The zzso alpha zzso of many zzso channels are associated with auxiliary zzso that influence channel zzso zzso and zzso Several different auxiliary zzso zzso for large zzso zzso zzso channels of the zzso family have been reported, but none of these beta zzso is expressed extensively in the nervous zzso We describe here the cloning and functional characterization of a novel zzso zzso auxiliary zzso in human and zzso which exhibits only limited sequence zzso with other beta zzso This zzso zzso zzso with human and mouse zzso zzso is expressed highly in human and monkey brain in a pattern that zzso zzso with zzso alpha zzso but in contrast to other zzso beta zzso it is expressed little (if at all) outside the nervous zzso Also in contrast to other beta zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity by shifting its zzso range to more zzso zzso and slowing its zzso zzso zzso may be important for the critical roles played by zzso channels in the regulation of zzso zzso and neurotransmitter zzso
