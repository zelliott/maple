Clinical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso 64 zzso and sensitive to zzso zzso 2 zzso were compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso of the same zzso No apparent differences between the sensitive and resistant strains of either pair were found with respect to binding of zzso to the bacteria, or to the zzso acid content or degree of zzso of zzso zzso The resistant strains did not zzso zzso in the surrounding zzso Analysis of the membrane proteins of the resistant zzso zzso strain grown in the presence or absence of zzso levels of zzso (4 zzso showed the presence of a 39 zzso protein which was either zzso or present in considerably reduced zzso in the sensitive zzso zzso of cell components after zzso of zzso showed that the 39 zzso protein was present predominantly in the membrane fraction but also in small amounts in the wall zzso Similar investigations with zzso zzso revealed the presence of a 35 zzso protein in zzso of the resistant zzso the amount was increased substantially by growth in zzso levels of zzso zzso prepared by mechanical disintegration of bacteria or by zzso zzso of zzso showed large apparent differences in the amounts of the 39 zzso zzso
