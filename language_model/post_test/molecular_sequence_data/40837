A detailed knowledge of the zzso assembly pathways of viruses from their coat protein building blocks is required to devise novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit such zzso In the quest for understanding how assembly of zzso zzso viruses is achieved at the molecular level, zzso has been used to locate regions of a coat protein zzso that exhibit zzso changes, and hence changes in their zzso zzso upon binding to a zzso zzso zzso known to trigger assembly zzso The zzso data highlight specific areas within the coat protein zzso that alter their exchange zzso in the presence of the zzso These include the known zzso sites, zzso E and G, which have a lower zzso to zzso when zzso as may have been zzso In contrast, several exposed regions are unaffected by zzso zzso zzso in this example, the loop between zzso F and G exhibits reduced zzso propensity when the zzso is bound, consistent with previous zzso from zzso and normal mode analysis that suggested a local zzso change at this loop induced by dynamic zzso These results demonstrate the potential utility of zzso to probe zzso and zzso changes within zzso bound zzso complexes which are of widespread importance in many zzso zzso
