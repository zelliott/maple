zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso in a segment of zzso acid sequence zzso This structure differs from that of other characterized zzso zzso but outside zzso the segment is zzso in known zzso insect and bacterial zzso Thus, limited structural variation is now defined within zzso for a part of the protein otherwise strictly zzso and for which stringent structural requirements probably relate to zzso zzso
