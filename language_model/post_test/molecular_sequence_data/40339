zzso zzso zzso are known to be involved in many critical biological zzso and identification of zzso is an important task in biological zzso A popular software, zzso is the most successful prediction tool and exhibits high zzso The application of zzso has been mainly focused on small suspected zzso We tried to apply zzso on a zzso zzso the results have high sensitivity, yet contain many false zzso Further enhancing zzso for zzso level or zzso wide study is zzso 

Based on the conjecture that adjacent zzso dependence affects the stability of the secondary structure of an zzso we first conduct a systematic study on human zzso and find that adjacent zzso dependence in human zzso should be useful for identifying zzso We then incorporate this dependence in the zzso model and develop a new zzso zzso model for identifying zzso 

With respect to our experiments on human zzso the proposed new model can eliminate more than 50% false zzso reported by zzso while maintaining the same zzso The zzso and the source code of programs are freely available at zzso
