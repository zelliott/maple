During the screening of zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to react with various zzso An zzso of approximately 35 zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso which reacted strongly with zzso was characterized by zzso zzso acid sequencing and identified as a zzso a class B zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso was amplified from the zzso DNA of several zzso zzso by zzso with a single pair of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is highly zzso among these zzso Cloning and sequence analysis of zzso from zzso zzso revealed that it contains an zzso open reading frame with a G + C content of zzso which encodes a zzso protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and a predicted zzso of zzso A sequence comparison of zzso proteins revealed that the zzso acid sequence is most variable in the central portion of the zzso zzso zzso which is believed to contain specific sequence information and which may thus be useful in the design of DNA or synthetic zzso zzso suitable for the detection of infection with zzso zzso
