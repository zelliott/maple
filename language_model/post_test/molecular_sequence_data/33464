zzso occurring coiled coils are often not homogeneous throughout their entire structure but rather interrupted by sequence zzso and zzso zzso We apply atomic force zzso to locally probe the mechanical zzso process of a zzso model coiled zzso when zzso zzso with different sizes are zzso We find that the zzso force decreases from zzso zzso with increasing size of the added zzso zzso while the unfolding properties of the model coiled zzso remain zzso We show that this behavior results from the increased size of the nucleation seed which has to form before further zzso folding can zzso Since the nucleation seed size is linked to the zzso of the energetic folding barrier, we are able to directly measure the dependence of folding forces on the barrier zzso Our results allow the design of coiled coils with designated zzso forces by simply adjusting the nucleation seed zzso
