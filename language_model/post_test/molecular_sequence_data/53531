zzso are unique bacteria with the ability to prey upon a wide variety of susceptible zzso zzso zzso exhibiting this trait have been included in the zzso zzso despite their isolation from diverse zzso and relatively zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso sequences were compared from known zzso zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in order to study their zzso zzso The two sequences from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso similar to each other but exhibited only zzso and zzso zzso respectively to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso clustered in a separate zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrating only a distant relationship between zzso zzso zzso and the other two recognized type zzso zzso zzso experiments also demonstrated zzso zzso between these three zzso On the basis of the results obtained from the zzso analysis and zzso zzso studies, it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso should be transferred to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is also proposed that the type species for the new zzso zzso should be zzso zzso zzso zzso
