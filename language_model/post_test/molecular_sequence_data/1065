zzso of zzso 8 in alternative zzso zzso generates an zzso zzso zzso zzso with a novel zzso domain zzso zzso by the zzso This study examines binding interactions with several receptors and investigates sequence variations in zzso zzso The zzso expressed as a zzso binds at zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and to the IGF-1 zzso but not to zzso nor to the zzso zzso whereas a rare zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso eliminates zzso zzso The full-length zzso binds with zzso higher affinity than its zzso but with approximately zzso lower affinity to the zzso zzso conservation in zzso monkey but not in rat suggests that zzso 8 recently zzso as a zzso module critical for the function of zzso
