zzso are recognized as functionally important in many pathological disorders, which has led to increased interest in mechanisms related to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Known mechanisms for regulating zzso activity are changes in gene expression or zzso zzso However, little is known about zzso with respect to a third regulatory zzso which is observed among other zzso zzso zzso the concept of differential zzso or processing of zzso zzso We now report on the discovery of a zzso human zzso zzso resulting from alternative zzso via zzso zzso The observed zzso processing zzso a drastically altered zzso protein sequence with a predicted zzso or zzso domain structure, differing from all known functional zzso However, our data indicate that that this zzso zzso which we termed zzso despite its severe structural changes still zzso to the cell surface and mediates functional activity of zzso
