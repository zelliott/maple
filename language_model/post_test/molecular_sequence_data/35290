zzso seed zzso is a protein capable of reducing zzso in zzso and increasing zzso zzso by model zzso This work investigated whether zzso is zzso into the target cells and zzso any zzso change during the process, as a first step to understanding its mechanism of zzso To this purpose, zzso and zzso zzso cells were submitted to zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso of zzso at various intervals revealed its zzso inside the zzso In zzso zzso of the cell zzso and zzso reaction of the zzso maps showed the presence of the protein intact zzso inside the treated cells, zzso no trace of the protein was found in the control zzso However, zzso spots with an unexpectedly low zzso were also observed in the zzso These spots were zzso zzso and submitted to zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso acids was zzso These findings, by showing that zzso is zzso by zzso cells in an intact form and is modified by multiple zzso open the way to the understanding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
