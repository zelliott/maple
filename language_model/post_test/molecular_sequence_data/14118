The presence of repeated sequences in the zzso represents a potential source of zzso zzso zzso control of zzso is thus important to preserve the integrity of the zzso To investigate the genetic control of zzso between repeated zzso we have created a series of zzso strains in which we could assess the role of genes involved in DNA repair in two types of zzso direct repeat zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso occurring (Ty zzso and artificially constructed repeats could be compared in the same cell zzso We have found that direct repeat zzso and gene conversion have different genetic zzso The role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are involved in zzso repair, was zzso Based on the zzso of single and double zzso these genes can be divided into three functional zzso one composed of zzso a second one composed of zzso and zzso and a third one that includes the zzso and zzso zzso Among seven genes involved in zzso repair tested, only zzso and zzso played a role in the types of zzso zzso We did not detect a differential effect of any zzso zzso on Ty elements as compared to artificially constructed zzso
