Six pockets, designated A through zzso which extend from the zzso binding site of class I zzso zzso have been zzso to play an important role in determining zzso binding zzso zzso zzso molecules with single zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in pocket zzso zzso in pocket zzso and zzso in pocket F have been generated and characterized for their capacity to present an influenza A zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso T zzso zzso We report here that zzso in zzso 45, 67, and 116 affect presentation of zzso zzso when zzso is processed and loaded during viral zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso in zzso 67 and 116 alter the stability of zzso zzso A substitution at position 9 of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso introduced at zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso binds with its zzso terminal zzso acid in pocket zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso within pockets B and F of zzso play a crucial role in zzso binding and stability of zzso class I zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso at zzso zzso within pockets B and F alter the stability of zzso complexes resulting in the diminution or zzso of zzso presentation during viral zzso
