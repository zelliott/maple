zzso has been previously shown to regulate the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso 1 zzso and is believed to control the activity of the zzso complex by zzso of the level of zzso zzso which zzso zzso the activity of zzso These mechanisms contribute to the ability of insulin to increase zzso zzso zzso Human zzso shows zzso zzso acid identity to its rat and mouse zzso with complete conservation of the zzso a binding zzso zzso is highly expressed in the liver and present at appreciable levels in heart tissue of all three zzso Surprisingly, zzso is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle while only being detected at very low levels in zzso zzso and rabbit skeletal zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso predicted from the zzso is identical in human liver and skeletal muscle and zzso by a gene on zzso 8 at zzso The zzso difference in the level of expression of zzso zzso and protein in skeletal muscle has important implications for understanding the mechanisms by which insulin regulates zzso synthesis in human skeletal muscle and for questions regarding whether zzso are appropriate models for this zzso
