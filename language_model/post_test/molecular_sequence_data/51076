A 51 zzso section of the zzso zzso zzso reaction center M zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso structural zzso zzso zzso acids zzso was replaced by the zzso region of the L zzso zzso This resulted in the zzso of much of the zzso acid environment of the reaction center initial electron zzso zzso This is the first in a series of large-scale symmetry zzso and is referred to as zzso The zzso zzso was able to grow zzso indicating that reaction center function was largely zzso zzso reaction centers showed an approximately zzso blue shift in the zzso band of zzso The standard free energy change between zzso and zzso determined from analysis of the zzso zzso from zzso reaction centers decreased from about zzso zzso in the zzso to about zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso quantum yield of electron transfer from zzso to zzso was observed, most of the yield loss occurring between zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso was about zzso slower in this zzso than in the zzso zzso spectral analysis of the zzso zzso formed in zzso reaction centers indicated that the major product was zzso A zzso analysis of the observed rates and zzso yields gave the following microscopic rate zzso for zzso reaction centers zzso values under the same conditions are given in zzso zzso see zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso near P made by other groups, and zzso variation of zzso acids in the vicinity of P suggests that the protein asymmetry in the environment of the initial electron donor is important for zzso the rate and yield of electron transfer, but is not strictly required for overall reaction center zzso
