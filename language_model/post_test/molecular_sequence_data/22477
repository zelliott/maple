The diversity of zzso zzso was investigated in two contrasting zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso amplification, cloning and sequencing of the genes coding for parts of the alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso One site is located in the zzso and shows marine zzso with high zzso and zzso zzso whereas the other site shows freshwater zzso with low zzso and zzso zzso Diversity and abundance of zzso genes differed between the two zzso In the zzso zzso most of the zzso sequences were affiliated to those of marine zzso bacteria belonging to the order of zzso whereas in the freshwater zzso a majority of zzso sequences was related to those of the zzso bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso It is speculated that this is related to the zzso and the zzso concentration in the two zzso
