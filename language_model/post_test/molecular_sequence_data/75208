Three regulatory proteins are involved in the zzso control of zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The 880 zzso acid zzso zzso like some DNA binding zzso possesses in its zzso sequence a zzso region that presents zzso to the zinc binding region of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso also has a region of 90 zzso acids that is zzso zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso a 87 zzso acid long sequence of zzso contains three stretches with significant zzso to some zzso bacterial and pancreatic zzso We propose a model in which the zzso sequence could regulate the expression of zzso anabolic zzso zzso
