zzso hormones have been implicated as important regulators of zzso zzso To gain a better understanding of the potential roles of the zzso system in zzso a zzso clone which zzso rainbow trout zzso was zzso This clone exhibited highest zzso acid identity to Japanese zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed against the rainbow trout sequence and the complete coding region of Atlantic salmon zzso was isolated by zzso The Atlantic salmon sequence exhibited highest zzso acid identity to rainbow trout zzso zzso Japanese zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Atlantic salmon zzso exhibited the classic modular structure associated with members of the nuclear zzso zzso and consisted of a divergent zzso domain while the DNA and zzso zzso were highly zzso to other zzso zzso zzso zzso expression from the rainbow trout zzso gene was monitored by zzso zzso at selected stages during rainbow trout embryonic and zzso zzso High levels of maternal transcripts were present at zzso zzso 6) which were rapidly zzso by zzso zzso zzso Low levels of zzso expression were then detected during zzso zzso 20, 24, 26, 29, and zzso A peak in zzso levels was observed at hatch zzso zzso after which levels rose in a gradual manner during zzso development zzso 33, 34, 35, and zzso to reach zzso values at first feeding zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso axis is functional and that embryonic and zzso rainbow trout are at least capable of responding to zzso zzso These observations zzso the zzso system as being an important regulator of zzso zzso
