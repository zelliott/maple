zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso of unknown function expressed at high levels in cells of zzso zzso To study the structure, function, and expression of zzso a full-length zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence spans zzso zzso and includes an zzso signal zzso of 17 zzso zzso the zzso active site, a rather zzso backbone with five potential zzso sites, and a short zzso zzso zzso zzso negative zzso cells zzso with an expression zzso containing the zzso coding sequences express zzso The rat bone, liver, and kidney zzso shows remarkable zzso zzso with the corresponding human zzso the most divergent region being the zzso zzso domain through which the zzso may be anchored to the plasma zzso The rat zzso also shows 50% zzso with the human zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso coli zzso The zzso acids involved in zzso show nearly complete zzso among all known zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso evolved from a common ancestral zzso The rat zzso zzso zzso 54, used as a zzso probe in zzso zzso analysis of several zzso that express zzso revealed the presence of an zzso zzso of approximately equal to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso patterns derived from Southern zzso analysis of rat zzso DNA offered molecular evidence that the zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and various rat zzso excluding the zzso is the product of the same single copy zzso
