zzso sequences zzso in three complete bacterial zzso those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the first available zzso zzso zzso that of zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso zzso and methods for zzso acid motif zzso Between zzso and zzso of the predicted proteins zzso in each of the bacterial zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso proteins showed significant sequence similarity to proteins from other zzso The fraction of bacterial and zzso proteins containing regions zzso over long zzso distances is nearly the same and close to zzso zzso of zzso of the bacterial proteins and about zzso of the zzso proteins were predicted with varying zzso This contrasts with the previous report that more than half of the zzso proteins have no zzso and shows that, with more sensitive methods and detailed analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso become as amenable to meaningful interpretation by computer as bacterial zzso The analysis of zzso motifs resulted in the prediction of a number of previously zzso functions of bacterial and zzso proteins and in the identification of novel protein zzso In spite of the generally high conservation of protein zzso zzso of zzso or less of the zzso zzso genes were detected in each individual completely zzso zzso supporting the uniqueness of zzso as a distinct domain of zzso About zzso of the zzso zzso proteins belong to families of zzso a fraction similar to that in bacteria with larger zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso coli, but higher than that in zzso zzso which has approximately the same number of genes as zzso zzso Certain groups of zzso zzso molecular zzso and DNA repair zzso thought to be ubiquitous and represented in the minimal gene set derived by bacterial zzso comparison, are missing in zzso zzso indicating massive zzso displacement of genes responsible for essential zzso An unexpectedly large fraction of the zzso zzso gene products, zzso shows significantly higher similarity to bacterial than to zzso zzso compared with zzso that have zzso proteins as their closest zzso (the rest of the proteins show approximately the same level of similarity to bacterial and zzso zzso or have no zzso zzso involved in translation, transcription, replication and protein zzso are most closely related to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso systems, zzso for cell wall zzso and many zzso proteins appear to be zzso A similar prevalence of proteins of apparent bacterial origin was observed among the currently available sequences from the zzso related zzso zzso zzso It is likely that the evolution of zzso included at least one major merger between ancestral cells from the bacterial lineage and the lineage leading to the zzso zzso
