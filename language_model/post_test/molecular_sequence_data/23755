zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso zzso regulators in zzso The malaria zzso has two zzso proteins zzso and zzso that share zzso zzso in the zzso binding zzso Here we confirmed the preferential expression of zzso in zzso stages using Northern zzso The zzso initiation site of this zzso mapped using zzso zzso rapid amplification of zzso end and primer extension, is located approximately 300 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso The 3' end of zzso is located approximately 250 zzso downstream from the stop zzso The total length of the zzso is approximately zzso zzso consistent with the zzso size determined by Northern zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed in bacteria were zzso and used to produce zzso zzso Western zzso further established the preferential synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso Using the zzso elements zzso in the Hunchback zzso of zzso zzso as an artificial target zzso we tested the binding of zzso zzso domain to this sequence using the zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso domain bound specifically to zzso suggesting that zzso may be involved in zzso regulation of target genes using a zzso mechanism of the zzso family zzso
