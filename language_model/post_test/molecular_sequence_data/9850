When exposed to zzso conditions, zzso and other zzso breeders undergo zzso zzso With chronic exposure to short days, however, the animals become zzso and zzso zzso zzso The underlying mechanism for this zzso is still zzso There is growing evidence, however, that specific cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate these zzso changes as a direct or indirect zzso for the zzso zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso formation for several zzso hormones zzso zzso zzso common zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of female zzso zzso in long zzso zzso and after 18, 28, and 38 weeks of short zzso zzso As indicated by zzso and body weight, the zzso displayed zzso zzso after 18 and 28 weeks of zzso after 38 weeks of SP, all animals showed zzso At 18 and 28 weeks of SP, only zzso zzso and protein levels were significantly reduced in the zzso and returned to LP values after 38 weeks of zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus that was determined by zzso and by in zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso and zzso with increasing levels at zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in SP with highest levels in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and protein were not zzso in all SP groups compared with the moderate signal intensity in zzso The common zzso zzso and zzso however, which were also reduced in the animals of the zzso group, were already elevated after 28 weeks of SP and nearly reached zzso after 38 weeks of zzso These results show that, in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso is a sensitive indicator for zzso dependent changes of the zzso system and seems to be zzso zzso zzso The increase of common zzso expression in zzso cells depending upon duration of SP that precedes the hormonal changes in the zzso leads us to speculate that zzso cells initiate spontaneous zzso via a zzso zzso
