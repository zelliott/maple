Recently, we reported the isolation, zzso and expression of a rat zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso that degrades zzso fatty acid zzso like zzso and zzso to their corresponding zzso thereby serving to terminate the signaling functions of these zzso Here, we report the molecular characterization of both a mouse and a human zzso and compare these zzso to the rat zzso The zzso are well zzso in primary structure, with the mouse and rat zzso sharing zzso zzso acid identity and the human zzso sharing zzso and zzso identity with the rat zzso and mouse zzso zzso In addition, the expressed human and rat zzso behave zzso as membrane proteins of comparable molecular size and show similar, but zzso zzso zzso The identification of highly zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso and human supports a general role for the fatty acid zzso in zzso zzso
