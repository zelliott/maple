zzso Factor 1 alpha zzso zzso an important zzso translation factor, zzso charged zzso from the zzso to the zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso shows that, in all cells zzso zzso alpha is the major zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha has an apparent Mr zzso zzso and a basic zzso zzso It is zzso and does not contain zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha generated two major zzso zzso Three peptides were zzso and were identical to two distinct regions of the human zzso alpha zzso zzso sequencing cycles coinciding with zzso acid in the human zzso sequence were also found to release zzso and compositional analysis of these peptides confirmed the presence of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso group of the zzso is zzso These results indicate that zzso alpha is zzso modified by the zzso attachment of zzso via an zzso bond to at least two specific zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso The zzso group of the attached zzso was shown by mass zzso and compositional analysis, to be further modified by the addition of a zzso zzso This novel zzso modification may represent an important zzso of zzso zzso comparable to the regulatory effects of zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso
