The effect of various zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the reaction of triplex formation by zzso and AG motif zzso zzso designed to bind to biologically relevant zzso sequences occurring in the promoters of the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso has been investigated by means of zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and zzso I zzso zzso We found that in the presence of 10 zzso zzso the triple zzso were progressively zzso by adding increasing amounts of zzso from 20 to 140 zzso to the zzso We also observed that, while the total zzso concentration was constant at 100 zzso the exchange of sodium with zzso but not lithium, results in a further zzso of the triple zzso due to zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to destabilize triplex DNA even when the triple zzso are zzso in the absence of zzso However, zzso experiments also showed that the zzso effect of zzso on triplex DNA is partially compensated for by zzso amounts of zzso transition metal zzso such as zzso and zzso which upon zzso to zzso of zzso are expected to enhance zzso formation between the target and the third zzso and to reduce the assembly in quadruple structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhancement in the presence of zzso was also observed, but to a lesser extent, when zzso was added to the reaction zzso Here, the zzso effect on triplex DNA is rationalized in terms of competition among the different zzso zzso to bind to triplex DNA, and differential zzso stabilization of unusual zzso structures formed by the zzso zzso
