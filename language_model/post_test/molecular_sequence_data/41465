zzso is a highly diverse and complex zzso modification for the regulation of protein function and zzso Studies of zzso have, however, been hampered by its rapid reversal in cell zzso for example through the action of zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso protein zzso zzso composed of an array of five zzso zzso from the zzso zzso protein zzso fused to zzso zzso binds zzso zzso with unprecedented zzso and can be used as both an affinity zzso to study protein zzso and to effectively protect zzso proteins from the action of zzso and the zzso in crude cell zzso We use the zzso to show that the zzso protein becomes zzso in response to DNA damage, and to isolate zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso
