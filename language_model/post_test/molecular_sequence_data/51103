The zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso binds to the extreme zzso of zzso zzso generating a very zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein recognizes both the sequence and the structure of the zzso zzso To explore how the zzso protein recognizes and binds zzso DNA, we have examined the zzso specificity of the zzso protein using zzso that mimic natural and zzso versions of zzso zzso The protein binds very specifically to the 3' zzso of zzso zzso with the sequence zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso even slight modifications to this sequence reduce binding zzso The protein does not bind zzso corresponding to the complementary zzso strand of the zzso or to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein with zzso generates an zzso zzso zzso of approximately 35 zzso This zzso zzso appears to comprise the zzso domain of the zzso protein as it retains most of the zzso characteristics of the native zzso zzso For example, the zzso zzso remains bound to zzso DNA in 2 M zzso Additionally, the zzso binds well to zzso zzso that have the same sequence as the zzso strand of native zzso but binds very poorly to zzso zzso DNA sequences and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 15 zzso from the zzso protein does diminish the ability of the protein to bind only to the zzso of a zzso DNA zzso
