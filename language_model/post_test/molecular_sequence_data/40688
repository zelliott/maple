The purpose of this study was to determine the diversity and prevalence of zzso species in a survey of cereal and zzso systems from the South Island of New Zealand by applying zzso and molecular zzso zzso were collected from soil, roots, and stems from 21 cereal and zzso zzso Ten zzso species were identified using zzso characters, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In general, their distribution was found to be unrelated to zzso location, although agricultural practice increased the overall diversity of zzso zzso analyses were successfully used to identify zzso similar zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso species complex and to resolve previously zzso relationships amongst these zzso zzso zzso classified as either zzso zzso zzso or other closely related species as well as several zzso zzso from international culture collections were examined using DNA sequence data for zzso zzso translation zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA sequence data from both zzso and zzso zzso among zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and determined that these three distinct sequence groups formed a single zzso By contrast, zzso was unable to differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso and other closely related species believed to be zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences with the international zzso database supported the identification of zzso in this zzso As in other studies, zzso zzso was found to be widespread in agricultural and native zzso However, zzso zzso in New Zealand was found only on zzso zzso The reason for the absence of this wheat pathogen in zzso zzso in New Zealand remains zzso
