The zzso family of proteins play significant roles in zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso in melanoma 2) and zzso zzso protein zzso recognize zzso DNA to initiate inflammatory zzso In contrast, zzso a mouse zzso protein containing two zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been reported to inhibit zzso inflammatory zzso in zzso To understand the zzso zzso the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain in complex with a zzso DNA was determined, in which zzso zzso zzso recognizes both strands of DNA through zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain binds DNA more tightly than does zzso zzso and the zzso mode of zzso zzso is different from that of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results, together with the reported data on zzso zzso lead to an interaction model for full-length zzso and zzso which provides a conceivable mechanism for the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso
