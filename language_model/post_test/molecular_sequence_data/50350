A synthetic gene based on the published zzso acid sequence for zzso zzso zzso was constructed, cloned in zzso coli zzso and expressed using the zzso zzso zzso system in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and metal analyses indicated that the zzso synthetic gene product is a mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the latter amounting to approximately zzso of the total zzso The zzso zzso and resonance zzso zzso of the cloned zzso are characteristic of the native zzso iron zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing suggests that the gene product consists of at least three zzso species with the initial sequences zzso relative zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso and zzso zzso The blocked portion presumably consists of a mixture of zzso and zzso where zzso represents an zzso zzso zzso
