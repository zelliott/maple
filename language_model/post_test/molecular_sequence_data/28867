When zzso bacteria from a cow fed hay were serially diluted into an zzso medium that had only peptides and zzso acids as energy sources, little growth or zzso production was detected at zzso greater than zzso The zzso and zzso zzso contained bacteria that fermented zzso and some of these bacteria inhibited zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the most active isolate zzso was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso 49 and a variety of other zzso organisms, but it had little effect on most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not produce a zzso zzso substance zzso until it reached the late log or stationary zzso The zzso zzso did not cause the zzso of zzso zzso 49, but the zzso zzso level, the zzso level, the electrical potential, and the viability decreased zzso The zzso zzso also caused marked decreases in the viability and cellular zzso level of zzso zzso zzso The membrane potential and zzso zzso level also zzso The zzso was zzso very slowly by zzso zzso but it could be zzso with zzso ammonium zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso could be separated from other peptides by zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the molecular size of this compound was approximately 3,600 zzso Based on these results, it appeared that the zzso zzso was a zzso zzso Because zzso zzso bacteria could inhibit the growth of zzso zzso zzso bacteria, zzso may play a role in regulating zzso production in zzso
