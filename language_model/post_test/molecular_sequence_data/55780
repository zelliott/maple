zzso zzso that cleave zzso and zzso zzso are implicated in zzso and pathological functions ranging from wound healing to tumor zzso and are useful in zzso zzso We report the cloning of the zzso I zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso using zzso Two zzso zzso based on the zzso acid sequences derived from zzso peptides of zzso zzso were used to generate a zzso probe by zzso amplification using zzso zzso DNA as the zzso This probe was used to screen a zzso zzso DNA library in zzso The open reading frame of zzso I is zzso zzso in zzso zzso a precursor protein of zzso zzso Eleven of the zzso peptides zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso mapped onto the open reading zzso The zzso acid sequence reveals a consensus zzso binding domain and a zzso leader zzso with a characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a soluble zzso using the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso was identical to that of native zzso
