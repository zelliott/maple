The 65 zzso protein zzso is a zzso part of the zzso tight zzso which is the main barrier of the zzso zzso The function of zzso as part of tight junctions is still poorly understood and even less is known about the regulatory mechanisms that influence zzso gene zzso This study aimed to identify the sequences essential in zzso for zzso regulation of tight junction formation and to investigate their zzso role in zzso tight junction zzso Using zzso walking cloning of zzso human zzso DNA zzso a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso start point of zzso zzso sequences was amplified and zzso zzso of this zzso in front of the zzso reporter gene revealed strong expression of zzso activity after zzso of the human zzso cell line zzso With subsequent deletions of parts of the promoter fragment, its size was reduced to 280 zzso that are necessary and sufficient to mediate promoter zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha and another zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso resistance in zzso cells, which was preceded by a decrease in zzso zzso expression as revealed by northern zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha and zzso gamma diminished zzso promoter activity alone and even zzso suggesting a zzso regulation of zzso of the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso gamma can zzso the expression of the zzso tight junction strand protein zzso zzso the barrier zzso detected zzso This could be an important mechanism in gastrointestinal diseases accompanied by barrier zzso for example inflammatory zzso zzso
