DNA zzso delta zzso zzso which plays keys roles in DNA zzso repair and zzso in zzso cells, comprises at least two essential zzso - a large zzso zzso zzso possessing both DNA zzso and zzso zzso activities, and a smaller zzso zzso whose function is not yet zzso Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso This protein zzso zzso is zzso identical to the human zzso protein and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein sequences across ten zzso species identifies 36 zzso zzso zzso These 36 zzso are located within ten zzso regions zzso zzso likely to have key functional zzso zzso with this, the zzso in six previously identified zzso zzso zzso proteins map within zzso regions III, zzso zzso and zzso Several of the zzso zzso acids are also zzso across the zzso DNA zzso II zzso protein zzso
