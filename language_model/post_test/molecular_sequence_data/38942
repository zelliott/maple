zzso also known as zzso is involved in a variety of zzso such as gene zzso in position effect zzso zzso the control of gypsy zzso zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso and programmed cell zzso We have isolated a large number of zzso zzso representing 21 different zzso generated by alternative zzso The deduced proteins are characterized by a common N zzso of 402 zzso zzso including the zzso Most of the variable C zzso contain a new consensus zzso including four positioned zzso zzso acids and a zzso zzso Using specific zzso for two protein zzso we demonstrate different zzso of the corresponding proteins on zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso zzso show enhancement of zzso and zzso transformation and affect viability and zzso zzso and zzso zzso are enhanced by zzso in other zzso zzso A zzso containing the common zzso region of zzso that is present in all zzso zzso known so far partially zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that the molecular and genetic complexity of zzso is caused by a large set of individual protein zzso with specific functions in regulating the zzso structure of different sets of genes throughout zzso
