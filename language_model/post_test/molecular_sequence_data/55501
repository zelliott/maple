zzso zzso belong to a zzso protein family of water channels that are permeable to water by the zzso zzso There are two zzso of mouse zzso - zzso and zzso Their balance in the cell determines water zzso of the plasma zzso These two zzso are zzso by three zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Here we found a new fourth zzso of mouse zzso - zzso zzso The start of zzso is different for zzso zzso from all the known zzso zzso The zzso region zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by four new zzso zzso B, C, and zzso which are located in the zzso region from zzso of the zzso zzso Alternative zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso leads to formation of multiple zzso of zzso zzso We cloned six of these zzso all of which code full length zzso zzso of zzso Using zzso we detected zzso expression of the new zzso and already known zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is expressed mostly in zzso liver, and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso structure showed low translation efficacy for zzso zzso in comparison with high translation efficacy for zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso expression is controlled zzso by independent zzso Thus multiple zzso zzso may allow long-term regulation of the balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the cell and thus water zzso of the plasma zzso
