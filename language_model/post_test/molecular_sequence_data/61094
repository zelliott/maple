zzso one of the accessory molecules of zzso has been demonstrated to arrest the cell cycle at the zzso zzso This zzso cell cycle arrest is implicated to have an important role in the viral life zzso In the present study, we zzso the extent of zzso cell cycle arrest with the use of a zzso zzso consisting of a zzso gene and a green zzso protein zzso Using this system, we examined the effect of several zzso on cell cycle progression and growth of cells from different species zzso We found that zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso could not significantly induce zzso arrest in zzso cells but was able to induce it in zzso zzso However, strong zzso of cell proliferation in zzso cells as well as in zzso cells was observed by zzso This ability of zzso to inhibit cell proliferation without zzso arrest was also observed when expressed in monkey cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that this zzso growth zzso activity of zzso was not zzso solely by the zzso region of zzso These results indicated that the growth zzso activity of zzso is independent of its zzso arresting zzso In addition, the zzso nature of this activity suggests that zzso has a novel mechanism to zzso cell proliferation by influencing basic cellular zzso
