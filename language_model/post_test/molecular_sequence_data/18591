Here, we review current knowledge about zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins to illustrate progress in this zzso A zzso analysis of the literature about the topic was carried out, together with a zzso comparative zzso to give a more comprehensive zzso zzso methods for zzso or zzso identification are commonly based on zzso protein sequence zzso we added comparison of structures to detect the whole universe of proteins containing the zzso zzso We present an update of proteins having this domain, focusing on the specific proteins present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and explore the existence of these in other zzso We also analyze the zzso distribution of the zzso domain in different species and zzso Finally, we performed a structural comparison of the zzso domain through data mining of structural databases, determining a zzso structural zzso despite the differences in the zzso even among zzso zzso and zzso All data discussed in this review, both zzso and zzso corroborate the functional importance of the zzso domain in zzso zzso
