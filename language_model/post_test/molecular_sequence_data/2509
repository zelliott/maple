The bacterial zzso zzso encodes two distinct but overlapping zzso zzso zzso + zzso promote zzso to a specific site, zzso while zzso + zzso promote zzso to many other sites unrelated to zzso We have identified a zzso DNA binding activity that specifically recognizes zzso We have localized the recognition sequences for this activity to a zzso region and have shown that this same region can provide specific properties of an zzso target in zzso Interestingly, these sequences are positioned more than 25 base pairs from the specific point of zzso zzso
