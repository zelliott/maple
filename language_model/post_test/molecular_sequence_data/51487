zzso is essential for protein zzso across the zzso zzso membrane of zzso zzso We have found a zzso zzso that shows more than 50% sequence identity with the zzso zzso Moreover, several regions of zzso have significant similarities with corresponding ones of zzso of bacteria, indicating a strong evolutionary conservation of the mechanism of protein zzso zzso zzso like the zzso zzso is located in the immediate vicinity of nascent zzso during their membrane zzso It is tightly associated with zzso zzso suggesting that the nascent chain passes directly from the zzso into a zzso zzso These results define zzso as a ubiquitous key component of the protein zzso zzso
