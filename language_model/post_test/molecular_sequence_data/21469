zzso peptides are highly valued tools in biomedical zzso In many cases, they show higher zzso zzso enhanced biological activity, and improved serum zzso Technical difficulties in producing zzso zzso especially larger ones, in appreciable yields have precluded a prolific use in biomedical zzso Here, we describe a novel and efficient zzso method that uses the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A to zzso linear synthetic precursor zzso As a model, we used zzso 1, a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso 1 resulted in zzso zzso yields, whereas zzso zzso provided a yield of zzso The zzso zzso displayed a maximum wound closure activity at 10 zzso whereas the linear zzso displayed zzso activity at 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the linear and zzso zzso in solution showed no evidence for zzso changes, suggesting that structural differences due to zzso only became manifest when these peptides were located in the binding domain of the zzso The zzso zzso technology provides a general method for easy and efficient manufacturing of large zzso zzso
