zzso strains of zzso zzso contain low affinity zzso proteins and often also produce abnormal indirectly zzso cell zzso However the relationship between cell wall zzso and zzso resistance has remained zzso We now show that the zzso of zzso zzso contains an zzso composed of two genes zzso and zzso that zzso zzso involved with the zzso of zzso structured cell wall zzso The sequences of zzso were compared in two zzso the zzso strain zzso producing the zzso zzso cell wall zzso in which zzso stem peptides are rare, and the highly zzso zzso strain zzso the cell wall of which is enriched for zzso stem zzso The two strains carried different zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strain zzso had a zzso structure zzso a protein that was only zzso identical to the product of zzso identified in the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in which the zzso zzso was interrupted by zzso zzso produced zzso from which all zzso zzso components were zzso The zzso zzso of zzso carried a zzso gene with the same zzso sequence found in zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso in strain zzso and other resistant strains caused a virtually complete loss of zzso zzso Our observations indicate that the capacity to produce zzso cell wall precursors plays a critical role in the expression of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
