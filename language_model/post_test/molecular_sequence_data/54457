zzso is an zzso zzso zzso class I gene carried by zzso of zzso zzso zzso Comparing zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso defines a unique zzso zzso block flanked by blocks containing classical zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso are zzso orangutan zzso and the zzso part of human zzso zzso carried by zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso gene alternatively evolved in these closely related species to become classical, zzso and zzso Although differing by 30 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind overlapping zzso of zzso the overlap being comparable with that between the zzso and zzso zzso differing by one zzso zzso thus has the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have similar three-dimensional structures, binding peptides in similar zzso Although comparable in size and shape, the B and F specificity pockets of zzso and zzso differ in both their constituent zzso and contacts with zzso zzso zzso shared by zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso are the absence of zzso at position 9 in the B pocket and the presence of zzso at position 116 in the F zzso zzso zzso from zzso is an unusually zzso upper face on the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso chimpanzees with B cells expressing zzso produced potent zzso zzso T cells with specificity for zzso and no zzso toward other zzso class I zzso including zzso In contrast, zzso from zzso chimpanzees are tolerant of zzso
