zzso A chain is a zzso of 267 zzso acids containing a zzso region near its zzso zzso zzso which has been implicated in the membrane zzso step necessary for this zzso active toxin to reach its zzso zzso DNA zzso were constructed that zzso hybrid proteins consisting of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso A chain preceding mouse zzso zzso When in zzso transcripts prepared from these zzso were translated in zzso systems, the zzso A zzso sequences functioned as efficient signal peptides which directed zzso zzso into zzso or into zzso containing zzso membrane zzso
