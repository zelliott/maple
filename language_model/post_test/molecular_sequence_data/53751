zzso capacities of synthetic peptides to zzso molecules were tested on filter papers to identify putative helper zzso zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso tested was the zzso surface zzso 1 zzso of zzso zzso a vaccine candidate targeting the asexual zzso zzso zzso between synthetic zzso and zzso molecules were zzso Such zzso were not zzso and a known helper zzso zzso zzso showed positive binding to the restricting zzso zzso By using this screening system, we observed the unequal distribution of zzso peptides in 10 out of 17 zzso blocks zzso Block zzso of zzso seemed to show the highest frequency in the positive zzso on the other hand, blocks zzso and zzso both of which were thought to be vaccine candidate regions, contained fewer zzso binding zzso This was not inconsistent with the results that block zzso was less zzso to peripheral T cells than block zzso The peptides with positive binding to zzso showed actual zzso activities when we tested zzso proliferation of human bulk zzso lines, and association between the two parameters was statistically significant zzso For more detailed information for vaccine development, peptides with both zzso and zzso binding activities were mapped in block zzso of zzso Together with these results, we demonstrate that our simple screening system seems to provide essential information for vaccine development through uncovering locations of putative zzso for human helper T zzso
