Hantavirus zzso protein zzso has been proven to induce highly protective immune responses in animal zzso The knowledge on the mechanisms behind zzso protection is still zzso although recent data suggest that both cellular and zzso immune responses are of zzso For a detailed zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso N derivatives of the Russian strain zzso and the Swedish strain zzso as well as overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the Finnish zzso strain zzso The majority of a panel of zzso zzso zzso reacted with proteins derived from all included zzso strains demonstrating the zzso similarity of these zzso In line with previous results, the zzso of most zzso were mapped within the 80 zzso zzso acids of zzso The present study further revealed that the zzso of four zzso raised against native viral N were located within zzso acids zzso whereas one zzso raised against zzso N was mapped to zzso acids zzso zzso between the zzso of the zzso strains zzso and zzso N suggested the importance of zzso acid position 35 for the integrity of the zzso In line with the patterns obtained by the truncated zzso zzso mapping by overlapping peptides zzso confirmed a complex recognition pattern for most analyzed zzso Together, the results revealed the existence of zzso partially zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, based on differences within the same competition group, novel zzso were zzso
