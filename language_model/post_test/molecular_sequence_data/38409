zzso zzso zzso type 4 zzso is a zzso zzso that is found as four distinct genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis was done to identify the zzso acids involved in activity and inhibitor zzso zzso at zzso were made in zzso based on zzso that affect zzso sensitivity in zzso The zzso zzso zzso was resistant to zzso by zzso as well as several other zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that this zzso is near the inhibitor binding pocket in zzso zzso comparison of zzso with zzso zzso proteins shows a zzso zzso acid at position zzso in zzso and a zzso zzso at this position in zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with kinetic zzso similar to those observed for this protein with zzso zzso approximately 20 zzso zzso approximately 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso Under identical conditions, the zzso value for zzso zzso by zzso zzso is 3 zzso and the zzso value is 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso protein could zzso zzso Finally, the analogous zzso in zzso zzso also allows zzso of zzso These results show that this zzso acid zzso is important in inhibitor binding and zzso discrimination and suggest this zzso is in the active site of zzso
