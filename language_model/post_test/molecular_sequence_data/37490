zzso becomes zzso zzso zzso and accumulates in the zzso of zzso cells exposed to zzso the zzso zzso that directs zzso cell zzso By performing zzso zzso of living cells, we show that zzso zzso the nuclear export of zzso Within zzso there is a 50 zzso acid region containing several consensus zzso zzso zzso nuclear export signals zzso zzso of this region causes zzso to accumulate in the nucleus zzso and, when coupled to zzso the same region directs nuclear zzso We show that the zzso 46 zzso acids are necessary for nuclear zzso of zzso and sufficient to direct zzso nuclear zzso when fused to zzso Combining the zzso and molecular zzso we suggest that zzso zzso of zzso functionally masks the zzso region and that this leads to zzso nuclear zzso directed by the zzso import zzso These results show that the regulated nuclear zzso of a zzso protein can be controlled at the level of nuclear export and they also provide a better understanding of the mechanism zzso zzso directs cell type zzso
