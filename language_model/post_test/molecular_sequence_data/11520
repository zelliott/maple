We have characterized two zzso zzso in the zzso type 1 zzso gene by direct sequencing of zzso zzso The zzso for these zzso were initially detected on zzso zzso One of the zzso involves a G to A transition in zzso 41 at the 28th base upstream of zzso 42 with an observed zzso zzso of zzso The other zzso is a T to C transition in zzso 16 at the 16th base upstream of zzso 17 with an observed zzso zzso of zzso In combination with other documented zzso in the zzso zzso these zzso should assist in genetic analysis of zzso zzso
