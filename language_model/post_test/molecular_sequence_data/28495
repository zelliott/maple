zzso protein R zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso is a small accessory protein that regulates nuclear import of the viral zzso complex and zzso infection of zzso cells, such as zzso Studies demonstrated that a fraction of zzso molecules is zzso in the zzso and in zzso cells, but the role of zzso in nuclear import activity of zzso has not been zzso We found that zzso is zzso predominantly on the zzso zzso in position 79, and zzso affecting zzso zzso significantly attenuated viral replication in zzso but not in activated T zzso or cell zzso The replication zzso was mapped by zzso chain reaction analysis to the step of nuclear zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso regulates its activity in the nuclear import of the zzso zzso zzso
