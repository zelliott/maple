Three zzso acid derivatives with different types and/or percentages of zzso were analyzed by means of zzso contact angle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso characterization of the three different samples, in both dry and wet state, was provided in terms of surface and bulk zzso zzso and infrared analyses showed that the surface composition of all samples differs from that of the zzso The zzso character of the samples changed according to the chemical composition as shown by zzso and contact angle zzso Both infrared and contact angle zzso reveal that surface restructuring occurred upon zzso for all the samples and the greater the zzso character of the sample, the greater and faster the restructuring zzso A clear picture of the different types of chemical groups has been established at different depth for the three zzso
