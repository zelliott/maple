zzso zzso protein replication protein A zzso has a strand melting property that assists zzso and zzso in resolving DNA secondary zzso zzso previous results suggested that human zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso produced zzso during DNA zzso however, the mechanism was not zzso We designed a series of zzso representing displaced DNA zzso generated during maturation of Okazaki fragments, to investigate the strand zzso properties of zzso Until zzso by zzso zzso zzso 1), such zzso can initiate zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of strands lacking secondary structure but promoted zzso of structured zzso Apparently, both processes primarily derive from the strand melting properties of zzso These properties slowed the spontaneous zzso of zzso single zzso which occurred efficiently without zzso However, structured strands without zzso displayed very slow spontaneous zzso because of stable zzso hydrogen zzso zzso appeared to zzso melt the single strands so that they could bind to form double zzso In this way, melting ironically promoted zzso Time course zzso in the presence of zzso suggest that structured single strands achieve an equilibrium with double zzso a consequence of zzso driving both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso reached a maximum at a specific zzso zzso presumably when all structured zzso DNA was zzso zzso suggest that displaced zzso with secondary structure formed during Okazaki zzso maturation can be melted by zzso and subsequently zzso to a complementary zzso DNA site, forming zzso zzso that can lead to zzso zzso
