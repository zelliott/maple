To facilitate zzso zzso studies, we tested whether zzso zzso which supports zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso also supports zzso zzso zzso zzso strains expressing zzso zzso replication proteins zzso and zzso were engineered to zzso zzso two independently zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso lacked the coat protein gene and zzso zzso zzso zzso lacked the zzso zzso promoter and had the coat gene replaced by the zzso zzso zzso After 12 to 72 h of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso All zzso cells contained zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso Most zzso arose by zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Such zzso were isolated only when zzso and zzso were expressed and after transient zzso of both zzso and zzso showing that zzso occurred at the zzso not DNA, zzso A minority of zzso zzso were derived from zzso independently of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso generating novel zzso promoters and demonstrating that zzso can give rise to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred only when both parental zzso bore a functional, zzso template recognition and recruitment element targeting viral zzso to replication zzso The results imply that zzso occurred in zzso replication complexes to which parental zzso were independently zzso Moreover, the ability to obtain zzso zzso at precisely zzso zzso zzso to control genetic background and induction conditions, and other features of this system will facilitate further studies of virus and host functions in zzso zzso
