The crucial role of zzso zzso virus type 1 immediate early protein zzso zzso in the regulation of all classes of viral genes has been established by extensive analysis of zzso zzso and deletion zzso It has long been known that zzso binds to selected DNA zzso and recent studies have shown that it interacts with components of the zzso zzso zzso However, the role of DNA binding in its mechanism of action has been zzso Despite the presence of zzso recognition sites at numerous locations throughout the viral zzso it has proved difficult to establish that these sites are important for the zzso of early and late zzso In this study we have zzso the ability of a large number of zzso and single point zzso derivatives of zzso to bind to DNA and to support virus zzso zzso zzso which were unable to bind to DNA were also zzso in terms of their ability to activate gene expression in zzso zzso and to complement the growth of a zzso deletion zzso zzso These results strongly support the hypothesis that interaction with DNA is an essential feature of the mechanism of action of zzso
