The zzso zzso zzso is regarded as the zzso agent of zzso plague and represents an evident hazard for European zzso zzso Native zzso populations infected with this pathogen suffer up to zzso zzso The existence of multiple transmission paths zzso the development of a reliable, robust and efficient test to detect the zzso Currently, zzso zzso is diagnosed by a zzso zzso that suffers from zzso to other zzso We developed an alternative zzso zzso for zzso zzso which achieves zzso through simultaneous amplification of multiple functionally constrained zzso 

Two novel zzso expressed members of the zzso zzso zzso gene family of zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso strain zzso The primary zzso acid sequence of these zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso is composed of an zzso signal zzso directing the zzso transport of the protein into the zzso space, the zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso and zzso domain and a zzso zzso putative zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso grown in a zzso medium showed significant zzso changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso amounts indicating functional zzso Their different zzso occurrence with zzso at 48 and 24 hours of incubation for zzso and zzso respectively, is in accordance with the zzso of zzso family zzso To identify zzso zzso primer target sites in these novel zzso we determined the partial sequence zzso in the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in the relevant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso primer pair targeting the novel genes zzso and zzso as well as zzso - a third zzso family member - was zzso with zzso targeting the zzso zzso used as an zzso zzso A species was typed zzso as zzso zzso if two zzso were zzso detected by melting curve analysis zzso For sensitive detection of the zzso but also for zzso of agent levels in susceptible zzso and carrier zzso a zzso based real-time zzso zzso zzso was zzso It targets the same zzso genes and allows zzso down to 25 target zzso 

The simultaneous qualitative detection of multiple sequences by zzso represents a promising approach to detect species with elevated levels of genetic variation and/or limited available sequence zzso The zzso zzso format, reduced detection time, higher zzso and the considerably reduced chance of false negative detection achieved by targeting multiple genes zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at least two of which are subject to high functional zzso are the major advantages of this multiplex zzso compared to other diagnostic zzso Sensitive zzso achieved with zzso zzso zzso to monitor infection status and pathogen distribution in different zzso and can help prevent disease zzso
