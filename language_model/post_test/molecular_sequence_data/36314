Using zzso DNA binding protein zzso expressed as a fusion to zzso in zzso coli, we established a zzso DNA zzso procedure for enriching zzso binding sequences and monitoring the enrichment zzso zzso synthetic zzso for an authentic zzso binding zzso inserted into a zzso zzso were incubated with the crude zzso zzso zzso complexes formed in zzso were zzso zzso utilizing the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The effectiveness of repeating cycles of zzso was demonstrated by the color selection method designed for zzso zzso after introducing the zzso plasmids into zzso zzso After three cycles of DNA zzso only a few kinds of sequences constituted the zzso By repeating two more cycles, the most zzso sequence was finally enriched until zzso indicating the enrichment of the binding sequences in a zzso zzso Further application to human zzso DNA showed that two zzso DNA fragments, zzso and zzso zzso in size, were exclusively zzso This procedure can be applied to the systematic analysis of binding sequences for any other DNA binding proteins without production of any specific zzso or further zzso
