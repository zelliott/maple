We describe a new nuclear zzso zzso zzso B zzso specifically involved in the generation of mature zzso of zzso b in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso results in a respiratory zzso (no growth on zzso and ethanol, a reduced growth on zzso and a moderate growth on zzso zzso b is practically zzso zzso while zzso a and zzso zzso zzso appear unaffected by the zzso Analysis of zzso transcripts shows a reduced abundance of zzso zzso which in addition is approximately 200 zzso longer than that of the zzso zzso of the 3' region of the zzso zzso zzso with an zzso primer positioned 148 zzso downstream from the zzso sequence zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso transcript is extended beyond this position and is not processed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene product may be one of the components required for the exact 3' zzso of the zzso zzso and may also be related to zzso zzso since the zzso zzso gene is not as well expressed as the zzso gene and the respiratory zzso is more zzso We zzso that the zzso protein is necessary for the correct trimming of the end of zzso zzso and may be a part of the zzso complex involved in this zzso
