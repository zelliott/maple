zzso zzso on animal cell surfaces are believed to contribute to zzso interactions in cell zzso and cell zzso Their zzso proceeds via linear precursors that become zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Previous work has identified the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso for a rat serum zzso activity zzso which transfers zzso units to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 is converted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 to the doubly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Costello, zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso Here we report that neither the zzso zzso derivatives of 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso nor a similar zzso of 4 zzso zzso zzso were zzso for the rat serum zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso action was completely prevented at sites in the immediate neighborhood of the zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso reaction was restricted to the zzso zzso unit; at the middle zzso the branching proceeded zzso However, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso prevented branching completely at the middle zzso and almost completely at the reducing end zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso chains inhibited the zzso reaction in a zzso manner, at the zzso zzso unit itself and also at sites one and two zzso units upstream, but not at the zzso units downstream from the zzso zzso These data imply that zzso branching in zzso is possible in zzso with the aid of specifically positioned zzso units, that can be removed afterward without harming the zzso zzso
