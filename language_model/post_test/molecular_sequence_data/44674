We isolated a zzso zzso a human zzso of zzso zzso which has five zzso zzso type zinc fingers at zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zinc zzso at the zzso zzso using zzso zzso from a patient with overlap syndrome zzso and zzso zzso of the entire zzso revealed an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso with a deduced protein sequence of 449 zzso acid zzso and a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is highly zzso to mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells showed the nuclear dot pattern in the zzso zzso zzso
