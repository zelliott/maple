zzso zzso is a newly defined zzso of the zzso box zzso zzso zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso with a severe speech disorder, whereas several zzso in the zzso zzso domain are linked to the zzso syndrome in human and a similar zzso zzso in zzso Here we report a zzso A crystal structure of the zzso domain of human zzso bound to zzso This structure allows us to revise the previously proposed DNA recognition mechanism and provide a unifying model of DNA binding for the zzso family of zzso Our studies also reveal that the zzso zzso domain can form a zzso zzso made possible by a strategic substitution of a highly zzso zzso in conventional zzso proteins with zzso in the P zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso map either to the DNA binding surface or the zzso zzso zzso functionally corroborating the crystal zzso
