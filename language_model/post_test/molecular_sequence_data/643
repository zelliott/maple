A gene zzso provides the natural historical order to zzso genes and to understand their functional, zzso and zzso zzso The gene family of zzso receptors zzso is responsible for many key zzso and zzso processes of zzso and zzso This study provides a zzso gene zzso for the zzso family, which is used to zzso its members and to assess their zzso The zzso zzso supports the recognition of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as more zzso zzso of zzso and the African clawed zzso The zzso for these nominal genes are related to the various zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso fishes, and zzso The zzso zzso also identifies several gene losses, including that of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso When coupled with structural and zzso information, zzso analyses of evolutionary rate shifts reveal two distinct patterns of potential functional changes at the sequence level between zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso between groups without and with zzso An analysis of linkage maps and zzso zzso further suggests that the loss of zzso zzso may be related to a zzso deletion in its common zzso
