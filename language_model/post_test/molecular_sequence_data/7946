We have zzso the extra sex combs zzso gene to zzso 4 zzso that include a single transcript and are able to rescue both the maternal and zzso zzso zzso Several zzso have been identified within the zzso zzso In agreement with earlier genetic studies, zzso is expressed zzso and its product is most abundant during the early embryonic zzso It encodes a protein of the zzso repeat family, which zzso predominantly to the zzso During germ band extension, it is expressed in a zzso pattern of zzso We propose a model in which zzso is recruited by gap proteins both to act as a zzso that competes with the zzso zzso to block zzso and also to mediate the transition to permanent repression by zzso zzso
