Potential zzso effects zzso by T cells or by natural killer zzso cells were investigated in chronic zzso leukemia zzso patients treated with zzso zzso zzso of T cell and zzso zzso was monitored for one year from initiation in zzso mixed zzso cell reactions and zzso directed against zzso zzso cells, zzso During the course of zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso cells increased zzso whereas T cell zzso zzso zzso Despite the high level of T cell zzso to zzso tumor cells in short-term (6 zzso culture, 1) they failed to respond to synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso fusion sequence of the patient, and 2) only one zzso T cell clone zzso was isolated which specifically recognized zzso zzso zzso This zzso appeared not to recognize synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso fusion sequence of the zzso the zzso to which it responds remains zzso To assess potential zzso of zzso zzso it was attempted to sensitize T cells from normal donors in zzso Of 109 cell lines obtained from seven different donors, zzso showed zzso zzso zzso although these results show that it is possible to isolate apparently zzso T cells from patients, as well as to prime T cells against zzso zzso in zzso the frequency of such T zzso zzso appears low and its relevance to zzso effects zzso On the other hand, the strong zzso enhancement of natural killing of zzso zzso blasts during zzso treatment, a phenomenon not observed for T cell zzso suggests that natural immunity may be more important in controlling zzso
