zzso is an zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso and it plays an important role in the production of fermented foods by enhancing the zzso zzso By using the zzso sequence and expressed sequence tag data available for zzso zzso zzso we cloned a novel zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso which was similar to a previously described gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The structural gene was zzso zzso in length without zzso and zzso a zzso zzso which shared zzso identity with zzso The introduction of multiple copies of zzso into zzso zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was subsequently zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso While zzso was located at the cell surface in submerged culture, it was zzso zzso in solid-state zzso The molecular mass of zzso was estimated to be 67 zzso and 135 zzso by zzso and gel zzso zzso respectively, indicating that the native form of zzso was a zzso The optimal pH of the zzso was zzso and its optimal temperature was zzso in sodium zzso buffer zzso zzso Analysis of zzso specificity revealed that zzso zzso not only free zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso Moreover, this is the first report to describe the gene cloning and zzso of a zzso
