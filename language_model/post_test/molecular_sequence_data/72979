zzso zzso segregate in zzso and are zzso distributed between zzso and zzso zzso Their functions in those compartments are likely to be zzso by proteins that interact selectively with one or other zzso zzso (an zzso protein previously termed zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and in zzso binds brain zzso (a mixture of alpha I, beta I, and beta II zzso but not zzso zzso zzso I and beta zzso Because alpha II and beta II zzso zzso are enriched in zzso we investigated a possible binding of zzso to the types of zzso found in zzso zzso did not bind to isolated brain alpha zzso zzso expressed zzso segments zzso of beta II zzso bound to zzso and inhibited the binding of zzso to whole brain zzso By contrast, zzso segments zzso of the zzso beta I zzso 2 zzso showed no interaction with zzso Within beta II, zzso binding activity was localized to zzso zzso which are unique to beta II and link between the end of segment 18 and the zzso zzso domain in segment zzso The divergent regions of sequence in segments 19 of beta II and beta I zzso 2 are candidates to mediate the zzso functions of zzso zzso is the first protein to be described that discriminates between the unique regions of beta zzso zzso
