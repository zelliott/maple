the zzso and zzso zzso spectrum and zzso detection rates according to different family histories were investigated in 521 subjects from zzso unrelated zzso cancer families with breast and/or zzso zzso 

the zzso and zzso genes were screened using zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct zzso 

zzso different zzso were found in zzso and 13 in zzso zzso zzso in one or other gene were found in 96 unrelated zzso The zzso detection rates were the highest in the families with at least one breast and at least one zzso cancer - zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso detection rate observed in the families with at least two breast zzso with disease onset before the age of 50 years and no zzso cancer was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso detection rate in the families with at least two breast zzso and only one with the disease onset before the age of 50 years was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso In the families with at least two breast zzso all of them with disease onset over the age of 50 years, the detection rate was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso 

among the zzso detected in zzso population, 5 zzso in zzso and 4 zzso in zzso have not been described in other populations until zzso The most frequent zzso in our population were zzso zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso gene and zzso zzso G, zzso zzso G and zzso in zzso gene zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso positive zzso
