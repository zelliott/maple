Although intensive studies have been directed at understanding zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms are still zzso In this study, we describe a zzso that encodes a zzso zzso that was cloned as a gene induced in zzso precursor cells in association with zzso zzso Based on the fact that bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in immature mouse zzso zzso cells, we performed a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso cells, and have isolated one clone zzso as zzso for zzso zzso in zzso induced by zzso that is constantly expressed in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence and proposed structure of zzso are mostly identical to those of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene product zzso zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, whereas its expression was faint in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was increased by transforming growth zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso as well as zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso incorporation in zzso cells about twice as high as the baseline zzso zzso actively take up zzso to zzso zzso which are one of the major components of the zzso zzso of bone and zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso induced during zzso differentiation is an important zzso of zzso for characterizing their zzso
