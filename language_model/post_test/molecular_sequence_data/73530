We describe experiments directed towards development of cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso for propagation of functional elements during infection of zzso zzso and zzso were introduced into zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to zzso was found to zzso promoter activity when in reverse orientation sufficient to establish systemic zzso However, replacement of the zzso zzso with that from the zzso promoter caused loss of zzso A 31 zzso zzso containing a zzso tract specifying initiation of zzso plus strand DNA synthesis was inserted into a zzso zzso deletion zzso and zzso in zzso Analysis of progeny DNA showed the presence of an additional zzso at its new location in the zzso zzso indicating that the artificial primer had functioned correctly in an zzso zzso An zzso and zzso sequences from the zzso leader of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when inserted into the zzso zzso in forward orientation was very efficiently spliced during zzso The zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene zzso produced unusual infection zzso with plants showing early symptoms and then zzso We conclude that infectious zzso zzso can be used to carry a variety of elements that target both viral and host zzso
