zzso into zzso is regulated by zzso zzso of zzso B, and these zzso can be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Here, we present the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso and examine the relationship of zzso and zzso activities in the context of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found by zzso the complete zzso zzso using the zzso acid sequence of human zzso zzso A single predicted zzso was identified that shared a zzso identity within the zzso domain with human and zzso zzso zzso with its putative role as negative regulator of zzso entry, zzso of this protein in zzso zzso cells resulted in a reduced rate of cellular proliferation while the loss of expression via zzso interference zzso resulted in an increased rate of zzso In addition, loss of zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso resulted in a reduction of cells in zzso phase and an increase in zzso phase zzso Finally, loss of zzso alone resulted in a significant reduction of zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso however, a reduction in the zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso was only observed when both zzso and zzso expression was reduced via zzso and not by zzso zzso Most zzso in the absence of zzso zzso fragmentation during zzso was zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso have distinct roles in the regulation of zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso zzso
