zzso between related zzso may carry information on selective constraint in each of zzso We zzso patterns of similarity between several zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso are quite zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso sequences contain long gaps, segments where similarity is low and close to that between random sequences aligned using the same zzso and segments of high zzso Conservative estimates of the zzso of selectively constrained zzso are zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This implies that the total number of constrained zzso within zzso sequences is comparable to that within coding zzso so that at least one-third of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are under strong stabilizing zzso
