We performed zzso to detect zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 81 patients with acute and chronic zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso gene product was positive in 27 out of 81 zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso was positive in 20 out of 81 zzso zzso Of 54 patients with acute zzso 17 zzso were positive for zzso zzso and 8 zzso for zzso zzso A high proportion zzso of patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso were zzso zzso zzso Of the patients with zzso zzso disorder zzso a chronic zzso or natural killer cell zzso zzso zzso were positive for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso Of 23 patients with chronic leukemia zzso and zzso 10 zzso were positive for zzso zzso and 12 zzso for zzso zzso To clarify the function of the zzso zzso we examined the zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells from patients with acute zzso zzso on the addition of 10 zzso zzso A zzso The addition of zzso led to significant increases in zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for dye zzso suggested that the zzso zzso has a role in drug resistance, and functional zzso zzso In 31 acute leukemia patients at initial diagnosis, zzso or zzso zzso expression correlated significantly to an outcome of complete zzso zzso In 54 acute leukemia patients, exposure to zzso agents correlated significantly to zzso with a significant higher number of patients zzso or zzso zzso positive than zzso In the 54 patients with acute zzso zzso zzso expression correlated to zzso zzso expression significantly zzso In the 27 patients with chronic leukemia zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression did not correlate to exposure to zzso agents, nor did zzso zzso expression correlate to zzso zzso zzso It may be speculated that zzso agents induced zzso and zzso zzso expression in acute zzso however, in chronic zzso both zzso were expressed independently of exposure to zzso zzso
