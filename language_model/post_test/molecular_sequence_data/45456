A 45 zzso DNA sequencing analysis from zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso A zzso zzso revealed 16 structural zzso 2 regulatory zzso 5 genes related zzso zzso or zzso zzso another 4 genes had no obvious zzso The zzso zzso zzso was proposed, with assignment of the required genetic functions confined to the zzso zzso A cluster of eight zzso genes was found to support zzso synthesis in a zzso host, zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the putative zzso gene zzso abolished the final attachment of zzso for zzso production and resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso while the normal production of zzso could be restored by zzso with zzso The role of zzso in the zzso of zzso to zzso was demonstrated in zzso by zzso zzso
