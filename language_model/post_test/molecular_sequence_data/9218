zzso zzso including zzso and zzso play various important roles in insects, including food zzso immune defense, and zzso zzso Studies on insect zzso zzso could reveal their feeding preference zzso and zzso and facilitate identification of zzso zzso which can be engineered for zzso zzso In this paper, 11 transcripts zzso zzso and zzso proteins were cloned from the striped rice stem zzso zzso zzso zzso All the predicted proteins share high sequence similarity with known zzso and zzso proteins from either zzso or zzso and most of the proteins have zzso motifs that are characteristics of zzso zzso Among the 11 cloned zzso six were expressed predominantly and one exclusively in the zzso of the zzso three were expressed relatively evenly in examined zzso and one was not expressed in either the gut or zzso based on zzso zzso The seven genes that were predominantly or exclusively expressed in the gut were also affected by feeding on different host zzso The genes that were expressed in the gut and were affected by host plants are likely to zzso zzso zzso The identification of zzso and zzso genes in this insect species is the first step towards further comparative studies and for identification of zzso zzso zzso which might be engineered to protect rice plants against the striped rice stem zzso which is one of the destructive zzso of zzso
