zzso are the specialized structures at the end of linear zzso and terminate with a zzso 3' zzso of the zzso zzso The primary role of zzso is to protect zzso ends from zzso and fusion and from being recognized as broken DNA zzso This protective function can be achieved through association with specific zzso zzso Although proteins that bind zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso length and zzso activity in zzso and lower zzso equivalent factors have yet to be identified in zzso Here we have identified proteins capable of interacting with the zzso zzso zzso repeat from the zzso extracts by affinity zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis indicates that the isolated protein is a zzso zzso protein (and a truncated zzso The truncated zzso which we refer to as zzso zzso zzso protein 1), binds specifically the zzso zzso plant zzso DNA sequences but not zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso exclusively to the nucleus, suggesting that it plays a role in plant zzso zzso We also demonstrated that the specific binding of zzso to zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso The evidence presented here suggests that zzso is a zzso binding protein that may contribute to zzso length regulation by capping the ends of zzso and thereby zzso zzso activity in zzso
