A zzso cloning approach was used to clone genes zzso induced in zzso undergoing programmed cell death after zzso We thus identified about 60 zzso zzso One of these genes encodes a WW domain previously briefly reported by others, which defines this gene as zzso zzso sequencing showed zzso to be remarkably zzso in zzso zzso zzso essentially restricted to T cells, was regulated by zzso since it increased zzso after zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso in cells zzso with a conditional zzso zzso zzso less than 1 h after shifting to zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression thus depends upon zzso protein expression and zzso with cell death induction in these zzso While the zzso of its induction are zzso the observed increased expression of zzso in the presence of protein synthesis zzso suggests that zzso gene expression is indirectly regulated by zzso through zzso of a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso
