A dual zzso expression zzso has been developed which combines the features of positive selection for cloned zzso along with the production of an zzso zzso insert by transient zzso in zzso cells as well as high level induced expression in zzso coli cells zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso has two zzso zzso a zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso which when expressed in combination with the zzso analog zzso results in termination of host cell protein zzso Cloning of zzso using unique sites in the zzso zzso regions results in loss of the zzso zzso zzso and hence permits growth of colonies zzso zzso on zzso zzso Additional features of the zzso include an optimal zzso consensus sequence for high level zzso cell expression and an efficient zzso translation initiation site in frame and downstream from the zzso initiation zzso zzso proteins can be produced with an zzso zzso zzso which can be removed via a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoter sites permit in zzso zzso and translation of cloned zzso A zzso of the zzso has also been constructed enabling nuclear zzso of the zzso proteins via an zzso nuclear zzso signal upstream of the zzso zzso
