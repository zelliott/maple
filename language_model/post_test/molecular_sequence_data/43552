The synthesis of zzso involves many small zzso zzso particles zzso as zzso zzso zzso strains lacking the zzso zzso are viable but are impaired in growth and delayed in the early zzso zzso at sites zzso zzso and zzso which lead to the synthesis of zzso zzso The same zzso are inhibited by genetic depletion of the essential zzso protein zzso zzso for zzso showing synthetic zzso with deletion of the zzso gene or with a zzso zzso zzso both identified the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is essential for zzso and depletion of zzso zzso zzso processing at sites zzso zzso and zzso thereby blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using a zzso construct shows the protein to be predominantly zzso These results suggest that zzso is required for the function of the zzso complex carrying out the early zzso zzso zzso
