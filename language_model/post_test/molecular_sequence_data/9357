The genetic basis of floral symmetry is a topic of great interest because of its effect on zzso behavior and, consequently, plant zzso The zzso which is the largest family of flowering plants, is an ideal system in which to study this zzso as many species within the family exhibit a compound zzso containing both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In sunflower and related species, the zzso is composed of a single zzso of ray zzso surrounding multiple whorls of disc zzso We show that in zzso zzso sunflower zzso (in which disc zzso develop bilateral zzso such as those captured by Vincent van zzso in his famous zzso sunflower paintings, an zzso into the promoter region of a zzso zzso gene zzso that is normally expressed specifically in zzso rays is instead expressed throughout the zzso presumably resulting in the observed loss of zzso This same gene is zzso in two independent zzso zzso zzso though these zzso involve apparently recent zzso zzso resulting in little or no expression and zzso of the normally zzso ray zzso Interestingly, a zzso analysis of zzso genes from across the family suggests that different zzso of this fascinating gene family have been independently recruited to specify zzso in different species within the zzso
