Patients with generalized zzso benign zzso zzso zzso an inherited zzso blistering disease, often have no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso in their zzso basement zzso Recently, we analyzed the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in an Austrian family with zzso and identified a zzso deletion zzso zzso that results in a downstream premature termination zzso zzso This zzso has now been identified in additional descendants, suggesting transmission of this zzso zzso through at least six zzso zzso of four other Austrian zzso families revealed that affected members were zzso for zzso in two cases and zzso in two zzso In the latter, zzso analysis identified two novel nonsense zzso zzso and zzso that were confirmed by restriction zzso zzso Thus, zzso on both zzso of zzso are present in all of these zzso zzso zzso and northern zzso studies of cultured zzso from zzso zzso patients show that zzso results in zzso levels of zzso protein and zzso consistent with the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso increased zzso zzso to a level zzso by northern zzso When the latter was used in reverse zzso studies, the zzso was demonstrated, suggesting that zzso may allow zzso analysis in cases where low transcript levels have previously thwarted zzso zzso These findings account for the absence of zzso in zzso patients and attest to the importance of this protein in zzso of zzso to zzso basement zzso
