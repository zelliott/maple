The zzso acid sequences of eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which had been isolated from the zzso of Australian king brown snake zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso at the 103rd position and zzso was separated into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso All the zzso zzso molecules except zzso and zzso which lack the 118th zzso consisted of a single chain of 118 zzso acid zzso including 14 zzso zzso and all the common zzso among zzso zzso from other zzso From comparison studies, zzso zzso and zzso seem to be important for the zzso and we propose that the domain for the zzso toxicity consists of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
