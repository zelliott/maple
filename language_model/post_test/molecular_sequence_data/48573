Here we report the identification and expression of a second zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso This new protein was identified due to a zzso event, since the zzso reaction performed to complete the sequence of zzso (the first zzso protein of zzso zzso identified in 2009 by our group), amplified a 619 zzso sequence corresponding to a portion of a new gene of the same protein zzso The full sequence consists of zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso coding DNA sequence and 4 zzso of zzso zzso The protein is characterized by an zzso region of 47 zzso zzso followed by a region with 7 zzso of zzso zzso acids and a zzso region of 22 zzso zzso This protein showed high identity with zzso and other zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso expression system, and characterized by means of zzso zzso
