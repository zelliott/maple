Within the past 20 years or so, factor IX has been at the zzso of particularly intensive studies of its zzso pathology and zzso as well as its molecular zzso and zzso With the complete zzso sequence of its human gene determined in 1985 and the molecular defects of over 600 abnormal human factor IX genes zzso to date, factor IX is among the few zzso proteins which have been zzso studied in almost every zzso The enormous amount of information we now have on this zzso plasma protein sheds light on how a gene and its protein evolve, how the protein carries out a highly zzso specific and pivotal role in the delicately balanced blood zzso reaction, and the correlation between clinical presentations and its highly diverse molecular mechanism of zzso This wealth of knowledge makes factor IX an excellent model for deeper study, such as truly quantitative analysis of its zzso relationship and in zzso function and zzso It will also provide a sound foundation which may lead to improved treatment of zzso B and perhaps to its zzso This paper attempts to review the recent progress in research on factor zzso
