The scanning zzso microscope is capable of the zzso imaging and zzso of molecules on an atomic zzso Numerous attempts have been made to use the scanning zzso microscope to sequence single DNA zzso but difficulties in preparing samples of zzso DNA molecules on surfaces, and problems in zzso results have limited these zzso Here, we report zzso DNA sequencing with a scanning zzso microscope by using an zzso zzso method to deposit the molecules onto a copper zzso First, we show that zzso bases have a distinct electronic state that allows them to be distinguished from the other zzso acid zzso Then, by comparing data on zzso a zzso zzso DNA, with a known base zzso the zzso zzso of zzso bases in the DNA zzso is zzso These results show that it is possible to sequence individual zzso bases in real zzso DNA molecules with high-resolution scanning zzso microscope imaging and zzso
