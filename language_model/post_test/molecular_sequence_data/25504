Several zzso zzso box genes have been shown to control cell fates in specific positions or cell groups of the zzso Because the mechanisms involved in the pattern formation of complex internal zzso such as the zzso and the nervous system, are still largely unknown, we sought to identify and analyze new zzso box genes specifically expressed in these zzso Here, the molecular analysis and expression pattern of one such zzso containing both a zzso box and a zzso zzso is zzso This zzso designated zzso is expressed in a small number of zzso repeated zzso cells approximately 2 zzso zzso Gradually, four groups of zzso zzso cells appear in each abdominal zzso each one giving rise to a particular zzso muscle after fusion with surrounding zzso Thus, individual precursors for particular muscles, which we call zzso zzso are specified relatively early during zzso zzso The expression of a particular zzso box gene in these cells suggests that distinct programs of gene expression are active in zzso of zzso cells after germ band zzso resulting in a zzso of their zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso is expressed in a subset of zzso cells of the zzso and their precursors and also in cells of a small region of the zzso
