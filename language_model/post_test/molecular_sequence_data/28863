The zzso editing of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by an zzso complex that recognizes an zzso zzso sequence downstream of the editing zzso A minimal zzso that zzso zzso zzso in zzso has been zzso This complex contains zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso the zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso binds with high affinity to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso recognition motifs zzso and a unique zzso auxiliary zzso In many zzso zzso the zzso mediate zzso binding and an auxiliary domain functions in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso does not fit this simple zzso Based on deletion zzso the zzso in zzso are necessary but not sufficient for binding to zzso zzso zzso acids in the zzso region are required for zzso activity and zzso zzso but not for interaction with zzso The zzso 196 zzso acids are not absolutely essential for zzso However, further deletion of an zzso region from the auxiliary domain abolished zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The auxiliary domain alone did not bind zzso Although all three zzso are required for zzso activity and zzso interaction, the individual motifs contribute differently to zzso zzso Point zzso in zzso or zzso decreased the zzso for zzso zzso by two orders of magnitude whereas zzso in zzso reduced binding affinity zzso The zzso expression of zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in moderate affinity zzso
