The circular zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are significantly zzso by the binding of zzso DNA binding proteins such as the zzso zzso gene 5 protein zzso and the A domain of the 70 zzso zzso of human replication protein A zzso These two proteins have similar zzso secondary structures, although their CD zzso at zzso below 250 zzso differ zzso The spectrum of zzso is dominated by a zzso zzso band at 229 zzso while that of zzso is dominated by its beta secondary zzso Despite differences in their inherent spectral properties, these two proteins similarly zzso the zzso of bound zzso acid zzso CD zzso of free, zzso zzso are dependent on interactions of the zzso zzso in the zzso The CD zzso zzso zzso of zzso of simple repetitive sequences 48 zzso in length and containing simple combinations of A and C are related by zzso zzso For example, 3 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso + zzso - zzso Moreover, zzso equations relate the zzso of zzso when they are bound by zzso indicating that each type of zzso nearest neighbor has a similar average structure within the binding site of the zzso
