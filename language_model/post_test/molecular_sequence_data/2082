In order to identify molecular features of the zzso zzso activated zzso zzso of zzso zzso a truncated zzso gene was fused after the zzso zzso in frame with the zzso gene zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso long protein was zzso to zzso by zzso and affinity zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso protein are very similar to that of zzso zzso zzso from zzso culture zzso zzso a specific activity greater than 2000 zzso zzso of protein at 30 degrees C and pH 8, a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso for its zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso converted the zzso protein to a 43 zzso protein with no loss of zzso the latter zzso to the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso protein yielded zzso expressing full zzso activity but having altered affinity for zzso Thus, substitution of an zzso acid zzso for zzso reduced the affinity of zzso zzso for zzso greater than zzso zzso of a zzso zzso for zzso or zzso yielded zzso with a drastically reduced zzso activity zzso zzso of that of zzso zzso but with little zzso of zzso These results substantiated, at the molecular level, our previous genetic and zzso studies according to which the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso site, whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the main zzso domain of the zzso
