The human zzso zzso system has been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso specific for either the zzso or zzso zzso have been shown to react exclusively with the heavy chain of membrane zzso zzso zzso To investigate the structure of the zzso zzso we used the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso samples prepared from individuals of known zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of amplified zzso zzso derived from one zzso zzso individual and one zzso zzso individual revealed a single zzso base difference near the 3' end of the zzso zzso the zzso heavy zzso Short 13 base zzso zzso zzso containing the putative zzso base in the middle were then zzso zzso with zzso using terminal zzso and used as zzso in subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared from a panel made up of four zzso three zzso and two zzso individuals, and the zzso zzso zzso was amplified using zzso and spotted onto nylon zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso base difference identified above zzso with zzso zzso in all nine individuals examined zzso zzso zzso The base pair substitution results in an zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso of the mature heavy zzso The zzso form of zzso encodes an zzso at this position, whereas the zzso zzso contains a zzso Identification of the zzso associated with this clinically important zzso system should permit new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches for treating and managing patients with zzso zzso zzso
