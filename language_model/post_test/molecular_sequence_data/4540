Shortly after initiating zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso II becomes highly susceptible to arrest in a zzso region zzso base pairs downstream of the zzso start site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Arrest by zzso in this region is suppressed by zzso in an zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 94, zzso In this report, we present evidence that, in addition to zzso and an zzso zzso efficient zzso by zzso zzso II through this zzso region requires formation of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of this intermediate requires template DNA zzso base pairs downstream of the zzso start zzso This requirement for downstream DNA is zzso since template DNA downstream of zzso is zzso for assembly of the zzso complex, for initiation and synthesis of the first zzso zzso bonds of nascent transcripts and for further extension of transcripts longer than approximately 14 zzso Thus, promoter escape requires that the zzso zzso II zzso complex zzso a critical structural transition, likely driven by interaction of one or more components of the zzso machinery with template DNA zzso base pairs downstream of the zzso start zzso
