To study the zzso sequence from the zzso zzso associated with the nuclear zzso a residual DNA was extracted from the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso tissue culture cell line zzso The isolated DNA was cloned in zzso zzso The DNA library obtained was screened for the clones zzso to the zzso zzso The experiments on in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the nurse cell zzso of the strain zzso B assigned the reiterated zzso zzso to the zzso DNA zzso to the nuclear envelope associated regions of the zzso zzso which is known to undergo structural reorganization during cell zzso The zzso analysis of 300 zzso from this sequence has established the presence of 21 zzso and 300 zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso the regions of recognition of the nuclear factor and the zzso zzso
