Short peptides have been identified from zzso proteins that form zzso zzso in zzso The zzso stretch zzso has been shown to be important in the zzso of the zzso zzso 3 zzso domain of zzso alpha zzso of bovine zzso zzso The zzso domain of chicken brain zzso zzso which is otherwise zzso is rendered zzso if zzso is replaced by zzso In this article, we describe the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso structures at pH 5 and zzso At pH 5, in the presence of zzso zzso forms short zzso zzso The presence of zzso along with mica results in zzso zzso At pH 6, zzso forms largely zzso zzso Both the peptides are zzso in solution but adopt zzso on zzso The zzso formed by zzso and zzso are formed during drying process and their structures are modulated by the presence of mica and zzso Our study suggests that a zzso need not have intrinsic zzso propensity to facilitate the zzso of the full-length zzso The propensity of peptides to form zzso structures that are zzso could be important in zzso the zzso of full-length proteins into zzso zzso
