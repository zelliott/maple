The zzso of zzso peptides represents a new class of peptides with four zzso bridges zzso that falls into three zzso zzso and zzso categories according to the different signal zzso zzso The zzso has received increasing attention because it targets zzso zzso channels, a function that is relatively rare in zzso zzso we report 11 novel zzso zzso from the zzso ducts of five zzso snails zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso native to the South China Sea using a primer designed according to the zzso of the signal sequence of zzso zzso The alignment of sequences revealed that signal regions exhibited moderate conservation with the exception of zzso from zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to the signal peptides of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The mature peptides ranged from almost identical to highly divergent between zzso zzso of the evolutionary trees of these peptides with those of reported zzso zzso showed that nine of them fall in zzso zzso zzso but two of them were neither zzso and zzso nor zzso zzso zzso some peptides exhibited significantly different zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso compared with group A, B and C of zzso zzso suggesting that they may have different zzso and zzso
