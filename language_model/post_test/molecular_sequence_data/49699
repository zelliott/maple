We deleted the two zzso zzso of the scorpion toxin zzso a zzso inhibitor of a transient zzso zzso current in zzso zzso in culture, to assess their contribution to zzso zzso The zzso analog was shown to have a zzso structure in one-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso We found that zzso bound to its zzso less efficiently than the zzso zzso (by a factor of about zzso in binding zzso with rat brain zzso and that this zzso did not block the zzso zzso current (at a concentration of 35 zzso in zzso patch clamp experiments with zzso zzso Also, these results show that the zzso zzso channel blocked by zzso should have a zzso zzso channel pore zzso
