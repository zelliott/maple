A new strategy to package zzso zzso in zzso was developed that was based on modifications of the zzso zzso This strategy used two zzso the zzso zzso containing the zzso under control of a hybrid zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso reporters, expression of zzso in zzso cells reduced zzso from the zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso was then tested, since it is known to package poorly with standard zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased the zzso of zzso 8 zzso by zzso in initial viral packaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in subsequent viral zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso which packages in zzso without difficulty, was also tested as a zzso In contrast to that observed with zzso 8, zzso expression did not alter the zzso obtained when packaging the zzso zzso thus excluding zzso effects of zzso expression on zzso zzso Since zzso was provided in trans and did not package in the resulting zzso strong zzso of the zzso occurred in zzso cells without the need of additional zzso
