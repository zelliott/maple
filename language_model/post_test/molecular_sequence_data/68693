Many group II zzso zzso reverse zzso proteins that potentially function in zzso mobility and zzso zzso We compared 34 zzso open reading frames and four related open reading frames that are not zzso in zzso Many of these open reading frames have a reverse zzso domain, followed by an additional zzso domain X, and a zzso zzso Some open reading frames have lost zzso sequence blocks or key zzso acids characteristic of functional reverse zzso and some lack the zzso zzso The open reading frames zzso by the zzso zzso genes and the related zzso zzso zzso open reading frame lack a zzso region and have only remnants of a reverse zzso domain, but retain a readily identifiable domain zzso Several findings lead us to speculate that domain X may function in binding of the zzso zzso during reverse zzso and zzso zzso Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that all of the known group II zzso open reading frames evolved from an ancestral open reading frame, which contained reverse zzso X, and zzso zzso and that the reverse zzso and zzso zzso were lost in some zzso The retention of domain X in most proteins may reflect an essential function in zzso zzso which is independent of the reverse zzso activity of these zzso
