zzso The type III zzso of zzso zzso zzso is resistant to zzso by zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas it is sensitive to zzso by similar but zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The target for these zzso zzso has been zzso to be zzso This zzso is situated within a part of the zzso site formed largely from the side chains of zzso zzso acid zzso which might be expected to discriminate against the access of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The substitution of zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso yields an zzso that is resistant to zzso by zzso zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso results in increased zzso values for zzso with only small changes in zzso In contrast, the zzso substitution mainly affects zzso zzso Although the zzso for zzso zzso is decreased zzso compared with zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso zzso reaction, which occurs in the absence of zzso is increased zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso results in an zzso zzso that is structurally similar to the side chain of a zzso zzso zzso The kinetic properties of zzso zzso closely resemble those of zzso
