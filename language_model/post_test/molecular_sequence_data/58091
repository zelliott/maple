To use the zzso chain reaction zzso to detect zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso was developed, the first stage of which amplified DNA from both C zzso and C zzso while the second stage targeted specifically at C pneumoniae, allowing the two species to be zzso The zzso were designed not to amplify sequences from C zzso A panel of 26 zzso samples from patients with community acquired pneumonia evaluated previously by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso direct zzso zzso and culture was tested blind by zzso Most of these specimens also had accompanying serial serum samples which were tested for species specific zzso using zzso zzso 

zzso detected C zzso DNA in 10 of the 26 samples and C zzso DNA in zzso There was good zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the C zzso zzso Two of the C zzso identified by zzso were zzso C zzso by zzso but the zzso results were supported by zzso or a history of bird zzso Of the zzso negative group: six were true negative results; two contained C zzso There were four zzso zzso 

The data suggest that zzso is effective in the detection of C zzso The sensitivity for C zzso is inevitably lower due to the strategy taken but specificity seemed to be zzso
