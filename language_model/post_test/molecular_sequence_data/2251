zzso proteins are zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and assemble in zzso into zzso threads which aquatic larvae use to construct tubes for filter feeding and zzso Thus far, all known zzso protein genes contain zzso zzso sequences and are located in zzso structures known as zzso rings, giant zzso found on zzso zzso cell zzso In this paper we describe the identification of another zzso protein gene which is comprised of repeated zzso however, this gene is not located in a zzso zzso Two partial zzso clones from a zzso pair zzso zzso were zzso and found to contain two open reading frames for protein zzso zzso were raised against synthetic zzso whose sequences were derived from these two open reading zzso An zzso zzso for one of these peptides bound specifically to a zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso sequences contain tandem repeats of 42 base pairs which zzso a repeat of 14 zzso acids with a composition and zzso sequence similar to other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains about 70 copies of this zzso pair repeat organized as a zzso block of 3 zzso pairs or zzso The zzso gene was mapped by in zzso zzso to zzso zzso band zzso zzso studies of protein zzso zzso levels of zzso and relative zzso rate suggested that the zzso gene is zzso regulated so that zzso expression is achieved during the zzso stages of the fourth zzso zzso Based upon these results we proposed that zzso gene belongs to a zzso class of zzso protein zzso While the zzso gene shares structural and expression characteristics with other zzso protein zzso its unique zzso location shows that this zzso family is not restricted to zzso zzso
