Two point zzso were identified within the gene zzso bovine zzso in a zzso calf afflicted with zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso causes an zzso acid to zzso substitution at zzso acid 128 zzso in the highly zzso zzso region of this zzso zzso a region where several zzso have been found to cause human zzso The other zzso is zzso Twenty calves with clinical symptoms of zzso were tested, and all were zzso for the zzso zzso In addition, two calves zzso for the zzso zzso were identified during widespread DNA testing, and both were subsequently found to exhibit symptoms of zzso The carrier frequency for the zzso zzso among zzso cattle in the United States is approximately zzso among bulls and zzso among zzso This zzso is also prevalent among zzso cattle throughout the world, placing this disorder among the most common genetic diseases known in animal zzso All cattle with the zzso zzso are related to one bull, who through the use of artificial zzso zzso many calves in the 1950s and zzso The organization of the dairy industry and the diagnostic test described zzso will enable nearly complete zzso of bovine zzso within 1 zzso These results also demonstrate that bovine zzso is genetically zzso and zzso similar to human zzso thus providing a useful animal model for studies of zzso and beta 2 zzso zzso
