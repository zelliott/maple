zzso diabetes zzso has been recognized to be zzso in zzso with multiple zzso Several genes or zzso regions have been implicated in the development of the zzso In this study the association of zzso class II zzso and zzso and the association of zzso and zzso zzso were assessed in a large number of Belgian zzso diabetes zzso zzso Furthermore, the importance of the zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and the zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso and the combination of both zzso were zzso Our results show that in the zzso class II genes only the zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso diabetes zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also observed that the frequency of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was significantly increased and decreased respectively in zzso diabetes zzso patients as compared with the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results therefore suggest that zzso class II and zzso genes might independently contribute to the zzso for zzso diabetes zzso and that these zzso and zzso might identify zzso of patients with different zzso
