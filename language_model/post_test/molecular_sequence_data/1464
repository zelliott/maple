To prepare humanized zzso zzso by guided selection and chain zzso zzso 

Human zzso and zzso repertoire genes were amplified by zzso from zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were paired with the human zzso repertoire genes to construct zzso zzso zzso After four rounds of panning against zzso zzso zzso containing humanized zzso gene and binding to zzso were zzso Then the selected zzso genes were paired with the human zzso repertoire genes to construct a humanized zzso zzso gene zzso After four rounds of zzso completely humanized zzso zzso were zzso 

After six rounds of zzso 7 zzso zzso genes were obtained from the zzso gene library with 2 zzso 10 zzso zzso Using the selected seven zzso zzso the humanized zzso gene library of zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso was zzso After four rounds of zzso 2 humanized zzso genes with the strongest zzso to zzso were zzso DNA sequencing showed that zzso of the two humanized zzso had the same DNA zzso which belonged to zzso just the same as the parent zzso And the zzso belonged to zzso type, and V zzso 3 zzso 

By zzso and chain zzso technique, the humanized zzso zzso against zzso is zzso which lays the foundation for further zzso
