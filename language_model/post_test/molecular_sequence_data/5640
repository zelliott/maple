zzso zzso are essential for viability and replication of all zzso organisms either zzso PA or acquire them from the zzso How zzso that zzso the gut satisfy their PA requirement has not been zzso The primary regulatory zzso in PA zzso in most animals is zzso zzso zzso This zzso has recently been characterized in zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are reported to differ in zzso zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso We cloned an zzso zzso zzso that encodes a full-length zzso zzso data from this article have been deposited with the zzso Data Library under zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso was functionally expressed in strains of zzso coli and zzso zzso that lack zzso and are dependent upon zzso PA for zzso zzso of zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso of both zzso The zzso zzso strain was used to develop a zzso viability screen for selective zzso of zzso zzso The zzso drug zzso zzso was identified as active in this screen, but zzso characterization revealed that this compound did not inhibit zzso Instead, like other zzso zzso zzso probably zzso zzso zzso zzso Nonetheless, the activity in the screen of the known zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the concept that specific zzso zzso can serve as the basis for extremely selective and facile zzso
