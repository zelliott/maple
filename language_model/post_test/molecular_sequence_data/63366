Recent researches to develop zzso systems in zzso drug delivery have focused on more complicated design to improve therapeutic efficacy and to reduce side zzso Although such efforts have great impact to biomedical science and engineering, the complexity has been a zzso because of clinical and economic zzso In order to overcome the problems, a simplest strategy to zzso zzso to deliver zzso zzso was proposed in the present zzso Two significant subjects zzso formation of zzso loading and releasing zzso and zzso binding specificity of them to cells, were zzso zzso acid zzso was directly coupled with zzso zzso backbone by zzso linkage zzso zzso and the degree of substitution zzso was zzso which were confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Light scattering results revealed that the zzso possessed two major size zzso around 70 and zzso zzso in an zzso zzso Their critical zzso zzso zzso were less than 10 zzso which are lower than general critical zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso images showed zzso zzso zzso in a dried zzso Depending on the zzso the zzso showed different zzso and releasing zzso The zzso release rate from zzso (with the highest zzso for zzso was slower than that from zzso zzso indicating that the zzso worked as a zzso zzso for drug zzso Cellular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was also monitored by zzso zzso All zzso were zzso regardless of the zzso of zzso Based on the results, the objectives of this study, to suggest a new method overcoming the complications in the drug carrier design, were successfully zzso
