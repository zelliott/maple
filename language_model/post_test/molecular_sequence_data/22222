zzso is the primary cause of mortality associated with zzso zzso mechanisms leading to zzso spread are poorly zzso To get a better understanding of this process, we compared the gene expression pattern of two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso activity using the differential display zzso A novel zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso differentiation gene 1), which had zzso zzso with rat zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso was increased in low zzso zzso cell line in comparison to high zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso gene showed that it belongs to the zzso proteins of 40 zzso zzso zzso family, considered to function as a zzso of zzso zzso In order to confirm involvement of zzso in zzso we injected parental and zzso zzso cells into zzso We showed that zzso of the zzso gene significantly diminished the zzso activity of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso repression of zzso was not connected with zzso in cell proliferation and zzso in zzso but correlated well with a decrease in content of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on cell zzso
