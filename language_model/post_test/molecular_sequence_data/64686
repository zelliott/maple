Human zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is an zzso cancer zzso widely used for a serum zzso Its zzso region consists of tandem repeats of SEA zzso In this study we determined the three-dimensional structure of the SEA domain from the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso The domain forms a unique zzso sandwich fold composed of two alpha zzso and four zzso beta strands and has a characteristic turn named the zzso between zzso and zzso The internal mobility of the main chain is low throughout the zzso The zzso that form the zzso core and the zzso are fully zzso in all SEA domain zzso indicating that the fold is common in the zzso Interestingly, no other zzso are zzso throughout the zzso Thus, the sequence alignment of the SEA domain family was refined on the basis of the three-dimensional structure, which allowed us to zzso the SEA zzso into several zzso The zzso on the surface differ between these zzso suggesting that each zzso has a different zzso In the zzso SEA zzso the zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are clustered on the beta sheet surface, which may be functionally zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso is located around the zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand the tissue tumor marker zzso has a SEA domain belonging to another zzso and its zzso motif for zzso zzso is located in the short loop connecting zzso and zzso
