The importance of the zzso zzso factor zzso regulatory factor 4 zzso in zzso zzso has been increasingly zzso We have previously identified the B cell integration cluster zzso the gene zzso zzso as the first zzso zzso gene zzso targeted by zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso of zzso is prerequisite for their zzso However, how zzso is activated in cancer is an open zzso Our zzso profiling has identified several zzso zzso sites on zzso in zzso virus zzso zzso Further, we show here that zzso dramatically stimulates zzso zzso and activity and that zzso and zzso are two key sites responding to zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed and active in zzso zzso However, zzso is unlikely to be a direct zzso for zzso Furthermore, we have a zzso zzso specific to zzso developed in zzso We have further shown that zzso of zzso activity reduces zzso and significantly zzso zzso of the zzso target zzso in zzso zzso Our results therefore, for the first time, demonstrate that zzso is zzso and activated through a zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings will improve our understanding of zzso in zzso and will provide profound insights into the interaction of zzso viruses with zzso in the development of zzso zzso
