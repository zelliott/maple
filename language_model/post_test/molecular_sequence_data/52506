A zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso from the cells of zzso zzso strain zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were done zzso in the presence of zzso zzso Three zzso steps were done for zzso zzso zzso and zzso 6, in this zzso zzso was completed with zzso yield of total activity and with zzso increase of specific activity when compared with the values for the membrane zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso with zzso structure, with a molecular mass of 60,000 Da for the large zzso and 38,000 Da for the small zzso The zzso zzso directly reduced zzso with an apparent zzso of around 300 zzso and with a turnover number around 2900 zzso Metal analysis and zzso properties of the zzso have shown that the zzso is one of the zzso Also, optimum pH and temperature for reaction, zzso stability, and electron zzso specificity were zzso Finally, a model is presented for energy and central metabolism of zzso zzso strain zzso
