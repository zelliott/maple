A kinetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso the transfer of a zzso group from zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso sequence with a random zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso DNA zzso suggest that recognition of the specific site of DNA occurs after the binding of zzso zzso concentration does not affect the zzso constant of zzso while zzso and the zzso constant of DNA show a maximum around pH zzso zzso the amount of zzso decreases the zzso effect of zzso DNA which proves the active role of zzso in site zzso zzso with zzso DNA show that the zzso binds the zzso DNA zzso
