zzso species often contain the toxic zzso zzso which is proposed to protect these plants from general microbial zzso however, zzso pathogens of tomato often are tolerant to zzso and zzso of zzso may be how these pathogens avoid this potential zzso As an initial step to evaluate this possibility, we have zzso to zzso a zzso zzso from the tomato pathogen zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso bond on the zzso zzso of zzso to produce zzso The zzso is a zzso protein with a zzso of zzso and a zzso for zzso of 62 zzso Little or no activity was detected on a variety of other zzso The gene zzso this protein was isolated and contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids that shares sequence zzso with several other zzso When zzso zzso was incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso activity when transformed with this gene but zzso were still sensitive to zzso
