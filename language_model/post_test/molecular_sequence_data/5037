zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso step of zzso tissue zzso The zzso is also expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso A novel zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso shorter than the full-length zzso zzso was detected in human zzso zzso zzso results from the zzso skipping of zzso 6, which encodes the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The corresponding 80 zzso protein was identified in human zzso after zzso The truncated protein expressed in zzso cells showed neither zzso nor zzso activity but was zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was found in all human zzso expressing zzso except brown zzso tissue from zzso It represented zzso zzso of total zzso transcripts in human subcutaneous zzso No alternative zzso was detected in other zzso Human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso cell lines reproduced the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of hybrid zzso zzso zzso into human cell lines showed that zzso elements responsible for the skipping of human zzso 6 were restricted to a 247 zzso region including zzso 6 and the first 19 zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, divergence in zzso zzso elements between mouse and human was shown to be critical for the zzso alternative zzso
