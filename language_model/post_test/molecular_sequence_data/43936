zzso protein zzso of influenza virus is a zzso protein that mediates the zzso of zzso zzso into the membrane zzso It is therefore required that zzso binds both membrane and zzso zzso The X-ray crystal structure of the zzso portion of type A influenza virus zzso acid zzso zzso been determined at zzso A resolution at pH zzso The protein forms a zzso A highly positively charged region on the zzso surface is suitably positioned to bind zzso while the zzso surface opposite the zzso binding region may be involved in interactions with the zzso The zzso zzso surface could be buried or exposed after a zzso zzso
