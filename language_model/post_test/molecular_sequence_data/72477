We have cloned a zzso that encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso is zzso zzso long with an open reading frame of zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence with previously cloned zzso zzso zzso shows a low identity, zzso with type 2 rat zzso zzso and zzso with type 4 rat zzso zzso indicating that this zzso zzso represents a new member of this protein zzso Gene expression studies of the zzso by reverse zzso showed that this gene is expressed in all zzso stages but not during early zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cells resulted in increased zzso zzso activity, that was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was insensitive to calcium and zzso zzso
