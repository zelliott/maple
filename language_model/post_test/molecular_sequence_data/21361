zzso engineers facilitate habitat formation and enhance zzso but when they become zzso they present a critical threat to native communities because they can drastically alter the receiving zzso Management of such species thus needs to be a priority, but the poorly resolved zzso of many zzso engineers represents a major obstacle to correctly identifying them as being either native or zzso We address this dilemma by studying the sea zzso zzso zzso an important zzso engineer that dominates coastal communities particularly in the southern zzso Using DNA sequence data from four independently evolving zzso we aimed to determine levels of cryptic diversity, the invasive or native status of each regional population, and the most appropriate sampling design for identifying the geographic ranges of each evolutionary zzso 

zzso sampling in Africa, zzso and South America revealed the existence of zzso levels of cryptic diversity, in which at least five distinct species can be further subdivided into smaller-scale genetic zzso The ranges of several evolutionary units are limited by well-documented zzso zzso Evidence for both cryptic native diversity and the existence of invasive populations allows us to considerably refine our view of the native versus introduced status of the evolutionary units within zzso zzso in the different coastal communities they zzso 

This study illustrates the degree of zzso complexity that can exist within widespread species for which there is little zzso expertise, and it highlights the challenges involved in distinguishing between indigenous and introduced zzso The fact that multiple genetic lineages can be native to a single geographic region indicates that it is imperative to obtain samples from as many different habitat types and zzso zones as possible when attempting to identify the source region of a putative zzso zzso cryptic diversity, and the difficulties in correctly identifying invasive species that arise from it, represent a major challenge for managing zzso
