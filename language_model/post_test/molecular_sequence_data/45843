Recently, it was reported that zzso bone zzso protein zzso acted as an zzso agent in a variety of cell lines, including normal and zzso gastric cell lines, indicating that zzso plays an important role during cell zzso However, despite the loss of zzso expression in several zzso the underlying mechanism remains zzso zzso zzso through DNA zzso is one of the key steps during zzso In this study, we found, through analysis by the zzso zzso chain reaction technique, zzso island zzso of the zzso promoter region in gastric and colon cancer cell zzso zzso zzso was found to be activated after zzso treatment of the zzso zzso Moreover, 24 of the 56 zzso gastric cancer zzso exhibited promoter zzso zzso zzso revealed that 18 of the 24 zzso gastric cancer zzso without zzso signals exhibited zzso zzso whereas among 20 cancer zzso with strong zzso signals only four zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso is strongly associated with the loss of zzso protein expression in the primary gastric zzso zzso zzso was more often observed in diffuse type zzso than in zzso type zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso loss of zzso expression may be related to gastric zzso particularly in the diffuse zzso
