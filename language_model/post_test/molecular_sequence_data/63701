The European wild zzso is an important game species, subjected to local zzso and zzso in the past, and currently enormously and zzso expanding in some areas where management is urgently zzso zzso the relative roles of ancient and recent events in shaping the genetic structure of this species is therefore not only an interesting scientific issue, but it represents also the basis for addressing future management zzso In addition, several pig breeds descend from the European wild zzso but the geographical location of the zzso zzso and the possible zzso of pig zzso into wild populations are still open zzso Here, we zzso the genetic variation in different wild zzso populations in zzso Ten zzso zzso were typed in 252 wild zzso and the zzso control region was zzso in a subset of 145 zzso Some samples from different pig breeds were also zzso Our results, which were obtained considering also zzso published zzso zzso suggest that zzso most populations are similarly zzso but the major zzso is found along the zzso zzso except for the Italian zzso European wild zzso show the signature of a zzso demographic zzso zzso Italian populations seem to preserve a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso the demographic decline which occurred in some areas in the last few centuries did not produce a noticeable reduction of genetic zzso zzso signs of zzso gene flow among populations are weak, although in some regions the effects of zzso are zzso and a low degree of pig zzso can be zzso zzso the hypothesis of an independent zzso zzso in Italy is not supported by our data, which in turn confirm that Central European wild zzso might have represented an important source for domestic zzso We can therefore conclude that recent human activities had a limited effect on the wild zzso genetic zzso It follows that areas with high variation and differentiation represent natural reservoirs of genetic diversity to be protected avoiding zzso In this context controlling some populations by hunting is not expected to affect significantly genetic variation in this zzso
