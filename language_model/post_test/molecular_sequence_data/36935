zzso zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso chain reaction, has been cloned into zzso and zzso The resulting DNA sequence shows close zzso with the bovine zzso The derived zzso sequence shows zzso motifs similar to those observed in all species studied so zzso No signal zzso is zzso Northern blots of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show zzso beta zzso to be produced earlier than and to be more transient than zzso alpha zzso zzso coding for the zzso alpha zzso and zzso alpha and zzso beta mature proteins have been cloned and expressed in the zzso zzso system as fusion zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso from their fusion partners by the action of activated zzso Factor zzso are zzso pure and show biological activity in standard zzso zzso and cartilage degradation zzso for zzso Some species specificity is observed in that sheep zzso are more responsive to zzso zzso than are mouse zzso The presence of a Factor zzso zzso site in the zzso alpha zzso suggests that Factor zzso may be involved in the processing of zzso zzso alpha to its mature zzso
