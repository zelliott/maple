zzso acids are required for zzso of the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso which regulates protein translation, cell size, and zzso However, the zzso acid sensor that directly couples zzso zzso zzso signaling to zzso is zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso zzso by sensing zzso zzso concentration and initiating molecular events leading to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso important for zzso binding renders the zzso zzso insensitive to zzso levels of zzso zzso We show that zzso directly binds to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso acid signaling to zzso in an zzso zzso manner and functions as a zzso protein zzso for zzso zzso to activate zzso This work demonstrates that zzso is a key zzso for zzso acid signaling to zzso
