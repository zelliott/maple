zzso is a zzso protein that regulates the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso in response to high calcium zzso It is zzso zzso by zzso and related fatty zzso zzso that are thought to act as zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso the zzso zzso group is extended away from zzso and, in the absence of zzso it is more closely associated with the zzso Here we use zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to examine hydrogen zzso exchange rates for specific regions of both zzso and zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso The zzso exchange rates of three regions in the zzso zzso binding pocket of zzso zzso decreased in the absence of zzso This effect is most likely due to the closer association of the zzso group with the protein under these zzso In contrast, rates of zzso incorporation increased in the absence of calcium for other regions, including the two functional zzso zzso In addition to supporting the zzso switch hypothesis, a comparison of the behavior of zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso group zzso or zzso exerts a significant stabilizing influence on the dynamics of zzso We demonstrate that the new technique of monitoring hydrogen zzso exchange by zzso can be used to obtain useful information concerning protein structures in solution using smaller amounts of protein and under more zzso relevant conditions than is typically possible with zzso or X-ray zzso
