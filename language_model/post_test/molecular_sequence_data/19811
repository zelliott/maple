zzso genetic structure of the West Nile zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in 5 states in the western United States using 5 zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso reduced form of zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed a lack of isolation by distance, zzso across all zzso an excess of rare zzso and a zzso zzso zzso revealed moderate genetic differentiation and isolation by distance, with the largest genetic distance occurring between populations in southern California and New Mexico zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and analysis of molecular zzso on zzso data indicated the presence of 3 broad population zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso sequences displayed zzso characteristic of population zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso D statistics performed on zzso sequences all revealed zzso negative zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tests showed evidence of range expansion in the majority of zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso underwent a range expansion across the western United States within the last zzso years, which may have been associated with zzso zzso events that occurred in the zzso and western United States between 350,000 and 1 zzso
