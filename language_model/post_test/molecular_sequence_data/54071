The zzso zzso factors form a family of signal zzso and zzso of zzso We zzso the bovine zzso zzso and both zzso zzso zzso and zzso representing the first complete description of any zzso zzso DNA fiber FISH zzso revealed that the genes reside only 40 zzso apart on zzso Both genes are segmented into 19 zzso and all but two of the zzso zzso are of equal zzso The genes harbor a central block of nearly identical DNA sequence zzso sequence identity over zzso zzso spanning from zzso 5 to zzso zzso Isolation and sequencing of the zzso segments from mouse revealed the same unusually high degree of zzso sequence conservation in these segments of the zzso zzso zzso However, the respective sequences are completely divergent between the two zzso A comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso sequence preservation at zzso sites reveals that the zzso domain is under the strongest selection pressure for both zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso The so-called zzso segment of the zzso domain, in contrast, shows zzso sequence identity in all but one zzso acid zzso in both factors, in zzso human, and zzso This indicates that the same zzso selection pressure occurs on the zzso domain from both factors, zzso and zzso Thus, the comparison of evolutionary selection pressures resting on various zzso suggests that the zzso domain might contribute to differential DNA binding of zzso and zzso factors, while both might interact equally well with other cellular factors through a segment of the zzso zzso
