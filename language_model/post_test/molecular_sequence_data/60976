A zzso chain zzso library screening procedure was used to isolate zzso an zzso acid zzso zzso from zzso bean zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso with an open reading frame that encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 51 zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso protein is highly zzso in nature with nine to 11 putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso transport zzso showed zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso Transport was higher at zzso pH and was inhibited by the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso transport zzso zzso zzso was strongly inhibited zzso by the permeable zzso zzso zzso but showed lower sensitivity zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso modifier, inhibited zzso zzso by zzso A range of zzso acids inhibited zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be a broad zzso zzso that can transport neutral and basic zzso acids with a lower affinity for zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis indicated that zzso is widely expressed in source and sink zzso of zzso zzso and that the pattern of expression is distinct from zzso and zzso
