zzso zzso zzso recently discovered in the human brain, is an important zzso zzso Some derivatives of zzso show even higher biological activity, for example zzso where zzso at position 14 is replaced with zzso As structurally related zzso zzso derivatives have similar chemical properties, their separation by zzso is zzso In this work, the zzso zzso of zzso derivatives including zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso several other zzso derivatives and zzso fragments was zzso While zzso buffer was used as the general zzso the effects of the buffer concentration and various zzso were zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso efficiency of 200,000 theoretical plates was achieved in a zzso of 80 zzso zzso at pH zzso where seven out of nine major zzso were partially zzso By investigating the influence of concentration of the interrogated zzso on peptides migration, the association between positively charged zzso sites of peptides and various zzso was zzso Especially a strong interaction with zzso zzso and zzso groups was zzso zzso stability constant of the zzso zzso - zzso zzso associate zzso zzso 1) for zzso equals to log K approximately zzso
