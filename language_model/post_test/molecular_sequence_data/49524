zzso zzso channels zzso have been identified in zzso and zzso where they may provide protection against zzso We now report that zzso is zzso by the zzso gene (also called zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shares many properties of native zzso including zzso by zzso zzso high zzso and prominent zzso zzso In addition to zzso by zzso we report that zzso channels are zzso activated by zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso both rise in zzso cells, zzso may more effectively trigger the activity of zzso channels in zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that the zzso current is a major component of the delayed zzso We demonstrate in zzso zzso that zzso zzso are hypersensitive to zzso suggesting a zzso role for the zzso gene zzso
