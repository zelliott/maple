We have identified three strains of the same zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Two of them, zzso and zzso have been derived from Japanese populations and one, zzso from Turkish zzso The zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso which linked to the zzso were isolated from each strain, and zzso Each clone isolated from zzso zzso and zzso was designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their zzso sequences were completely identical in coding region, zzso zzso region, and 3' zzso region, though the position of the zzso site was slightly different among the zzso zzso This result suggests that the origin of zzso in these three strains might be common, and that the zzso sequences of zzso of the same zzso are completely zzso among different zzso The high conservation of the zzso zzso sequences is probably essential for the recognition of self or zzso of zzso in this zzso
