The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are predominantly zzso with little effect on the zzso with interchange of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The packing motif of zzso in crystal II is zzso whereas the zzso pack in a skewed fashion in crystal III, with a 40 degrees angle between neighboring zzso zzso Crystal III contains a water zzso in a zzso hole that forms hydrogen bonds with two zzso zzso that also participate in zzso type hydrogen zzso zzso for zzso zzso angles zzso and zzso assume a much wider range than zzso Crystal II: zzso space group zzso with a zzso zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso zzso A, beta zzso zzso zzso degrees, Z zzso 2, R zzso zzso for zzso data with magnitude of zzso greater than 3 zzso Crystal zzso zzso zzso zzso space group zzso with a zzso zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso zzso A, beta zzso zzso zzso degrees, Z zzso 4, R zzso zzso for zzso data with zzso greater than 3 zzso
