zzso of zzso a zzso zzso made by zzso zzso zzso normally occurs only in zzso zzso zzso zzso protection experiments showed that zzso of zzso the zzso gene required for expression of the zzso structural zzso increased dramatically during the transition from exponential to stationary zzso The increase in zzso expression was followed by zzso of the zzso structural genes zzso and zzso and by the production of zzso The presence of zzso on a zzso zzso resulted in enhanced levels of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso production during exponential growth, suggesting that zzso synthesis in rapidly growing cultures is normally limited only by the availability of enough of the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso that is required for the efficient translation of a single zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was transcribed throughout zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of the zzso end of zzso that included the zzso zzso to the zzso reporter gene demonstrated the presence of functional zzso zzso in young, zzso growing cultures and no increase in the efficiency of translation of zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso was observed during zzso The normal zzso production of zzso in the liquid culture conditions used in these experiments appears to be zzso at the zzso level through zzso of the zzso zzso
