The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso through zzso 63 of zzso zzso rather than zzso 48 zzso This modification does not target proteins for zzso zzso zzso for potential regulators of this zzso zzso we have identified four zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso that interact with zzso through their zzso finger zzso These zzso can zzso in addition to zzso other zzso that mediate zzso zzso zzso None of these zzso finger proteins were known previously to recruit zzso For one of these zzso zzso we show its activity as a zzso zzso that zzso chains through either zzso or zzso of zzso and its nuclear zzso with zzso Thus, our screening reveals new potential regulators of zzso zzso
