zzso zzso are zzso by open reading frames that are embedded within group I, group II and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso sequences that are spliced and excised zzso These zzso initiate transfer of those elements (and zzso by generating strand breaks in zzso zzso that lack the intervening zzso as well as in additional zzso sites that broaden the range of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can be divided into several unique families that are remarkable in several zzso they display extremely high zzso zzso which arise from long DNA target sites zzso zzso they are tolerant of a variety of sequence variations in these sites, and they display disparate DNA zzso zzso A significant number of zzso zzso also act as zzso zzso specific zzso for the zzso zzso reactions of their zzso zzso Of the known zzso group I zzso families, two zzso and zzso box zzso appear to be zzso from a common ancestral zzso While crystal structures of several representatives of the zzso zzso family have been determined, only structures of single members of the zzso zzso zzso box zzso and zzso zzso families have been zzso These studies provide an important source of information for zzso relationships in those families, and are the centerpiece of this zzso Finally, zzso zzso are significant targets for redesign and selection experiments, in hopes of generating novel DNA binding and cutting zzso for a variety of zzso zzso
