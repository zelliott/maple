zzso zzso zzso zzso is caused by zzso in genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests the existence of modifier zzso zzso zzso could be of importance given the key role of zzso for cardiac zzso function and zzso Any zzso that affects zzso expression and/or function may impact on zzso clinical zzso 

We screened the promoter region of human zzso III gene zzso and identified a new zzso zzso with a zzso frequency of zzso The distribution of zzso zzso differed in 180 unrelated zzso patients carrying a known zzso zzso compared with zzso controls, with higher zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and AA zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso To study whether the zzso zzso could play a modifier role, patients' relatives including both affected and healthy carriers were zzso zzso carriers had a zzso times higher odds of carrying a T zzso than healthy carriers zzso zzso zzso We then investigated whether the zzso zzso affects the promoter activity using zzso reporter zzso containing either zzso or zzso zzso The activity of zzso was lower than zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is a modifier gene for zzso potentially by affecting expression level of zzso and therefore zzso and development of zzso
