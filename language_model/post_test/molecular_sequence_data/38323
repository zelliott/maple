We have identified the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso of geese zzso a fatal disease of European zzso zzso has been recognized in almost all goose breeding areas, with an zzso pattern, and up to now, the infectious agent has remained zzso In order to identify the zzso agent, infected zzso from zzso geese were zzso to zzso zzso which then developed clinical signs typical of zzso zzso zzso from these birds were subjected to zzso extraction followed by zzso density zzso zzso The resulting main band was examined by electron zzso and consisted of zzso naked, zzso particles approximately 45 zzso in zzso The virus was isolated and zzso in goose kidney cell primary zzso zzso or zzso virus allowed the experimental reproduction of the disease in zzso Random zzso amplification of viral zzso acid produced a zzso zzso which was shown to be associated with field samples collected from geese affected by zzso on commercial farms in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso product revealed a unique open reading frame, showing 63 to zzso zzso acid similarity with the major zzso protein zzso of several zzso Finally, based on zzso analysis, we conclude that the zzso agent of zzso is closely related to but clearly distinct from other zzso we thus have named this newly identified virus Goose zzso zzso
