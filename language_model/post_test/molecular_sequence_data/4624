zzso membrane protein zzso is the major outer membrane of zzso zzso and has been expressed to a similar high level in zzso coli from the cloned zzso It contains zzso surface zzso and zzso against these zzso can protect mice from zzso zzso zzso To develop the zzso gene as a carrier for foreign zzso zzso zzso zzso has been performed to introduce 12 zzso zzso marked by a unique zzso zzso Nine such sites can accept and express a foreign zzso within the surface loop regions of zzso on the surface of zzso zzso The zzso at a given zzso site, and the influence of the length of a model repeating zzso zzso on zzso have been shown to be zzso and apparently dependent on the nature of the surrounding zzso acids at the zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso containing a highly zzso inserted zzso led to an zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso has potential for use as a carrier for foreign zzso
