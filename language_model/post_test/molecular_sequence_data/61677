The fusion protein of enveloped viruses mediates the fusion between the viral and cellular zzso allowing the penetration of the viral zzso into the host zzso Many of these proteins share a common fold zzso a central core zzso of zzso zzso zzso which are formed by two zzso zzso repeat zzso motifs located at the zzso of the fusion zzso In this study, we constructed and zzso the corresponding regions zzso and zzso of zzso virus fusion protein that are predicted to form coiled zzso The zzso and zzso were expressed and zzso separately or as a single chain connected by an zzso acid zzso zzso named zzso Series of zzso and zzso analyses of the expressed proteins have shown that zzso and zzso of zzso virus fusion protein share the common features of other enveloped virus fusion zzso CD spectral results show that zzso forms an zzso zzso structure while zzso exists as an zzso zzso in PBS in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso could form a stable zzso zzso indicating the interaction of zzso and zzso The zzso protein also shows characteristic properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus fusion protein has a common core architecture and its zzso regions could be used as a drug target for virus fusion zzso
