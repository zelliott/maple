zzso expression of the plasma membrane drug zzso pump proteins zzso and zzso was shown to accompany decreased zzso zzso in zzso zzso clinical zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed extensive zzso zzso particularly of zzso zzso zzso showed different abilities to transport zzso when individually expressed in zzso zzso Loss of zzso however, did not accompany decreased zzso sensitivity in zzso clinical zzso Two adjacent zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the putative zzso zzso zzso 12 of zzso were found to be present in six strains including two zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso and principally the zzso zzso contributed to functional differences between the proteins zzso by the two zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso zzso revealed that both zzso were equally frequent among 69 clinical zzso and that the majority of zzso zzso were zzso at the zzso zzso a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso analysis by maximum likelihood zzso identified 33 zzso in zzso in which zzso acid zzso changes showed a high probability of being selectively zzso In contrast, all zzso in zzso were under zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that possession of two functionally different zzso zzso in individual strains may zzso a selective advantage, but that this is not necessarily due to zzso zzso
