Increased zzso density, through viscous loading of active zzso causes zzso dysfunction of zzso and failing zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso We have found this to be based on zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso We show here that increased zzso synthesis is accounted for by marked zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso that zzso regulation of these genes zzso their zzso regulation, and that the greater proportion of zzso protein may have a zzso role in the zzso stabilization found in cardiac zzso
