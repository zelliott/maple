DNA from two regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with DNA restriction fragments from zzso of various species including man zzso zzso As the pattern of zzso is zzso this zzso zzso probe can be used for DNA zzso We demonstrate here that the regions of many zzso genes coding for zzso parts of C and N end zzso are very similar to the zzso zzso probe, and this similarity may be responsible for zzso
