We investigated the zzso region of the gene zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso was screened with a zzso probe, and a zzso zzso clone was obtained covering the first two zzso and about 3 zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso boundaries matched established consensus zzso Within 240 base pairs zzso upstream of the initiation zzso three putative zzso boxes were zzso zzso protection and primer extension analysis indicated that the three zzso boxes corresponded to two major and one minor zzso start zzso The zzso sequences of the two more zzso zzso boxes were nearly zzso Additional sequence motifs with putative regulatory function are two zzso boxes, an zzso consensus zzso and long zzso stretches within 800 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso reporter gene were made for two different promoter zzso and the resulting plasmids were mobilized into zzso zzso The analysis of zzso activities in the transformed carrot zzso showed that 240 zzso of the upstream zzso including all three zzso boxes, led to low but zzso zzso zzso however, the larger zzso which included the putative zzso sequence and the zzso stretches, led to an approximately zzso higher zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso activity in the transformed zzso showed no preferential expression in any specific cell type, in keeping with the presumed zzso character of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
