The induction of differentiation in mouse zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso is characterized by increased zzso of zzso zzso We have determined that zzso treated cells increase the levels of nuclear factors capable of overall interactions with the beta zzso zzso promoter during the initial 24 h post zzso as measured by gel mobility zzso Two zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso which are present in zzso cell zzso early in zzso were previously shown to contain the zzso promoter zzso region, and thereby provided the nucleus with a pool of regulatory sequences in multiple zzso zzso We have studied the effect of zzso copies of the promoter region on binding interactions between DNA sequences of the beta zzso zzso promoter and nuclear factors that interact with these zzso The promoter region zzso transcripts zzso effectively for DNA binding proteins in zzso while the zzso zzso from the same region did zzso The most pronounced competition was observed with proteins from 12 h after zzso zzso when the concentration of the DNA binding proteins was still zzso Since the zzso transcripts predominate at 12 h after zzso zzso these results indicate that the promoter region transcripts may influence the equilibrium of binding between the beta zzso zzso promoter and the nuclear factors that bind to this region during zzso zzso
