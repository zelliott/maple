In contrast to the wealth of information relating to genes regulating floral zzso and floral organ identity, only limited data are available concerning genes that are involved in determining and regulating the identity and development of an zzso We have recently isolated the floral binding protein 11 zzso zzso box gene from zzso and found that it is expressed exclusively in zzso zzso and subsequently in the zzso suggesting a role for this gene in zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we constructed a zzso gene in which the full-size zzso zzso was placed under the control of a strong cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso zzso plants expressing this zzso gene have zzso structures on the zzso side of the zzso and the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso studies showed that these zzso structures are true zzso zzso gel zzso analysis was performed to investigate zzso zzso expression in relation to the expression of the closely related zzso gene and the putative zzso class zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso Our results indicate that zzso represents an zzso identity zzso A new model describing the mode of action of zzso as an additional class D zzso box gene is zzso
