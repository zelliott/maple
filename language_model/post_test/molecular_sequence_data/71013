The human zzso virus type I is strongly regulated at the zzso level through the interaction of an zzso acid protein zzso with a viral zzso zzso zzso zzso the binding of this protein and other cellular factors to the zzso has constituted a significant target for the development of zzso zzso In the present work, we describe the detection of the binding of two zzso zzso of 12 and 40 zzso acids in zzso with chemically zzso zzso by an acoustic wave zzso zzso of the zzso acid to the sensor surface, which was incorporated in an zzso system, was zzso using the zzso zzso As expected, the changes in series resonance frequency and zzso resistance for the two peptides indicate zzso interactions in both cases that can be further characterized by the calculation of kinetic zzso Of particular interest is the nature of the two zzso signals, which are in opposite directions for the two zzso These results together with those obtained for the surface interactions of zzso and zzso zzso confirm that the thickness zzso mode zzso zzso model involving the well-known zzso expression is invalid when applied to operation in zzso
