zzso zzso relies chiefly on the rotation of a molecular zzso the zzso filament, which is constructed from the protein zzso Here, zzso sequence conservation and diversity is examined in the light of the recently determined zzso filament zzso As expected, the zzso zzso are not zzso However, the sequences that mediate filament assembly show remarkable zzso which indicates that all bacterial zzso are likely to pack into filaments in a similar zzso zzso provide a striking illustration of the twin evolutionary themes of conservation and zzso
