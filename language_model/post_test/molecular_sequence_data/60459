The zzso of formation of protein structural motifs zzso zzso and zzso can provide information about the early events in protein zzso A recent study has used zzso zzso to monitor the folding thermodynamics and zzso of a zzso zzso In the present paper, we obtain the free energy surface and zzso involved in the folding of an zzso model for the zzso from zzso zzso Carlo zzso The results suggest that folding proceeds by a collapse that is downhill in free energy, followed by zzso to form a structure with part of the zzso zzso the hairpin hydrogen bonds zzso zzso in both directions from the partial zzso Such a folding mechanism differs from the published interpretation of the experimental results, which is based on a zzso zzso zzso
