Within the frame of the characterization of the structure and function of zzso zzso an zzso acid zzso c was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso Because of the scarce information about bacterial zzso of this type and the large zzso in sequences and possibly function, we decided to proceed to its structural zzso This protein was expressed in zzso coli and zzso The oxidized species is largely high spin, with a detached zzso whereas the reduced species has the classical zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso solution structure of the reduced form was determined on a zzso sample, for which zzso of all zzso backbone zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso One thousand three hundred two meaningful zzso out of 1775 zzso together with 66 zzso angles provide a structure with zzso values from the mean of zzso and zzso A for backbone and all heavy zzso zzso A search of gene banks allowed us to locate 10 different zzso zzso the sequences of which are more than zzso identical to that of the zzso zzso For two of them, the structures are zzso The structures of the others have been modeled by using the available templates and internally zzso zzso similarities in terms of surface properties account for their zzso features and provide hints about the zzso
