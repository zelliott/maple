It has earlier been shown that multiple positioning of zzso on mouse satellite DNA is determined by its zzso zzso To clarify whether other factors, such as boundary ones, can affect the zzso we modified the environment of satellite DNA zzso by inserting it into a zzso zzso between zzso zzso promoter and a structural region of the zzso zzso zzso We have revealed that the positions of zzso on satellite DNA are identical to those detected upon reconstruction in zzso The positioning signal zzso zzso of satellite DNA zzso zzso location at the adjacent zzso sequence as zzso Upon promoter induction the zzso zzso positioned on the zzso promoter, transfers to the satellite DNA and its location follows the positioning signal of the zzso Thus, the alternatives of positioning of a zzso on satellite DNA are controlled by its zzso zzso though the choice of one of them is determined by the adjacent zzso
