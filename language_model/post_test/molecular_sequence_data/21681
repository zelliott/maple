Human zzso virus type 1 zzso is characterized by high genetic zzso due to its high replication rate and the lack of zzso activity of the reverse zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analysis performed on numerous zzso from all over the world, zzso is subdivided into types, zzso zzso circulating zzso forms, and unique zzso zzso No data are currently available about the circulation of zzso types in zzso Here, we describe the genetic zzso of zzso strains identified in plasma samples of patients from zzso zzso analysis on 32 zzso sequences was carried zzso The prevalent circulating zzso zzso is zzso The strains were zzso within the zzso Two main zzso (I and zzso may suggest independent introductions of zzso zzso B into Montenegro, although other zzso evidence will be needed to assume a small number of zzso No obvious evidence of zzso by residence, age, or sex was found zzso not zzso zzso resistance was found, though zzso is the only zzso zzso Continuous monitoring of zzso individuals is crucial to a better understand of the epidemiology of the B zzso in zzso
