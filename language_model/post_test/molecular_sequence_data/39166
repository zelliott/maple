A zzso with a variable number of tandem repeats zzso found in the 3' untranslated region of the human zzso zzso gene zzso was scored in unrelated individuals drawn from 10 geographically widely dispersed populations in order to assess this zzso usefulness in human population zzso The populations that were analyzed in this study included 4 indigenous groups of zzso natives of North and South America, as well as Caucasian and zzso groups, most of which represented small-scale zzso A total of 5 zzso zzso were seen overall, but only in one zzso population, the zzso were all 5 present, and in the Native Americans of Colombia the locus was zzso The most common zzso zzso ranged in frequency from zzso in Greeks to zzso in South zzso The high frequency of the zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso groups of north and east Asia zzso them from most Caucasian zzso The presence of the rare zzso zzso in relatively high frequency zzso zzso among all zzso groups suggests a close affinity with north Asian groups, especially zzso The presence of the even rarer zzso zzso in one zzso population, the zzso reflects this group's long historical contact with zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso is useful in investigating population zzso and that rare zzso at this locus may be particularly valuable in understanding the extent of genetic affinity between neighboring groups and in situations where zzso is zzso However, because of both the association and linkage of this zzso locus with zzso zzso disorder zzso in children, and its highly restricted zzso (usually 3 zzso in most human groups, the possibility of selection constraints on the zzso gene cannot be zzso
