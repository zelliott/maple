To provide a solid support for automated synthesis of zzso zzso zzso controlled pore glass beads were zzso with a protected zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was used for automated synthesis of zzso zzso having either of two distinct 3' terminal zzso If the first zzso to the beads was of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso then, upon completion of zzso zzso synthesis and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso was produced and was shown to be a stable structure which zzso a primary zzso group suitable as a site for further zzso If the first zzso was of a zzso zzso zzso the initial product of synthesis and zzso underwent a spontaneous, zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution to produce an zzso zzso zzso An application of the zzso to the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso is described in a companion paper zzso zzso and Miller, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso preceding paper in this zzso
