A variety of zzso including zzso have recently been found to activate functions by zzso zzso bond zzso from zzso zzso Here we present the zzso A crystal structures of zzso precursors that are able to zzso via an N zzso O zzso zzso Several zzso zzso are aligned around the zzso zzso bond that is in a highly strained trans zzso bond zzso The structure illustrates how a zzso side chain may attack the zzso zzso bond at the immediate upstream backbone zzso and provides an understanding of the structural basis for zzso bond zzso via an N zzso O or N zzso S zzso shift that is used by various groups of zzso zzso zzso
