We and others have recently reported that patients with the zzso syndrome have a zzso at zzso 102 of the gene coding for zzso protein that accumulates in this zzso We report here that this zzso was not found in 5 familial and 27 sporadic cases of zzso disease or in 3 patients with zzso so that although this zzso may be responsible for zzso and zzso in zzso syndrome, it cannot be the only cause of human zzso zzso
