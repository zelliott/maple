As an alternative to microscopic identification of zzso zzso zzso isolated from stool, a sensitive and zzso DNA zzso probe was made for rapid diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso in clinical samples directly applied to nylon zzso The DNA zzso probe was made by screening a zzso library of a virulent zzso strain of zzso zzso to detect zzso plasmids containing highly repeated zzso DNA zzso Four zzso clones that reacted across zzso species coded for highly repeated zzso genes of zzso zzso Four other zzso clones were zzso zzso specific in that they bound to four zzso and nine zzso strains of zzso zzso but did not recognize closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic clones detected as few as eight cultured zzso and did not distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The diagnostic clones were zzso and contained zzso sequences which appear to be zzso repeated in the zzso No stable transcript which is zzso to the diagnostic DNA was zzso In a study of stool samples from Mexico City shown by zzso to contain zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the DNA zzso probe demonstrated a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso We conclude that the DNA zzso probe can be used for rapid and accurate diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso
