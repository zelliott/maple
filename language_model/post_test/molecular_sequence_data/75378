A zzso virus zzso zzso originally derived from brain cells of a zzso zzso zzso patient expressed in zzso cells an unstable zzso zzso protein and was unable to produce virus zzso zzso of this zzso zzso into other cell lines did not relieve these zzso showing that they are ultimately zzso by viral zzso However, these defects were partially relieved in a zzso infectious virus which emerged from zzso cells and which produced a zzso protein of intermediate zzso The sequences of several zzso related to the unstable and zzso stable zzso proteins showed many differences in comparison with a stable zzso protein sequence and even appreciable zzso among zzso Nevertheless, partial restoration of zzso protein stability could be ascribed to a single additional zzso acid zzso From an examination of additional zzso we estimated that, on average, each zzso zzso in zzso cells differs from the others in 30 to 40 of its 16,000 zzso The role of extreme zzso of zzso virus zzso in persistent viral infections is discussed in the context of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and of other human diseases of suspected viral zzso
