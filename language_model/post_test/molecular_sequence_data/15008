zzso transfer inhibitor protein zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso transfer protein zzso zzso zzso affecting plasma zzso levels are poorly zzso In humans, plasma zzso is elevated in zzso To define possible mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso diets on plasma zzso and zzso levels in experimental zzso The zzso which naturally expresses zzso was shown to express zzso zzso zzso zzso exclusively detected in the liver, defined a predicted zzso protein that is zzso zzso to human, with an zzso point of zzso and Mr zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso induced by feeding zzso coconut oil, cholesterol, or both lipids increased plasma zzso mass up to zzso with zzso mass zzso strongly with plasma cholesterol zzso zzso mass was similarly affected by these zzso In contrast, these diets reduced zzso zzso zzso levels by zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso Similar results for both zzso and zzso were also observed in zzso zzso In conclusion, we report in zzso and rabbit that dietary lipids regulate zzso zzso zzso markedly increased plasma zzso mass while zzso depressing zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso have distinct responses to dietary zzso
