This paper describes the characterization and zzso status of zzso a zzso isolate from the respiratory tract of a zzso zzso contains zzso DNA, has normal elementary body zzso and its inclusions do not stain with zzso Its major zzso protein zzso gene was completely zzso and compared with the zzso genes of zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This analysis revealed that zzso is closely related to the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By comparison, zzso shows between zzso and zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso shares zzso DNA zzso with the zzso gene of a zzso isolate zzso from the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso raised to zzso zzso zzso and shown to be zzso zzso confirmed that zzso was more closely related to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso Thus DNA zzso and zzso zzso data both suggest that horse zzso as exemplified by zzso form a new second strain of zzso zzso This species is probably more widespread and diverse than the current literature would zzso
