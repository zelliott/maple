We used DNA sequence variation at the zzso zzso b gene zzso zzso to assess the zzso of zzso zzso in the Black Sea zzso Our aim was to test whether the recent ( approximately 22 zzso years zzso freshwater phase of the Black Sea was a zzso for gene flow among freshwater zzso that today are found in zzso entering the saltwater Black zzso Deep zzso breaks suggestive of zzso divergence were observed between four regional groups of zzso zzso simulation used to distinguish between this and an alternative scenario that the zzso structure was due to random lineage sorting showed that the contemporary populations were unlikely zzso zzso zzso to have been founded by a single ancestral zzso zzso between the lineages zzso were dated to the Middle to Late zzso using distances and a molecular clock corrected for superimposed zzso Taken together, this evidence suggests that multiple zzso populations survived over several later zzso in the vicinity of the Black zzso This zzso zzso served as the primary source for the zzso expansion throughout Europe as far as the Atlantic zzso However, only one of the zzso lineages contributed to this zzso whereas the others remain restricted to the Black Sea region and followed independent evolutionary zzso
