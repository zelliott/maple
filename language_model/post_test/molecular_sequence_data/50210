zzso corresponding to the third zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein gene were isolated from the second copy of the zzso gene and from the single copy of zzso zzso comparison revealed that the three zzso share an unusual sequence conservation which spans a region of 110 zzso In addition, they have the same zzso zzso zzso zzso The three zzso show similar features upon zzso zzso they have very low zzso efficiency and undergo the same site specific zzso which lead to the zzso of truncated zzso Computer analysis and zzso zzso have allowed to assign to the zzso region a specific secondary zzso zzso analysis has shown that this structure is important for zzso the zzso zzso to these three zzso Competition experiments show that the zzso zzso can be prevented by zzso of excess amounts of zzso zzso
