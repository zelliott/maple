In this article, we report the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressed by human zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso normally expressed by the human zzso Using a zzso zzso raised against an internal zzso located between zzso and zzso of the human pancreatic zzso we have zzso an zzso of human pancreatic zzso with an apparent molecular mass of about 62 zzso This zzso of zzso was mainly associated with the zzso of a human zzso cell line zzso the remaining protein being found in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity on zzso zzso measured in zzso and zzso appeared very low and was zzso zzso by zzso zzso such as zzso In contrast to human pancreatic zzso which is zzso as a component of pancreatic juice, this zzso appeared to be retained in the zzso zzso zzso transcription, followed by zzso and amplification, performed on zzso extracted from zzso cells using specific zzso zzso to the sequence coding for the entire normal human pancreatic zzso allowed us to amplify a zzso zzso transcript that appeared to be zzso zzso shorter than the transcript of the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso From the sequence of the transcript thus zzso a protein with a molecular mass of 62 zzso might be predicted, which is in good agreement with the size of the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso deduced from the zzso transcript zzso matched that of the pancreatic zzso However, the zzso domain appeared zzso bearing only a single zzso sequence compared with zzso for the human pancreatic zzso The actual zzso function of this human zzso zzso zzso remains to be zzso
