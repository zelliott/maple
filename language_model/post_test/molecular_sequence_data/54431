zzso zzso zzso is the widely used zzso model animal for understanding the complexity of development and disease zzso zzso has been also extensively used in understanding the mechanism of zzso for its extensive capability of zzso fins and other zzso We have analyzed the zzso profile of zzso zzso fin in its native state based on one-dimensional gel zzso zzso and two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso proteins were identified as zzso fin tissue specific, which includes zzso proteins identified based on one-dimensional gel zzso zzso analysis and 101 proteins identified based on two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso The proteins mapped to the zzso fin tissue were shown to be involved in various biological activities related to development, zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso processing and zzso and zzso are some of the important pathways associated with the identified zzso data set of the zzso zzso
