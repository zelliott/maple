Alpha toxin zzso is a zzso toxin produced by zzso zzso that belongs to the unique zzso family of zzso zzso The location and structure of the zzso zzso of these toxins have remained zzso Using deletion zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso methods a zzso zzso zzso of AT has been zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso modified with an environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe via the zzso zzso showed that the side chains of zzso zzso zzso between the zzso milieu and the membrane core when the AT zzso was inserted into zzso consistent with the formation of an zzso zzso zzso AT derivatives that contained deletions that removed up to zzso of the zzso did not form a pore but were similar to native toxin in all other aspects of the zzso Furthermore, a zzso of AT that contained an engineered zzso predicted to restrict the movement of the zzso functioned similarly to native toxin except that it did not form a pore unless the zzso bond was zzso Together these studies revealed the location and structure of the zzso domain of zzso
