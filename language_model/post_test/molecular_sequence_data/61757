zzso zzso zzso zzso are responsible for the selective incorporation of saturated and zzso zzso chains into zzso zzso which is an important zzso of a plant's ability to tolerate chilling zzso The molecular mechanisms of plant chilling tolerance were zzso by creating zzso zzso between squash zzso zzso zzso and spinach zzso zzso zzso and the results were interpreted using structural information on squash zzso determined by X-ray zzso at zzso A zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso containing the spinach region from zzso 128 to zzso prefer the zzso zzso fatty acid rather than zzso saturated fatty zzso zzso analysis suggests that the size and character of the cavity that is formed from this region determines the specific recognition of zzso zzso
