zzso proteins define a zzso of bacterial proteins that are likely involved in iron zzso Members of this zzso were previously thought to be zzso and were included in the zzso family zzso We determined the first crystal structures of two remotely zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure was determined at zzso zzso resolution and contains the zzso zzso fold, while higher resolution structures from the gut bacteria zzso zzso in two crystal forms (at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso Both structures are highly similar to each other despite low sequence similarity and circular zzso The zzso structure can be divided into two similar zzso bundle zzso The overall structure and the zzso motif region differ from known zzso zzso suggesting that zzso proteins are not zzso A putative functional site is located at the domain zzso We have now organized the known zzso proteins into a zzso which can be separated into four zzso These families share a similar functional site, but each has zzso structural and sequence zzso These results indicate that zzso proteins have evolved from a common zzso and likely have a zzso zzso
