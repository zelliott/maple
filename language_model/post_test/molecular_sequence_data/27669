Most zzso protein zzso in zzso are preceded by zzso sequence motifs that act as upstream zzso sites zzso zzso These sequence elements have previously been shown to represent specific binding sites for a protein factor, zzso zzso of the various zzso elements identified so far indicates a remarkably high degree of variation in the respective zzso On the other hand, a zzso interference study performed with one zzso box revealed close contact points with the zzso protein along the entire zzso To investigate the sequence requirements of the zzso box, we inserted synthetic zzso that differed from the general consensus sequence zzso at single positions into a deletion zzso of the zzso promoter that lacked its natural zzso zzso zzso activity was estimated by Northern analyses of the cellular level of zzso hybrid zzso The results show that in the 3' part of this sequence element single zzso are allowed at all positions, in the zzso part, however, the zzso requirements appear to be more zzso In particular, the zzso C at position 5 of the consensus sequence is absolutely necessary for its zzso zzso
