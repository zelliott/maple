The zzso blood group system consists of at least 21 zzso which may be classified into five sets of zzso and at least 10 independently expressed zzso The molecular basis of four of the five sets of zzso has been zzso point zzso in zzso leading to zzso acid zzso characterize the zzso In this study, the point zzso associated with the remaining zzso zzso was zzso 

The 19 zzso of zzso were amplified from zzso DNA by a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The zzso products were zzso DNA sequences from unrelated zzso and zzso individuals were compared to the DNA sequence of the common zzso zzso 

DNA from the zzso person yielded both G and C at zzso zzso indicating an zzso and Pro zzso in zzso acid zzso 180 of zzso zzso DNA from the zzso person had a zzso zzso in zzso 6, indicating an zzso zzso The zzso change introduces an zzso III restriction zzso site, which was used to confirm the base zzso by restriction zzso length zzso analysis of the zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso predicting an zzso change in zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso
