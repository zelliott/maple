A zzso expression library of the zzso stage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been established in the zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso with pooled zzso from patients with zzso zzso an zzso zzso termed zzso was zzso zzso was expressed using the expression zzso zzso resulting in the synthesis of a zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso of the zzso from 28 patients suffering from zzso zzso disease had zzso against zzso whereas none of the 55 zzso obtained from zzso zzso patients and none of the 15 zzso from patients with other zzso infections reacted with zzso zzso By use of a zzso rabbit zzso zzso serum native zzso protein could be detected only in the zzso of zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso larvae or zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso is located in the zzso on the surface of the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso could be detected by Northern zzso analysis in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence analysis of a zzso clone coding for the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso larvae, termed zzso revealed a zzso zzso a zzso deletion and additional 22 zzso exchanges resulting in a zzso identity at the zzso sequence level and a zzso identity at the zzso acid sequence level to the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso serum with the zzso zzso indicates a zzso regulation zzso resulting in an zzso negative zzso in zzso zzso
