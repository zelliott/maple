A conditional block to zzso zzso is an important mechanism for regulating zzso gene zzso This zzso block within the first zzso zzso was defined originally in zzso cells by nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injection and in zzso zzso analyses suggested that sequences near the end of the first zzso zzso are sites of zzso and/or premature zzso We report here that the mapping of single stranded DNA in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso is paused near position zzso relative to the major zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso of 350 zzso including the sites of zzso formation and intrinsic termination defined in zzso injection and in zzso zzso zzso does not zzso pausing of zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, sequences upstream of zzso are sufficient to zzso the zzso pausing of zzso and to generate the polarity of zzso farther zzso Thus, the zzso pausing of zzso zzso II complexes accounts for the block to zzso within the zzso gene in zzso zzso We speculate that modification of zzso complexes at the zzso pause site may determine whether zzso can read through intrinsic sites of termination farther zzso
