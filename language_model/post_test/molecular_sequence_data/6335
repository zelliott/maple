zzso zzso zzso produces two zzso zzso I, an zzso zzso and zzso II, an zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso and also zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the zzso I zzso The zzso I gene consisted of zzso base pairs, and the deduced primary structure was composed of 611 zzso zzso including an zzso signal sequence consisting of 29 zzso zzso The similarity between the zzso sequence of mature zzso I with those of other zzso zzso such as zzso II and zzso zzso zzso was only zzso although that of zzso II with zzso was zzso zzso II prefers specific small zzso and zzso and zzso Whereas zzso values of zzso I for zzso were larger than that of zzso II, and zzso II could not zzso starch zzso zzso II was inhibited by zzso the hydrolysate of zzso which seems to be the reason for inefficient zzso of zzso These kinetic properties indicate that zzso I and zzso II have differential zzso roles in sugar metabolism zzso and zzso zzso
