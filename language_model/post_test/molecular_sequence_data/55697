We describe a new member of the zzso protein zzso zzso family, zzso zzso cloning predicts that zzso is zzso from a precursor protein of zzso zzso zzso Its zzso domain displays the classical zzso repeated protein zzso zzso zzso separated from the zzso segment by an zzso large zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso precursor protein contains an zzso domain and four zzso type zzso repeats, preceded by a signal zzso and a region of about 150 zzso acids with similarity to the zzso A5 zzso a putative zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso and zzso zzso reveal that the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso processing, following which both zzso products remain zzso By zzso zzso the likely zzso site was shown to be a consensus sequence for zzso by the processing zzso zzso located in the fourth zzso type zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis indicates that expression of zzso in the central nervous system is zzso zzso with highest expression seen in actively developing areas and, in the adult, in areas capable of zzso plasticity such as the zzso formation and cerebral zzso The mouse zzso gene maps to zzso 10, at approximately 21 zzso from the zzso
