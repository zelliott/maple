zzso zzso and simulated zzso calculations have been used to determine the three-dimensional structure of zzso a novel zzso and zzso protein isolated from the flowers of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein of 47 zzso and is the first example of a plant zzso from flowers to be characterized zzso Its three-dimensional structure consists of an zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that are stabilized by four zzso zzso zzso zzso features all the characteristics of the zzso zzso motif that has been described for a variety of proteins of differing functions ranging from zzso insect zzso and zzso zzso scorpion toxins to an zzso of the sweet taste zzso The protein is biologically active against insect zzso which makes it a potential candidate for use in crop zzso zzso shares zzso sequence identity with zzso an zzso protein from alfalfa that zzso resistance to a zzso pathogen in transgenic zzso The structure of zzso was used to obtain a zzso model of zzso since zzso has the highest level of sequence identity with zzso of any structurally characterized zzso zzso The structures of zzso and zzso were used in conjunction with zzso data for the zzso zzso zzso to provide an insight into zzso zzso In particular, a putative zzso site was identified in the structure of zzso and in the corresponding zzso model of zzso
