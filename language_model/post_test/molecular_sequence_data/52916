The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso distinct from the first zzso zzso yet both structures form in the same zzso approximately 20 minutes zzso The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso are required for the establishment of the zzso zzso zzso but are not required for zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes an AAA zzso family member with similarity to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sea zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso encodes a zzso acid protein containing a region similar to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso decorate the polar ends of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that the zzso location of zzso depends on zzso zzso activity and vice zzso These experiments, combined with zzso and zzso similarity to zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso proteins function as a zzso In support of this idea, zzso and zzso physically associate in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells results in the zzso of zzso These data lead us to conclude that zzso zzso activity is required for zzso zzso organization in zzso zzso
