The zzso T cell zzso zzso recognizes zzso fragments bound in the groove of major zzso complex zzso zzso We modified the zzso alpha chain from a mouse T cell zzso and tested its ability to zzso zzso expression and function in an alpha zzso zzso of the zzso The modified alpha chain differed from wild type only in its leader zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso zzso cell surface zzso complexes reacted normally with zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso of this zzso with an zzso to the zzso zzso zzso vigorous T cell zzso zzso stimulation with its natural zzso + zzso zzso did zzso We demonstrated that this zzso could be reproduced simply by substituting the zzso acid zzso at the mature zzso zzso of the wild type zzso alpha chain with zzso acid zzso The substitution also dramatically reduced the affinity of soluble zzso zzso for soluble zzso + zzso molecules in a zzso system, suggesting that it did not exert its effect simply by zzso zzso interactions with accessory molecules on the zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that zzso acids which are not in the zzso zzso zzso determining regions can be critical in determining how the zzso engages zzso + zzso
