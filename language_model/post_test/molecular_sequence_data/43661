The zzso domain of zzso large tumor zzso zzso is required for efficient viral DNA zzso However, the zzso activity associated with this domain has remained zzso We show here that the zzso domain of zzso shares functional zzso with the zzso of zzso molecular zzso zzso proteins function as zzso by regulating the activity of a member of the zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso sequences of zzso comprise a novel zzso that mediates a specific interaction with the zzso expressed zzso and show that the zzso is also required for efficient viral DNA replication in zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the zzso of two human zzso zzso zzso or zzso could substitute functionally for the zzso of zzso in promoting viral DNA zzso Together, our findings suggest that zzso uses its zzso to support zzso DNA replication in a manner that is zzso similar to the use of zzso coli zzso by zzso zzso in DNA zzso However, zzso has evolved a more efficient strategy of DNA replication through an intrinsic zzso to associate directly with a partner zzso zzso Our observations provide evidence of a role for zzso proteins in the process of zzso DNA zzso
