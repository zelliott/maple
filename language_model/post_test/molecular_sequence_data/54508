zzso exists concerning whether cattle and water buffalo sustain infections with zzso of distinct zzso of species in the zzso zzso In particular, zzso similar zzso have been alternately ascribed to zzso zzso or to zzso zzso depending on their occurrence in cattle or water zzso We used light and transmission electron zzso genetic analysis, and experimental infections of definitive canine hosts to determine whether consistent differences could be identified from zzso derived from several natural infections of each host, examining several tissue types zzso skeletal muscles, and zzso zzso derived from cattle and water buffalo shared similar zzso variation among zzso zzso sequences did not segregate consistently according to intermediate host type; zzso derived from cattle and water buffalo induced similar outcomes in the canine definitive zzso One cattle zzso zzso unusually large zzso zzso which nonetheless zzso to previously reported zzso and genetic features of zzso zzso Finding no consistent basis to differentiate between them, we conclude that the zzso infecting each host and tissue type zzso to zzso zzso In our sample, no zzso distinct zzso was sampled which might zzso to a distinct zzso previously described as zzso zzso Either that zzso was missed by our sampling effort, or it may represent a junior synonym to zzso zzso which would then cycle between dogs and a broader range of intermediate bovine hosts than was previously zzso
