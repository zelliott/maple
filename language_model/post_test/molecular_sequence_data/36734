In this paper we show that the zzso zzso agent zzso is a broad spectrum zzso agent with an zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in human zzso rich plasma zzso It had similar activity when zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso were zzso It had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso It inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor binding to zzso fixed zzso with zzso values of zzso 160 and 60 zzso zzso zzso showed a high degree of species selectivity with slightly less activity in monkey and dog zzso and little activity in guinea zzso zzso rat and mouse zzso compared with zzso This was similar to the other zzso zzso zzso This species specificity was shown to be dependent on the species of zzso and independent of the species of zzso Thus, zzso is a potent zzso inhibitor of zzso binding to zzso
