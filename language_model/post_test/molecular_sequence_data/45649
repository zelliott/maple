zzso zzso is a zzso factor with critical role in the zzso regulation of multiple genes in the zzso and also important for the survival, differentiation and proliferation of three zzso cell zzso To understand the regulation of zzso gene in zzso zzso we report its zzso sequencing and zzso The zzso zzso zzso included six zzso and two complete zzso zzso zzso gene has a high level of conservation with its zzso human and rat counterparts showing zzso zzso and zzso of similarity at the coding level, zzso All six zzso were analyzed for zzso detection in 100 animals of the Portuguese indigenous zzso breed zzso da Terra zzso One zzso was found at zzso 58 in zzso 2, in one zzso of 4 animals leading to a change from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso 3 two zzso were zzso a G to A transition altering a zzso to an zzso at zzso 89 in one zzso of one animal zzso zzso zzso and another G to A transition at zzso 105 converting an zzso into a zzso in one zzso of 3 animals zzso zzso zzso These zzso might change the structure of the zzso protein and modify zzso In zzso 4, an A to G transition was detected in one zzso of six animals zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 4 and 6 showed no zzso
