zzso receptors are important neurotransmitter receptors and belong to the zzso of zzso coupled receptors zzso Although it is an important drug target, the crystal structure of the zzso zzso has not been solved zzso Earlier zzso models of the zzso zzso were generated using zzso as a zzso We have used two recent crystal structures of the human zzso zzso one of which shows specific cholesterol binding zzso as templates to model the human zzso zzso Since the sequence similarity between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso is considerably higher than the similarity between the zzso zzso and zzso our model is more zzso Based on these templates, we generated models of the zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso The zzso model appears more compact in the presence of zzso We validated the stability of zzso using zzso MD zzso zzso all zzso exhibit higher binding energies when zzso to the zzso in the presence of cholesterol, thereby zzso that membrane cholesterol zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reports in which zzso zzso zzso have been modeled by zzso zzso
