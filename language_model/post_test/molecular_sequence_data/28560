zzso zzso complex zzso zzso and zinc zzso zinc finger factors are a class of nuclear zzso proteins involved in development, zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso domain zinc finger factors linked to development of the zzso cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso have not been described zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of two novel nuclear zzso domain zinc finger zzso designated zzso and zzso that are specifically expressed in early zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso as well as in differentiated zzso During embryonic development of the zzso cerebral cortex, zzso expression is restricted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with early differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, with a sharp decline in expression at the zzso zzso By using zzso labeling and zzso we show that zzso expression zzso with immature zzso cells and is zzso in differentiated cells, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso role of the zzso domain as a site for zzso zzso both zzso zzso are able to zzso The zzso zinc fingers bind specifically to the binding site for the related zzso leukemia zinc finger protein as well as to a newly identified DNA zzso
