The zzso zzso is a paradigm of bacterial responses to DNA zzso A wide variety of bacterial species possess zzso of zzso and zzso the central players in the regulation of the zzso zzso Nevertheless, the genes actually regulated by the zzso have been determined only zzso in a few bacterial zzso In this work, we describe 37 genes regulated in a zzso manner in the zzso zzso zzso In agreement with previous results, we have found that the direct repeat zzso is the zzso operator of zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso Several potential promoter regions containing the zzso operator were identified in the zzso and the expression of the corresponding genes was analyzed for both the wild type and the zzso strain, demonstrating that the vast majority of these genes are indeed zzso zzso Interestingly, many of these genes zzso proteins with unknown functions, revealing the potential of this approach for the discovery of novel genes involved in cellular responses to DNA damage in zzso and illustrating the diversity of zzso genes among different bacterial zzso
