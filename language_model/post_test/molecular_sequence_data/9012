The invasion and replication of zzso zzso in the chicken zzso is responsible for avian zzso a disease that has major economic impacts on poultry industries zzso zzso zzso is transmitted to zzso animals via shed zzso zzso that need contact with air and humidity to form the infectious zzso zzso which contain the first invasive form of the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso are major zzso factors expressed by zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso expresses five zzso regulated genes zzso one zzso zzso one zzso B and three zzso zzso zzso a zzso derived probe, zzso eight zzso in zzso zzso but only one in zzso zzso zzso activities were found against the fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso throughout the zzso zzso These activities corresponded to a zzso zzso zzso since they were inhibited by zzso a specific zzso B zzso A zzso model of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso based on its sequence zzso with human zzso B, further confirmed its zzso as a zzso zzso with similar characteristics to zzso from the related zzso zzso zzso zzso we have, therefore, named the zzso zzso zzso B, zzso Following stable zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso allowing the expression of zzso fused to the fluorescent protein zzso we demonstrated that zzso is detected throughout zzso and has a zzso distribution in the bodies of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso Me, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso invasion of zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso This study represents the first characterization of zzso expressed by a zzso from the zzso zzso Moreover, it emphasizes the role of zzso in transmission and dissemination of zzso stages of zzso zzso
