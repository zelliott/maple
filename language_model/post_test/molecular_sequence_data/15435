A zzso zzso was isolated from the snake zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso by column zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso Q zzso zzso and designated as zzso It showed an average molecular mass of zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso identification results from zzso analysis indicated that the zzso was a new snake zzso zzso zzso Seven peptides were zzso from zzso by zzso zzso zzso alignment indicated that zzso shared zzso peptides of zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has an optimum zzso activity temperature of approximately 45 degrees zzso The intrinsic zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso showed zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso from those of free zzso and zzso zzso zzso was shown to contain one zzso per zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be critical for both the zzso activity and the structure of zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso intensity and the zzso of the environment of zzso The zzso activity of zzso was accelerated due to the addition of zzso zzso by enhancing the zzso zzso However, a protein component with the molecular weight zzso relative to that of zzso was found to be difficult to eliminate for the zzso of zzso zzso detected the same peptides from it as from zzso which indicated that it should be a zzso of zzso A zzso approach, zzso zzso coupled to zzso supported the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso in the crude snake zzso zzso from the combination of zzso and zzso specific zzso combined with the zzso method indicated that both the zzso zzso and zzso were both zzso and zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso was found to be able to promote the zzso formation of zzso We conclude that a novel zzso was successfully zzso The zzso zzso zzso structural and functional characterization results from zzso reveal new threads and provide valuable zzso for the study of snake zzso zzso zzso
