zzso zzso of zzso is a common zzso syndrome that appears to be zzso in many instances by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a human zzso zzso associated with this syndrome was enriched by zzso zzso and used to construct an enriched zzso library in zzso zzso zzso The library was screened with a zzso zzso zzso on the basis of a partial zzso zzso acid sequence from a human zzso zzso and a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso encodes a 177 zzso acid protein consisting of a 36 zzso acid leader sequence and a 141 zzso acid mature zzso The first 13 zzso acids of the deduced sequence of the mature zzso display strong zzso to human zzso with complete divergence zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed multiple transcripts in zzso from tumors associated with the zzso syndrome and also in zzso from normal human zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA from humans and zzso revealed a simple pattern compatible with a zzso zzso The gene has been mapped to zzso zzso
