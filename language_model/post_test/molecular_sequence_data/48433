Abstract zzso resistance of zzso zzso has been reported to be the result of one or more specific point zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we amplified and zzso the entire zzso coding sequence of 72 zzso of zzso zzso to search for possible zzso zzso silent zzso and 14 zzso zzso were zzso While the zzso zzso and zzso were found as zzso changes in zzso other zzso were detected simultaneously in individual zzso Several different clinical zzso had the same pattern of multiple zzso acid zzso zzso zzso with zzso was identified in 11 resistant and 3 susceptible zzso zzso without any other silent zzso and may be associated with zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso was identified in two zzso zzso and is known to contribute to zzso and zzso the coexistence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was first described in five zzso zzso but the correlation of this pattern with resistance is still zzso These data indicate that multiple zzso acid zzso in zzso were found frequently in clinical zzso and may be associated with zzso zzso
