Plants have as many as 20 heat shock factors zzso grouped into three classes, A, B and C, based on sequence similarity and modular zzso Through screening for cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso and thus subjected all other members of zzso zzso class B zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the same cell death zzso When expressed in zzso leaves, only zzso and zzso zzso mild cell zzso zzso we found that zzso has a zzso control zzso in which a zzso upstream zzso frame zzso is zzso The known zzso function of the respective zzso was confirmed and the difference in cell zzso activity of zzso was explained by the fact that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso but the others are zzso Indeed, the cell death symptom by zzso and zzso required not only their repression activity but also their nuclear zzso zzso zzso expression was drastically and zzso induced by heat shock zzso and the zzso of zzso was required for its HS zzso Based on the results, the zzso significance of cell zzso activity of zzso and zzso and the zzso in the zzso transcript during HS response is zzso
