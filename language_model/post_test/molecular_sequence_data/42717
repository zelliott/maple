The arbitrary primer zzso chain reaction zzso and Southern zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso were used to zzso the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Total zzso DNA from 73 strains was extracted by conventional zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso were chosen for zzso The amplified DNA products were separated zzso in a zzso zzso gel containing zzso zzso and the zzso patterns were compared among different zzso For zzso analysis, DNA was zzso with zzso separated on a zzso zzso gel and transferred to a nylon zzso The membrane was zzso with a previously characterized zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso cloned from zzso zzso strain zzso The probe was labeled with zzso and zzso fragments were detected with zzso zzso zzso produced zzso DNA bands in the zzso zzso regions and distinguished 9, 13 or 17 zzso depending on the specific primer zzso Southern zzso zzso analysis revealed 12 zzso patterns consisting of 1 or 2 DNA fragments zzso zzso The addition of the Southern zzso analysis to the zzso analysis gave rise to a total of 30 DNA profiles among the 73 zzso zzso study zzso The results indicate that both zzso and Southern zzso analysis are useful in zzso analysis of zzso zzso
