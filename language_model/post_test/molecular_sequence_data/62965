zzso zzso or instability of zzso protein zero zzso results in zzso motor sensory zzso In view of recent advances in gene therapy, substitution of the molecular zzso may become realistic in the near zzso Here we investigate the impact of genetic zzso of zzso on selection of the zzso T cell repertoire in the corresponding mouse zzso We show that zzso zzso transcripts are expressed in zzso zzso similar to other zzso proteins and that expression of intact zzso protein can be detected by Western zzso Using a library of overlapping zzso peptides spanning the entire length of zzso and applying the zzso technique, we detected a strong immune response toward zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso in zzso knockout mice, but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In addition, one cryptic zzso and two zzso zzso of zzso were zzso Using zzso into zzso bone zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso expression in the host zzso for full tolerance zzso which is in line with its presence in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso led to partial induction of zzso suggesting that zzso derived cells can also express this zzso Our findings may have implications for secondary zzso developing after gene therapy in zzso zzso and other diseases with genetically determined protein zzso because the repaired protein will then represent a foreign, zzso zzso
