The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso extraordinarily resistant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress, was zzso zzso with a zzso recovery yield from the zzso extract of stationary cells by steps of ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A specific activity of the zzso zzso preparation was zzso zzso U zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso judging by metal analysis and its zzso to cyanide and a partial sensitivity to zzso The molecular weights of the zzso zzso estimated by gel zzso and zzso gel zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso seems to be a zzso protein with a molecular mass of 26 zzso zzso zzso per zzso The zzso native zzso showed very zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was stable at pH zzso but quite unstable below pH zzso zzso was zzso up to 40 degrees C, but a linear reduction in activity above 50 degrees zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity by zzso acid, zzso zzso acid, and zzso suggests that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso similar to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
