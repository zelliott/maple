The zzso zzso constitutes one of the most abundant groups of zzso factors and plays central roles in zzso processes and defense responses in zzso In the work described in this article, 30 unique peanut zzso genes that contained full-length zzso sequences were zzso The 30 genes were grouped into three zzso one zzso nine zzso and 20 zzso zzso The sequence composition of the zzso and zzso repeats was zzso among the nine peanut zzso zzso zzso comparison of the members of this zzso between peanut and zzso revealed that the putative functions of some peanut zzso proteins were clustered into the zzso functional zzso zzso analysis during zzso stress identified a group of zzso genes that responded to at least one stress zzso This is the first comprehensive study of the zzso gene family in zzso
