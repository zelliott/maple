Four genes zzso zzso shell peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso the genes zzso the large and small zzso of zzso zzso zzso and three unidentified zzso constitute an zzso in zzso zzso An unidentified zzso zzso zzso in size is predicted from sequence analysis to zzso a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 57 zzso When this zzso was expressed in zzso coli under the control of its zzso zzso site, no zzso product was zzso In order to correlate this zzso with a zzso zzso the zzso was zzso in zzso coli by cloning it into zzso a zzso expression zzso containing an zzso coli zzso binding zzso When zzso raised against the zzso protein were used to probe an zzso containing zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso was subsequently named zzso zzso is a minor component of the zzso a zzso of this size is commonly not observed or is very faint on zzso zzso zzso gels of zzso zzso zzso labeling established zzso to be a component of the zzso zzso
