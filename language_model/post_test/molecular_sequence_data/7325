The zzso scratch zzso gene is expressed in most or all zzso precursor cells and encodes a predicted zinc finger zzso factor closely related to the product of the zzso determination gene snail zzso Adult flies zzso for zzso zzso zzso have a reduced number of zzso in the eye, and zzso lacking the function of both zzso and the zzso gene deadpan zzso which encodes a basic zzso zzso zzso exhibit a significant loss of zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso during embryonic and adult development leads to the production of zzso zzso zzso with zzso functioning as a zzso factor, various genes are more broadly expressed than normal in zzso zzso zzso zzso these same genes are expressed at reduced levels in response to zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso promotes zzso cell fates by suppressing expression of genes promoting zzso cell zzso We discuss the similarities between the roles of the zzso related zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in regulating cell fate zzso
