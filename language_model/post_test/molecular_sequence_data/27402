A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso plant zzso zzso zzso of zzso was induced by both 300 zzso zzso and zzso stress in roots, but only slightly regulated by those stresses in zzso zzso transcript levels in 300 zzso zzso were doubled by the depletion of zzso zzso transformed with zzso like those transformed with zzso from zzso zzso plants zzso zzso zzso were able to take up zzso in low zzso concentration medium or in the presence of zzso and zzso were permeable to zzso This suggests that zzso has a high affinity zzso zzso function in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed increased sensitivities to zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso zzso from rice zzso zzso showed increased sensitivity only to zzso In contrast to zzso which functions in zzso at low external zzso zzso zzso functions in zzso at higher external zzso zzso These results show that the modes of action of zzso in transgenic zzso and zzso differ from the mode of action of the closely related zzso zzso
