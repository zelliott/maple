The zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the metabolism of zzso drugs used to treat acute zzso leukemia and inflammatory zzso zzso Thus far, at least 29 zzso of the zzso gene have been zzso many of which zzso proteins that have low zzso activity and in some cases become more prone to zzso and zzso Here, the two naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso circular zzso zzso showed that zzso was substantially zzso whereas zzso showed much greater stability comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to probe the zzso structure during zzso zzso In contrast to zzso neither of the zzso bound zzso to a large zzso To explore the zzso of the zzso zzso we performed zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso formation for zzso and zzso The differences in the flexibility of zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated in a limited zzso experiment to pinpoint stable zzso Even though there is only one zzso acid difference between the analyzed zzso zzso a clear disparity in the zzso patterns was zzso zzso displays a protected region in the zzso which differs from zzso whereas the protected regions in zzso are located mainly in the zzso close to the active zzso In conclusion, this in zzso study, conducted to probe structural changes during unfolding of zzso and zzso demonstrates that the various causes of the low zzso activity in zzso could be explained on a molecular zzso
