Many zzso zzso including zzso zzso harbor a so-called zzso a complex zzso of red zzso origin which was gained by a secondary zzso zzso The exact molecular mechanisms directing the transport of zzso proteins to the zzso of zzso zzso are not well zzso Recently, in zzso analyses revealed a second copy of proteins zzso to components of the zzso zzso zzso protein degradation zzso system in organisms with secondary zzso including the malaria zzso zzso zzso These proteins are predicted to be endowed with an zzso targeting signal and are suggested to play a role in the transport of zzso proteins to the zzso Here, we have studied components of this zzso putative zzso zzso complex in malaria zzso Using zzso technology coupled with zzso imaging techniques we can demonstrate that the N zzso of several zzso components targets green fluorescent protein to the zzso Furthermore, we confirm that full-length zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso where zzso tightly associates with zzso zzso zzso (a zzso copy of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso Our data suggest that zzso components have been zzso to provide a zzso for protein transport to the zzso Our results are discussed in relation to the nature of the zzso protein transport zzso
