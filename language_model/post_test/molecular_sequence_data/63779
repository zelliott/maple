zzso zzso zzso and zzso deletions of zzso and zzso genes present a challenge for genetic counseling of individuals carrying such zzso zzso We assessed the value of tumor zzso markers in conjunction with genetic and evolutionary approaches for investigating the clinical significance of zzso zzso 

We studied 10 zzso and 12 zzso zzso identified in Australian families with breast zzso zzso assumed a prior probability based on revised zzso sequence alignment methods assessing zzso acid evolutionary conservation and position, combined with zzso from data on zzso with zzso zzso in the same zzso segregation analysis, and zzso We specifically explored the value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 14 as tumor markers of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso probabilities classified zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T zzso zzso were classified as zzso with zzso zzso probability of being zzso and tumor zzso was particularly important for their zzso zzso zzso zzso was improved over previous studies, largely by incorporating the prior probability of zzso based on zzso acid zzso sequence zzso 

zzso zzso was considerably improved by analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 14 tumor zzso and use of updated methods zzso the clinical relevance of zzso acid evolutionary conservation and zzso These zzso may assist genetic counseling of individuals with zzso sequence zzso
