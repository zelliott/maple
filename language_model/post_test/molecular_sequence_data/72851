Previous studies showed that the zzso zzso proteins from zzso groups zzso display cooperative DNA binding with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by a zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso lack this zzso zzso and zzso were reported to bind with zzso to zzso We show that these interactions require a zzso 6 zzso acids zzso to the zzso zzso site selection for zzso with zzso yielded zzso containing a novel zzso zzso site adjacent to a zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and zzso bound to targets containing either zzso or zzso These data extend previous findings that interactions with zzso define a zzso protein binding code for different DNA sequences across zzso groups 1 through zzso Members of the 11, 12, and 13 zzso do not zzso bind DNA with zzso despite the presence of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso selected a zzso zzso site but lacking a zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso proteins bind to a novel zzso site and can be divided by their cooperative binding to DNA with zzso
