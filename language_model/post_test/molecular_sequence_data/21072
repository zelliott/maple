The shoot zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the development of all the zzso parts of a zzso Our understanding of the SAM at the molecular level is zzso This study investigates the gene expression repertoire of zzso in the garden pea zzso zzso To this end, 10 zzso zzso sequences representing zzso unique genes were generated from SAM zzso zzso These zzso together with previously reported pea zzso were used to construct a zzso zzso array to identify genes with differential SAM zzso as compared to zzso zzso root zzso zzso or zzso zzso A number of genes were identified, predominantly expressed in specific cell layers or zzso of the SAM and thus are likely components of the gene networks involved in stem cell maintenance or the initiation of lateral zzso Further in zzso zzso analysis confirmed the spatial zzso of some of these genes within the zzso Our data also indicate the diversification of some gene expression patterns and hence functions in zzso crop zzso A number of transcripts highly expressed in all three zzso have also been uncovered and these candidates may provide valuable insight into molecular networks that zzso the maintenance of zzso zzso
