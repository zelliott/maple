In the course of zzso our strain collection for zzso zzso zzso two different type II zzso zzso zzso gene clusters were observed from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis placed these together with known zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso The host strain itself has a very clean production profile of secondary zzso which composes mainly of zzso beta under typical zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso from the putative zzso cluster revealed eight genes that were zzso to typical type II zzso genes responsible for zzso aromatic zzso These genes were especially similar to genes from known zzso zzso gene clusters and also zzso to these clusters was zzso In addition, three genes were recognized that are needed for zzso the minimal zzso complex before zzso synthesis can zzso but which are not normally found to cluster with zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso gene that was dissimilar to zzso genes found from zzso zzso zzso gene clusters was also zzso Gene disruption of the zzso resulted in partial zzso of the cluster and production of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results confirm that the zzso method we have developed can be used to correctly detect compounds that are not visible in chemical zzso
