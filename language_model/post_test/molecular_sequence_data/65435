The zzso the so-called sea zzso accumulate high levels of zzso a transition zzso Since zzso first observed this zzso unusual phenomenon about one hundred years ago, it has attracted interdisciplinary attention from zzso zzso and zzso The maximum concentration of zzso in zzso can reach 350 zzso and most of the zzso zzso are stored in the zzso zzso state in the zzso of zzso blood cells known as zzso Many proteins involved in the zzso and reduction of zzso in the zzso blood zzso and zzso tract have been zzso However, the process by which zzso is taken in prior to its zzso in zzso has not been zzso In the present study, a novel zzso zzso designated zzso was identified from blood plasma of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was transcribed in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein was exclusively localized in blood plasma and muscle cells of this zzso It bound not only to zzso but also to zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the other hand, a truncated form of zzso designated zzso bound only to zzso zzso and zzso In a pull-down zzso an interaction between zzso and zzso occurred both in the presence and the absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso function zzso as zzso in blood zzso
