A myeloma cell line zzso from a patient with multiple myeloma and idiopathic zzso and another myeloma cell line zzso were seen to have activity to form zzso from zzso High activity of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso cycle zzso was detected in these cell zzso zzso of these cells was much more zzso than the liver zzso and did not zzso with an zzso against the liver zzso As the zzso activity was also detected in the culture medium of the myeloma cells and because the activity was markedly decreased by the zzso drug zzso the zzso activity was assumed to be associated with mycoplasma zzso zzso chain reaction, using zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the two highly zzso sequences of zzso amplified a DNA sequence that apparently encodes a portion (about zzso in zzso of mycoplasma zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the mycoplasma zzso was zzso identical with those of the zzso of bacteria, zzso and zzso
