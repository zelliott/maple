Type 2A of von zzso disease refers to qualitative zzso with decreased zzso dependent function that is associated with the absence of high molecular weight forms of von zzso factor zzso zzso Type zzso refers to qualitative zzso with increased affinity for zzso zzso zzso In this report we describe the study of a patient who has been previously diagnosed as having zzso 2A von zzso disease zzso because she had no heightened zzso zzso zzso no large and intermediate molecular weight von zzso factor zzso zzso in zzso and no increase in plasma zzso capacity to bind to normal zzso in the presence of low zzso zzso The DNA sequencing of the 3' part of the zzso 28 of the zzso gene where most of the zzso 2A zzso have already been identified, did not detect any zzso zzso At zzso a G to A transition changing the zzso zzso acid zzso from Val zzso to Met in mature zzso was found in the zzso part of this zzso This zzso which has already been found in several unrelated families with zzso zzso and the increased binding of the patient zzso zzso on normal zzso in the presence of low zzso zzso provide evidence for zzso zzso zzso This study thus illustrates the importance of the molecular characterization of patients in the correct diagnosis and zzso of type 2 zzso
