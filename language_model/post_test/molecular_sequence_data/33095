The zzso organic zzso transporting zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso and share numerous zzso However, at low zzso zzso shows zzso selectivity for zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism for this zzso selectivity of zzso by constructing zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso showed that zzso domain 10 is critical for the function of zzso We further identified four zzso acid zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso whose simultaneous zzso caused almost complete loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso transport confirmed a zzso pattern for zzso but showed a zzso pattern for the quadruple zzso zzso This zzso also showed reduced transport for other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso wheel analysis and molecular modeling suggest that zzso is facing the zzso zzso pathway, whereas zzso zzso and zzso are located inside the zzso These results indicate that zzso might contribute to zzso function by interacting with zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso seem important for protein zzso In conclusion, our results show that zzso is critical for the function of zzso
