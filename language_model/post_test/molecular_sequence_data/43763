zzso alpha and beta zzso known as zzso alpha and zzso are zzso surface proteins implicated in zzso binding and membrane zzso In this work we report the zzso zzso and cloning of the bovine zzso of zzso alpha and zzso zzso and Western zzso using zzso zzso made against guinea pig zzso identified likely bovine zzso alpha and beta zzso These candidates were zzso under zzso conditions using zzso and zzso zzso and were subjected to zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso made from bovine zzso protein sequences and from guinea pig zzso sequences were used to isolate clones zzso bovine zzso alpha and beta from a bovine zzso zzso zzso The predicted proteins have the same domain organization as guinea pig zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by an zzso zzso a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso In contrast to the reported sequence of guinea pig zzso zzso the mature, zzso processed bovine zzso alpha zzso contains a complete zzso domain, and a potential zzso beta zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may be present on the zzso surface as a zzso zzso
