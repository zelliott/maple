The gene coding for zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from the malaria zzso zzso zzso The gene appears to be single copy and zzso is expressed in asexual zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso sequences identified three small zzso The open reading frame codes for a zzso protein and no evidence of forms with an extended zzso coding sequence was zzso zzso important in zzso binding and in the zzso mechanism in other species are zzso The protein was expressed from a zzso in zzso coli, partially zzso and shown to have zzso activity using a synthetic zzso zzso zzso of the malaria zzso protein with that derived from the human gene showed a different pattern of zzso by chemical zzso Human zzso activity was inhibited by zzso and partially inhibited by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso activity was not inhibited by either zzso Since the zzso in infectious zzso is a target for potential zzso drugs, it should also be investigated in the context of zzso infections such as that responsible for zzso
