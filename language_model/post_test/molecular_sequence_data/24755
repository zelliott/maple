To explore the relationship between the zzso changes of gene expression of zzso and zzso zzso functional zzso in severely zzso zzso 

zzso of female zzso rats with severe zzso were harvested and the zzso was extracted for the zzso of the expression of zzso gene selected by zzso zzso in contrast to that before zzso The zzso genes were cloned and zzso and compared to those in zzso for zzso 

The harvested zzso were identified by zzso to be zzso and zzso Multiple strips located at 200 approximately 400 zzso were obtained by zzso zzso zzso and were cloned into zzso easy zzso zzso Thus the zzso of zzso expression was zzso Twenty clones were zzso randomly and partial obtained known genes were in zzso with zzso systemic zzso Several novel genes were accepted and registered by zzso 

There exhibited change in the gene expression of peripheral zzso at early zzso stage in rats inflicted by severe zzso
