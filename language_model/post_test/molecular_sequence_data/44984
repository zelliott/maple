Most types of cells can produce zzso zzso in response to various inflammatory zzso To study the role of protein zzso in the signal zzso leading to zzso production, a zzso of zzso zzso was treated with zzso acid zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and VA dramatically increased zzso zzso up to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and VA stimulation was accompanied by a marked increase in zzso zzso expression and also by zzso of a zzso factor, zzso In addition, an essential role of the zzso site in the zzso gene zzso was confirmed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso production by zzso or VA was inhibited by protein zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso Both zzso and VA induced significant zzso zzso of zzso which was presumed to be zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso family, with zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso In zzso rapid degradation of zzso an zzso component of zzso was zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso we assumed that zzso is involved in the zzso and subsequent degradation of zzso thus leading to the zzso of zzso gene zzso
