It is generally recognized that development of gastric cancer arises gradually from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso display of zzso is a valuable tool for the identification of zzso expressed genes in human zzso and zzso The search for zzso expressed genes in gastric cancer and its zzso zzso may help to define molecular zzso in the gastric zzso tissue that may zzso the development of gastric zzso 

The zzso expressed zzso bands were isolated and identified by fluorescent differential display in 2 gastric cancer, 2 zzso zzso and 2 normal gastric zzso zzso and then zzso by zzso After being zzso all zzso fragments were zzso Through zzso software, the sequencing results were compared with zzso database for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in 7 gastric cancer zzso 7 zzso zzso and 7 normal gastric zzso zzso were identified by zzso 

Four zzso expressed zzso fragments were zzso Three of them were zzso in the gastric cancer zzso One of them was zzso in zzso zzso and normal gastric zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso in gastric cancer was zzso to zzso and its zzso in gastric cancer was confirmed by zzso The other three zzso fragments showed significant zzso to known gene sequences in zzso but their functions are zzso 

Three of the four zzso expressed genes zzso in gastric zzso zzso was significantly higher in gastric cancer tissue than in normal gastric zzso tissue and zzso zzso
