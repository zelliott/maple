Many zzso pathogens assemble zzso and functionally diverse adhesive zzso on their surfaces by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso escort zzso zzso to the zzso a large protein complex that zzso the zzso and assembly of zzso across the outer zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex, determined at zzso zzso resolution, reveals that the zzso functions by zzso its zzso beta strand to complete the zzso fold of the zzso via a mechanism termed donor strand zzso The structure of the zzso complex also suggests that during zzso zzso every zzso completes the zzso fold of its neighboring zzso via a mechanism termed donor strand zzso
