zzso receptors zzso are zzso proteins and exhibit distinctive zzso properties, recognizing a wide range of zzso that include microbial surface constituents and intact zzso The class B scavenger zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed by zzso and is considered important in innate zzso We here show the identification and characterization of zzso from the hard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso was zzso zzso including an zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso domain and four centrally clustered zzso zzso for arrangement of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence has an identity of zzso with the zzso of other zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts were expressed in multiple zzso of adult ticks but with a different transcript level in the zzso stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli with an expected molecular mass of 50 zzso In Western zzso analysis, mouse zzso serum recognized a strong reaction with a 50 zzso protein band in zzso prepared from egg and adult tick but showed a weak reaction with zzso of zzso and zzso In an indirect zzso zzso test, zzso zzso recognized the protein located on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of partially fed zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso led to a significant reduction in the zzso female body zzso It is noteworthy that more than a dozen zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso of insect species with functions related to zzso zzso innate zzso zzso clearance of zzso cells, and various aspects of the fatty acid zzso This is the first report of the identification and characterization of the zzso zzso in zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
