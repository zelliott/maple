An important justification for zzso sequencing efforts is the anticipation that data from model organisms will provide a framework for the more rapid analysis of other, less studied zzso In this investigation, we zzso an internal region of 25 zzso acids from a 52 zzso protein that was zzso expressed in zzso Aedes zzso cells in zzso Within the zzso zzso and zzso expressed sequence tag zzso database, this zzso zzso uncovered a putative zzso to hypothetical translation products from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The hypothetical translation product from zzso zzso which included zzso zzso zzso uncovered five expressed sequence tags zzso from the malaria zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso were aligned against the hypothetical zzso zzso we found that in zzso they covered 324 zzso zzso with gaps measuring 19, 30, and 87 zzso zzso To approximate the complete zzso acid zzso gaps between translation products from zzso zzso were replaced with corresponding zzso acids from zzso to arrive at a calculated mass of 51 104 and a zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso consistent with the position of the zzso zzso protein on two-dimensional zzso zzso Finally, tandem mass zzso of a zzso digest of the 52 zzso zzso zzso protein revealed 33 peptides with masses within 1 Dalton of those predicted from an in zzso zzso of the reconstructed zzso zzso In addition to providing the first direct evidence that a hypothetical protein in zzso is in fact zzso this analysis provides a general approach for maximizing recovery, from existing databases, of information that can facilitate zzso of efforts among several candidate zzso
