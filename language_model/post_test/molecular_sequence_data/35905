The zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso were incapable of forming hybrid zzso suggesting that the zzso contact regions of these two zzso are not zzso in spite of significant zzso between the total sequences of the zzso To locate the zzso contact region, we modified zzso zzso of the intermediate species formed during the assembly of the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso modified with zzso were unable to assemble into zzso Further experiments showed that zzso was the primary zzso that was zzso The sequence zzso zzso is quite different from that in the the zzso from zzso zzso suggesting that this region zzso in the mutual recognition of zzso
