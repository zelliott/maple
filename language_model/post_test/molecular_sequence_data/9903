zzso are a class of zzso molecular zzso involved in protein zzso We report the zzso sequencing and zzso of the rat zzso zzso 60 and zzso 10 zzso The two genes are arranged in a head-to-head zzso and together comprise 14 zzso and contain 14 zzso The genes are linked together by a region of approximately 280 zzso which constitutes a zzso promoter and includes a common zzso zzso zzso of the shared promoter region between two reporter genes is sufficient to drive their expression under both zzso and zzso zzso The arrangement of the zzso zzso genes suggests the potential to provide the coordinated regulation of their products in a manner that is mechanistically distinct from, yet zzso similar to, that employed by the bacterial zzso zzso zzso
