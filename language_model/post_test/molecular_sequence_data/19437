The zzso and zzso orphan nuclear receptors comprise the zzso core of direct repeat zzso zzso a protein complex that binds to direct repeat elements in the embryonic and fetal zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of both the embryonic and fetal zzso zzso genes is delayed in definitive zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice, whereas in transgenic mice that express zzso zzso zzso human embryonic zzso is activated in primitive and definitive zzso zzso In contrast, human fetal zzso is activated by zzso only in zzso but not in zzso zzso cells, implicating zzso as a zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso leads to precocious repression of zzso but in contrast to induction of zzso in definitive zzso zzso These temporally specific, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso gene expression by gain and loss of zzso function provide the first genetic evidence for a role for these nuclear receptors in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes during development, and suggest that their differential zzso controls zzso repression of the human zzso and zzso zzso
