We report the cloning and characterization of zzso a novel 19 zzso zzso binding protein that marks a defined cortical zzso domain in zzso and provides evidence of zzso zzso polarity and a form of zzso that persists in zzso and early zzso through the zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso type zzso typical of the zzso type I zzso of zzso binding zzso and both zzso and native zzso bind zzso By zzso zzso protein was first detected in primary zzso throughout the zzso As zzso expanded in size during zzso zzso increased in zzso zzso localized in the zzso egg and early zzso as a symmetrical zzso cortical domain underlying the zzso deep to the zone of cortical zzso zzso remained restricted to a cortical zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain was absent in regions underlying cell zzso In zzso the zzso domain was found at the zzso of zzso polarized zzso but was zzso in zzso of the inner cell zzso In early zzso zzso localized in both mural and polar zzso and a subset of zzso showed inner cell mass zzso zzso concentration dramatically declined in late zzso When zzso of zzso to zzso stages were zzso the polarized zzso domain assumed a zzso zzso zzso while overnight culture of zzso zzso resulted in formation of zzso zzso in which polarity of the zzso domain was zzso at the zzso zzso zzso showed no evidence of translation in zzso eggs, indicating that zzso is a maternal effect zzso The persistence during early development of the zzso cortical zzso domain as a cortical zzso in zzso suggests an intrinsic zzso in the egg that is related to the zzso polarity of the zzso Although the zzso bound to zzso are presently unknown, we predict that the zzso domain directs zzso essential for normal embryonic development to specific locations in the zzso and early zzso
