zzso zzso are zzso zzso compounds that are essential for the growth and survival of all zzso Although the zzso system plays a key role in zzso cancer and in plant survival, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well zzso Here, we identified an zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso family zzso named zzso zzso to zzso zzso 1), responsible for zzso of PA and its analog zzso zzso The natural variation in zzso tolerance was determined in 22 zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso variation of zzso An zzso fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane in transformed zzso The zzso zzso zzso was highly resistant to zzso because of the reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants were hypersensitive to PA and zzso and showed elevated zzso zzso activity, supporting the notion that zzso enters plant cells via a carrier system that inherently functions in PA zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso variation in zzso controls zzso zzso zzso Our identification of a molecular entity for zzso zzso and sensitivity provides an important clue for our understanding of the mechanism and biological significance of PA zzso
