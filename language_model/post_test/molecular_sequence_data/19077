Small zzso are important regulators of zzso function, yet their prediction in zzso is still a major zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso sequences indicated that their zzso structure tends to have a minimal free energy zzso significantly lower than zzso values of zzso zzso sequences with the same zzso zzso in contrast to other classes of zzso zzso The zzso of many zzso is, however, too intensive to allow for zzso zzso 

Using a local grid infrastructure, zzso zzso of random sequences were zzso on a large zzso These zzso follow a normal distribution and can be used to determine the zzso distribution for any given sequence composition by zzso It allows zzso calculation of the normal distribution for any candidate sequence zzso 

The zzso achieved makes zzso screening with this characteristic of a zzso sequence zzso Although this particular property alone will not be able to distinguish zzso from other sequences sufficiently zzso the zzso zzso should be added to the parameters of choice to be included in the selection of potential zzso candidates for experimental zzso
