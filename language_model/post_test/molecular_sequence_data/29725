zzso DNA zzso are present in all bacteria and are essential for zzso Their unique zzso specificity compared with zzso human DNA zzso recommends the zzso zzso as targets for the development of new zzso zzso A plausible strategy for drug discovery is to identify the structural components of bacterial DNA zzso that interact with zzso and then to isolate small molecules that recognize these components and thereby block the binding of zzso to the zzso The limitation to this strategy is that the structural zzso of zzso specificity are not zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso zzso with zzso requires zzso domain zzso which is unique to, and zzso zzso zzso zzso but absent from zzso zzso zzso of domain zzso abolished the zzso of zzso nicks and the reaction with zzso to form zzso but had no effect on zzso formation at a zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso within domain zzso either reduced zzso zzso or abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso and zzso transfer from zzso without affecting zzso of zzso zzso We suggest that these five side chains comprise a binding site for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso relationships were clarified by conservative zzso
