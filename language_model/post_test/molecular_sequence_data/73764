The high-resolution crystal structure of the gene V protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been solved recently for the zzso and two surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to a plausible model for the zzso zzso complex zzso Y, Zhang zzso Wang zzso 1995, zzso zzso zzso The model of the complex shows extensive contacts between neighboring zzso zzso involving zzso interactions between the zzso from one and the zzso and zzso from the next zzso In addition, zzso interactions between the zzso acids zzso and zzso from one and zzso from the next zzso also contribute to the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sites generally destabilize the protein and many of these affect the function of the zzso We have studied the structural effects of three zzso proteins involving those sites, zzso zzso zzso and zzso by X-ray zzso analysis at zzso A zzso In zzso zzso the structural zzso is zzso whereas in zzso and zzso zzso some long-range effects are also detected in addition to the local zzso We have interpreted the protein stability and the functional properties associated with those zzso in terms of the observed structural zzso
