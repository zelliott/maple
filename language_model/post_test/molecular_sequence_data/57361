Seven individuals with deletions of the zzso long arm of zzso 18 were evaluated at the clinical, zzso and molecular zzso The patients had varying degrees of typical clinical findings associated with the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed deletions from zzso or zzso to zzso zzso cell hybrids derived from the patients were zzso characterized using ordered groups of zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso In general, the size of the deletion could be correlated with the severity of the zzso Based on the clinical pictures of these seven patients, a preliminary zzso map for the clinical features associated with deletions of the zzso portion of the long arm has been zzso Furthermore, genes previously localized to zzso were mapped relative to the zzso zzso present in these zzso
