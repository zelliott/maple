zzso beta and gamma constitute a novel family of zzso proteins in the zzso fluid of goldfish zzso Here we demonstrate that at least two different transcripts exist in goldfish brain differing mainly in the length of their 3' zzso regions but zzso very similar precursors for zzso Both precursors consist of 216 zzso acid zzso including two potential zzso zzso zzso is the main but not the only precursor of zzso zzso whereas zzso is zzso processed to zzso zzso This is in line with our results showing that both zzso beta and gamma represent different zzso with very similar protein zzso Additionally, we show that both zzso share the same zzso ends indicating that zzso gamma is not a zzso product of zzso zzso We also demonstrate that processing at three internal pairs of basic zzso does not occur in either zzso
