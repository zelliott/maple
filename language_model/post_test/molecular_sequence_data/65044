zzso are basically zzso in color vision, possessing middle to long zzso zzso and the short zzso zzso cone zzso in the zzso whereas some nocturnal zzso lack functional zzso zzso zzso primitive primates consisting of three extant groups zzso zzso and zzso include many nocturnal zzso Among nocturnal zzso a species of zzso the greater zzso zzso zzso is known to lack a functional zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso appear to retain zzso zzso in the zzso It has not been established, however, whether the loss of zzso zzso is a universal phenomenon among zzso and whether the functional zzso zzso genes of zzso and zzso are under strict or relaxed selective zzso To gain better insight into an association between zzso and loss of zzso function, we isolated and zzso the zzso zzso genes from two species of zzso the slow zzso zzso zzso zzso and the lesser zzso zzso zzso zzso and one species each of zzso and zzso the brown zzso zzso zzso zzso and the western zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso Our sequence analysis revealed that zzso the zzso zzso gene was disrupted in the common zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso the rate of zzso zzso substitution has been kept significantly lower than that of synonymous substitution in zzso and zzso demonstrating the presence of strict selective constraint on the zzso zzso genes in zzso and zzso
