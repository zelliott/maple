A model of zzso interaction with distinct zzso or zzso has been derived from the zzso studies of zzso complexes, and buttressed by functional studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives or zzso against zzso The unique specificity of zzso for its zzso and zzso may be ascribed to multiple interactions with both the active site zzso and zzso distinct from the active zzso Two prominent zzso zzso around zzso 50 and zzso 148 project over the active site zzso and play an important role in the zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso interact with a large zzso located on the surface of the loop segment zzso mainly constituted of basic zzso zzso designated zzso binding zzso zzso zzso with these various zzso appears to involve a limited number of zzso within the large zzso zzso It is conceivable that zzso 1 contains distinct zzso although most of them may zzso A second basic zzso zzso binding zzso 2) is located close to the zzso B chain zzso zzso 2 interacts with zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with either zzso 1 or zzso 2 leads to zzso changes of the zzso zzso that may be important zzso of zzso zzso Whether zzso 2 zzso with zzso 1 for zzso interaction with zzso or the zzso zzso remains to be zzso
