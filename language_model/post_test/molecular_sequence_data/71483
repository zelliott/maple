zzso zzso is the major zzso protein of zzso zzso It exhibits the functional properties of a general diffusion zzso but has no sequence similarity to other zzso According to the proposed zzso model, each zzso of this zzso protein is a zzso consisting of 16 zzso segments with eight zzso zzso Several zzso charged zzso are proposed to extend from the zzso wall into the zzso channel zzso and may contribute to a zzso electric field similar to that at the pore zzso of zzso with known zzso The goal of our study was to identify particular basic zzso contributing to such an electric field in zzso Several zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso charged zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli, and the effects on pore function were studied in zzso by zzso the zzso rate of zzso zzso and in zzso after zzso of the zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso Some of the point zzso had a significant impact on the channel zzso The substitution zzso produced a zzso increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso selectivity of zzso increased by zzso The effects of the zzso substitution on channel properties were zzso Most of the point zzso had a minor effect on the zzso gating of the zzso channel, resulting in an increased sensitivity, except for zzso which showed a decreased zzso The latter zzso had no effect on zzso zzso but the zzso substitution improved the zzso rate of zzso The results presented here indicate that zzso 90 and 92 are probably part of the zzso zone of the zzso zzso and zzso 78 and zzso 115 and 117 are probably in close proximity to this region as zzso
