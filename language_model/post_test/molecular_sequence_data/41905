Satellite DNA from wild beet species was separated from restriction zzso zzso zzso DNA by zzso gel zzso Two zzso zzso satellite DNA repeats were cloned from the wild beet zzso zzso The type I repeat is zzso zzso long and AT rich, while the type II is 162 zzso in size and zzso zzso A third repetitive zzso element cloned from the related wild beet zzso zzso was shown to be organized as a zzso satellite DNA family in the cultivated beet zzso zzso zzso zzso and the wild beet zzso zzso zzso zzso This type III satellite zzso is 149 zzso long and contains a high number of short direct zzso The zzso was found in different zzso organizations and copy numbers in all sections of the zzso zzso indicating an amplification early in the zzso The zzso repeats from zzso zzso are characterized by a lower zzso and form long tandem zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The investigation of the distribution of all three sequence families provided data that may contribute to the solution of zzso problems of the zzso zzso and be useful in the characterization of hybrids and derived lines with alien wild beet zzso
