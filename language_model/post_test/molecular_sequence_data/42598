The identification and propagation of T cells with zzso zzso is critical for understanding the human immune response to tumors, which may possibly be useful in the successful zzso of adoptive zzso against zzso In order to address this question, we examined the diversity of zzso transcripts of zzso zzso zzso V alpha and V beta genes in zzso zzso zzso of 12 zzso specimens obtained at zzso Using the zzso chain reaction zzso method and zzso for 18 different human zzso V alpha and 22 V beta families to analyze zzso zzso gene zzso we detected a limited expression of zzso variable region, V alpha genes and zzso usage of V alpha 7 within zzso zzso zzso V beta gene usage was more diverse than that for V zzso but zzso V beta zzso was zzso expressed in 9 out of 12 zzso In addition, we analyzed the percentage of each V zzso and V zzso zzso zzso in zzso as well as in peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso bearing each V alpha or V beta zzso was variable and uneven in all zzso In 3 cases, the distribution of V alpha zzso T cells in zzso was far higher than in zzso This phenomenon was not found in T cells bearing zzso V beta zzso We also performed human zzso zzso zzso typing in these patients, and zzso was observed in 8 out of 11 zzso Among them all 3 patients who showed a skewed distribution of V alpha zzso T cells in zzso expressed zzso There was no correlation between particular class I or II type and zzso V beta gene zzso From these results, it was strongly suggested that T cells bearing zzso V alpha 7 might be targeted to zzso zzso on zzso cells, and such zzso population may be useful as zzso cells for cancer zzso
