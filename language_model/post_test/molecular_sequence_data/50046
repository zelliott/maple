zzso zzso protein 1 zzso plays an important role in B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso survival, and zzso After zzso stimulation in zzso cells, zzso has been shown to be recruited to zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs present in receptors such as zzso and zzso However, the zzso of zzso in the chicken B cell line, zzso have remained zzso To identify zzso zzso in zzso we used a zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso inactive zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso of approximately zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso analysis revealed that this was zzso zzso type 5) carrying three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind to one of these sequences in synthetic zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso is a direct zzso zzso Furthermore, more zzso molecules zzso into zzso zzso and their association with zzso was increased after zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by membrane zzso zzso was sustained to a greater extent for a longer time compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is essential for zzso zzso after zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso plays a pivotal role in reorganization of zzso architecture inducing zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate the direct interaction of zzso with zzso
