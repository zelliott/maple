The zzso growth factor binding proteins zzso constitute a structurally related protein family with six known zzso We have mapped and regionally localized the genes coding for human zzso 2, 3, and 4, by in zzso zzso and zzso cell hybrid zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso region zzso whereas the genes for zzso and 3 are localized in a zzso fashion on zzso 7 region zzso The zzso gene is located in the zzso region zzso zzso characterization of the genes coding for zzso 2, 3, and 5 showed that the translated parts are divided into four zzso The zzso are similar both in size and sequence in all studied zzso
