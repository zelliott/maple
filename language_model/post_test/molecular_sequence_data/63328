zzso a biological module involves recognition of its structure and the dynamics of its principal zzso In this report we present an analysis of the dynamics of the repression module within the regulation of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We combine zzso data for reaction rate zzso for the zzso zzso binding to zzso operator and in zzso data of a number of zzso zzso zzso that bind to the zzso The model of repression presented in this report greatly differs from previous mathematical zzso One, two or three zzso can bind to the operator and repress the zzso Moreover, reaction rates for detachment of zzso from the operator strongly depend on zzso zzso zzso since zzso can also bind to the zzso complex and stabilize zzso From the mathematical modeling and analysis of reaction rates and equilibrium zzso emerges a zzso accurate and effective module of zzso zzso This genetic switch responds accurately to fast consumption of zzso from the interior of a zzso It switches with minimal zzso when the concentration of zzso drops below a thousand molecules per zzso
