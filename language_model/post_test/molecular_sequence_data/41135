zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are a new class of zzso that selectively target insect zzso receptors zzso a distinct class of zzso calcium release channels which play a pivotal role in calcium zzso in numerous cell zzso Resistance to these zzso has recently been reported in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a global zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the present study a region of the gene zzso the proposed zzso binding site of the zzso from zzso collected from the Philippines and Thailand and found to be over zzso resistant to both zzso and zzso compared to susceptible zzso were amplified by zzso and zzso zzso of the sequence with those from several susceptible reference strains revealed zzso zzso in each of the resistant strains that in both cases lead to a zzso to zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso The independent evolution of the same zzso acid substitution within a highly zzso region of the proposed zzso binding site in two geographically separated resistant strains of zzso strongly suggests a zzso association with zzso zzso zzso we designed a zzso diagnostic zzso for resistance monitoring purposes that can be used to detect the zzso zzso in zzso samples of zzso zzso The implications of the reported findings for resistance management strategies are zzso
