A zzso zzso library was generated to identify genes involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was isolated by negative selection using an zzso separation technique with specific zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was inserted in an ORF, called zzso which zzso a protein of unknown zzso The zzso prevented the zzso of zzso as well as two genes located zzso which are designated zzso and zzso and which form the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso revealed that both proteins possessed the classic zzso motif zzso of zzso bacterial surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were generated in zzso coli and used to produce zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso but not zzso zzso specifically recognized zzso zzso zzso Our results suggested that the zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso zzso one of which, zzso was associated with the zzso
