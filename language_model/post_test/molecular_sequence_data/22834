Bone mineral density zzso the major factor determining bone strength, is closely related to zzso fracture risk and is determined largely by multiple genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso a recently described member of the zzso family, has been shown to play a critical role in the zzso of zzso that share zzso with zzso zzso and thus might contribute to zzso zzso In the present study, we directly zzso the zzso gene in 24 Korean individuals, and identified 15 sequence zzso Five zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected and zzso in zzso Korean women zzso zzso zzso together with measurement of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso spine and the zzso zzso zzso using zzso X-ray zzso We found that zzso of the zzso gene were associated with the zzso of the zzso spine and zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso G and zzso zzso G were associated with low zzso of the zzso neck zzso zzso zzso and zzso spine zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also showed an association with risk of zzso fracture zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Our results suggest that variations in zzso may play a role in decreased zzso and risk of zzso zzso
