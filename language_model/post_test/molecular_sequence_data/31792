We used zzso engineering to investigate the relationships between structure and linkage specificity of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and to generate zzso with altered zzso zzso and structural analysis of zzso family 70 zzso led to eight zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso being targeted, zzso by zzso zzso and simultaneously zzso zzso of two libraries totaling zzso clones allowed the isolation of a zzso zzso 81 zzso which zzso high molecular weight zzso with different proportions of zzso linkages ranging from 3 to 20 zzso zzso sequence analysis, zzso characterization and molecular zzso studies revealed the previously unknown role of zzso zzso in zzso linkage zzso This zzso sequence together with zzso zzso contribute to defining zzso zzso zzso which may be critical for the zzso zzso
