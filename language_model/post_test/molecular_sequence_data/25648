The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso change and zzso leakage of contents from large zzso zzso zzso when in a zzso zzso The zzso of this process have been investigated over a wide range of pH and zzso and zzso zzso Leakage from zzso zzso is rapidly initiated zzso 2 zzso when the pH is lowered below 6 and is rapidly terminated when the pH is raised to zzso The leakage shows a selectivity to the size of the zzso molecules and occurs by an all or none zzso zzso either leak or retain all of their zzso Using this experimental data, we have developed a mathematical description of the zzso of leakage induced by zzso This model assumes that zzso becomes incorporated into the zzso zzso and zzso to form a zzso Leakage occurs when a critical number of peptides assemble into a zzso zzso in the zzso Leakage zzso generated at zzso ratios ranging from zzso to zzso can be well described by this zzso On the basis of the results and the model, we suggest that zzso forms a zzso channel composed of 8-12 zzso The channel diameter ranges from 5 to 10 zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that can predict the leakage zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso induced by a zzso zzso The analysis may be of general use in defining the zzso and state of zzso of similarly acting peptides and proteins which form zzso zzso in zzso
