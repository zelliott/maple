A novel zzso technique for detecting correlated zzso acid positions in zzso protein families zzso zzso was developed, and applied to study zzso gating of zzso zzso Most contemporary methods for detecting zzso acid correlations within proteins use very large sets of data, typically zzso hundreds or thousands of zzso related zzso to overcome the relatively low zzso ratio in the analysis of zzso between pairs of zzso acid zzso Such methods are zzso for zzso zzso zzso channels and for many other protein families that have not yet been zzso to that zzso Here, we used a zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso channels to follow the evolutionary history of every pair of zzso acid positions within this family, thus increasing detection accuracy of correlated zzso acids relative to contemporary zzso In addition, we used a zzso procedure to eliminate correlations that were statistically zzso These and other measures allowed us to increase the zzso sensitivity, and opened the way to reliable identification of correlated positions even in zzso protein zzso zzso analysis applied to the set of correlated zzso acid positions in zzso channels detected a network of zzso zzso a large fraction of which were identified as zzso upon zzso zzso the network of correlated zzso onto the zzso structure of the zzso channel from zzso zzso disclosed correlations between zzso in the zzso paddle and the pore region, including regions that are involved in the gating zzso We discuss these findings with respect to the evolutionary constraints acting on the channel's various zzso The software is available on our zzso
