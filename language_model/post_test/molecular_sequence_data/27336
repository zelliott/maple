Terminal zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso are two zzso highly similar proteins involved in DNA processing and zzso Despite their high sequence identity, they differ widely in their activity: pol zzso has a zzso zzso activity, whereas zzso has a zzso zzso zzso first described when the zzso structure was zzso has been invoked as the major structural zzso of this zzso Here we describe attempts to transform zzso into pol zzso with the minimal number of zzso in and around zzso First we describe the effect of zzso on six different positions chosen to destabilize zzso zzso structure, either by zzso substitution or by zzso they result at most in a reduction of zzso activity, but adding zzso restores most of this zzso zzso However, a deletion of the entire zzso as in pol zzso does zzso a limited zzso zzso behavior to zzso while a zzso bearing an extended pol zzso zzso reproduces pol zzso zzso Finally, 16 additional zzso are reported, targeted at the two so-called zzso zzso regions located just after zzso or zzso Among them, the zzso zzso zzso displays a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is stable upon zzso zzso These results are discussed in light of the available crystal zzso
