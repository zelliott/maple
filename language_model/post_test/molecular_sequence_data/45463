Higher zzso contain a wide variety of repetitive DNA, although their functions often remain zzso We describe zzso zzso zzso copy number assessment, and zzso status of zzso and zzso repeat zzso in the buffalo zzso The zzso representing the zzso fragment, showed FISH signals in the zzso region of zzso zzso only, whereas zzso corresponding to zzso zzso detected signals in the zzso regions of all the zzso zzso studies of zzso and zzso with zzso DNA from different sources showed signals only in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis uncovered zzso and zzso copies of zzso and zzso fragments per the zzso zzso corresponding to 30 and 68 copies per zzso zzso Analysis of zzso from different zzso of buffalo with zzso zzso showed maximum expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso and liver, zzso zzso analysis of these sequences showed a close relationship between buffalo and zzso The prospect of this approach in comparative zzso is zzso
