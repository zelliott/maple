zzso zzso and protein content were examined during embryonic zzso in the rat zzso Content of total zzso zzso at day 6 of pregnancy increased relative to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso protein content of the zzso zzso was relatively decreased except in the region directly surrounding the zzso and this zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso zzso These changes are likely to reflect the degradation and subsequent zzso of the previously stable zzso zzso zzso in preparation for embryonic zzso zzso zzso V + zzso zzso were present in both the zzso and day 6 pregnant zzso with increased content of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso A + zzso zzso was distributed throughout the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and content of the zzso zzso increased by day 4 of pregnancy, zzso with zzso action on the zzso On day 6 of pregnancy, zzso zzso zzso the zzso and A regions were zzso localized to the zzso zone of the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zone was dependent upon zzso but the zzso was not zzso Thus, there are two major changes in zzso zzso gene expression as a result of zzso increased zzso zzso content and zzso zzso These changes suggest a key function for zzso in zzso and imply the operation of a regulatory program of zzso gene expression which depends on hormonal zzso and a zzso zzso
