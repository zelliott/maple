It has been previously observed that various zzso plasmids replicate zzso in zzso coli cells during the relaxed response to zzso acid zzso Here we develop a kinetic model to explain these observations based on the possibility of interaction of the 3' zzso sequence with the zzso triplets in zzso of zzso I and zzso II zzso by zzso zzso According to our model, when the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso I is possible, the replication of the zzso zzso is affected by differences in the concentration of various zzso in the starved cell, but it is not affected by the zzso concentration if the hypothetical pairing occurs between the zzso and zzso zzso Using the previously determined parameters for the zzso zzso the concentration of zzso zzso in the zzso acid starved relaxed strains and the assumed efficiency of binding of zzso and zzso I, we show that our model explains the differences in zzso copy number in the relaxed strain starved for several zzso zzso
