zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso binds zzso zzso and can be released from intact zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the nature of the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso and to assess the role of zzso in zzso assembly and function, we cloned the zzso gene zzso zzso We have shown that zzso is an essential zzso zzso A conditional zzso zzso in which the only copy of zzso is under control of the zzso zzso promoter was zzso zzso of zzso causes instability of newly zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso depleted of zzso no longer assemble zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is required for assembly of stable zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso particle not associated with zzso particles was detected by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This pool of zzso zzso remained stable even upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso assembly by depletion of another zzso zzso zzso zzso results suggest that zzso of zzso is not zzso regulated by zzso
