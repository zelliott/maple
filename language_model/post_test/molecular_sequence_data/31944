zzso also named zzso zzso is one of the earliest known zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis and it has been commonly used in zzso zzso We constructed a truncated version, zzso by removing 96 and 14 zzso acid zzso from the zzso and zzso respectively of the native zzso The native and the truncated zzso zzso proteins were expressed in zzso forms in zzso coli to levels of zzso and zzso of the total cell zzso zzso Both the zzso molecules reacted equally well with the zzso raised in rabbit against the native zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated through zzso against plasma samples from 160 culture positive tuberculosis patients and 40 healthy zzso With zzso zzso of the patient samples were detected positive for the zzso as compared to only zzso in the case of the native zzso Data for the secondary structures of the native and the truncated zzso as obtained by circular zzso agreed with the known 3-D structure of the native protein and the predicted structure of the truncated version, zzso The results show that the truncated zzso is more efficient as compared to the native zzso for use as a zzso zzso
