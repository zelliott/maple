zzso have been proposed as a promising treatment for zzso after zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso but their mechanism of action remains zzso Here, we investigated the effect of antioxidants on gene expression in the artery after balloon zzso We developed a sensitive zzso zzso protection zzso for the zzso zzso zzso levels of immediate early zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso growth zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso transforming growth zzso 1, and vascular zzso growth zzso New Zealand White rabbits were fed a zzso cholesterol diet containing vehicle, zzso or zzso and balloon zzso for zzso arteries was zzso The zzso arteries were then removed at 4 h after the zzso for zzso zzso and 10 days after for growth factors and zzso Both zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso compared with the zzso In terms of gene zzso zzso but not zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso but not zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso Neither treatment had any effect on the expression of other zzso These results suggest that antioxidants affect the gene expression of the zzso response and that both zzso and zzso inhibit gene expression in specific zzso
