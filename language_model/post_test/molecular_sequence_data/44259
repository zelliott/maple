zzso such as the zzso hormone zzso zzso bear zzso terminating with the sequence zzso zzso zzso and are rapidly removed from the circulation by a zzso present in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso Rapid removal from the circulation is essential for attaining zzso hormone activity in zzso We have isolated a protein from rat liver which has the properties expected for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso At least 12 peptides prepared from the zzso have zzso acid sequences that are identical to those of the zzso Nonetheless, the zzso binding properties of the zzso and the zzso differ in a number of zzso The zzso binds to immobilized zzso but not to immobilized zzso whereas the zzso binds to immobilized zzso but not to immobilized zzso When analyzed using a binding zzso that zzso zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso the zzso is able to bind zzso serum zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso is zzso In contrast both the zzso and the zzso are able to bind zzso zzso that inhibit binding of zzso by the zzso enhance binding by the zzso zzso terminating with zzso and those terminating with Man are bound at independent sites on the zzso The zzso present in zzso zzso cells may account for clearance of zzso bearing zzso terminating with zzso and zzso bearing zzso terminating with either zzso zzso or zzso
