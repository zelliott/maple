The zzso for the full-length zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and an alternatively spliced transcript with a deletion of zzso 5 zzso beta delta 5) was cloned from pig zzso zzso protection zzso revealed that zzso beta zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso and early, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso beta delta 5 transcripts were shown by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction to be expressed at a ratio of approximately zzso in zzso cells, small, zzso and large zzso zzso and zzso phase zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso beta proteins corresponding to the size of in zzso translated zzso beta and zzso beta delta 5 were detected by zzso zzso zzso beta was detected in zzso small, zzso and large zzso zzso and zzso phase zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso beta delta 5 zzso bands were abundant only in zzso cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso beta delta 5 had no effect on zzso zzso of an zzso reporter construct but did repress zzso zzso beta zzso when zzso at zzso excess zzso No repression of zzso alpha zzso was zzso In primary zzso cell cultures, zzso zzso beta delta 5 zzso did not inhibit zzso reporter zzso zzso beta delta 5 was shown by zzso to zzso to the nucleus in zzso zzso zzso In zzso translated zzso beta delta 5 proteins bound zzso response elements in DNA in zzso mobility shift zzso as indicated by zzso zzso zzso beta is abundant in zzso zzso and a naturally occurring zzso zzso missing zzso 5 may have biological zzso
