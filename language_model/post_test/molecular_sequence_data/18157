A collagen zzso is made up of long zzso molecules regularly zzso with respect to one zzso This means that zzso its zzso projected fine structure, resolvable to approximately 2 zzso in electron zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso 67 zzso and zzso the zzso acid zzso contributing to each element of the fine structure can be zzso from sequence zzso zzso data from a zzso zzso can can therefore be correlated directly with chemical zzso Such correlations confirm the zzso nature of the zzso reaction when a zzso is positively zzso After negative zzso the principal factor determining the small-scale distribution of stain is local exclusion by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is the average zzso area, or zzso of a zzso A small superimposed positive zzso contribution can also be zzso zzso of collagen by zzso and zzso occurs via an initial reaction with zzso (and zzso zzso and zzso groups, followed by secondary zzso reactions that differ from zzso to zzso These secondary reactions determine the nature and abundance of the zzso and the extent to which they influence subsequent zzso zzso
