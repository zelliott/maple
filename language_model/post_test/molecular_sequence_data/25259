In humans, zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso as an obligatory constituent of zzso zzso zzso is identical to the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of zzso and is translated from an edited zzso zzso in which zzso zzso has been converted from zzso zzso to what is recognized as a premature stop zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso editing in fact converts zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso we incubated a synthetic zzso zzso containing zzso zzso in an in zzso editing system prepared from rabbit zzso The in zzso edited zzso was zzso and zzso to zzso zzso which were analyzed on two-dimensional zzso zzso We found that the edited base zzso with authentic zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is converted to zzso most likely by a zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso editing occurs in cell lines that do not zzso zzso we zzso zzso a high expression zzso containing 354 base pairs of zzso sequence into 18 different cell zzso We found zzso zzso editing activity in five zzso cell lines and one zzso cell line, none of which zzso any zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso editing occurs in cell lines that do not zzso zzso which suggests that zzso editing may be a common biological phenomenon in zzso zzso
