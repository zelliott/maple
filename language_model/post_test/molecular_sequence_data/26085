Although zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in rabbit kidney extract was zzso protein zzso toward rabbit zzso kidney zzso zzso and zzso that zzso with fragments of human and pig zzso zzso were detected distinctly in the rabbit zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the rabbit kidney zzso library by zzso with a zzso of human zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence revealed a zzso zzso sequence zzso a protein consisted of 347 zzso zzso The number of zzso acid zzso was identical with those of human and pig zzso and the zzso acid sequence showed 80 and zzso identity with pig and human zzso zzso zzso that zzso with zzso DNA zzso also existed in rabbit zzso and their sizes were the same as those of the zzso detected with the human and pig zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was hardly zzso by an in zzso expression zzso However, a zzso zzso lacking most of the zzso region and its zzso containing base changes around the initiation zzso did direct protein zzso Moreover, the protein derived from the partial zzso zzso containing a large part of the coding region sequence showed zzso toward zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that one of the causes of the very poor synthesis of zzso protein in rabbit kidney is zzso suppression in the synthetic zzso
