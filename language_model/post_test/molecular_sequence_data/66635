zzso proteins are essential components of zzso and contribute to the zzso repression of zzso genes via the recruitment to specific promoters by zzso proteins including zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts in the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which defines redundant negative regulators of a Ras signaling cascade required for zzso zzso Several zzso genes zzso for zzso proteins involved in zzso regulation, including zzso and components of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso physically interacts in zzso and in zzso with the multiple zinc finger protein zzso another member of the zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso motif found in many zzso proteins mediates zzso binding to the zzso of zzso We further show by in zzso zzso studies that zzso is required for zzso recruitment in nuclear zzso Our data suggest that the zzso complex may physically link a subset of the zzso related zzso proteins to zzso
