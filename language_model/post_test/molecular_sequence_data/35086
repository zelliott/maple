A significant part of horizontal gene transfer is facilitated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso island zzso is an archetype of a zzso island that accounts for pandemic spread of antibiotics zzso zzso has modular structure and harbors zzso involved in type IV zzso and zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso encodes a functional type IV zzso system; however, other zzso have not been characterized zzso Here we show that the module on the zzso zzso of zzso consists of 15 genes that are well zzso in a number of related zzso zzso zzso by zzso six genes of the investigated module of zzso by zzso zzso we demonstrate that in addition to type IV zzso system zzso the investigated module is also important for the successful zzso transfer of zzso from donor to recipient zzso
