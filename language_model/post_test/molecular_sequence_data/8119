In 1995, there will be zzso new cases of lung cancer diagnosed and zzso deaths from this disease in the United zzso While the zzso of the disease process is poorly zzso a growing body of evidence suggests that abnormalities in cellular regulatory genes may play an important role in the zzso maintenance and/or progression of some tumor zzso These genes include both growth promoting zzso as well as growth zzso or zzso zzso Included among these genetic sequences are several cellular zzso zzso A group of these factors including zzso zzso and zzso are members of a class of genes known as immediate early genes whose expression are zzso by a variety of stimuli including zzso and differentiation inducing growth factors, indicating a potential important role for these genes in normal growth zzso Since these genes are involved in early regulation of cellular growth properties and at least two zzso and zzso can act as zzso we wished to determine whether their expression levels were altered in human zzso cell lung zzso zzso compared to normal lung zzso To address this, Northern zzso analyses were performed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso extracted from 101 zzso tumor specimens and adjacent zzso lung zzso Analysis of this cohort revealed that zzso of the normal zzso demonstrate significantly greater expression of these zzso factors as compared to adjacent zzso zzso Moreover, this expression pattern appeared to be coordinate for all three genes in the majority of zzso This differential expression pattern was confirmed at the protein level using an zzso approach with zzso directed against the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Southern zzso analyses demonstrated no gross zzso of these sequences at the DNA level, indicating that the observed differential expression pattern was not due to gross structural changes in the zzso These data suggest that zzso of these genes may be involved in the zzso of lung zzso
