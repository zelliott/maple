The families of zzso proteins are the most important growth factors in the zzso for growth and differentiation of early zzso zzso Three related zzso members of the transforming growth zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be essential for zzso growth and zzso The objective of the present study was to detect the zzso of zzso in zzso portion of zzso 15 gene in zzso and local Kashmir valley sheep zzso Blood samples were collected from 85 zzso and zzso DNA was extracted using the modified zzso zzso zzso The quantity and quality of extracted DNA was examined using zzso and gel zzso zzso A zzso with the size of zzso zzso was amplified using zzso chain reaction zzso with a pair of specific zzso The amplified zzso products were zzso with zzso restriction zzso In the presence of zzso at this zzso the zzso zzso cannot recognize the restriction zzso However, here in the absence of zzso the zzso recognizes one restriction site and divides the amplified zzso into two fragments of 152 and 204 zzso The zzso zzso zzso was also analyzed for zzso by zzso zzso The results indicated two different zzso patterns AA and AB for this zzso Later on two different zzso forms A and B were confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence was subjected to alignment analysis and it was observed that sequence similarity of this zzso with that of other sheep and zzso zzso goat was more than zzso zzso analysis revealed that both designated A and B zzso as well as published sequence of sheep form a common cluster indicating their evolutionary zzso The origin of zzso zzso goat was located some distance away from the zzso The overall zzso of AA and AB zzso were zzso and zzso The breed wise zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso sheep and the zzso in Kashmir valley sheep were zzso and zzso for AA and AB zzso zzso The overall zzso zzso of A and B zzso were zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso sheep was zzso and zzso and that of Kashmir valley sheep were zzso and zzso
