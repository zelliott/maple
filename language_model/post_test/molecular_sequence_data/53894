We previously reported the cloning of a human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the properties of zzso zzso remain poorly zzso The preparation zzso using zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of rabbit liver zzso zzso In addition, the zzso shows zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso to apparent zzso zzso from zzso cells by sequential zzso of zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The final preparation showed a specific content of zzso zzso of zzso of zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso was distinguished from the closely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by its much higher zzso for zzso inability to zzso zzso zzso and extreme zzso
