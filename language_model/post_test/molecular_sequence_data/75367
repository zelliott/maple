zzso transfer zzso zzso analysis was used to perform the physical characterization of the transcript expressed in zzso sensory nerve zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso virus type zzso Most of this zzso transcript zzso was isolated in the zzso fraction from zzso A smaller zzso species was also detected at less than zzso the abundance of the major zzso zzso was not detected with zzso from DNA outside the limits of the larger zzso In zzso zzso data correlated well with Northern zzso zzso however, low levels of zzso were seen with zzso immediately outside the region of viral DNA giving positive Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso and primer extension mapping were used to locate the zzso end of the zzso 510 bases to the left of a zzso site at zzso map zzso The 3' end of the major zzso species was mapped to just within a zzso zzso zzso located zzso to 970 base pairs to the right of the zzso site at zzso map zzso These data were correlated with an analysis of the sequence of the DNA zzso this transcript and its possible function in the zzso phase of zzso
