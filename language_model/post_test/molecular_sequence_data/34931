zzso zzso is the only known zzso that zzso the formation of zzso a zzso involved in most anabolic reactions and in the zzso defense zzso Despite its importance, very little is known regarding the mechanism of zzso and only recently have several zzso zzso structures been deposited in the zzso Here, an independent investigation of the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein from zzso zzso is reported at a resolution of zzso zzso The crystal structure was solved using zzso anomalous zzso zzso data collected at the zzso zzso wavelength in a state in which no zzso or zzso were zzso It revealed that the zzso protein is folded into two distinct zzso similar to recently reported zzso zzso The zzso zzso spans the first 100 zzso acids and the last 30 zzso acids of the zzso and has several zzso matches in the zzso whereas the other domain, which spans the middle 130 zzso adopts a unique zzso architecture and only appreciably matches the recently deposited zzso structures of zzso zzso
