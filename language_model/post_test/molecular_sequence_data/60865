zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a single zzso cluster coordinated by three zzso (at positions 11, 17, and zzso and one zzso zzso (at position zzso In this study, the zzso zzso and functional consequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso The four zzso zzso each contain a potential cluster coordination sphere of one zzso and three zzso zzso with zzso zzso at each of the four zzso sites of the zzso zzso All five zzso were expressed in zzso coli, and each contained a zzso cluster as shown by zzso zzso and resonance zzso studies of the oxidized protein and zzso and zzso magnetic circular zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso zzso Changes in both the zzso and resonance zzso zzso are consistent with changing from complete zzso cluster zzso in the zzso zzso to three zzso and one zzso zzso in each of the four zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies show distinctive ground and excited state properties for the zzso zzso centers in each of these zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso having homogeneous S zzso zzso ground states and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso having zzso S zzso zzso and zzso ground zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 23 degrees zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso were unchanged compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within experimental error, but the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were more negative by 49 and 78 zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso indicate the presence of a zzso zzso zzso pair in all five zzso the zzso zzso are interpreted in terms of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso pair in zzso Only the zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso potential over the range of zzso and this is attributed to zzso of the zzso zzso to the reduced cluster zzso zzso zzso All five zzso had similar zzso and zzso values in a coupled zzso in which zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and oxidized by zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso from zzso zzso zzso the mode of zzso at each zzso atom in the zzso cluster appears to have little effect on the interaction and the electron transfer between zzso and zzso
