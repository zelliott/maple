The zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso in the center of each zzso but are divergent in the zzso and zzso zzso The structure of zzso has been extensively characterized by zzso studies, whereas little is as yet known specifically about the structure of zzso To characterize the zzso zzso we performed a zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso of the fully functional first zzso (99 zzso of the zzso zzso We found that deletion of zzso 8 through 33 in the zzso zzso drastically reduced zzso activity, whereas deletion of zzso 8 through 47 largely abolished zzso zzso We also analyzed zzso proteins in which the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins were exchanged precisely at the first zzso in the zzso zzso Both zzso proteins possessed very low levels of zzso activity, indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are not zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were analyzed and zzso acid 90 at the end of the basic domain was found to be at or near the limit of zzso zzso that can be deleted without abolishing zzso zzso A zzso zzso truncated after zzso 84 within the basic domain was found to be a zzso zzso able to inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the results of zzso suggested that deletions in the zzso zzso zzso can reduce protein zzso
