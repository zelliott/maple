A novel zzso zzso zzso element, designated zzso was found on the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was located between the origin of replication and the zzso transport gene zzso The zzso pair zzso zzso was flanked by zzso perfect zzso zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso of 296 zzso zzso An almost identical zzso element zzso DNA sequence zzso was cloned and partially zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso perfect zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that in 12 zzso strains zzso zzso was present with copy numbers ranging from 1 to at least zzso zzso displayed sequence zzso to the putative IS element zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not related to other known zzso sequences and may represent a new family of IS zzso
