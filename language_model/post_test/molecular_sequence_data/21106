zzso proteins are crucial for membrane fusion in zzso zzso To ensure efficient and accurate fusion, zzso need to be sorted into different budding zzso This process is usually regulated by specific recognition between zzso and their zzso zzso How different pairs of zzso and zzso achieve their recognition is zzso Here, we report the recognition between zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso derived from three crystal zzso Surprisingly, this zzso pair zzso interacts through a distinct binding site compared to their zzso zzso in zzso An opposite surface on zzso domain binds to a zzso area on the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso in zzso pull-down and in zzso experiments indicate this binding interface is important for correct zzso of zzso in the zzso This previously zzso discovery that a cargo and zzso pair uses different binding sites across species suggests the diversity of zzso recognition in zzso zzso
