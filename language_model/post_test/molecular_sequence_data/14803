zzso zzso is usually of adult zzso can be zzso and frequently involves the cervical zzso Our goal was to identify the zzso zzso in a family with adult zzso primary cervical zzso 

zzso and zzso analyses were combined with zzso zzso capture and zzso parallel sequencing in a large Caucasian pedigree with adult zzso primary cervical zzso to identify a zzso zzso zzso screening and zzso sequencing were completed in 308 Caucasians with familial or sporadic adult onset cervical zzso and matching controls for sequence zzso in this zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing led to the identification of an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 7 of zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso zinc finger protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zinc finger protein expressed in brain and involved in DNA synthesis and zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we showed that zzso altered zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also altered the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso in subjects with zzso cervical zzso identified 2 additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso in zzso may cause adult zzso primary cervical zzso possibly by zzso zzso abnormalities that manifest in adults and/or zzso zzso zzso in the mature central nervous zzso
