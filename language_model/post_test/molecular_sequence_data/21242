In many bacteria, including zzso zzso progression from the zzso to the stationary phase is accompanied by conversion of most of bacterial membrane zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by human zzso also zzso the conversion of most bacterial PG to zzso The zzso of all zzso strains of zzso zzso contains two open reading frames zzso predicting proteins zzso with zzso identity to the principal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso To test whether these zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and contribute to zzso zzso in zzso zzso we expressed these proteins in a zzso strain of zzso coli and created zzso single and double zzso in zzso zzso The expression of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso coli resulted in zzso zzso in the stationary zzso zzso zzso with deletion of both zzso and zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso in the stationary phase or after zzso by zzso zzso zzso in the stationary phase was due almost solely to zzso whereas both zzso and zzso contributed to zzso zzso following zzso by zzso zzso in the relative contributions of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso under different triggering conditions suggest differences in the role and regulation of these two zzso
