zzso 4 zzso is a zzso zzso of 37 zzso acids zzso zzso isolated from the skin of zzso zzso It has shown a broad spectrum zzso activity in zzso against zzso and -positive bacteria, zzso and zzso To understand its mechanism of zzso action, we examined the effect of zzso on the membrane zzso and the electrical properties of zzso pores in zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso Natural and synthetic zzso zzso zzso increased the membrane zzso in a zzso manner, but zzso zzso an zzso zzso of the zzso with little zzso activity, failed to increase the zzso At symmetrical 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso of about 120 zzso were frequently zzso Their zzso relations were linear and open state probabilities were close to 1, but longer closing events were seen more frequently at negative zzso In addition, zzso pores were selective for zzso over zzso the zzso ratio of zzso to zzso being zzso 1 in neutral and 7: 1 in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso forms zzso and zzso pores in zzso zzso zzso The zzso property of zzso is likely to contribute to its zzso zzso
