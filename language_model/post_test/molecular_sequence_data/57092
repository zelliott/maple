zzso zzso peptides are potent growth factors that bind to G zzso zzso Although short-term signals activated by zzso receptors have been extensively zzso relatively little is known about zzso signal zzso We investigated the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso signaling in zzso zzso cells and the role of protein zzso C zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso increases in zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks increments in zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unable to increase zzso or zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso signaling occurs through an ETA zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with both zzso zzso and depletion demonstrate that zzso was necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso of cellular proteins in zzso zzso cells that was blocked by zzso with zzso zzso Two chemically and mechanistically dissimilar zzso zzso zzso A and zzso blocked zzso zzso by zzso In addition, zzso A attenuated zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso directed by an zzso zzso in response to zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso signaling by zzso also involves a zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso That the zzso relationship for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar suggests that these events might be functionally zzso Thus, zzso between G zzso receptors and zzso zzso such as zzso might be involved in zzso regulation and zzso signaling by zzso
