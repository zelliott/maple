A family of zzso molecules was recently described in animals and zzso possessing extensive coiled regions and a short zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso domain, called the zzso domain, which is responsible for their location to this zzso Using the model plant zzso zzso we identified a gene zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso domain from zzso functions as a zzso sequence in plant zzso zzso studies in living cells expressing the zzso fused to a zzso fluorescent probe, showed extensive zzso with the zzso marker zzso I in transformed tobacco zzso zzso sequences were also found in zzso databases of rice, zzso wheat and zzso suggesting that this domain may be a useful zzso marker for zzso zzso Despite low sequence identity amongst zzso zzso the plant zzso sequence was able to target to the zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso domain proteins might be implicated in a targeting mechanism that is zzso amongst zzso
