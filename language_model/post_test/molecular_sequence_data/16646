zzso dynamics is an important factor in cell proliferation and one of the main targets of cancer zzso Since zzso proteins zzso are known to influence zzso stability, study of zzso may contribute both to knowledge of cancer cell biology and to the production of new zzso zzso In this study, we identified a new mouse gene which is a zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso by differential display zzso The level of expression of mouse zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso cells expressing zzso with a multiple zzso zzso zzso 2A or zzso zzso than in parental zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso protein is localized in zzso with a zzso appearance, and is zzso with zzso throughout the cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in cells appeared to stabilize zzso against treatment with zzso a zzso zzso In addition, levels of human zzso were increased in some human tumor cell lines zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a new zzso with zzso properties and may represent a new molecular target for cancer zzso
