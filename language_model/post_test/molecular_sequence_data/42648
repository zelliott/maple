Different zzso DNA samples and primer sequences were evaluated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for rapid identification of zzso zzso zzso DNA and heated zzso cell zzso of bacterial cultures from gastric zzso were tested with three primer sets for unique internal zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were quick to prepare but more frequently gave unexpected variable or negative zzso results than zzso performed on zzso DNA, which were highly specific and zzso for all three primer zzso zzso indicated that sensitivity of the zzso was linked to the size of the amplified target region rather than any particular strain feature, with the small zzso zzso zzso product providing more accurate zzso with zzso of zzso zzso We strongly recommend that negative results in any zzso zzso should be checked on zzso DNA to exclude the possibility of a zzso zzso
