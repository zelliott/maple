By searching a zzso expressed sequence tag database and by comparing the retrieved data with zzso sequences from a DNA database, we identified an expressed zzso zzso putative major intrinsic protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso contains an open reading frame coding for a zzso protein named zzso It possesses zzso zzso zzso but is not highly zzso to known zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and zzso for water and zzso transport zzso By the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not enhance the zzso water zzso of membrane zzso of the zzso zzso However, the zzso cells showed zzso transport activity in the in zzso zzso using zzso This is the first report on the isolation and functional identification of a zzso member from zzso
