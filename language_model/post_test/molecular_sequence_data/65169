To zzso a novel strain of zzso zzso type zzso zzso type zzso involved in an epidemic zzso zzso outbreak in zzso city using zzso testing and sequence analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso test zzso was performed in zzso plates containing a zzso zzso of zzso cells using 100 tissue culture infectious doses of virus and type specific zzso The zzso zzso test was also carried out in zzso plates with rat zzso using four zzso units of virus and twofold zzso of zzso The zzso gene was zzso by generating overlapping zzso chain reaction products or by direct sequencing of zzso zzso zzso selection was based on alignment of the zzso genes of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso available from Gene zzso 

The virus strain was specifically zzso by zzso zzso although there was a major zzso with zzso zzso zzso was equally inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of the zzso regions zzso of the zzso zzso gene showed higher zzso with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso was more zzso to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso 

zzso is a unique strain of zzso because of its lower zzso zzso with zzso major zzso with zzso in zzso and mixed genetic zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso These factors may have enabled the virus to circumvent acquired zzso resulting in the zzso
