The bacterial zzso zzso encodes two zzso the zzso and a related zzso the zzso zzso whose relative abundance zzso in part, the frequency of zzso zzso The synthesis of these proteins is programmed by a complex set of genetic regulatory zzso The host DNA zzso function, zzso zzso zzso promoter recognition and indirectly enhances the zzso inhibitor zzso The inhibitor lacks the zzso 55 zzso acids of the zzso suggesting that this sequence plays a key role in the zzso zzso An intact zzso sequence is required for the zzso recognition of the zzso end DNA zzso This is the first critical step in the zzso zzso zzso DNA interaction is itself regulated by an intricate series of reactions involving several host zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is a unique protein in that it acts primarily in zzso and zzso its own activity in zzso Models to explain these properties are zzso Finally circumstantial evidence suggests that zzso occurs zzso from newly zzso DNA that has yet to be zzso to progeny zzso This timing of zzso is likely to have a selective advantage for the host and the zzso zzso
