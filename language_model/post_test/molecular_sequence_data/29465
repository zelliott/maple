zzso zzso gene zzso 1, the main zzso target in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is a member of a new zzso of zinc finger proteins zzso the tumor zzso candidate zzso (also called zzso or lost on transformation 1) and zzso In this report, we show that zzso cells zzso zzso or zzso display the typical markers of zzso transformation: zzso the cells lose zzso contact zzso zzso show zzso zzso and zzso are able to induce tumors in nude zzso In contrast, zzso has been shown to prevent the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and zzso This difference in function is also reflected in their DNA zzso as we show here that the three zzso zzso although highly zzso in their zzso domain, bind different DNA sequences in a distinct zzso Interestingly, the zzso and zzso transformation is accompanied by a drastic zzso of zzso growth zzso which we prove is a target of zzso and zzso This strongly suggests that the zzso capacity of zzso and zzso is zzso at least partly by zzso the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso
