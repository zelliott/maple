The genes zzso zzso zzso proteins constitute a large family in higher zzso To zzso the functional roles of these types of zzso four different members of the gene family were cloned from zzso by zzso zzso One was identical to the already reported gene zzso and three were as yet unidentified zzso then designated zzso zzso zzso protein 1), zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso proteins contain two zzso zzso zzso zzso separated by a long zzso Three zzso regions, named zzso zzso and zzso were also recognized outside the zzso zzso as in other members of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso These four genes were positioned on the same branch of a zzso tree constructed based on the zzso motif zzso suggesting their structural and functional zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that all four genes were mainly expressed in roots and at different levels in other zzso zzso of the four genes responded to water zzso zzso treatment resulted in elevated levels of expression of all of these zzso zzso treatment increased the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso Only zzso expression was strongly induced by zzso treatment, where the time course of the induction was similar to that caused by high zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso zone of the roots under the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all involved in the zzso response in an zzso or zzso zzso to regulate downstream zzso
