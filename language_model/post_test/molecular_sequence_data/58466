The outer arm zzso of sea zzso zzso zzso contains three intermediate chains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso family; the zzso motif is responsible for a zzso zzso We describe here the molecular cloning of zzso zzso has a unique primary structure, the zzso part is zzso to the sequence of zzso the middle part consists of three repetitive sequences zzso to the sequence of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso part contains a high proportion of zzso charged zzso acid zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso intermediate chain distinct from zzso and zzso and may be a zzso zzso The zzso part of zzso is more closely related to those of two zzso zzso light chains than zzso zzso were prepared against the zzso and middle zzso of zzso expressed as zzso proteins in zzso These zzso zzso with some zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso related zzso We propose here that the three intermediate chains are the basic core units of zzso outer arm zzso because of their ubiquitous zzso The zzso zzso part of zzso and outer arm zzso from sea zzso and zzso related species were specifically bound to and zzso from a zzso oxide affinity column with zzso indicating that they contain zzso zzso competent to undergo zzso zzso
