zzso zzso between zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was examined in zzso The individual genes from these species were cloned on different compatible plasmids or amplified by zzso and brought together to yield zzso combinations without extraneous zzso The beta zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso form active zzso only with alpha zzso from one of these zzso All other combinations yield active zzso The lack of activity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso with the alpha zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso results from a lack of zzso This was shown by in zzso competition in which these beta zzso were zzso in comparison with the beta and alpha of zzso zzso No reduction in light was zzso Overall, the in zzso results parallel those found in zzso using isolated zzso zzso and zzso by removal of the zzso
