The two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso crystal are zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso These crystal protein genes are located in an zzso Western analysis zzso demonstrated that the zzso promoter activity was located in the region upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed only when the upstream promoter region was zzso The crystal protein genes are the only zzso in the zzso and they are expressed during zzso with the highest transcript levels detected early in zzso zzso to 3 h after the onset of zzso zzso zzso from two adjacent sites located 84 and 85 bases upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso crystal protein gene zzso promoter aligned with other crystal protein gene zzso which are activated from early to zzso and transcribed in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso
