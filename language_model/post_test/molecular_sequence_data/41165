zzso strains zzso and zzso were isolated from the subsurface of a nuclear legacy waste site where the sediments are zzso with large amounts of zzso zzso metal zzso and other heavy zzso A combination of zzso and genetic zzso indicated that these strains represent the first member of the zzso zzso shown to be capable of complete zzso zzso of strain zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso 3-5 zzso long and zzso zzso in zzso The zzso were zzso zzso and had temperature and pH zzso for growth of 30 zzso and pH zzso they were able to tolerate up to zzso zzso although growth improved in its zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained fatty acid and zzso zzso zzso profiles that are characteristic features of the zzso zzso Although strains zzso and zzso shared high zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso between these strains were substantially below the zzso threshold used to designate novel zzso Thus, based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso differences, strains zzso and zzso are considered to represent a single novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
