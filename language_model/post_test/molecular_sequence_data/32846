This study investigates white spot syndrome virus zzso gene expression levels in the cells of 2 hosts zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and expressed sequence tag zzso analysis of the zzso profiles in zzso zzso zzso cells were used to identify zzso genes that were very highly zzso zzso showed that the zzso of the zzso zzso gene consistently had the highest copy number of all zzso higher than the major envelope zzso zzso At the protein level in zzso zzso zzso zzso gel analysis and liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso protein identification also showed that this zzso zzso protein has the highest expression levels reported to zzso zzso is capable of zzso and it becomes located in both the zzso and nucleus of the host zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important, but presently unknown, role during viral infection, and that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is potentially a good and zzso useful indicator of zzso zzso
