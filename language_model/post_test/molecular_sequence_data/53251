zzso in the zzso gene lead to an zzso dominant disorder, multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso which is characterized by tumors of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protein zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso resides primarily in the nucleus and binds to the zzso factor zzso resulting in the repression of zzso zzso We report here a detailed characterization of the zzso zzso gene and its full-length zzso zzso transcript, zzso a zzso acid protein with zzso identity and zzso similarity to human zzso Of the 81 zzso zzso and zzso deletions reported in zzso patients, 72 occur in zzso that are identical in zzso suggesting the importance of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene maps 61 zzso from the top of linkage group 7 zzso a region that appears to show zzso zzso to the zzso zzso at human zzso A zzso zzso message is detected at all stages of zzso development zzso from zzso zzso to adult zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed ubiquitous distribution of zzso message in zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and early zzso zzso with relatively abundant expression in blood cell zzso (24 h post zzso and zzso zzso zzso h post zzso at later zzso zzso zzso binds both human and mouse zzso and zzso zzso transcription, indicating that the zzso ability of zzso is zzso zzso
