zzso zzso zzso is a class I zzso which houses its zzso active site in a zzso core that is defined by a zzso zzso binding zzso In addition, many zzso bear a unique zzso insert comprised of about 50 zzso acids located just upstream of the zzso zzso zzso The role of this zzso domain zzso remains zzso We hypothesized that this domain may be important for zzso recognition in zzso and/or zzso acid zzso We carried out a series of deletion zzso and zzso swaps within the zzso domain of zzso zzso Our results support that the zzso domain is critical for zzso but not required for editing zzso zzso analysis determined that deletion of the zzso primarily impacts zzso Because of its proximity to the zzso active site, we propose that this domain interacts with the zzso during zzso acid zzso and/or zzso zzso Although the zzso domain does not appear to be important to the editing complex, it remains possible that it aids the dynamic zzso process that moves zzso from the zzso to the editing zzso
