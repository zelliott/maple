zzso by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso markedly increased the frequency of zzso of a zzso zzso The formation of zzso colonies presumably occurs by zzso zzso between the zzso repeats in zzso zzso generated by the zzso of zzso The responsible zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and is located near the zzso zzso zzso function, zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso The absence of a distinctive zzso site is consistent with a poor translation of zzso from an expression zzso in zzso Placement of a zzso site before zzso resulted in the extensive synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso precise zzso in zzso or zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso was active in zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso activity of zzso was directly involved in the zzso We have constructed a zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso did not appear to restrict dramatically the ability of zzso to grow zzso or to form zzso Thus, the role of zzso in the physiology of zzso remains to be zzso
