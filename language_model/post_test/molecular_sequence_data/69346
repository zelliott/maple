Many of the zzso protein zzso genes in both bacterial and zzso zzso occur, for reasons not yet zzso in zzso that include zzso zzso Here we report such an zzso organization in a zzso zzso zzso involving the genes for four zzso that are important in the zzso function of the zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso for zzso of aromatic zzso acids and cell wall zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein which is 52, 60, and zzso identical to two zzso (both zzso zzso and a higher plant zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was zzso in zzso coli, and the gene product was shown to zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso it also zzso an zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso of 237 and 141 zzso acid zzso respectively, also with high sequence identities to the corresponding zzso sequences from other zzso and higher plant zzso The gene order is shown to be: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern and Northern zzso analyses of zzso DNA and zzso respectively, revealed a single cluster of these genes per zzso which is transcribed from a common promoter to an unusually long, approximately zzso zzso Several zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso genes were made and expressed in zzso coli to examine the mechanisms for their very differential expression from a zzso zzso zzso four copies zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso These results present the first zzso genetic evidence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
