zzso zzso may exist in solution both as zzso and zzso but zzso that form strong zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso have been found, thus far, only in zzso of the snake family zzso The complete zzso acid sequences of a basic zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso (American zzso water zzso zzso have been determined by protein sequencing methods as part of a search for aspects of structure contributing to formation of stable zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and both have the seven zzso zzso extension characteristic of the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, it is clear that the extension is not a prerequisite for zzso Studies to date have revealed two characteristic features of zzso zzso that exist in solution as strong zzso One is the presence in the zzso of a zzso sequence at position 112 and 113 which just precedes the seven zzso zzso extension zzso zzso The other is a low zzso zzso only the zzso zzso zzso have been observed, thus far, to form stable zzso zzso alone or together, may be necessary, though not sufficient conditions for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regarding zzso interactions based upon zzso data are evaluated relative to the new sequence information on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso
