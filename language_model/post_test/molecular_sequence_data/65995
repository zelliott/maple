To construct a zzso zzso zzso interference zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso and to obtain the zzso of the zzso stock for investigating the expression in the zzso cells and the effect on the zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso 

Two complimentary zzso of small interference zzso zzso with hairpin structures targeting the zzso gene and a negative control were zzso then zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were then zzso with viral packaging mix into zzso cells, viral zzso was harvested to determine the zzso zzso cells infected by virus were harvested and the expression of zzso zzso activity and zzso were detected by reverse zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso 

zzso data showed that the constructed plasmids contained the correct sequences of zzso zzso transcript zzso A zzso producing cell line zzso was established, and the zzso for zzso was zzso zzso and zzso flow zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso expression construct could suppress the expression of zzso and zzso activity and induce zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso gene was successfully constructed, which decreased the expression of zzso and zzso activity effectively and induced zzso It has set up a research platform for the gene therapy of tumors which take zzso as the zzso
