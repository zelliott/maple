The tad locus of zzso zzso encodes a molecular transport system required for zzso zzso adherence to surfaces and formation of extremely strong zzso This locus is dedicated to the zzso of zzso zzso which are required for colonization and zzso We have previously shown that 11 of the 14 tad locus genes are required for adherence and zzso zzso zzso Here, we present genetic and zzso analyses of zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso We show that zzso predicted to zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso In contrast, targeted zzso zzso of zzso a gene closely related to the zzso gene zzso did not abrogate zzso zzso zzso studies did not detect zzso protein under standard laboratory zzso We present zzso data showing that there is no significant evidence for natural selection in the available zzso sequences from zzso zzso suggesting that zzso does not play a significant role in the biology of this zzso zzso with insertions at the 3' end of zzso formed zzso equivalent to zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso end zzso zzso zzso in zzso were obtained only when a zzso copy of the zzso gene was provided in trans or when the zzso zzso system was zzso Together, our results strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso is essential in the context of a functional tad zzso These data show three different zzso for the three zzso
