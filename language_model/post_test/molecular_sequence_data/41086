The gene zzso encodes a predicted major zzso zzso protein suggested to play a role in export of zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso It is zzso however, how the zzso protein zzso may influence zzso sensitivity and zzso of the wheat pathogen zzso zzso In this study, we establish a role for zzso in toxin zzso and sensitivity as well as in zzso toward zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso are reduced in zzso and result in decreased zzso zzso when zzso on wheat compared with the zzso strain or an zzso zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso on zzso zzso induction medium was observed relative to the wild type and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in liquid medium cultures zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells grown under conditions that induce zzso zzso develop distinct zzso swelling and form large zzso A strain expressing zzso linked to green fluorescent protein shows zzso of the protein consistent with the plasma zzso Our results indicate zzso plays a role in zzso and influences toxin production and zzso of the fungus in zzso
