zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the aromatic zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso and also a zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso acid substitution in the zzso part of the protein have been zzso approximately zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is activated by zzso and subject to feedback zzso by zzso whereas the zzso zzso does not respond to zzso by zzso nor zzso by zzso Both zzso are zzso consisting of two identical zzso of Mr zzso each one capable of binding one zzso and one zzso zzso Each zzso of the zzso zzso also binds one inhibitor zzso whereas the zzso zzso lost this zzso The zzso reaction was observed by zzso zzso and shows a direct and irreversible conversion of zzso to zzso without the zzso of any zzso zzso The kinetic data of the zzso zzso zzso show positive zzso toward the zzso with a Hill zzso of zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso the zzso is zzso The zzso has an zzso value of zzso zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso and an increased zzso value of zzso zzso in the presence of 300 zzso zzso In the zzso zzso a loss of zzso was observed, and zzso was reduced to zzso zzso This zzso is therefore locked in the activated state by a single zzso acid zzso
