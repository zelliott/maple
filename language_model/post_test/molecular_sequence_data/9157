zzso zzso is the method of choice for zzso zzso zzso of target sequences in a zzso It can be applied successfully to small plasmids (up to 10 zzso However, this method cannot efficiently mutate bigger zzso Using zzso Hot Start zzso in combination with high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to achieve zzso in big plasmids (up to 16 zzso involving not only a single base change but also multiple base zzso Moreover, only six zzso chain reaction zzso cycles and zzso zzso of zzso (instead of 18 zzso cycles and zzso zzso of zzso in the standard zzso were sufficient for the zzso
