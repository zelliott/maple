Type I zzso are zzso zzso involved in a range of zzso and sensory activities in different cell zzso In simple zzso zzso motor activity of class I zzso is regulated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso within the motor zzso The mechanism by which this zzso event affects the cellular function of each zzso I remains zzso The zzso zzso zzso I, zzso activates zzso zzso of cortical zzso patches and also regulates zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso we show that the zzso of the zzso zzso site zzso zzso plays a crucial role in regulating this zzso dynamic zzso and cellular zzso We conclude that although zzso of zzso zzso does not affect the ability of this motor protein to promote zzso zzso it is required for zzso to recruit to sites of zzso and function during this zzso
