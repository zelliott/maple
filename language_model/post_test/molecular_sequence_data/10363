zzso protein zzso a crucial zzso component of the zzso is one of two proteins that zzso assembly of the zzso zzso zzso It is required for proper folding of a large 3' domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates its own synthesis by binding to its own zzso This ability of zzso to bind both zzso and zzso zzso makes determination of its mode of zzso recognition particularly zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso was determined by a zzso anomalous zzso experiment using the zzso edge of zzso The zzso structure consists of a bundle of six zzso and an extended beta hairpin between zzso 3 and 4, with two or more zzso sites on its zzso The zzso along with portions of zzso 1, 4 and 6, forms a large, positively charged, zzso surface that has the appropriate zzso and dimensions to bind zzso zzso A second putative zzso site comprises parts of loop 2 and the zzso zzso 5 zzso 

zzso similarity between zzso and the zzso family of proteins strongly suggests that the beta hairpin of zzso binds to a groove of zzso zzso The beta hairpin of zzso is also similar to those from other zzso acid binding zzso such as zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that it belongs to an extended family of such zzso all of which bind to a groove of zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso loop 2 that belong to the second putative zzso site may have a role analogous to the zzso zzso of zzso which grip an zzso portion of double zzso
