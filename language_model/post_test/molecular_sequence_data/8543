A protein of molecular weight of 64 zzso zzso found in the outer membrane of zzso zzso shows a high degree of zzso with both the zzso domain of the zzso and the entire sequence of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso components of the zzso zzso complexes, zzso The alignment of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso from different species is zzso The possible implications of this protein in binding zzso transport are zzso This is the first zzso zzso reported to have a zzso zzso
