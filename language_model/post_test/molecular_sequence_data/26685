zzso peptides zzso are broad spectrum zzso which mostly act without specific zzso Identification of zzso is important in the current scenario of emerging zzso resistant zzso In the present study, in an attempt to identify new zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso from buffalo zzso zzso bone zzso and were amplified using specific zzso zzso analysis of cloned zzso revealed three novel zzso zzso They were named based on the number of active zzso acids in the zzso region of their predicted zzso sequences as zzso zzso an additional zzso at position zzso zzso zzso an additional zzso at position zzso and zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively with that of its cattle zzso zzso number of zzso acids of the zzso was zzso 155 and 157 zzso with zzso zzso sequences of 28, 29 and 34, respectively, which zzso to putative zzso zzso Several zzso acid zzso were observed in all the three zzso The zzso of the peptides was predicted to be alpha zzso having total net positive charge and zzso similar to that of zzso in zzso Comparative analysis of the predicted peptides suggested potential zzso activity and the sequence variations detected might enable the peptides to act as effective broad spectrum zzso zzso
