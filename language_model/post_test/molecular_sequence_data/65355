We previously showed that side population zzso cells, characterized by specific zzso dye zzso pattern in flow zzso analysis, were present in zzso kidney zzso zzso and that kidney SP cells were enriched in zzso stem cells zzso zzso is an zzso cassette (ABC) zzso that is known to be associated with zzso dye zzso activity of zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the expression and function of zzso in kidney SP cells from zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso has 4 zzso copies of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was expressed in kidney SP zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso and zzso showed that zzso was directly associated with the SP zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is a useful marker for zzso zzso In zzso zzso in kidney tissue showed that zzso cells were sporadically localized on the surface of zzso zzso and tightly zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso zzso adhere to the surface of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso cells are a key component of zzso niche in zzso
