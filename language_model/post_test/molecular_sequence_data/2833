The structures of the rearranged zzso segment 11 of two spontaneous zzso zzso strains were zzso We found that the zzso involved the zzso of normal segment 11 in a zzso orientation, and partial deletions in both zzso The open reading frame for zzso the protein zzso by normal segment 11, was zzso We also showed that the two rearranged genes were transcribed into zzso molecules of the same length as their corresponding zzso zzso
