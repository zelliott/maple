Using zzso as sole source of zzso nitrogen and energy, strain zzso zzso zzso was isolated from forest zzso The isolated strain was identified as a member of the zzso of fast-growing zzso species as revealed by zzso zzso zzso An identity of zzso was obtained to zzso zzso however, the type strain was unable to zzso zzso A zzso growth rate of zzso zzso was observed at a zzso concentration of 30 zzso 30 degrees C and pH zzso The zzso was tolerated at zzso up to 100 zzso Besides zzso the strain zzso zzso zzso and proposed zzso in zzso metabolism such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by resting or zzso cells was strictly dependent on the presence of zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso to the growth medium resulted in a significantly decreased growth rate if these zzso zzso were used as a zzso zzso monoxide difference zzso of crude extracts from cells grown on these zzso compared to zzso obtained for extracts of zzso cells indicated that zzso zzso is specifically expressed during growth on the zzso zzso These data indicated that a zzso zzso is involved in the degradation of the three zzso zzso
