With a simple tandem zzso zzso the zzso terminal domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso serves as the central coordinator of zzso synthesis by zzso a diversity of sequential interactions with zzso and processing zzso Despite intense research interest, many key questions regarding functional and evolutionary constraints on the zzso remain zzso for example, what selects for the zzso zzso zzso its tandem array across zzso diversity, and constant zzso length within given species and finally and how a zzso repetitive structure can orchestrate a diversity of simultaneous and zzso zzso interactions with both zzso zzso and binding zzso Here we examine comparative sequence evolution of 58 zzso II zzso from diverse zzso representing all six major zzso zzso and employ integrated evolutionary zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso zzso to further clarify how this repetitive sequence must be organized for optimal zzso II zzso We find that the zzso is composed of zzso and independent functional units that span zzso and not only a flexible zzso around each unit but also an elastic overall structure is zzso More zzso optimal zzso function always is achieved at approximately zzso zzso length rather than number of functional units, regardless of the characteristics of the sequence zzso Our combined observations lead us to advance an updated zzso working model, in which functional, and therefore, evolutionary constraints require a flexible zzso zzso determined by the zzso sequence and tandem register to accommodate the diversity of zzso interactions and a specific zzso length rather than number of functional units to correctly order and organize global zzso zzso zzso of conservation of these features across evolutionary diversity have important implications for comparative zzso II function in zzso and can more clearly direct specific research on zzso function in currently zzso zzso
