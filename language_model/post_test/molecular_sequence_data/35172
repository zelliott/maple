zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso not able to express the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In Germany, the zzso is occasionally isolated from poultry, zzso fish, food, and zzso In this study, a selection of 67 zzso unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated in Germany between 2000 and 2011 from the environment, animal, food, and humans was investigated by zzso and zzso methods to better understand the population structure and to identify potential sources of human zzso zzso of this zzso zzso were highly zzso Within the 67 strains zzso we identified 52 different zzso gel zzso zzso profiles, 12 different zzso sequence types zzso and 18 different zzso array zzso The zzso of strains based on the zzso gene repertoire zzso markers zzso was in good agreement with grouping by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is distributed across multiple unrelated zzso groups and consequently is highly zzso Two sequence types zzso and zzso were linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso two zzso zzso of zzso were linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso and one sequence type zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso a recently zzso new zzso From the characterization of clinical zzso and those of nonhuman origin, it can be concluded that the potential sources of sporadic human infections with zzso zzso zzso zzso most likely are mushrooms, zzso and zzso
