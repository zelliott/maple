It is poorly understood why a particular plant species is resistant to the vast majority of potential pathogens that zzso other plant species, a phenomenon referred to as zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is required for resistance to and induced by zzso zzso zzso from bean and zzso zzso is also required for resistance to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso indicating that zzso is not limited to bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso an isolate fully virulent on zzso actively suppressed the zzso zzso This suppression is abolished in zzso plants, indicating that zzso required an intact zzso acid signaling zzso in the plant to suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to enhanced resistance to this otherwise virulent zzso The presence of zzso in zzso which activates a zzso zzso resistance in zzso restored the induction of zzso zzso Thus, zzso is deployed for both general and specific resistance in zzso and targeted by the zzso for zzso
