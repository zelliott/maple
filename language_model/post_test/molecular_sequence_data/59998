In recent years, a zzso zzso for complement zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso has been described as a key mechanism for the zzso acute phase response to zzso This complement zzso zzso is initiated by a zzso recognition zzso the binding of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to microbial surfaces bearing zzso zzso zzso The recognition factor, zzso is associated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which, upon zzso binding to the microbial zzso activates the complement component zzso leading to either zzso zzso of the zzso target via the complement zzso or zzso zzso cell killing via assembly of the membrane attack zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso zzso zzso activity of the complement zzso 3 zzso the zzso membrane zzso for complement components zzso and zzso downstream products of the zzso zzso which are zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso also mediate zzso and zzso to zzso activated by signaling through another zzso zzso the zzso leading to zzso zzso Thus, the functional interplay of zzso zzso and zzso in the acute phase response zzso the microbial challenge, and lead to further zzso zzso Although the observation of various components of the zzso zzso in different zzso species demonstrates the high conservation and ancient roots of the components of innate zzso there has previously been no evidence supporting the possibility that the integral zzso complement zzso zzso is present in zzso We now have evidence for the coexistence of zzso of all the zzso key components zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the zzso zzso of complement zzso preceded the zzso zzso in zzso zzso despite being zzso to the zzso experimental evidence indicates that this zzso is zzso and has been zzso intact throughout its zzso
