zzso of the zzso hormone zzso gene occurs in the zzso of all zzso and in the zzso of primates and zzso In humans, tandem zzso response elements zzso located in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso act together with an adjacent upstream regulatory element to zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso genes of Old World Monkeys contain a single functional zzso This suggests that tandem zzso are unique to higher primates and humans and are not absolutely required for zzso zzso In contrast, the comparable zzso region of the horse zzso gene lacks a functional zzso but appears to retain a functional upstream regulatory zzso This suggests that acquisition of zzso expression of the zzso gene occurred independently in these zzso related zzso As a result, different combinations of zzso elements may explain why expression of the zzso gene only occurs in zzso of primates and zzso
