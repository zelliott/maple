The structure of the extension peptides retained on the tissue form of type V collagen molecules was zzso Type V collagen alpha chains containing extension peptides were extracted from fetal calf skin and bone by 4 M zzso and zzso M zzso acid, zzso zzso present in both extracts were zzso by sodium zzso zzso The collagen zzso chains were then resolved by zzso high performance liquid zzso The zzso extension peptides were characterized by direct sequence analysis after zzso with zzso zzso and analysis of the products of zzso by bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that the retained extension peptides on type V collagen molecules in the zzso zzso of skin and bone were zzso and that the alpha zzso chain retains an intact zzso while the alpha zzso chain appears to be partially zzso The extended alpha zzso chain isolated from fetal calf bone gave an identical zzso sequence to that of the alpha zzso chain isolated from fetal calf skin, suggesting that a specific zzso may be involved in processing the alpha zzso zzso
