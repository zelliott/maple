The zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso plays a central role in zinc zzso by controlling the expression of genes involved in zinc zzso zzso is active in zzso cells and zzso in replete zzso At the zzso level, zzso controls its own expression via positive zzso In addition, zzso two zzso zzso are regulated independently of each other by zinc binding directly to those regions and zzso zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso DNA binding is also inhibited by zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso target gene promoter occupancy is regulated with or without zzso zzso These results were confirmed using zzso zzso zzso regulation of DNA binding activity mapped to the DNA binding domain indicating other parts of zzso are unnecessary for this zzso zzso of zzso overrode DNA binding regulation and resulted in zzso promoter zzso Under these conditions of zzso zzso both the zinc dose response of zzso activity and cellular zinc zzso were altered suggesting the importance of DNA binding control to zinc zzso Thus, our results indicated that zinc regulates zzso activity zzso via three independent mechanisms, all of which contribute to the overall zinc responsiveness of zzso
