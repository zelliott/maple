We have zzso the zzso strain of Murray Valley encephalitis virus in zzso zzso cells, zzso the E and M zzso and examined the zzso of the zzso virus for zzso mice following zzso and zzso zzso Six independent passage series were carried out: four in the presence of mouse zzso zzso fluid and two without zzso Changes were observed in the E protein deduced zzso acid sequence for each of the six 10th passage stocks zzso Eleven changes were observed in total for the six stocks zzso these were at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Nine of the changes were zzso Five of the six zzso zzso were altered at zzso 390 which is part of an zzso zzso zzso This change resulted from adaptation to zzso cells rather than from zzso zzso The zzso sequence (and zzso zzso falls within a region which is highly zzso between zzso and is strongly zzso All five zzso which were altered at zzso 390 were attenuated in zzso mice following zzso zzso We propose that the domain of E encompassing the zzso sequence is an important zzso of zzso zzso
