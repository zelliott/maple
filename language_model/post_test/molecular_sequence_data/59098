zzso D zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to play a pivotal role in various cellular zzso but molecular understanding of this zzso is rather zzso This report describes the zzso zzso structure, and zzso organization of a zzso gene from zzso bean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was isolated from a zzso bean zzso library using the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso comparison with the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso gene consisted of four zzso and three zzso one of which interrupts the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the cloned zzso gene was present as a zzso zzso and yet there were other zzso or zzso sequences in the zzso bean zzso
