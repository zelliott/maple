Using the zzso zzso system we have identified novel potential zzso interacting zzso Here we described the interaction of zzso with a human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso protein specifically interacts with zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso and any of a number of zzso zzso zzso is not an inhibitor nor an zzso of the zzso D1 zzso while it appears to facilitate complex assembly between zzso and zzso D1 in zzso zzso competes with zzso for binding to zzso suggesting that zzso might exert part of its zzso function by affecting the formation of zzso D1 complexes via zzso
