The complete zzso sequence of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was zzso An open reading frame of the zzso gene was zzso zzso long and zzso a zzso protein consisting of 920 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso Da and an zzso point of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso coli cells showed zzso activity with optimal pH zzso and temperature (40 zzso similar to those of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso consists of two variable regions and a zzso zzso The variable regions contained an zzso signal zzso and a zzso cell wall sorting zzso the zzso region contained two functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso This structural feature of the zzso zzso zzso is quite similar to that of other zzso species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
