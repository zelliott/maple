Recent studies have suggested that protein zzso C zzso may be involved in the mechanism of signal zzso by which members of the zzso zzso family regulate gene expression and cell zzso We have investigated the role of zzso in the control of cell growth and gene expression by zzso alpha in zzso zzso Treatment of these cells with two zzso of zzso which are potent zzso of zzso completely blocked the induction by zzso alpha of the zzso for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These compounds also inhibited cell proliferation and zzso incorporation in this zzso In contrast, the protein zzso inhibitor zzso zzso did not significantly inhibit the induction of these genes by zzso alpha and had no effect on zzso cell growth or zzso incorporation in the presence or absence of zzso zzso No effect of zzso alpha on total zzso activity could be observed, and there were no significant changes in the overall levels of individual zzso zzso or their zzso following zzso alpha zzso In contrast, treatment of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which also zzso cell zzso strongly zzso zzso These data suggest that the activity of a zzso species, or a closely related zzso may be required both for continued cell proliferation and the response to zzso alpha in zzso cells, but that zzso growth zzso does not involve overall zzso or change in activity of zzso
