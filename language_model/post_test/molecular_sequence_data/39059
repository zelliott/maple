zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso C virus zzso is localized in the zzso although it has a functional nuclear zzso zzso To clarify the zzso of zzso zzso zzso various zzso or zzso deleted zzso zzso were generated and their zzso zzso was analyzed in cell lines after transient zzso zzso deleted forms of zzso were localized in the nucleus, and the sequence of the zzso 27 zzso acids of zzso had sufficient function to cause retention of a normally nuclear protein in the zzso These observations indicated that zzso zzso of zzso is determined primarily by the zzso region of the zzso In addition, we found zzso processing of zzso in zzso expressing zzso In these cells, zzso occurred at a few sites located in the zzso and zzso regions of zzso This zzso in cells was enhanced by zzso stimuli and was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso Based on the results of zzso analysis of zzso we predicted one zzso form, which had lost both the zzso and the zzso portions of zzso to be composed of zzso acid zzso 155 to zzso zzso containing the same zzso acid sequence as this zzso product was localized in the zzso Furthermore, we found that a fusion protein consisting of zzso zzso domain fused with this zzso form showed zzso activity only when the zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso was zzso suggesting that the zzso activity of this product was regulated by zzso These results suggested that the zzso product of zzso by a zzso zzso plays a role in zzso regulation of the host cell zzso in zzso zzso
