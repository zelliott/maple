The zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso with an zzso zzso and an zzso A zzso zzso protein zzso with high similarity to bacterial zzso has been proved to be capable of inducing calcium zzso in eggs at zzso zzso was supposed to be an important factor in starting embryonic zzso From the zzso library of human zzso cells zzso we isolated a novel full-length zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein that shares high zzso with human zzso So, the novel zzso is named as zzso The zzso gene consists of seven zzso and six zzso It is mapped to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that the tissue distribution of zzso zzso is different from that of human zzso or zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in most of human zzso with high expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Like zzso the zzso zzso has been proved to have the zzso activity to catalyze the conversion of zzso to zzso Our results indicated that zzso is a novel protein with zzso function as a zzso
