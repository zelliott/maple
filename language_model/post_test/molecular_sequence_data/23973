zzso zzso acid zzso is one of the most abundant fatty acids in zzso zzso zzso and a functional component of zzso zzso where it is found as an zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso lacks activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is characterized zzso by the absence of zzso and zzso by reduced zzso content and a reduced recovery rate after zzso While the zzso zzso has been zzso the zzso gene was not zzso identified, and a formal functional characterization by zzso of zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Two candidate genes zzso and zzso predicted to zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso locus were cloned from zzso plants and zzso A nonsense zzso changing zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso was identical to wild type (after correction of a sequencing error in the published zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso clone or zzso for zzso zzso zzso on zzso plants the ability to zzso zzso and restored leaf zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso in zzso had zzso levels of both zzso and zzso Together, these data formally prove that zzso is zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was partially zzso when zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family were expressed as zzso with a zzso transit zzso Tight correlation between leaf zzso levels and zzso content suggests a role for zzso fatty acid zzso in zzso zzso
