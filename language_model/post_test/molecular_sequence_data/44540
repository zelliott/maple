In zzso disease virus zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso a gene equivalent to the zzso E zzso of other zzso was identified and zzso The primary translation product comprises zzso zzso acids with a zzso of zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence possesses several characteristics typical of membrane zzso including a zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso region containing four potential zzso zzso zzso Compared with other zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso identity with zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso zzso at the zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso which starts between 65 and 86 zzso upstream of the potential zzso initiation zzso of zzso was identified as the zzso zzso By a zzso zzso this potential zzso coding region was expressed as several specific products from 66 to 72 zzso These products were susceptible to zzso treatment, indicating that they were zzso in zzso Further, the expressed zzso reacted with all zzso raised to each of the three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso is expressed by all three zzso of zzso in infected cells and zzso common zzso zzso beyond those that are zzso zzso
