zzso specifically control expression of genes predominantly involved in zzso zzso and transport of various cellular zzso in organisms from all three zzso of zzso Among many classes of identified zzso two zzso respond to zzso acids zzso and zzso to zzso Though these zzso recognize small compounds, they both belong to the largest zzso and have unique structural and functional zzso In this review, we attempt to characterize molecular recognition principles employed by zzso zzso zzso to selectively bind their zzso zzso and to effectively perform a gene regulation zzso We zzso up-to-date zzso and genetic data available for the zzso and zzso zzso and correlate these results with recent high-resolution structural information obtained for the zzso zzso We also discuss the contribution of zzso zzso to zzso resistance and outline potential applications of zzso in biotechnology and zzso
