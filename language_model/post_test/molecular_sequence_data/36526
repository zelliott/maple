An attempt has been made to construct a 3-D model of zzso a member of zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the latter was a factor considered in the modeling zzso The constructed model has been used to compare currently available specific zzso interaction information, the shape of the binding cavity derived from shape of binding retinal zzso and zzso and challenged to explain recently available results from a series of fluorinated zzso
