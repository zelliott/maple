zzso zzso activated by zzso of protein are thought to play significant roles in the progression of kidney zzso Thus, identification of genes related to zzso should provide insights into the pathological process of zzso zzso 

Gene expression profiles were constructed by means of direct sequencing procedures to identify genes induced in the mouse kidney zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso 

By comparing the gene expression of control zzso to that of disease model zzso the abundantly expressed genes in control zzso were zzso presumably because of potentially toxic effects of zzso From the more than 1000 zzso zzso an immunity related zzso zzso shared zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso were selected for further zzso The increased expression of zzso a member of the zzso family, and of zzso in response to zzso was confirmed by Northern analysis, zzso in zzso zzso and laser zzso along with real-time zzso zzso Full length cloning of zzso identified it as a family member of zzso that was reported to express predominantly in zzso 

The gene expression profiles showed that the expression patterns in zzso were changed dramatically by zzso The profiles include novel genes that should be further characterized to aid the understanding of the zzso of progressive kidney zzso
