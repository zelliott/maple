zzso is a zzso zzso that binds a number of proteins involved in cell cycle control and cell development, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The only recognizable structural motifs within zzso are two putative zzso zzso located near the N and C zzso of the zzso We now show that the zzso coiled zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso coiled zzso mediates zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso coiled zzso did not facilitate binding to zzso and zzso proteins in these zzso A zzso domain zzso zzso that minimally encompasses the putative zzso coiled zzso was identified by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso This region is predicted to contain two smaller zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain is zzso and zzso indicating that the domain does form a coiled zzso The two smaller zzso zzso and zzso also formed zzso of lower binding zzso but with less zzso content than the longer zzso The zzso radius of zzso is the same as those of zzso and zzso zzso that zzso does not form a single long coiled zzso but a more compact structure involving zzso of the two smaller coiled zzso which fold back as a zzso bundle or other compact zzso These results suggest a specific model for zzso zzso via its N zzso and contribute to an improved understanding of how this protein might assemble other factors required for its role as a zzso zzso
