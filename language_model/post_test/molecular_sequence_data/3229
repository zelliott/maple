A family I zzso domain zzso and a zzso and zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with the zzso fused to its zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso recovered from inclusion bodies had a molecular mass of zzso zzso which agrees with the 29 zzso of the zzso plus the calculated zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso The isolated zzso protein zzso to both bacterial zzso cellulose and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso caused a decrease in cellulose zzso and a higher sensitivity to zzso zzso
