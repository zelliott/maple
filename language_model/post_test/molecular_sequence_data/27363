The influenza A virus zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediates zzso of the interior of zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein has a single zzso zzso zzso which associates to form zzso that bind the zzso drug zzso However, the minimal zzso required for assembly and zzso transport in cellular zzso has not been zzso zzso the zzso properties of zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso were zzso A short zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso was inserted into the zzso membrane and had specific, zzso zzso transport activity indistinguishable from that of full-length zzso an zzso version of an even shorter fragment, zzso had specific activity within a factor of 2 of the full-length zzso Furthermore, synthetic fragments including a zzso spanning zzso zzso were found to transport zzso into zzso in an zzso zzso In addition, the functionally important zzso zzso zzso values are highly zzso in the zzso form of the zzso a property zzso in the TM zzso and full-length zzso in both zzso and zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso for zzso drug zzso and zzso zzso are packaged in a remarkably small zzso that can now be studied with zzso
