The zzso locus and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso A single zzso zzso composed of four zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus is characterized by the presence of four other genes of which at least three are expressed during the zzso zzso Three of the genes were highly zzso in closely related zzso species and for two of the genes and zzso gene zzso was observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cultures displaying approximately zzso decreased sensitivity towards the zzso drugs zzso and zzso were selected repeatedly after prolonged growth in presence of zzso Five cultures examined in detail were shown to zzso a zzso carrying zzso acid substitution zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso structure as a template, suggests that substitution zzso zzso into the binding site of zzso The zzso zzso could be isolated by growth under zzso or zzso pressure zzso zzso to both zzso Although opposing selection for zzso or zzso resistance was reported recently using zzso zzso or zzso zzso strains carrying zzso zzso the results obtained here are reminiscent of a quadruple zzso of zzso zzso zzso displaying strong resistance to zzso and zzso enhanced resistance against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carries three zzso present in this zzso possibly explaining the low sensitivity to zzso and the ease by which moderately zzso resistant zzso could be zzso
