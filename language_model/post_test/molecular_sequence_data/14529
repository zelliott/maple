zzso in the untranslated regulatory regions of genes may result in abnormal gene expression or zzso zzso In this study, we characterize the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene involved in the zzso formation in the zzso Our data revealed that two major transcripts zzso and zzso are more highly expressed than any of the other zzso in all the zzso zzso though a longer transcript zzso was also isolated and characterized from the brain zzso The zzso sequence fully matches the zzso zzso reference sequence zzso All three zzso use a zzso zzso zzso that is predicted to fold into a hairpin secondary structure which might be exposed to the zzso and zzso specificity zzso In addition, we observed that the zzso and zzso transcripts display zzso at the zzso sites in a zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that several zzso zzso are transcribed from the zzso zzso thereby indicating a wide degree of zzso in zzso zzso
