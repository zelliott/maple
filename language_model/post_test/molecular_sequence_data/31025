Native zzso factor Tu from zzso zzso is initially attacked by various zzso in a region spanning zzso acid zzso zzso By comparing the zzso rates of zzso and zzso zzso only a small difference was observed for the zzso zzso at zzso zzso V-8 attacks zzso only in a zzso form, whereas this zzso exclusively zzso zzso in zzso zzso even when the protein had been previously zzso at zzso zzso of zzso leads to a zzso decreased rate of zzso by the zzso zzso at zzso It also reduces the accessibility of zzso to zzso reflecting a zzso effect from zzso binding domain I to domain zzso Only slight differences were observed in the rate of zzso at all positions in the zzso versus the zzso zzso The intrinsic zzso activity was slightly reduced in zzso zzso significantly impaired in zzso zzso at zzso and completely abolished in zzso zzso at zzso No zzso zzso activity was observed for zzso zzso Treatment of these proteins with zzso zzso or zzso followed by zzso led to zzso modification of the new zzso located exclusively within region zzso The highest zzso was shown by the zzso of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso in the native protein sensitive to affinity labeling zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso lost their zzso upon zzso of zzso in region zzso suggesting an altered structure of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
