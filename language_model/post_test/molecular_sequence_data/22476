The bacterial diversity and community structure within both zzso enriched and zzso zzso zzso marine sediments at two fish farms in southern zzso Australia, was examined using zzso zzso gene clone library construction and zzso zzso at both zzso and reference sites at both farms showed a very high level of microbial zzso Over 900 clones were zzso and grouped into zzso unique zzso zzso sites were dominated by zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso Cage site sediments were also dominated by these zzso as well as members of the zzso and zzso Diversity and coverage zzso indicated that the actual diversity of the sediments was much greater than that zzso despite a large sampling zzso All libraries were shown to be statistically different from one another zzso zzso zzso Many zzso did not group with cultured bacteria, but grouped with other environmental clones from a wide array of marine zzso zzso Diversity and zzso zzso suggested that although both parameters changed after farming, diverse communities were present in all zzso The response of the microbial community to organic load suggested that random, rather than zzso succession events determine community composition and diversity, and that zzso type may influence bacterial community and zzso response to organic zzso
