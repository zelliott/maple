This study examines whether zzso zzso can activate the zzso sodium channel zzso in zzso kidney zzso zzso The zzso sodium transport assessed by zzso zzso current appears to be sensitive to zzso a zzso inhibitor in a mouse cortical collecting duct cell line zzso This result indicated that zzso zzso may be implicated in the regulation of zzso sodium zzso Using zzso zzso to a previously isolated zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel full-length zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso analysis showed a broad pattern of expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso experiments also showed that zzso was abundantly expressed in zzso zzso cells and was also expressed in intact and cultured collecting duct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or human zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso also showed that zzso zzso a significant increase in zzso current accompanied by a decrease of channel molecules at the cell zzso It is proposed that this novel mouse channel zzso zzso may act as a regulator of zzso within the zzso
