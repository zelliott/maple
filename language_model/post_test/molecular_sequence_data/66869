zzso zzso zzso protects us by transporting a broad range of structurally unrelated compounds out of the zzso zzso the regions of zzso that make up the zzso pocket is important for understanding the mechanism of zzso The common zzso pocket is at the interface between the zzso zzso of the two zzso halves of zzso It has been shown in a previous study zzso zzso and Clarke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that the first zzso segment zzso contributed to the zzso zzso In the present study, we used zzso zzso reaction with an zzso zzso zzso analogue of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis to test whether the equivalent zzso segment zzso in the zzso of zzso also contributed to drug zzso zzso of zzso to zzso caused a zzso decrease in apparent affinity for the drug zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed elevated zzso activity zzso higher than zzso zzso after zzso modification with zzso The activity returned to zzso levels after treatment with zzso The zzso zzso and zzso A, protected the zzso from zzso with zzso zzso zzso could be zzso with a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso that are predicted to line the zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by some drug zzso such as zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or by zzso zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso forms part of the zzso pocket of zzso
