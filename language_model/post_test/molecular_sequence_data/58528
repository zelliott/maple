Two similar, yet functionally distinct zzso zzso are transcribed from the DNA zzso of the human zzso B zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein which is zzso processed to yield e zzso The zzso zzso zzso both the zzso protein and reverse zzso and serve as the templates for viral DNA zzso To determine whether synthesis of these two zzso is directed from a single or a closely spaced pair of zzso we introduced point and zzso zzso into the zzso elements of the promoter that directs their zzso zzso from these zzso was examined both in zzso zzso systems derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and by transient zzso of zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The data from these experiments indicated that synthesis of the zzso and zzso zzso is directed by two distinct promoters and that the zzso elements of these two promoters partially zzso yet are genetically zzso with each consisting of its own zzso zzso and a zzso zzso sequence situated approximately 25 to 30 zzso upstream of its sites of zzso A zzso zzso was found to be sufficient to physically separate these two zzso Furthermore, these two promoters can be zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso from the zzso promoter and the zzso nuclear factor 4 specifically zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that the promoters used in synthesis of the zzso and zzso zzso are genetically distinct and separately zzso
