The bacterial community associated with a full scale zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treating zzso originating from domestic wastewater and destined for land spread, was zzso using a number of molecular approaches zzso specifically for this high temperature zzso zzso zzso genes were amplified directly from sludge with universally zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso and a clone library constructed that corresponded to the late zzso stage zzso zzso 23 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed various zzso zzso gene sequence types reflective of high bacterial community zzso Members of the bacterial community included zzso and zzso zzso with High G + C content and zzso bacteria with a prevalence of the zzso zzso G + zzso division zzso zzso and zzso Most of the zzso clones showed affiliation with bacterial species previously isolated or detected in other elevated temperature zzso at alkaline zzso or in cellulose rich zzso Several zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso The presence of zzso was of interest in such large scale systems where zzso zzso and mixing is often the norm while the presence of large amounts of zzso suggest the possibility of limited zzso and zzso of zzso within the sludge zzso during zzso Comparative analysis with zzso identified in other zzso systems revealed significant differences based on zzso zzso The abundance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that these organisms are responsible for maintaining the elevated temperature at the later stages of the zzso zzso
