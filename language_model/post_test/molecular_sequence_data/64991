The expression of genes zzso T cell zzso zzso alpha was used to follow the development of the zzso and to analyze the distribution of T cells in zzso In the zzso expression was first zzso by in zzso zzso at four days post zzso In zzso extracted from whole fish, zzso transcripts were also detected at four days and reached adult levels at three zzso At six weeks, zzso was expressed throughout the zzso whereas zzso expression was localized to the peripheral zzso zzso of zzso outside the zzso was detected at nine zzso In adult peripheral zzso the greatest expression was in the zzso zzso and zzso expression in the zzso became greater as fish zzso Three new, relatively highly zzso zzso zzso families were zzso
