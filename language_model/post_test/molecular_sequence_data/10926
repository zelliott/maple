To characterize zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and the surrounding zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso analyses were employed for screening zzso zzso zzso developed against zzso components of the human zzso zzso basement membrane zzso zzso In the current study, zzso zzso was used as the zzso probe to characterize its zzso zzso zzso and to zzso a complementary DNA zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence analyses were performed for the further characterization of zzso An indirect zzso zzso zzso technique was employed for zzso microscopic analysis to study the distribution of zzso in the zzso zzso 

The protein zzso isolated from rabbit zzso zzso and zzso zzso was identified as the zzso zzso form of type zzso collagen based on its size zzso 340 zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso and a zzso domain of approximately 300 zzso in its zzso structure, and its internal zzso acid zzso The identity of zzso was further confirmed from the zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso deduced from the sequence of a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the long form of type zzso collagen is present in the zzso of zzso zzso and in the zzso as well as in the zzso zzso zzso zone but is absent in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It was not zzso in the zzso loose zzso zzso in the zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso microscopic analyses indicated that the long zzso form of type zzso collagen is present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso gold was distributed along the collagen zzso with a zzso of 150 to 200 zzso 

The long zzso form of human type zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso with interrupted triple zzso referred to as zzso contributes to the differences in the zzso zones of the cornea and zzso Although many of the dense zzso zzso in adult animals contain the short zzso form of type zzso zzso human zzso zzso the zzso zone, and the zzso contain the long zzso form as the zzso form of type zzso zzso In the zzso zzso type zzso collagen may be organized along the collagen zzso in a uniform zzso zzso
