The zzso factor zzso and its zzso partner Max are members of the zzso zzso family and bind to the DNA core sequence zzso Using a site-selection zzso we determined the complete 12 base pair consensus binding sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso fails to bind the core when it is flanked by a zzso or a zzso while the zzso zzso readily binds such zzso zzso we show that inappropriate zzso sequences zzso zzso by zzso in zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso are less zzso than zzso and may regulate other genes in addition to zzso zzso
