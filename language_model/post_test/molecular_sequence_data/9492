zzso of bacterial communities in zzso zzso and evaluation of their degradation capacities may serve as a guide for improving zzso of such zzso Using zzso and molecular methods, the aim of this work was to characterize 17 zzso strains (13 zzso able to use diesel fuel oil as sole carbon and energy zzso The strains were first tested for their ability to grow on different zzso on minimal medium containing high zzso zzso The envelope zzso of each strain was assessed by microbial zzso to the hydrocarbon test zzso when grown in LB medium or minimal medium containing zzso or diesel zzso Most strains were zzso both in LB and minimal zzso except for strain zzso zzso zzso that was zzso only in minimal zzso Furthermore, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and strain zzso zzso zzso species zzso displayed zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of the 15 strains by zzso amplification, sequencing and Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis performed on the five zzso zzso strains revealed that they zzso used zzso as zzso and confirmed that they are unable to use zzso
