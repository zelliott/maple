zzso generated by in zzso zzso of zzso DNA is a straightforward and potentially valuable new approach to zzso Little is known about the type of cells involved, the various zzso aspects, and the destiny of the zzso In this report, we describe a system in which immunity is the result of in zzso targeting of B zzso This was accomplished using zzso DNA zzso an zzso zzso gene under the control of zzso promoter and zzso zzso We show persistence of the zzso in zzso B zzso for at least 3 months, zzso the average life span of zzso B zzso in the zzso The zzso could not be detected in any other zzso or zzso zzso over a period of 6 zzso We also established that the zzso is integrated in the host zzso These studies bring new understanding to the events underlying the in zzso use of zzso zzso Moreover, the characteristics of this new approach make zzso zzso zzso a model system to study the zzso of zzso zzso in adult zzso
