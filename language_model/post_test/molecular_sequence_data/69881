zzso DNA from a 38 year old male with diabetes zzso and features of zzso dysfunction was zzso and shown to include a population with a partial zzso The partially duplicated zzso DNA molecules were evident in both muscle and zzso The region of zzso DNA duplicated includes the origin of heavy strand zzso but not the light strand zzso This patient has features in common with other cases of partial direct tandem zzso and with a family which was reported to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso analysis of our case produced results consistent with a partial deletion of zzso zzso This leads us to propose that the rarity of reports of partial zzso DNA zzso may stem in part from the zzso of such zzso as partial zzso
