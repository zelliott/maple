zzso zzso acid strands exist as zzso in certain biological zzso and zzso DNA also presents interesting opportunities in zzso zzso We describe here how T4 DNA zzso can be used for efficient construction of DNA molecules having one zzso end but two distinct 3' ends that extend from the 2' and 3' zzso respectively, of an internal zzso The nature of the reaction products is investigated, and optimal reaction conditions are reported for the construction of zzso zzso We discuss the utility of these zzso DNA zzso for gene zzso
