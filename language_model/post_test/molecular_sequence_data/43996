Although the products of zzso of the zzso components of LDL have been studied zzso much less is known about the specific products of zzso modification of the zzso We reacted native LDL and LDL that had been treated with zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and analyzed the products by zzso Although zzso zzso of native LDL and LDL oxidized by limited quantities of zzso showed similar patterns by zzso with detection at 220 zzso oxidized LDL showed several discrete zzso at 365 zzso which is characteristic of zzso formed with zzso and zzso commonly termed protein zzso Native zzso showed no zzso in the zzso at 365 zzso zzso absorbing at 365 zzso were isolated by zzso and zzso In most cases, the probable sites of modification on the peptides could be implied by failure of an anticipated zzso acid to appear in the expected zzso Of the 14 peptides isolated and characterized to date, eight peptides contained zzso zzso In other zzso zzso zzso and Met were identified as zzso acid zzso apparently modified by zzso treatment of zzso Thirteen of the peptides identified are from zzso peptides located on the surface of zzso native zzso Our studies suggest a selective process of modification of zzso by zzso and the approaches used in the present studies should be useful for the characterization of the mechanisms of zzso of this and other zzso
