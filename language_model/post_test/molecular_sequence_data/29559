A gene designated as zzso was identified which was involved in zzso of zzso zzso zzso is located on the circular zzso as a single zzso This gene shares high zzso with zzso a zzso zzso gene zzso an outer membrane zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso at zzso caused attenuated tumors on plants when zzso at a low cell concentration zzso zzso The zzso did not affect the bacterial growth on different zzso A broad host range zzso containing the wild type zzso could restore the tumor formation ability of zzso to the wild type zzso When both zzso and zzso zzso were used to study the zzso gene zzso we found that the zzso gene was zzso by zzso pH but not by plant zzso compound zzso zzso encodes a putative protein of 218 zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and whole cell zzso experiments indicated that zzso is an outer membrane protein exposed on the bacterial cell zzso It appeared that zzso was exclusively present in the outer membrane and not in other zzso The zzso gene induction zzso showed that the zzso gene was not required for the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that are essential for zzso The zzso half of zzso is slightly zzso to some of the bacterial zzso proteins and some of plant zzso The role of zzso in zzso interaction is zzso
