The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso perform an essential function in membrane fusion in zzso While deletion of either zzso or zzso causes no obvious zzso in zzso grown cells, deletion of both genes is zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells only zzso but not zzso is needed for membrane fusion during zzso membrane zzso Mass zzso and in zzso labeling data suggest that zzso 23, 24, and 79 in zzso and zzso 31 and 34 in zzso can be zzso in zzso Here we set out to assess the contribution of zzso on zzso protein in zzso zzso 

Different zzso versions of zzso and zzso were generated to target the zzso sites in zzso and zzso zzso or zzso of zzso or putative zzso zzso or zzso zzso resulted in no obvious growth zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso caused a mild zzso in the ability of zzso to complement the zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso Combination of all zzso did not additionally compromise zzso in zzso zzso When compared to the wild type zzso and zzso the zzso acid zzso displayed similar genetic interactions with late acting zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells expressing only the zzso versions of zzso had no zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso also zzso and invasive growth modes are regulated by the availability of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso cells, deletion of zzso or zzso or expression of the zzso versions of zzso or zzso as the sole copies of zzso genes caused no defects in zzso or zzso zzso and invasive zzso 

The identified zzso sites do not significantly contribute to the in zzso functionality of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
