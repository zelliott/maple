The high zzso zzso ratio observed within the bacteria zzso zzso may contribute to its remarkable resistance to environmental zzso We isolated zzso a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso gel mobility shift zzso zzso revealed that zzso binds specifically to the promoter of the zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso and that zzso the only zzso zzso in zzso zzso cannot bind to the promoter of zzso but it can bind to the promoter of another zzso acquisition zzso zzso zzso expression analysis indicated that zzso acts as a zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further sequence alignment analysis revealed that zzso has evolved some special zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso plays an important role in the activities of zzso and further zzso binding activity zzso showed that the activity of zzso zzso decreased dramatically relative to wild type zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso has evolved a very efficient zzso regulation mechanism that involves its high zzso zzso ratio and permits resistance to extreme zzso
