The recently published zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso are almost identical to each zzso However, they are in conflict with the results of zzso and functional studies published in the past 18 zzso zzso folding patterns based on many zzso and functional studies differ from the zzso structures in the exclusion of distinct zzso zzso These differences might be the consequence of changes observed in zzso that result in the formation of channels with the characteristic functional properties of zzso Is it possible to reconcile the discrepancies between the zzso structures and earlier zzso As it was zzso from inclusion bodies, the protein used to obtain the zzso structures might not be in the native zzso Here, I propose structural zzso that could occur spontaneously as a possible path to convert the zzso structure to my preferred zzso determined native zzso
