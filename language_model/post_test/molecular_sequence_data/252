A novel strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a mixed culture from a pond zzso during screening for zzso bacteria capable of degrading zzso zzso In this study, the zzso characterization of this zzso zzso zzso isolate and the role which it, and its zzso relatives, may play in zzso degradation and in the sulfur cycle are zzso zzso zzso was a zzso strain, utilizing zzso degradation products produced by other zzso zzso were zzso until zzso forming oval, terminal spores that swell the zzso It showed optimum growth at 34 degrees C, pH zzso and in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds such as zzso zzso zzso gelatin and zzso zzso in addition to several zzso acids and zzso zzso of many of these compounds was enhanced in the presence of zzso The isolate was unable to use any of the carbohydrates or alcohols investigated or zzso as carbon and energy zzso zzso and zzso sulfur were used as terminal electron zzso zzso analysis revealed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso It exhibited 99 % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to its closest relatives zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values with these two strains were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso we conclude that the isolate represents a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
