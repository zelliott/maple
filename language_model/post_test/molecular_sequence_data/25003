Standard building blocks of zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso been recently discovered and further characterized by combined efforts of several zzso New challenging views on the protein structure, zzso and evolution are introduced by these zzso In particular, the role of van der zzso contacts in protein stability is better zzso They can be considered as locks closing the zzso chain returns and forming the zzso zzso The zzso of the arrangement of the standard zzso in the proteins has important evolutionary zzso zzso pressure to maintain the zzso of nearly standard size is reflected in the protein sequences as characteristic distance between zzso zzso equal to the loop zzso zzso Further characterization of the zzso units reveals several zzso zzso which suggests a new basis for protein zzso The following is a review of these zzso
