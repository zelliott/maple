The zzso element of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of different zzso species by zzso between a 58 zzso sequence common to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that sequences similar to the zzso zzso site were found in other zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as unrelated bacteria zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments from zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis were cloned and zzso zzso of these sequences with the sequence of the integration zone of zzso zzso revealed a zzso region of 76 zzso which overlapped with the zzso zzso This zzso sequence was similar to the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso genes as well as a number of zzso zzso genes and had a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso element zzso was also found to overlap a potential zzso gene zzso We note here that these two putative zzso genes as well as those which overlap the zzso site of the elements zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso all contain the site where zzso zzso takes zzso These zzso zzso zzso genes lack the 3' terminal zzso sequence found in most zzso zzso zzso
