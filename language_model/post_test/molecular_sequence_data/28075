zzso signal peptides display little zzso acid sequence zzso despite their shared role in zzso protein zzso This zzso may exist to permit the establishment of signal zzso zzso that are appropriate for transport of particular zzso In this paper we explore how signal peptides are composed of structural units that may interact with each other and with the mature protein to effect zzso Using a new application of cassette zzso we have replaced the zzso core of the zzso coli alkaline zzso signal zzso with zzso from the signals of zzso zzso zzso and zzso major coat zzso The core regions from zzso protein and zzso effectively replaced the alkaline zzso zzso the zzso hybrid signals performed as well as wild type in zzso transport and processing of alkaline zzso However, the core region from zzso major coat protein generated a zzso hybrid signal zzso zzso of a zzso portion of the zzso major coat protein core did not improve transport zzso However, restoration of the zzso zzso region and the zzso charged zzso zzso of the mature protein did zzso the transport zzso These results suggest that at least in the case of these zzso signal zzso zzso there is a requirement for zzso among the zzso core, zzso region, and part of the mature protein in order for efficient protein transport to zzso
