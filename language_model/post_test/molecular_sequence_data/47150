zzso immune responses against an zzso bacterial zzso such as zzso involve the production of gamma zzso zzso which activates zzso It has recently been suggested that, zzso zzso in addition to zzso contributes to the induction of zzso following zzso Given this hypothesis, an optimal host immune response against zzso bacterial pathogens would include the induction of zzso zzso by zzso due to zzso zzso We questioned whether zzso could induce zzso to zzso their expression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso With cultures of zzso zzso we were surprised to find that infection by zzso zzso zzso resulted in decreased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso rather than an zzso Reduction of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso occurred early in the response, suggesting a direct zzso Furthermore, mice orally zzso with zzso zzso were shown to have reduced zzso zzso expression at zzso sites within hours zzso Together these studies demonstrate zzso reductions in zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso pathogen may be capable of limiting a potentially protective immune zzso
