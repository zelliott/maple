On the basis of their relative zzso and zzso structure, we prepared zzso to four synthetic peptides with zzso acid sequences zzso to four zzso zzso regions of the zzso 80 zzso type I zzso zzso zzso zzso to each of the four peptides recognized their specific zzso Human zzso alpha or zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex, whereas zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso did zzso zzso to zzso zzso did not zzso the type II zzso zzso blocked zzso of the binding of zzso human zzso beta to zzso cells and 50% of the binding to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we compared the ability of this zzso to inhibit the binding of zzso or human zzso alpha to that of zzso or human zzso zzso At a concentration of 20 zzso zzso zzso blocked 50% binding of zzso zzso zzso At 1 zzso zzso zzso was zzso In contrast, no significant blockade of zzso alpha binding was observed at zzso as high as 3 zzso of zzso The selective blockade of zzso beta forms was not due to differences in the affinities of these zzso for receptors on these zzso The zzso also blocked the binding of human zzso beta but not human zzso alpha to zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso beta but not zzso alpha on zzso cells was also inhibited by this zzso These data suggest zzso that zzso to a specific zzso on the zzso domain interferes with the binding of zzso beta but not zzso zzso zzso the differential zzso of binding of zzso beta but not zzso alpha by zzso also blocks zzso activity, and zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta may zzso different signals by binding to separate zzso on the zzso
