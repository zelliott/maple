Selective zzso of zzso bonds in zzso is important in the processing of large zzso zzso This paper reports specific zzso at zzso sequences in single stranded zzso as short as zzso The zzso between U and A leaves a zzso zzso on the zzso and a zzso group on the 3' side of the zzso The zzso is promoted by a wide range of zzso including zzso organic compounds such as zzso zzso and by zzso A variety of experiments suggests the zzso is not due to contamination by zzso The rate of zzso is a function of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is not zzso The phenomenon described here can potentially provide a relatively simple way of coding chemical stability into single stranded zzso based on its sequence and zzso This process seems to be similar to that involved in zzso degradation of zzso
