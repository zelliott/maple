zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a dependent zzso that regulates asexual zzso zzso The order in which these genes are expressed determines the outcome of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells leads to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso growth, cellular zzso and spore zzso By contrast, expression of zzso in zzso cells does not result in zzso differentiation but does lead to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso growth, and zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso act individually and together to regulate their own expression and that of numerous other zzso zzso We propose that the central zzso controlling development is largely zzso The timing and extent of expression of the regulatory genes and their targets are determined as development proceeds by zzso controlled changes in the relative zzso of regulatory gene products in the various zzso cell zzso
