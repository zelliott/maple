Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso two independent zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso While zzso resides in the same zzso unit as the zzso zzso zzso forming the zzso degradation lower pathway, zzso is situated outside but in close proximity to this zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso are induced and expressed upon incubation with zzso and the zzso that are zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso have been cloned in zzso coli zzso The zzso of these genes yields peptides with apparent molecular masses of 46 zzso zzso and 43 zzso zzso zzso Both zzso exhibit broad zzso zzso and metabolize zzso zzso and zzso However, the relative rates by which the zzso zzso are transformed differ zzso
