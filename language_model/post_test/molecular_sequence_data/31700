A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was enriched and isolated from zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that strain zzso was affiliated with the zzso zzso within the family zzso and shared the highest zzso zzso and zzso M zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with the type strain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The cells of strain zzso were observed to be zzso zzso and irregular zzso that did not lyse in zzso % zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be used as zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Growth was observed at zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso M zzso zzso 0 zzso Growth and methane production rates were zzso in the presence of zzso although methane production and growth yields were not significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect methane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso growth, while zzso extract and zzso did zzso The zzso zzso experiment revealed a zzso of zzso % between zzso and the type strains of the zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was determined to be zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso study, strain zzso represents a novel species belonging to the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
