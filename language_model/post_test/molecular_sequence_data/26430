The zzso action of zzso zzso on the specific zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was investigated using a previously characterized zzso membrane extract zzso that was highly enriched in zzso zzso zzso activity and a zzso zzso In common with the previously described zzso action on zzso zzso at zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in a concentration and structurally dependent manner, while zzso and zzso or a combination of both peptides were zzso zzso similarities between segments of zzso and zzso may explain the zzso action of the zzso on zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso which binds to the zzso of the zzso form of the zzso also protected zzso from zzso
