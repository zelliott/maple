There is currently no effective therapy for human prion zzso However, several zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso prolong the incubation time of zzso in zzso and inhibit the production of the zzso zzso of the prion protein zzso the major component of infectious zzso in cultured zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso and related compounds rapidly and dramatically reduce the amount of zzso the zzso precursor of zzso present on the cell zzso This effect results primarily from the ability of these agents to stimulate zzso of zzso thereby causing a zzso of the protein from the plasma membrane to the cell zzso zzso zzso also causes a change in the zzso zzso of zzso such that a portion of the protein molecules are shifted into late zzso and/or zzso In addition, we zzso using zzso bacterial fusion zzso that cultured cells express zzso and specific surface binding sites for zzso many of which are zzso zzso Our results raise the possibility that zzso zzso inhibit prion production by altering the cellular zzso of zzso zzso and they indicate that zzso zzso are likely to play an important role in the cellular metabolism of both zzso and zzso
