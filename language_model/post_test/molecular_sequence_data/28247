The locus zzso zzso defines a deletion hotspot in the zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have cloned over 90 zzso of zzso DNA from this region in overlapping zzso The use of whole zzso as zzso in a competitive DNA zzso analysis proves a fast and convenient method for identifying zzso in this zzso A rapid survey of zzso patients is carried out to zzso the nature of the propensity to deletions in this zzso Using this technique, deletion zzso are zzso to individual restriction fragments in patient zzso without the need for tedious isolation of single copy zzso zzso the deletion data yield a consistent restriction map of the region and permit detection of several zzso A 176 zzso zzso was identified within the cloned DNA, located 3' of an zzso exceeding 150 zzso in zzso Its deletion causes a zzso in the zzso reading frame and produces the zzso zzso This zzso is one of the most frequently deleted zzso in zzso patients and its sequence is applied in a pilot study for diagnostic deletion screening using zzso zzso zzso zzso
