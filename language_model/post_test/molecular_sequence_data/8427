The zzso protein was first identified as part of a fusion product with the zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso resulting from the zzso zzso zzso associated with acute zzso leukemia zzso It has been previously demonstrated that zzso which is tightly bound to the nuclear zzso concentrates in discrete zzso compartments that are zzso in zzso cells due to the expression of the zzso alpha zzso Here we report that zzso infection causes a drastic zzso of zzso from zzso nuclear bodies into zzso zzso The product zzso by zzso zzso is shown to be responsible for this reorganization and to zzso with zzso into these zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso zzso concentrate in the zzso zzso both in infected and zzso zzso cells, and that this association requires the zzso zzso acid motif zzso common to all viral zzso that bind zzso or the related zzso and zzso zzso The zzso large T zzso another member of this zzso family is also found in close association with the zzso nuclear zzso Taken together, the present data indicate that the zzso zzso containing zzso represent a preferential target for DNA tumor zzso and therefore suggest a more general involvement of the zzso nuclear bodies in zzso zzso
