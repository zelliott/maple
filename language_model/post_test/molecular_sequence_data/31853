A zzso study was carried out to identify the structural zzso controlling the zzso specificity and binding strength of several saturated and zzso fatty acids with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer protein zzso Association between the number, position and zzso of zzso patches and zzso binding properties of the protein was evidenced by zzso zzso zzso affinity is influenced by the number of carbon zzso location of double bonds and zzso group in the zzso zzso The results may direct at developing applications in zzso transport and controlled release of low molecular weight zzso
