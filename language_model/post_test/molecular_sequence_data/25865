We have developed a highly sensitive and rapid zzso zzso for detection and identification of zzso zzso Two sets of zzso zzso were zzso one was for the 19 zzso zzso gene and the other for the zzso J zzso The zzso for 19 zzso zzso gene was found to be specific to the zzso tuberculosis complex; zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso for the zzso J gene was able to detect a broad spectrum of zzso species including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso was similar to that of the culture method for zzso zzso tuberculosis whereas zzso was much more sensitive than the culture for clinical zzso The procedure of decontamination by sodium hydroxide for clinical samples could reduce the viability of zzso tuberculosis while it did not affect zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso among major zzso were also determined following zzso for the zzso J zzso This allowed us to make restriction maps for each zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso for the zzso J gene will be a useful laboratory test for rapid identification of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
