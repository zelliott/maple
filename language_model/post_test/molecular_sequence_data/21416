The human zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso circulation of zzso zzso as well as in cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso acids from the zzso zzso via active sodium zzso in a zzso process, orchestrated by key zzso in zzso loop regions, as well as in zzso zzso Here, we unravel the functional contribution of highly zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso on the zzso transport zzso zzso zzso substitution of individual zzso along the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso resulted in functional impairment of zzso of zzso despite appreciable cell surface expression for all but zzso Cell surface expression of zzso and zzso was rescued upon zzso treatment as well as zzso A, but not by zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso accessibility to zzso zzso remains confined to the zzso half of the zzso along a single, discrete zzso zzso protection from zzso labeling was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso consistent with zzso changes playing a role in zzso accessibility for these zzso zzso zzso was shown to be critical for both zzso acid and sodium zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate in sodium zzso zzso our data demonstrate that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso function and stability, thereby providing further insight in its dynamic transport zzso
