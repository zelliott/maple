To understand the link between bacterial diversity and zzso in zzso groundwater, microbial communities were assessed based on clone libraries of zzso zzso genes from the zzso Oak Ridge Field Research Centre zzso zzso Four groundwater zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a wide range of pH (3 to zzso nitrate (44 to zzso zzso zzso uranium zzso to zzso zzso zzso and other metal contamination, were zzso zzso indicated that bacterial diversity correlated with the zzso of the zzso zzso diversity decreased in relation to the contamination levels of the zzso The highly contaminated well zzso had lower gene diversity than less contaminated zzso zzso zzso and zzso The high zzso of zzso present in well zzso zzso the growth of organisms capable of reducing uranium zzso and zzso nitrate zzso zzso and zzso and iron zzso and which were unique to this zzso The clone libraries consisted primarily of sequences closely related to the zzso zzso with zzso almost exclusively containing this zzso zzso bacteria were present in all four wells, which may suggest that there is potential for successful zzso of the groundwater at the Oak Ridge zzso The microbial community information gained from this study and previous studies at the site can be used to develop zzso zzso and geographical information system zzso based models for microbial populations at the Oak Ridge zzso This will allow for a better understanding of what organisms are likely to occur where and when, based on zzso and how these organisms relate to zzso processes at the zzso
