zzso responsible for zzso infection of T zzso cell lines were identified by functional analysis of zzso zzso clones derived from zzso line zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso envelope loop sequence with that derived from zzso resulted in a virus that is no longer T cell zzso However, the zzso replacement using zzso zzso loop sequences did not zzso upon either zzso or zzso envelope proteins the ability to zzso T cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso viruses were incapable of infection of primary zzso Single, zzso and multiple point zzso made within the zzso loop sequence did not result in change in zzso although zzso involving zzso 275 resulted in a virus that was incapable of infecting primary zzso but retained the ability to zzso zzso T zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso envelope zzso is necessary for T cell line infection, but other zzso in envelope are also necessary to obtain infectious virus zzso
