zzso cassette zzso zzso (ABC zzso have a potential role in drug and zzso zzso Here, we report for the first time the cloning of an ABC zzso from white shrimp zzso zzso zzso along with a study of its zzso zzso and zzso of its expression in different shrimp zzso exposed to cadmium and pH stress zzso and alkaline zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso shares many similarities with the zzso zzso zzso including two zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso cassette (ABC) and zzso domain zzso zzso analyses of transcript levels for zzso in shrimp zzso using reverse transcript zzso revealed the highest transcript level in the zzso less in the zzso and stomach, and none in the other zzso zzso The ABC zzso zzso transcript in the zzso of zzso was significantly zzso after zzso h and 24 h of exposure to alkaline and zzso conditions, zzso zzso was also induced in zzso but was zzso in the stomach under the alkaline zzso Upon exposure to cadmium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso the zzso expression of zzso was zzso zzso (at 6 zzso and zzso (at 12 zzso in the zzso zzso was also induced in the stomach after exposure to zzso zzso zzso cadmium, but zzso in the stomach and zzso after exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso might play an important role in the zzso changes related to metabolism and cell zzso that occur when Pacific white shrimp are exposed to cadmium and pH zzso
