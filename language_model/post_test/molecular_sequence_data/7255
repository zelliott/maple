We report the cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is preceded by an zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso located 81 zzso upstream in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene is followed by an zzso zzso five zzso downstream in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso is most similar to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso zzso has zzso identity to the same gene from zzso coli zzso Secondary structure predictions indicate that the large zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two smaller zzso at zzso zzso and zzso as compared to the corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso has a large zzso zzso at zzso zzso as compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There is no zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso lacks the large zzso present in the zzso zzso of closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso position zzso which is thought to be involved in zzso of zzso zzso precursor molecules into zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is the first zzso zzso zzso sequence for any member of the zzso zzso
