The complete zzso sequence of zzso mosaic virus zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso is composed of zzso zzso excluding the zzso zzso tail, zzso a large zzso of zzso zzso acids with the zzso features typical of a zzso zzso zzso zzso sites were identified by sequence comparison to those of known zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso zzso acid sequence identity to that zzso by the most closely related zzso tobacco vein zzso mosaic zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence and its coding sequences confirmed that zzso formed a cluster with the zzso zzso zzso virus group, most of which zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a distinct member of the zzso zzso
