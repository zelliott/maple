zzso zzso is a liver zzso zzso zzso that is defective in patients with zzso a rare zzso zzso zzso characterized by elevated levels of zzso in blood and zzso Some patients also exhibit mental zzso and growth zzso A full-length zzso for human zzso zzso was isolated from an adult liver zzso zzso The first 22 zzso in the deduced zzso acid sequence exhibit features expected for a zzso targeting zzso The predicted mass of the mature human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso is in good agreement with that observed for rat liver zzso zzso ( approximately 100,000 zzso Human zzso zzso exhibits zzso identity with rat liver zzso zzso and strong zzso ( approximately zzso zzso with rat liver zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso and the regulatory zzso from bovine zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso gene is at least zzso zzso long and located on zzso zzso The adult human liver clone is assembled from 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two smaller zzso zzso isolated from adult liver and infant brain libraries, were assembled from the same zzso zzso gene by the use of alternate zzso and zzso zzso This is the first report of the zzso structure of the zzso zzso gene in any zzso The observed zzso location is consistent with genetic studies with a mouse model for zzso that map the mouse gene to a region of mouse zzso 2 zzso with human zzso The availability of the zzso gene sequence will enable characterization of the zzso of zzso patients with different zzso
