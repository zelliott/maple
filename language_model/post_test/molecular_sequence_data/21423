zzso periodic paralysis zzso is characterized by episodic zzso paralysis of muscle and acute zzso during zzso zzso forms of zzso are predominantly caused by zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso consisting mainly of zzso periodic paralysis zzso and sporadic periodic paralysis zzso is largely zzso Recently, zzso in zzso which encodes a skeletal zzso inwardly zzso zzso channel zzso were reported in some zzso zzso Whether zzso of zzso occur in other patients with zzso zzso and how zzso of the channel zzso patients to paralysis are zzso Here, we report one zzso zzso zzso in zzso in two zzso patients and two separate zzso zzso in two zzso zzso These zzso result in zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid substitution of zzso zzso Compared with the wild type channel, zzso currents of zzso and zzso zzso were reduced by zzso and zzso zzso No current was detected for the zzso zzso Single channel zzso and open probability were reduced for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced cell surface abundance for zzso and zzso All three zzso exerted dominant negative zzso on wild type zzso as well as wild type zzso another zzso channel expressed in the skeletal zzso Thus, zzso of zzso are associated with zzso as well as zzso We suggest that decreased outward zzso current from zzso of zzso zzso the zzso to zzso paradoxical zzso during attacks, which in turn leads to zzso channel zzso and zzso of zzso
