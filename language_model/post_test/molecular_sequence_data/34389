zzso yellow vein virus zzso causes lethal systemic necrosis in zzso including broad bean zzso zzso and pea zzso zzso To identify host genes involved in zzso symptom expression after zzso infection, we screened zzso fragments in which expression was changed in advance of zzso symptom expression in broad bean zzso zzso zzso zzso using the differential display technique and zzso with Northern zzso zzso zzso changes were confirmed in 20 zzso and the six that exhibited the most change were analyzed zzso These six genes included a gene that encodes a putative zzso zzso protein zzso and another was zzso to an zzso gene that encodes a zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso We recently reported that zzso symptom development in zzso pea is associated with expression of salicylic acid zzso zzso zzso proteins and requires zzso host zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso expression was correlated with that of the putative zzso zzso proteins in zzso broad zzso However, broad bean infected with a zzso zzso expressing the zzso protein showed weaker symptoms and less viral zzso than that infected with zzso expressing the zzso zzso These results imply that zzso plays a role in defense against zzso rather than in zzso symptom zzso
