With the aim of identification of zzso proteins we investigated the zzso composition of zzso c zzso zzso complex zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Eleven zzso zzso were visible in zzso two-dimensional Blue zzso zzso zzso Their partial zzso acid sequences indicated that these zzso are zzso The zzso zzso I was detected with the zzso zzso against an internal region of this zzso In two-dimensional (9 versus zzso zzso zzso gels this zzso is found as a series of spots located off the main zzso a property that can be explained by abnormal zzso migration and zzso In gels loaded with high amounts of the zzso zzso active zzso the zzso I spots could be zzso by zzso The determined zzso zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso zzso I zzso matched with the predicted zzso thus indicating that the corresponding zzso zzso zzso is translated into a functional zzso
