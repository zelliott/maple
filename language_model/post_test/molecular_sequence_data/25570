zzso from mice zzso to zzso zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso selected from zzso serum by zzso zzso clone zzso or raised against a specific fusion protein or zzso produced a zzso pattern of zzso on fixed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso protein apparently identical to a zzso protein previously implicated in red cell zzso The cloned DNA zzso to at least seven zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso DNA and to three zzso fragments of similar but not identical zzso These results suggest that the gene zzso the zzso zzso protein may be represented more than once in the zzso zzso zzso
