zzso zzso zzso zzso is a branch point zzso in the zzso zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso used for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The current study showed the production of multiple forms of zzso zzso from a single zzso gene in zzso The zzso resulted from combinations of multiple alternative zzso and two zzso sites in the zzso and zzso zzso These are classified into zzso and zzso zzso based on the zzso of zzso zzso resulting in the difference in deduced zzso acid sequence between the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins expressed in both zzso coli and zzso cells were active and zzso zzso In the case of zzso cells, the latter protein expression level was about zzso relative to the former zzso This was also observed for zzso and zzso zzso When zzso of zzso with zzso regions differing between the zzso and zzso proteins were expressed in zzso cells, the expressed fusion proteins were both found to be active but the latter fusion protein expression level was considerably low compared with the former zzso The expression level of zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso in brain, liver, heart, and zzso but the two expression levels were the same in zzso and zzso During zzso development the total zzso zzso expression level increased, accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso the expression level of zzso zzso zzso active zzso remaining kept zzso These results indicate that the expression level of rat active zzso is at least regulated through the zzso of zzso zzso of its zzso
