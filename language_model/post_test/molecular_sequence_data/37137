zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso protein type II zzso and suppresses the expression of the type II collagen gene ( zzso ) at the zzso zzso To further examine this zzso the responses of zzso regulatory sequences to zzso and the role of components of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso were examined in the immortalized human zzso cell line, zzso zzso inhibited the zzso levels of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso all of which were expressed by these cells as markers of the differentiated zzso zzso suppressed the expression of zzso reporter zzso containing sequences of the zzso promoter spanning zzso to zzso zzso in the absence and presence of the zzso zzso and zzso activity of the zzso site zzso zzso reporter zzso associated with induction of zzso zzso activity in nuclear zzso These responses to zzso were blocked by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or reversed by zzso zzso alpha zzso containing a zzso at zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso promoter expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso cell zzso In the zzso cell line, the response to zzso was rescued by zzso of zzso zzso but not by either zzso alpha zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis using deletion zzso showed that the zzso response was retained in the zzso core promoter region spanning zzso to zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso sequences but no zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity by zzso persisted in the presence of multiple deletions within the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that repression of zzso gene zzso by zzso requires zzso zzso and zzso alpha and suggest that this response involves indirect interaction of activated zzso alpha with the general zzso machinery that drives zzso zzso zzso
