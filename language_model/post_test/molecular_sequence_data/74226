zzso a poorly absorbed zzso zzso is a promising alternative for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso Resistance to this agent has been reported, but no commercial test for zzso resistance exists and the molecular basis of this resistance has not been previously studied in zzso zzso To evaluate whether the zzso zzso would be a suitable substitute for zzso zzso testing in the clinical setting, we analyzed the in zzso zzso zzso of 80 clinical zzso from our collection by zzso dilution and compared these results to zzso zzso results obtained by zzso dilution and zzso We found zzso zzso data to agree with zzso zzso the zzso of both zzso for all zzso were either very low or very zzso Fourteen zzso zzso zzso or zzso 32 zzso unique zzso from patients at diverse locations in three countries were zzso zzso typing analysis showed that nine zzso of these zzso belonged to the epidemic zzso group that is responsible for multiple outbreaks and increased disease severity in the United zzso Europe, and North zzso The molecular basis of zzso and zzso resistance in these zzso was investigated by sequence analysis of zzso which encodes the beta zzso of zzso zzso the target of zzso zzso zzso sequence differences that resulted in specific zzso acid zzso in an otherwise zzso region of zzso were found in all resistant zzso Seven different zzso zzso acid zzso were identified in the resistant zzso which were divided into five distinct groups by restriction zzso analysis zzso These results suggest that the zzso acid zzso associated with zzso resistance were independently derived rather than zzso from specific zzso zzso We propose that zzso resistance in zzso zzso results from zzso in zzso and that zzso resistance predicts zzso resistance for this zzso
