The zzso protein is indispensable for zzso genetic zzso in zzso zzso This protein alone promotes the zzso formation of zzso joint molecules and their processing in zzso Through the use of a set of zzso protein mouse zzso zzso we have been attempting to divide the whole process into elementary steps to determine the basic functions of the zzso In order to correlate the basic functions with the active sites on the zzso zzso we located the zzso for the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso by means of zzso experiments and an zzso zzso zzso involving isolated zzso zzso or synthetic ones derived from various regions of the zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso both of which are shown to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso and the formation of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso were found to be located between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso respectively, on the zzso zzso zzso zzso had been shown to interfere with the zzso interaction between two zzso protein zzso and zzso had been suggested to inhibit the binding of zzso DNA to the zzso zzso The zzso for zzso and zzso were found to be located in a approximately zzso acid region at the C zzso These results suggest the locations of the active sites and a functional core on the zzso zzso
