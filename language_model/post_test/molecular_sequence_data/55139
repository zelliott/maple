zzso comprise a family of zzso peptides zzso sharing a highly zzso zzso domain, and play a central role in the innate defense against infection in most of zzso But so far it has not yet been found in zzso although a large number of other groups of zzso have been zzso In the current work, the first zzso zzso zzso has been characterized from the zzso skin of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso containing 48 zzso acid zzso zzso with 12 basic zzso and no zzso zzso The chemical zzso zzso efficiently killed bacteria and some zzso species including clinically isolated zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso precursor was cloned from the skin zzso library of zzso zzso As other zzso the precursor of zzso also contains highly zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso inhibitor followed by the zzso zzso at zzso zzso analysis revealed that as connecting zzso the zzso zzso predates zzso but zzso fish zzso The zzso zzso combined with gene cloning results confirms the presence of zzso in zzso and filled the evolutionary gap of zzso in zzso considering zzso special niche as the animals bridging the evolutionary zzso zzso
