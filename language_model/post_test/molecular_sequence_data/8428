zzso is a zzso membrane protein that continuously zzso between the zzso zzso intermediate compartment zzso and the zzso To identify the targeting signals that mediate this recycling, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso By monitoring zzso H resistance, we measured the loss from the zzso cycle of zzso A domain exchange approach with the plasma membrane reporter protein zzso showed that the zzso and the zzso zzso are not zzso while the zzso domain of zzso is required and sufficient for zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso domain on zzso lead to increased zzso by zzso zzso indicating that this domain alone cannot provide for unbiased recycling through the zzso zzso Complete progress through the zzso recycling zzso requires the zzso domain acting together with the zzso domain of zzso zzso of the zzso domain revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso targeting zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the two zzso zzso influence the zzso They reduce the zzso capacity of the zzso signal and zzso the zzso zzso
