A putative zzso site in the double strand origin zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was identified by comparing the zzso sequence of the zzso region with those of two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso sequence of this putative zzso site, zzso was similar to the consensus sequence of the zzso site of the zzso group of zzso When several point zzso were introduced into this zzso zzso the transformation abilities of the zzso zzso molecules for zzso zzso were either reduced or zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that these zzso plasmids could not replicate in zzso zzso but were integrated into the zzso zzso
