Recent advances in DNA sequencing and zzso offer the opportunity for reliable estimates of divergence times between organisms based on molecular zzso zzso zzso of divergence times that do not assume the molecular clock use time constraints at multiple zzso usually based on the fossil records, as major boundary zzso However, the fossil records of zzso zzso may not adequately provide effective time constraints at multiple zzso We explored an alternative source of time constraints in zzso zzso by evaluating a zzso hypothesis concerning freshwater zzso from the family zzso zzso zzso 

We added new zzso sequence data from six zzso species and conducted zzso analyses using a large zzso data zzso We found a zzso zzso of African and zzso zzso and their sister group relationship to some zzso zzso zzso zzso Sparks and zzso All of these zzso clustered with a zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sparks and zzso The results of the zzso analyses and divergence time zzso between zzso zzso zzso were much more zzso with zzso origin and zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso between major zzso 

We propose to add the zzso assumption of zzso zzso by zzso fragmentation as effective time constraints in dating zzso divergence zzso We conducted divergence time zzso among zzso by incorporating these additional time constraints and achieved a considerable reduction in credibility intervals in the estimated divergence zzso
