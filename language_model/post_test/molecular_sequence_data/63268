zzso DNA models available in the literature are often effective models where the zzso state only zzso or zzso is zzso Because of a decrease by a factor of 30 of the effective zzso rigidity of a sequence of broken bonds, or bubble, compared to the double stranded state, the inclusion of the molecular zzso degrees of freedom in a more general zzso model is zzso In this paper we do so by presenting a one-dimensional zzso model, which describes the internal zzso states, coupled to a discrete zzso chain model describing the chain zzso zzso Palmeri, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso zzso This coupled model is exactly solved using a transfer zzso technique that presents an zzso with the path integral treatment of a quantum two-state zzso zzso When the chain fluctuations are integrated out, the zzso transition temperature and zzso emerge naturally as an explicit function of the model parameters of a well defined zzso revealing that the transition is driven by the difference in zzso zzso zzso free energy between bubble and zzso zzso The calculated melting curve zzso of open base zzso is in good agreement with the experimental melting profile of zzso and, by inserting the zzso known zzso zzso leads to physically reasonable values for the bare zzso model zzso Among the zzso quantities explicitly calculated within this model are the zzso zzso and mechanical features of the DNA zzso such as bubble correlation length and two distinct chain persistence zzso The predicted variation of the zzso radius as a function of temperature leads to a coherent explanation for the zzso observed zzso zzso zzso Finally, the influence of the DNA strand length is studied in detail, underlining the importance of finite size effects, even for DNA made of several thousand base zzso zzso limiting formulas, useful for analyzing experiments, are given for the fraction of broken base pairs, zzso and chain correlation functions, effective persistence zzso and chain zzso zzso all as a function of temperature and DNA zzso
