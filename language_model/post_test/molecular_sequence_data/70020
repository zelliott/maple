We have studied the structure and function of the insulin zzso in a patient zzso with severe insulin resistance and zzso zzso zzso binding to cultured zzso from zzso was almost not zzso and zzso insulin zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The structure of the zzso gene was zzso by sequencing amplified products of the 22 zzso with the zzso zzso regions directly as well as after zzso in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of the insulin zzso gene were zzso One zzso contains zzso 12 additional base pairs in zzso 3 coding for the zzso acids zzso located between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso domain, being the first report of an zzso zzso of the insulin zzso zzso In the other zzso zzso in zzso 2 is changed into a stop zzso zzso zzso is compound zzso at the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing indicates that both zzso zzso are expressed in the patient's zzso Studies of the parents' zzso revealed that zzso inherited the zzso zzso from the father and the nonsense zzso from the zzso zzso binding to zzso of the mother was reduced zzso of control zzso and hormone binding to the father's cells shows a larger reduction zzso of control zzso but less severe than the patient's cells zzso of zzso This investigation provides further evidence that the zzso syndrome is zzso related to zzso in the insulin zzso zzso
