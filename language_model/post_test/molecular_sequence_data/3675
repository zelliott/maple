zzso an zzso zzso protein composed of two zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso change that provides a surface for target zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to probe the contributions of the zzso and zzso regions of zzso to zzso zzso These contributions were zzso using zzso zzso zzso proteins lacking the zzso seven zzso or nine zzso zzso or containing zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso or both zzso Both zzso and zzso bound zzso less tightly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating these zzso are important for zzso zzso The truncated zzso proteins bound zzso much more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating the zzso region contributed about 50% to the binding of zzso while the zzso contributed the remaining 50% of the binding zzso Based on zzso and zzso chemical shift studies, a comparison with known zzso protein complexes showed the zzso complex has the strongest resemblance to the zzso II zzso
