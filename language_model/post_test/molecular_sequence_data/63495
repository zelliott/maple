zzso are very important due to their unique zzso such as zzso social behavior and the production of diverse and novel zzso secondary zzso However, the lack of autonomously replicating plasmids has hindered genetic manipulation of zzso for zzso To determine whether indigenous plasmids are present, we screened about 150 zzso zzso and a circular zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso was zzso zzso long and had a zzso content of zzso zzso open reading frames were found in the zzso and 14 of them were not zzso to any known zzso zzso containing the gene designated zzso which encodes a large unknown zzso were shown to transform zzso zzso zzso and zzso at high zzso ( approximately zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the locus is responsible for the autonomous replication of zzso zzso zzso were constructed for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is essential for zzso formation and social zzso in zzso zzso was cloned into the shuttle zzso and introduced into the zzso zzso zzso The zzso subsequently exhibited the ability to form zzso and social zzso zzso replicating zzso zzso provides a new tool for genetic manipulation in zzso
