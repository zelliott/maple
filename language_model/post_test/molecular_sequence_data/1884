In the zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso DNA is zzso and maintained in the host zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso is a key factor for maintaining viral zzso zzso binds to the terminal repeat zzso DNA of the viral zzso leading to its zzso to specific dot structures in the zzso In such an infected cell, the expression of the viral genes is restricted by a mechanism that is still zzso Here, we found that zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso a key component of zzso formation, as determined by use of a DNA pull-down zzso with a zzso DNA zzso that contained a zzso binding sequence and a zzso protein pull-down zzso The diffuse zzso of zzso on the zzso of zzso cells changed to a zzso one with the introduction of a bacterial artificial zzso containing most of the zzso region, and zzso clearly zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso in zzso cells seemed to include zzso as well as zzso protein zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso and the open reading frame zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso lay within the zzso during zzso zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that zzso recruits zzso components to the viral zzso which may lead to the establishment of viral zzso and govern the zzso zzso
