zzso zzso acids having natural zzso were useful for the interaction zzso of zzso A zzso containing the whole structure of an zzso was easily prepared by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were introduced into the zzso zzso acid while maintaining the whole structure of zzso By using these labeled zzso zzso polarization zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso analyzed the zzso interaction in a solution zzso zzso
