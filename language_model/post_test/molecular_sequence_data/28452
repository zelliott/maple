The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso B, zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso An zzso coli zzso containing the zzso gene cluster of zzso was used as the source of the zzso zzso The zzso fragments used for sequencing were generated by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains 308 zzso and has a molecular weight of zzso To determine the zzso site, the zzso zzso containing zzso was treated with zzso sodium zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso map comparisons with an zzso zzso digest and monitoring zzso incorporation allowed identification of the zzso zzso which was then isolated and zzso The zzso site is the zzso zzso at position zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso B is zzso identical with that of zzso coli, differing in only eight zzso acid zzso zzso comparisons of zzso B to other known zzso sequences revealed limited sequence similarity zzso when zzso zzso acid zzso are allowed and alignments were forced to occur on the zzso zzso
