A synthetic gene zzso the Group II zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been constructed and expressed with high efficiency in zzso zzso No zzso activity was recovered when the zzso contained the zzso Met zzso Replacement of an zzso zzso penultimate to the zzso Met with zzso or zzso permitted removal of the zzso Met by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso inclusion bodies and were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation confirmed the removal of the zzso Met and confirmed the sequence of the first 40 zzso of zzso zzso The zzso proteins were zzso to apparent zzso and showed the same specific activity as the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the same zzso of zzso as the wild type zzso on large zzso of zzso zzso
