zzso are known to affect the zzso growth, and metabolism of zzso and thus may serve as candidate molecules for a zzso control strategy for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso variable zzso zzso zzso are easy to engineer and express in plants, but their zzso effects on zzso have never been evaluated and compared with those of zzso and zzso zzso We describe the zzso growth, and zzso metabolism of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso directed against the zzso membrane protein zzso We showed that the zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso metabolism but were as efficient as zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso growth in liquid zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso
