The seven members of the zzso killer gene family in zzso bacteria are described zzso The members of this gene family have been zzso and include zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso from plasmids zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso which are located on the zzso coli zzso The killer proteins zzso by these zzso are highly toxic zzso of 50 to 52 zzso zzso The proteins kill the cells from the inside by interfering with a vital function in the cell zzso On the basis of their zzso the killer proteins and their corresponding zzso are divided into four zzso The members of one zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso maintenance by killing zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were discovered through their abilities to cause membrane damage and degradation of stable zzso zzso and zzso which constitute the zzso zzso were found because of their sequence similarity at the DNA and protein levels with other members of the zzso gene zzso However, no function has been described for the proteins belonging to this zzso Although the four zzso are zzso related in terms of DNA and protein sequence zzso the overall genetic organization of the different zzso has been well zzso during zzso The expression of all of the members of the zzso gene family is regulated zzso Thus, the expression of the zzso and zzso genes is regulated by small zzso zzso that inhibit the translation of the stable zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of structural and functional similarities, we suggest that each of the related zzso killer genes is regulated by zzso zzso The conservation of this widespread gene family in zzso bacteria suggests that the genes are important to the zzso that carry zzso
