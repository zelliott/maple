zzso can undergo zzso or zzso programmed cell death zzso on exposure to zzso agents, zzso signals, and stress zzso zzso zzso can also exhibit a form of cell death called zzso zzso zzso triggered by fusion between two genetically incompatible zzso With the availability of recently zzso zzso of zzso zzso and several related species, we were able to define putative components of zzso death pathways and the ancestral core zzso machinery shared by all zzso and zzso 

zzso profiling of zzso proteins from four zzso and seven other zzso species revealed zzso protein families, orphan zzso and core genes zzso across all zzso and zzso The zzso domain zzso include zzso family zzso which may function as key zzso of stress and zzso availability zzso They are often found fused to putative zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and a newly identified domain, zzso Many putative zzso zzso and zzso are specific to zzso zzso and not found in zzso zzso In addition to their role in zzso several of them appear to be involved in regulation of cell cycle, development and sexual zzso Finally, the zzso possess many putative downstream components of the zzso zzso machinery including several proteins not found in the model zzso zzso zzso 

Our analysis identified more than 100 putative zzso associated genes in the zzso which may help expand the range of currently available treatments for zzso and other invasive zzso zzso The list includes zzso protein families as well as zzso core components of the ancestral zzso machinery shared by zzso and zzso
