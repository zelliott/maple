The zzso motif is a sequence of zzso zzso acids that has been identified in a number of zzso proteins of the inner nuclear membrane including the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso This evolutionary zzso sequence motif can mediate via the interaction with the small protein zzso the binding of zzso proteins to zzso Taking advantage of its zzso zzso we analyzed whether zzso possesses beside zzso additional genes coding for proteins with a zzso zzso A putative candidate gene was the zzso gene zzso which we named zzso Of all putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited the highest similarity in the zzso motif zzso identical zzso zzso The zzso gene can code for two zzso of 399 and zzso zzso acids that are produced by alternative zzso In the zzso a zzso domain is localized close to the zzso This segment is absent in the shorter zzso By zzso we could show that in the zzso the zzso coding for the zzso and in significantly lower amounts the zzso coding for the zzso are zzso When expressed in zzso cells as zzso fusion zzso the zzso is localized predominantly in the zzso and the zzso is targeted to the nuclear zzso indicating that zzso is localized in the inner nuclear zzso zzso is the zzso zzso expressed in cells, larvae, and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso on zzso and cultured cells revealed that zzso proteins are localized in the nuclear envelope and in the zzso By zzso interference we have zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso had no influence on the viability of zzso cells and the zzso zzso of all other nuclear and nuclear envelope proteins zzso In contrast, when zzso zzso was reduced by zzso the distribution of zzso and zzso in the nuclear envelope of zzso cells was significantly zzso We conclude that the two zzso proteins zzso and zzso are no limiting components for the maintenance of the nuclear architecture in cultured zzso cells at zzso
