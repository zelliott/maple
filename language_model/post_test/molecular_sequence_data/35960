We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso (the zzso for zzso that is related to the fly fork head and rat zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the organizer region of zzso zzso as a direct zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells of all three germ zzso In zzso zzso expression is graded with highest levels zzso zzso neural plate cells that give rise to the floor plate zzso express zzso apparently in response to induction by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the development of the neural zzso suppressing the differentiation of anterior and zzso neural cell types but causing an expansion of the zzso neural zzso Our results suggest that zzso functions in the induction and patterning of the neural zzso
