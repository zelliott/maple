The development of a protective immune response in sheep towards the presence of the zzso stage of Lucilia zzso has not been reported in the zzso Upon investigation of the effects of zzso zzso material on zzso T zzso zzso we isolated a 56 zzso protein capable of zzso zzso proliferation by at least zzso compared with that in the presence of zzso zzso This protein inhibited proliferation induced through zzso of the zzso zzso as well as proliferation induced zzso through the stimulation of the protein zzso C zzso zzso The zzso named blowfly zzso zzso protein zzso was shown to bind directly to zzso Further investigation revealed that the zzso prevented a proportion of zzso from entering the first division following zzso by affecting the early events in zzso zzso zzso the zzso reduced zzso expression on T zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was zzso in response to the zzso These effects suggest zzso zzso of T zzso in the presence of the zzso and we propose that the zzso presents an effective immune evasion tactic for the larvae of zzso zzso
