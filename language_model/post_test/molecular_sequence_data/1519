The basic zzso zzso factors zzso by the zzso gene function at the zzso of a zzso hierarchy involving zzso early B cell factor zzso and zzso which is essential for B zzso In committed B lineage zzso zzso proteins have also been shown to regulate many zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the block in B zzso imposed by the absence of zzso can be overcome by expression of zzso but not zzso indicating that zzso is the essential target of zzso required for development of B lineage zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso in zzso with low levels of alternative zzso proteins zzso zzso is sufficient to promote expression of most B lineage zzso zzso however, we find that zzso proteins are required for zzso zzso proliferation due, in part, to a role for zzso in optimal expression of zzso zzso high levels of E protein activity are essential for the zzso of zzso and zzso whereas lower levels of E protein activity, in zzso with other B lineage zzso factors, are sufficient for expression of most B lineage zzso
