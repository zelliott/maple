zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear protein induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso results in zzso cell cycle zzso How this gene is regulated by zzso in the cell differentiation process is still zzso In this study, we observed that zzso of zzso was present during the zzso zzso cell differentiation process, suggesting the functional relevance between zzso and zzso cellular zzso In order to further define the zzso regulation of zzso by zzso we analyzed the promoter region of zzso About zzso zzso zzso sequence of this gene was cloned into zzso zzso and its core promoter region was identified through systemic zzso Interestingly, zzso promoter containing several potential zzso sites of zzso was activated by zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso in latter rescued the zzso effect of zzso promoter in response to zzso and zzso Our evidence supported that zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which was associated with the zzso zzso cell differentiation and potentially zzso the downstream effects of zzso signal zzso via zzso in some cancer zzso
