The cellular components required to form the 3' ends of small nuclear zzso are zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is found in two forms that differ in length at their 3' ends zzso and zzso When added to a zzso cell free zzso synthetic zzso zzso bearing downstream zzso sequences is processed efficiently and accurately to generate both mature forms of zzso The two forms of zzso are produced in zzso by alternative zzso zzso A zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso III blocks zzso of zzso in zzso In zzso alternative zzso of the zzso precursor by zzso III determines the choice between the two zzso pathways that lead to zzso and zzso one of which zzso is strictly dependent on zzso zzso These results identify zzso III as a zzso factor involved in zzso formation of zzso and show how zzso III might regulate alternative zzso processing zzso
