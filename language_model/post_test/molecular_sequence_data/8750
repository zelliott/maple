Two activated transforming zzso of human zzso were found to possess single point zzso within the regulatory zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso domain zzso in zzso zzso respectively, that do not directly interfere with either the regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso site zzso or the zzso zzso In zzso both zzso proteins are zzso on their zzso regulatory zzso and are zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso proteins exhibited resistance to zzso by zzso relative to zzso zzso Under these in zzso conditions, zzso zzso was found to be zzso by zzso to zzso levels, while zzso zzso was not zzso zzso The ability of zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso was also impaired, suggesting that zzso is unable to recognize zzso zzso as an efficient zzso In the case of zzso zzso examination of whether its zzso zzso were accessible to the zzso regulatory zzso revealed a highly reduced ability of zzso zzso zzso to bind to a synthetic zzso zzso from the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso zzso with high zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso zzso results in an altered or reduced accessibility of the zzso domain of the zzso form of zzso zzso and may represent a previously zzso mode of zzso zzso Further study of these and other zzso zzso may offer additional new insights into the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
