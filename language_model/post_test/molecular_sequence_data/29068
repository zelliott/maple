To determine whether the native zzso of zzso are zzso stabilized early in the folding of these small zzso the rates and zzso for zzso formation were measured for three zzso of zzso zzso In each zzso one of the three pairs of zzso zzso zzso was replaced with Ala zzso leaving four zzso zzso that can form six zzso with one zzso and three species with two zzso For each zzso all of the zzso species were identified, and the equilibrium zzso for forming the individual species via exchange with oxidized and reduced zzso were zzso These equilibrium zzso represent effective zzso of the zzso zzso and ranged from zzso to zzso M in the fully reduced zzso There was little or no preference for forming the native zzso and the zzso for forming the first and second zzso decreased only slightly upon the addition of 8 M zzso The data for the zzso zzso together with equilibrium data for the zzso form, were also used to estimate effective zzso for forming a third zzso once two native zzso are zzso These effective zzso were approximately 100 and 10 M in the presence of 0 and 8 M zzso zzso The results indicate that there is little or no preferential formation of native interactions in the folding of these molecules until two zzso have formed, after which there is a high degree of zzso among the native zzso
