zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso gene zzso that zzso a step in zzso and zzso and acts as a zzso zzso associated with aggressive zzso zzso has been correlated significantly with breast cancer progression and poor prognosis in breast zzso We show here that zzso expression of zzso induced zzso transition zzso in zzso normal human breast zzso cells, and zzso of zzso expression triggered zzso transition zzso in aggressive zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was shown by zzso changes and loss of zzso zzso zzso which is zzso with the induction of the zzso zzso zzso Snail and zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso suppressed zzso marker expressions and enhanced zzso marker zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso interference in zzso cells induced the reverse processes of zzso including altered cell shape, gain of zzso marker, and reduction of zzso marker, zzso zzso Taken together, the results show the involvement of zzso in both zzso and MET: zzso of zzso zzso zzso in normal breast zzso cells and reduction of zzso expression led to zzso in aggressive breast cancer zzso These results suggest for the first time that zzso is a key gene to both zzso in the initiating step of cancer zzso and zzso in the later stage of zzso during breast cancer zzso
