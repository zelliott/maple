zzso hormone receptors regulate mouse zzso tumor virus zzso gene expression by binding to hormone response DNA elements present in the long terminal zzso zzso expression of zzso is unlikely to be regulated by steroid zzso complex alone, and zzso zzso factors might play a role in the zzso zzso zzso In this report we have investigated the function of a novel zzso element designated zzso zzso to zzso which is located adjacent to the zzso zzso response element, in steroid zzso zzso of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicate that cellular factors bind to the zzso element, and zzso stimulation results in zzso in the binding pattern of proteins in this zzso By transient zzso zzso using wild type and deletion zzso of the zzso element, we show that this novel zzso element is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso and functions in zzso tumor cells but not in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence suggests that the entire zzso element functioning as one unit is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso When placed in the context of zzso zzso neither zzso element nor zzso response element is able to induce significant zzso zzso of zzso The presence of both the DNA elements in tandem results in optimal induction of zzso in the presence of steroid zzso Our results also indicate that the zzso element functions in human breast zzso cell lines such as zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso element in combination with zzso zzso response element functions as a zzso zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso
