This study was undertaken to estimate the relative zzso of 13 zzso motifs in the rice zzso as a basis for efficient development of a zzso zzso Two zzso seven zzso and four zzso repeat motifs were end zzso and used as zzso zzso to screen zzso and zzso libraries of rice, zzso zzso zzso washing temperatures for identification of clones containing specific zzso motifs were estimated based on washing temperatures near zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso degrees zzso zzso of 20 zzso positive clones corresponding to each of 4 zzso motifs suggested that while zzso provides a useful predictor of washing stringency for most of the repeats zzso those with a very high zzso or AT content were most prone to zzso The results from screening the rice zzso library suggest that there are an estimated zzso zzso and 1230 zzso zzso in the rice zzso and that the relative frequency of different repeats decreased with increasing size of the zzso The most frequently observed zzso in the zzso library were the same as for zzso library, but no zzso zzso or zzso motifs were observed among zzso in this zzso
