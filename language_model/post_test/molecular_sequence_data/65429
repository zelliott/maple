zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso but whose zzso zzso gene family encodes three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso reaction center protein of zzso zzso Under standard culture conditions zzso exhibits zzso II electron zzso but several clear modifications in the zzso potential of key zzso bound by the zzso protein are zzso in the zzso zzso In other zzso dynamic expression of multiple zzso genes and turnover of zzso zzso is critical to counter zzso zzso We found that each of zzso five zzso genes is zzso with transcript zzso spanning zzso orders of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identical zzso form zzso are zzso expressed and dominate the zzso transcript pool under control zzso zzso zzso was strongly induced under zzso high zzso stress, thereby contributing to a large increase in the zzso transcript pool that allowed cells to maintain their zzso protein pools and then recover from zzso stress, within one cellular zzso In contrast, under comparable zzso provoked by zzso the cells were unable to maintain their zzso transcript and zzso protein pools, and showed limited subsequent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso two divergent zzso zzso showed consistent trace expression but were never zzso significant contributors to the zzso transcript zzso
