zzso structures of the zzso zzso protein zzso have been investigated with a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso and by limited zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso were obtained by zzso with zzso expressed human zzso and zzso zzso Among them, ten and three zzso reacted specifically with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that major zzso zzso were located at two restricted regions of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso Region I) and zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a highly charged region and a region near the C zzso zzso Taken together with the characteristics of the zzso acid zzso these two zzso regions appeared to be exposed at the outer surface of zzso We further investigated the domain structures of zzso by limited zzso in combination with zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at low zzso revealed the existence of major susceptible sites at zzso zzso and zzso zzso at higher zzso zzso caused successive zzso only toward the zzso direction from these sites, and Region I was included in the region selectively deleted during this process, thereby further suggesting its surface zzso From these results, we propose three domain structures of zzso consisting of zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso sensitivity and zzso further suggest that every domain is composed of two zzso This is the first study describing the domain structures and the zzso regions of zzso
