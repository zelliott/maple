As shown in the accompanying paper, the magnetic zzso interaction between zzso zzso pairs can be exploited to measure distances in T4 zzso a protein of known zzso To evaluate this potentially powerful method for general use, particularly with membrane proteins that are difficult to zzso both a zzso metal zzso binding site and a zzso side chain were introduced at selected positions in the zzso zzso of zzso coli, a paradigm for zzso membrane zzso Thus, three individual zzso zzso were introduced into putative zzso IV of a zzso zzso zzso devoid of native zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso metal zzso binding site in the form of six zzso zzso zzso in the zzso loop between zzso III and zzso In addition, the construct contained a zzso zzso domain in the middle zzso loop to facilitate zzso After zzso and spin zzso electron zzso resonance zzso were obtained with the zzso proteins in the absence and presence of zzso The results demonstrate that positions zzso 111, and 121 are 8, 14, and zzso 23 A from the metal binding zzso These data are consistent with an zzso zzso of zzso domain IV of the zzso Application of the technique to determine zzso packing in zzso zzso is zzso
