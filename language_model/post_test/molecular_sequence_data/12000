zzso structural genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso B zzso were expressed in zzso coli under the control of a regulated zzso Upon zzso high levels of proteins of zzso zzso and 75,000 were zzso zzso and zzso of these proteins yielded an zzso with bacterial DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso activity of the zzso zzso required zzso zzso and zzso Like other bacterial DNA zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso was inhibited by low concentration of the classical zzso B zzso zzso zzso and zzso Older zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, had no effect on the zzso activity at 400 to 800 zzso However, in zzso zzso to show the zzso of zzso activity and stimulation of zzso complex formation demonstrated that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso DNA zzso The availability of highly zzso zzso DNA zzso could aid in future investigations of zzso derivatives targeting zzso zzso
