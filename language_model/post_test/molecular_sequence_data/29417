A new zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the roots of zzso barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcript levels of zzso in roots strongly correlated with iron nutritional status, and induction by zzso was restricted to zzso Excess treatment with heavy metal zzso such as copper, zzso and zzso did not cause obvious zzso induction in either leaves or zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso and has features typical of zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is closely related to the zzso ABC protein zzso which includes zzso zzso associated with zzso processing zzso A zzso expressed fusion protein of zzso to green fluorescent protein zzso was localized to zzso in zzso tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso are thought to comprise a new class of ABC zzso located in the zzso of higher zzso A possible zzso adaptation role for zzso in barley root cells, involving transport across the zzso is zzso
