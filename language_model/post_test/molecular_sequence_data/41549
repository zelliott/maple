zzso zzso is currently regarded as the main zzso zzso domestic zzso whereas the reports of zzso zzso in domestic and wild zzso largely remain zzso This paper reports on pulmonary infestation caused by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in two kittens and zzso for the first time, associated clinical presentations and pathological zzso zzso molecular and zzso analyses have also been conducted to differentiate here the examined zzso species from zzso zzso towards a clearer zzso of zzso affecting zzso 

Two kittens were referred for respiratory distress and hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe zzso based on the presence of zzso larvae in the zzso Despite prompt treatment, kittens died within 48 zzso Both kittens were submitted to zzso to determine the cause of zzso 

At zzso zzso specimens were found in the zzso zzso and zzso and were associated with respiratory signs zzso zzso zzso severe coughing and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of adult zzso found allowed the unequivocal identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso even if first stage larvae were rather similar to those of zzso zzso Briefly, zzso zzso and zzso zzso larvae were shorter in length and lacking the typical zzso terminal end of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses zzso zzso identification and provided data on zzso and zzso DNA genes of zzso zzso 

Data presented here indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso may cause major respiratory distress in domestic zzso zzso these two species should be included, along with zzso zzso in the differential diagnosis of cat zzso zzso and treatment protocols need to be zzso Through research on the biology, epidemiology and control of zzso zzso zzso in domestic cats are zzso to implement current knowledge on these neglected zzso
