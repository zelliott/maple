zzso an zzso of zzso zzso known primarily as a zzso zzso zzso was detected recently also in the zzso of several zzso Here we provide zzso insight on the targeting function of its putative nuclear zzso signal zzso sequences using molecular zzso zzso zzso cells and binding to various zzso The synthetic sequence zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso targeted zzso bound fluorescent zzso to the zzso via classical zzso zzso mechanism employing zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso This transport was inhibited by wheat germ zzso and zzso The sequence zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso proved ineffective in nuclear targeting if zzso to zzso labeled zzso Nonetheless, zzso or either of its basic clusters directed to the zzso soybean zzso inhibitor that can pass the nuclear pore complex zzso moreover, an expressed 58 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also imported into the nucleus by import factors of zzso zzso or by zzso zzso or zzso complexes and localized to the zzso We conclude that the putative zzso zzso itself is a zzso targeting zzso and for nuclear import zzso requires a larger sequence around it or, zzso the zzso zzso
