The rat zzso of split- and zzso zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso was investigated under various zzso The level was decreased in the zzso rat liver and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso zzso was induced in rat zzso by feeding a zzso zzso To analyze the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of the rat zzso gene zzso the gene was zzso It was approximately zzso in length and consists of five zzso and four zzso To investigate the zzso regulatory region of this zzso zzso zzso reporter plasmids were zzso into zzso zzso A functional analysis of zzso zzso revealed that two E box sequences between zzso and zzso are mainly responsible for promoter zzso Although upstream zzso factors zzso bound to the element in zzso zzso failed to stimulate promoter activity from the element using the zzso zzso zzso other E zzso zzso factors differing from zzso proteins or zzso proteins are necessary for zzso stimulation of the rat zzso zzso
