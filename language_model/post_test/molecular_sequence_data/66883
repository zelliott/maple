zzso zzso at specific zzso zzso brings about various downstream events that are zzso by different zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso represents a new class of zzso zzso recognition zzso that is important for recruiting zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso tail as well as for global and zzso zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structures of full-length zzso zzso and its complexes with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The structures reveal that zzso is able to bind all of these zzso zzso zzso but only zzso zzso forms extra interactions with zzso by use of both zzso hydrogen bonding and the altered zzso of the modified zzso zzso We propose a mechanism for the involvement of zzso in binding and presenting zzso zzso for further zzso as a component of zzso zzso
