The simultaneous production of zzso and zzso oxide by zzso human zzso leads to the formation of zzso a zzso important zzso zzso We have investigated two possible pathways for the zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso through zzso of the tightly bound zzso zzso zzso and direct interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso Studies of two model peptides indicated that the zzso binding to zzso of a typical zzso zzso zzso significantly prevented Met zzso in zzso by zzso In contrast, binding of the putative zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso to zzso only marginally prevented the zzso of Met zzso in zzso When the native zzso complex was exposed to zzso zzso was zzso toward zzso Nevertheless, even small amounts of zzso abolished the activity of zzso through direct interaction with the zzso The loss of activity was paralleled by a decrease in zzso zzso and a shift of the zzso maximum from zzso to 409 zzso The presence of the zzso zzso during zzso exposure did not prevent zzso of the zzso but altered the change of the zzso spectrum, zzso a shift of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso rather than to 409 zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso through changes in the zzso or its environment in zzso rather than via zzso of the zzso zzso
