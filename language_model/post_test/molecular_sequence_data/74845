Among zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso initially zzso zzso were tested by improved conventional zzso methods zzso zzso extraction with zzso and zzso N zzso latex zzso zzso and use of zzso against all known zzso zzso zzso and II to zzso and a molecular zzso identification system zzso zzso reverse line zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso sites in the region spanning zzso to zzso zzso were assigned to 71 zzso of the zzso zzso by using zzso and to 204 zzso of them by zzso zzso of a portion of the zzso region of 141 persistently zzso zzso and 1 with zzso conventional and molecular zzso results was zzso Major zzso were identified in 34 zzso zzso including 11 zzso from which no zzso were obtained and 23 zzso with sequence variation compared with published zzso of the latter, 21 zzso were associated with zzso acid zzso By contrast, zzso were identified in only 12 zzso of 516 zzso zzso for which this region has been zzso zzso In zzso an improved zzso scheme allowed zzso identification of more than one-third of the previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were assigned to almost all of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso (with no zzso or with associated zzso acid zzso were found in the zzso region of a higher proportion of zzso than of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso but further investigation is needed to determine the genetic basis for most zzso zzso zzso
