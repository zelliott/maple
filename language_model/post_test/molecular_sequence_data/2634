Basic zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins characteristically have a molecular weight of 18,000 which is consistent with the predicted primary translation product of 155 zzso acids from the zzso More recently, higher molecular weight forms of zzso have been identified but their structural relationship to the commonly known zzso zzso has not been zzso We now show that a zzso zzso zzso from guinea pig brain tissue is an zzso extended and zzso modified form of the growth zzso Although the exact nature of the zzso modifications has not been determined, circumstantial evidence suggests that they may be zzso zzso
