The zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso component zzso form the structural core of the human zzso zzso complex by providing the binding sites for two other component zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite a high similarity between the primary structures of zzso and zzso the zzso domain of human zzso is highly specific to human zzso whereas the zzso domain of human zzso is highly specific to human zzso In this study, we characterized binding of human zzso to the zzso domain of zzso by zzso zzso at zzso resolution, and we used this structural information to interpret the specificity for selective zzso Two zzso of zzso form a single recognition site for the zzso domain of zzso through their zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of zzso insert themselves into the surface of both zzso zzso zzso Numerous zzso and hydrogen bonds between the zzso of three interacting zzso chains adjacent to the central zzso patch add to the stability of the zzso The specificity of pairing for human zzso with zzso is interpreted from its zzso structure to be most likely due to zzso rigidity of the binding zzso of the zzso domain of zzso and its exquisite zzso acid match with the zzso target zzso
