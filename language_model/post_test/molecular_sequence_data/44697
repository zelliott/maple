We have constructed a physical map of a zzso zzso region on mouse zzso 6 that contains the natural killer gene complex zzso The map comprises a zzso of 14 overlapping zzso artificial zzso onto which we positioned 25 zzso zzso zzso genetically linked genes zzso zzso 17 proteins that directly control innate zzso zzso tumor zzso and disease zzso zzso we show that zzso genes are clustered in a region flanked by zzso and zzso genes and that most zzso genes are clustered in a zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intervals of mouse zzso 6 and human zzso zzso that include the zzso are zzso zzso species conservation suggests that the human zzso may contain zzso for the mouse viral disease resistance zzso zzso and zzso The high-resolution zzso map will facilitate investigation of zzso gene regulation and identification of zzso defined gene products that zzso zzso cell defense against viral zzso
