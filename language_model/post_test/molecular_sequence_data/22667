To investigate the possibility that natural medicines affect zzso metabolism by regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso a green fluorescent protein zzso gene was constructed downstream of the zzso zzso response element zzso and the constructed zzso was zzso into zzso zzso to establish a zzso regulatory reporter zzso Using this system, zzso zzso were quickly selected from a panel of natural medicines and found to zzso zzso expression by an effect on zzso To confirm the effect of zzso zzso we treated mice orally with water zzso zzso zzso and zzso and measured the zzso levels in serum, zzso zzso and muscle by an zzso zzso zzso The serum zzso levels were no different from the controls after treatment with either zzso zzso or zzso but zzso increased significantly in muscular zzso and decreased in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso meditate zzso expression in mice with zzso zzso A novel zzso regulatory report system was established for rapid and effective selection and evaluation of zzso zzso
