We report the isolation and characterization of a zzso for zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of the zzso most resembles that of zzso from other zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrates that most probably a single gene represents zzso In addition, Northern zzso analysis shows that most probably only one single zzso zzso zzso is transcribed in zzso zzso In a zzso tree that includes all known zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso as expected, together with other zzso zzso
