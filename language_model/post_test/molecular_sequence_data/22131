zzso regulates the expression of a zzso and zzso that contain the zzso zzso in the mouse kidney through zzso zzso regulation of the core 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso The core 2 zzso gene has six zzso and produces three alternatively spliced zzso zzso regulates only the expression of the zzso zzso which is transcribed from the most zzso zzso By introducing a zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso clone that carries the mouse core 2 zzso gene and its zzso region into zzso mice that carry a defective zzso zzso we were able to rescue the deficient zzso The zzso clone was subsequently engineered to replace the core 2 zzso gene with the sequence of enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso as a reporter by an zzso zzso zzso system in zzso zzso The transgenic mice derived from the modified zzso clone expressed zzso in the zzso which suggests that the candidate zzso is in the zzso region of the core 2 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso regions of the zzso clone and zzso zzso DNA revealed a candidate sequence for zzso at about zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso This sequence consisted of eight repeats of two zzso units in the zzso mice, whereas it consisted of only one pair of zzso units with a minor modification in the zzso zzso zzso mice produced with the zzso reporter gene construct that included this candidate sequence expressed zzso exclusively in the zzso straight zzso cells of the zzso These results indicated that this unique repeat is indeed the zzso and it is a zzso element responsible for zzso straight zzso zzso zzso zzso
