The zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was cloned from a mouse lung zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso showed 58 and 51% zzso with those of human and zzso zzso zzso A zzso structure with similar zzso acid zzso four zzso zzso bonds, and high zzso content, which are characteristics common to human and zzso zzso was also found in the mouse zzso The zzso acid zzso for the signal sequence and active site are also zzso in mouse zzso zzso protection zzso showed the expression of the zzso gene in liver, zzso zzso and zzso suggesting the distribution of zzso in zzso other than lung and seminal zzso In the lung infected with zzso zzso strain zzso 10 h after zzso of bacteria the number of zzso zzso transcripts was three times higher than zzso The increased level of expression remained constant for at least 48 zzso This result clearly contrasts to that obtained for zzso in which the zzso zzso transcript level was mostly unchanged during the course of zzso These facts suggested the local regulation of the zzso gene expression in zzso in response to inflammatory stimuli at the site of zzso
