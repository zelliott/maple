zzso zzso hormone zzso is the primary regulator of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso has also been identified in zzso sites including immune zzso zzso zzso properties for zzso have been zzso We wanted to determine whether zzso and its zzso are produced by immune zzso in the zzso First, a zzso was cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso that showed zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso Internal zzso were identified from this sequence for amplifying a 268 zzso product by zzso In addition to the zzso zzso products reflecting zzso zzso were amplified in zzso zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in liver, cerebral cortex, or zzso tissue zzso zzso were designed to amplify a 360 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso products reflecting zzso zzso were amplified in pig zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No such products were amplified in zzso and liver zzso In zzso we report the sequence of a zzso coding for zzso and zzso associated zzso zzso in the pig zzso Additionally, we provide evidence that zzso and its zzso are zzso in zzso immune zzso This leads us to speculate that zzso may have local, zzso functions in zzso
