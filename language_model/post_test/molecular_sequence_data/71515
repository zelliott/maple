Following the discovery of the zzso zzso pump in zzso zzso zzso not only the zzso zzso pump and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the same species, but also zzso of these four zzso in strains of other zzso of zzso have been zzso zzso full (and zzso sequences of the zzso DNA of these zzso have been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences have led to new strategies and tactics for understanding bacterial zzso on a comparative basis, as summarized briefly in this zzso The data discussed include zzso alignment of the sequences to zzso the zzso zzso zzso assignment of zzso that cause differences in zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to suggest their evolutionary zzso The four kinds of zzso in each strain are zzso on the basis of their zzso zzso to have arisen by at least two zzso processes during evolution prior to generic zzso The first zzso of the zzso zzso gene yielded two zzso each of which was duplicated again to give four genes in the zzso zzso The zzso carrying four zzso zzso after accumulating zzso became ready for generic zzso and the delivery of four zzso to each zzso The original zzso zzso is speculated to be closest to the zzso pump zzso
