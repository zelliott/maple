We previously developed an efficient route to humanized zzso fragments by high level zzso of the zzso arms from zzso coli followed by directed chemical zzso in zzso Here the number and type of zzso linkages in zzso molecules has been modified to simplify their production and improve their serum zzso All zzso zzso had comparable binding affinity for the zzso zzso and zzso activity against zzso tumor zzso This was anticipated since the modifications are distant from the zzso zzso Replacement of a single zzso bridge between zzso arms with a more stable zzso bridge increased the serum zzso time in normal mice by zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso bond between L and H chains in the zzso zzso did not affect the zzso suggesting that the L chain remains associated with the H zzso An additional zzso zzso containing three repeats of the zzso zzso was constructed with the aim of promoting efficient formation of zzso in zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso was recovered predominantly (up to zzso as zzso directly from zzso cell zzso thus zzso the need for in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a similar serum zzso to the zzso zzso The improvements described here for zzso zzso fragments from zzso coli should enhance the clinical potential of these zzso
