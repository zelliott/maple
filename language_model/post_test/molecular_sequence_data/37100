zzso group proteins zzso repress zzso genes in cells where these genes must remain inactive during zzso and zzso zzso This repression depends on zzso zzso zzso called zzso group response elements zzso zzso zzso the only known zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso but pho zzso show only mild zzso compared with other zzso zzso We characterize zzso a gene zzso a protein with high similarity to zzso zzso binds to zzso sites in zzso and zzso pho double zzso show more severe zzso of zzso genes than do the single zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso act zzso to repress zzso zzso We examined the distribution of five zzso proteins on zzso zzso from zzso pho double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ph remain bound to zzso zzso at most sites in the absence of zzso and zzso At a few zzso locations, however, some of the zzso proteins are no longer present in the absence of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso may anchor zzso protein complexes to only a subset of zzso zzso zzso and zzso may not participate in the zzso of zzso complexes, but may be necessary for zzso repression zzso through zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso removal of zzso factor or zzso two other zzso proteins implicated in zzso function, does not cause zzso of zzso genes or reporter genes in zzso zzso
