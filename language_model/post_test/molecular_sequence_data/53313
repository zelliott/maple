To isolate microbial proteins capable of binding the third component of complement zzso we coupled the free zzso group of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso This simple technique facilitated the zzso of the first zzso protein isolated from a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were recognized by this zzso binding of zzso was zzso independent of zzso zzso and preferential for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and internal peptides from the zzso protein disclosed a zzso region spanning approximately 20 zzso acids and a signal zzso that had not been previously zzso The gene was isolated from a library of zzso DNA from laboratory strain zzso by screening with a 1200 zzso zzso product amplified from zzso zzso zzso the zzso terminal sequence and the internal zzso zzso The open reading frame spanned zzso zzso all zzso sequences were identified in the translated gene product, which also contained at least three zzso repeats at the zzso The gene was zzso and the translated protein was functionally active in zzso clinical zzso of zzso 1, 3, 4, 14, and zzso zzso from a patient recovering from acute zzso infection contained zzso zzso specific for this protein by zzso Wide conservation among clinical zzso zzso binding of zzso and the ability to stimulate the human immune response have not previously been reported for this zzso zzso A similar zzso approach should enable the identification of other zzso proteins in zzso able to elude zzso host zzso
