zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in cellular zzso zzso and has been studied in many living organisms from bacteria to higher plants and zzso However, zzso and molecular characterization of zzso from zzso zzso remains a zzso Here, we isolated the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed it in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited zzso reactions for zzso as well as for zzso zzso reaction for zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso but not to that level with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli resulted in the increased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were also significantly zzso Under high zzso the growth rate of zzso cells was faster compared to its respective zzso High zzso also strongly induced the transcript level of zzso in zzso zzso Our results indicate the importance of a novel zzso zzso zzso increased the level of zzso zzso via zzso and zzso and zzso the tolerance to zzso zzso
