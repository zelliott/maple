A novel approach to tailored selective zzso for the measurement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso solutions zzso zzso suppression by zzso zzso is zzso The zzso echo zzso which effectively combines one selective 180 degrees zzso pulse and two field zzso zzso achieves highly selective and effective water zzso This technique is zzso suited for the rapid collection of zzso data since a zzso acquisition produces a pure phase zzso spectrum with a perfectly flat zzso at the highest possible zzso Application to the fast measurement of zzso zzso data of a zzso zzso solution of a zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso at 5 degrees C is zzso
