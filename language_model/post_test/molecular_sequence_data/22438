zzso was additionally introduced into side chain of zzso promoter for the zzso of zzso reaction by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When a single zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso promoter either at the zzso region of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso or at the unwinding region zzso to zzso zzso zzso was suppressed in the zzso but proceeded faster in the zzso The amount of transcripts after zzso zzso with respect to that in the dark was zzso zzso analysis of the zzso reaction revealed that the zzso mechanism was different in these zzso The zzso of an zzso at the zzso region primarily affected zzso On the other hand, the zzso of an zzso at the unwinding region mainly affected zzso Still more clear-cut zzso was achieved when two zzso were introduced into both zzso and unwinding regions, zzso zzso proceeded zzso faster after zzso zzso than that in the zzso This synergistic effect was observed only when two zzso were introduced into these two different regions, respectively, and introduction of them into the same zzso region drastically lowered the zzso zzso The cooperation of two zzso at zzso and unwinding regions would contribute to the clear-cut zzso of zzso
