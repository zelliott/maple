In the Lewis zzso the dominant T cell repertoire to zzso basic protein zzso is directed to the zzso zzso and the T cell receptors of zzso T cells are of the zzso zzso zzso with short zzso sequences having a characteristic zzso However, this paradigm has been reached through analysis of long-term zzso lines and zzso We initiated the present study to examine the process of selection of the zzso zzso zzso and characteristic zzso motifs upon zzso with guinea-pig zzso and rat or guinea-pig zzso zzso We found that the dominance of zzso zzso developed progressively over 4-6 in zzso zzso Following zzso with rat zzso which differs from the guinea-pig zzso in one zzso acid at position 78, the dominance of zzso zzso and the characteristic zzso sequences are not zzso Thus, zzso zzso dominance and specific zzso zzso motifs are seen with zzso zzso but not with self rat zzso
