zzso zzso can transfer part of its zzso zzso the zzso to plant cells where it zzso into the nuclear zzso via illegitimate zzso zzso of the zzso results in small deletions of the plant target DNA, and may lead to zzso of the zzso borders and the production of zzso zzso We showed previously that zzso can also be transferred from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso via zzso zzso We show here that when the zzso lacks zzso with the zzso zzso zzso it zzso at random positions via illegitimate zzso From 11 lines the integrated zzso was cloned back to zzso coli along with zzso zzso zzso The zzso borders and zzso DNA zzso the zzso were zzso and zzso It was found that zzso integration had resulted in target DNA deletions and sometimes zzso zzso or zzso DNA zzso zzso the molecular mechanism of illegitimate zzso by which zzso zzso in higher and lower zzso seems zzso
