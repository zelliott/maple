In zzso cells the zzso family of zzso zzso has three distinct zzso termed A, B, and C, which are thought to play discrete roles in zzso zzso In this paper we report the cloning of zzso zzso and demonstrate its zzso regulation and key role in embryonic zzso zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses show that zzso is absent in zzso and synthesis begins within 30 zzso after zzso The protein product is localized in the nucleus in zzso and accumulates continuously until the zzso transition zzso after which it is zzso Upon injection into newly zzso eggs, zzso zzso shortened the cell cycle and accelerated the timing of zzso whereas zzso injected with zzso zzso displayed a zzso increase in the length of the cell cycle and a slower rate of zzso In contrast, injection of the zzso zzso zzso had no zzso Western zzso with an zzso specific for zzso zzso in zzso revealed a cycle of zzso in each cell cycle in control zzso and in zzso injected with zzso zzso there was a twofold increase in the level of zzso in zzso zzso with this, the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity were both reduced by approximately 50% after zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be recovered in a complex with both zzso suggesting that it acts in a zzso zzso These results indicate that periodic zzso of zzso on zzso occurs in each zzso cell cycle, and zzso of zzso by zzso controls at least in part the length of the cell cycle and the timing of zzso in zzso zzso The disappearance of zzso after the zzso may zzso in part the lengthening of the cell cycle at that zzso
