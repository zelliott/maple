In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a zzso factor complex and play a crucial role in wing zzso To extend our knowledge of insect wing formation, we isolated zzso and zzso zzso from two zzso zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso had only low zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in antennae and legs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interference zzso analysis in zzso zzso demonstrated zzso functions of zzso and zzso in wing development, and an unexpected novel function of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, our results can be applied to the production of a zzso zzso zzso for biological control purposes using zzso zzso
