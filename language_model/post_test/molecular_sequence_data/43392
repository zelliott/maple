We have generated several transgenic mouse lines and rabbits expressing efficiently (up to zzso zzso in mice and up to zzso zzso in zzso human zzso in their milk as bovine zzso fusion zzso Human zzso zzso was inserted in frame into zzso 5 of the bovine zzso gene with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso site for bacterial zzso zzso zzso analysis performed on one zzso transgenic mouse and one transgenic rabbit revealed that the fusion gene was expressed almost zzso in the zzso zzso although low amounts of zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso or in the zzso The fusion protein was specifically zzso with zzso zzso The zzso part obtained upon zzso had a lower molecular mass than zzso zzso produced in Chinese zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis it was shown that the difference in size was due to a different type of zzso Biological activity of the fusion zzso as determined by growth stimulation of zzso zzso cells, was less than zzso of that of human zzso zzso Upon zzso of the fusion protein with zzso zzso biological activity comparable to that of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso males and virgin females did not show signs of enhanced zzso but zzso females expressing the zzso displayed transient increases in their zzso zzso
