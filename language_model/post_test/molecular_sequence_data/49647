In zzso type zzso cells, zzso zzso III zzso of a gene superimposed on the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso II zzso unit produces two small zzso zzso that accumulate to low zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Flint, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso To gain a better understanding of the function of this zzso zzso III transcription, we have examined the properties of the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso III zzso in more zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the rates of zzso zzso by the two zzso zzso during the infectious cycle were analyzed by using zzso zzso protection and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso III transcripts were present at significantly lower zzso than zzso zzso throughout the period zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso III was found to be at least as efficient as that by zzso zzso zzso The short zzso of the small zzso zzso estimated by using the zzso D chase method appear to account for their limited zzso The zzso of zzso sequences by zzso zzso II and III in cells infected by zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter genes with zzso in zzso promoter sequences was also zzso The results of these experiments indicate that recognition of the zzso promoter by the zzso zzso II zzso machinery in infected cells limits zzso by zzso zzso III, and vice zzso Such zzso competition and the properties of zzso zzso made by zzso zzso III suggest that the function of this viral zzso zzso III zzso unit is zzso
