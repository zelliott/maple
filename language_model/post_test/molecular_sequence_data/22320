zzso zzso are ubiquitous proteins that employ the energy obtained from zzso zzso to zzso zzso DNA, or zzso The zzso family of zzso proteins is widespread throughout bacteria and zzso but is largely zzso Limited work with specific members has suggested a potential role as molecular zzso involved in the assembly of protein zzso As part of an effort aimed at determining the function of novel zzso zzso in zzso coli, we report the characterization of a representative member of the zzso family, zzso which we have renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso gene exists on an zzso with another gene zzso a zzso zzso of unknown function containing a Von zzso Factor Type A zzso zzso expression is under the control of the zzso zzso factor, and its levels increase toward late zzso stationary phase, consistent with its possible role as a general zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso and forms zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso interacts strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso forming a large zzso structure consisting of two zzso zzso linked by a maximum of five zzso zzso Surprisingly, the activity of zzso does not appear to be affected by binding to zzso in a number of in zzso and in zzso zzso however, complex formation results in the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Data obtained suggest that the zzso interaction may be important for the regulation of zzso activity against its zzso
