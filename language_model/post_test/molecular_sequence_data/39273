A zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso soil produced in zzso This zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rod that grows zzso at 37 degrees C and pH zzso zzso growth occurs in media containing 1 % zzso zzso although the zzso can grow in zzso % zzso The cell wall zzso is of the zzso type with a zzso containing zzso The major respiratory zzso is zzso 7 and the major fatty acids are zzso : 0, zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content is zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso formed a new branch within the family zzso The novel isolate is zzso closely related to members of zzso of moderately zzso zzso and formed a coherent cluster with species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso supported by zzso analysis at a confidence level of 71 zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene zzso sequence similarity values of zzso % with members of the zzso zzso zzso % with members of the zzso zzso zzso % with members of the zzso zzso and zzso % with members of the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analysis and zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel species in a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type strain of zzso zzso
