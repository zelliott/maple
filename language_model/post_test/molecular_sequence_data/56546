Several new rat class III zzso gamma R zzso are described here, extending the genetic complexity of this zzso family and further distinguishing rat zzso from mouse zzso represented by only one zzso zzso and human zzso represented by only two zzso zzso protection zzso reveal that three rat tumor cell zzso zzso leukemia cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso express multiple and probably identical zzso gamma zzso transcripts in similar relative proportions but at significantly different zzso These results indicate that no single zzso zzso in these cell types but that the overall level of zzso gamma zzso transcripts is zzso zzso Two of the zzso gamma zzso zzso found to have extensive zzso acid sequence differences in their second zzso zzso zzso are shown to bind rat and mouse zzso zzso zzso This result suggests that the zzso zzso diversity in this species may function as a mechanism for extending the zzso capacity of rat zzso zzso zzso for the rat zzso zzso protein was also isolated in this study and its ability to augment surface expression of class III zzso gamma R was tested by zzso of zzso zzso zzso Like the structurally zzso mouse zzso zzso rat zzso zzso fails to promote surface expression of zzso gamma zzso sharply contrasting the efficient zzso expression produced by human zzso zzso Variations in the zzso zzso acid sequences correlate with the divergent capacities of these zzso zzso molecules to augment zzso zzso The high levels of zzso zzso message expressed in rat zzso cells may indicate that other unidentified zzso are required for assembly of rat zzso zzso into functional zzso zzso
