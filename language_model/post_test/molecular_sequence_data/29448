A major, unresolved question in signal zzso by G protein coupled receptors zzso is to understand how, at atomic resolution, a zzso activates a G zzso A step toward answering this question was made with the determination of the high-resolution structure of zzso we now know the zzso interactions that characterize the resting zzso of a zzso To what degree does this structure represent a structural paradigm for other zzso especially at the zzso surface where zzso protein interaction occurs and where the sequence zzso is low among zzso To address this question, we performed zzso studies on approximately zzso peptides including the critical second zzso loop zzso of the alpha 2A zzso zzso zzso and of zzso To stabilize the secondary structure of the zzso zzso 4-12 zzso from the adjacent zzso zzso were included and structures determined in zzso zzso We also characterized the effects on an alpha 2A zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Our results show that in contrast to the L-shaped loop in the zzso of zzso the zzso of the alpha 2A zzso is predominantly zzso supporting the hypothesis that there is structural diversity within zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso subtly zzso the zzso zzso The spacing of zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso is a predictor of zzso versus loop zzso These data should lead to more accurate models of the zzso surface of zzso and of zzso G protein zzso
