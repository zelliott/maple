zzso zzso peptides were extracted from the gastric zzso of the American zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso pH stable zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three major zzso zzso were zzso and found to zzso to 49, 45, and 34 zzso peptides by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the largest zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two smaller peptides corresponded to zzso 45 and 34 zzso fragments of the 49 zzso zzso The putative zzso of the 49 zzso zzso to the two shorter peptides occurs at zzso sites that are unusual in zzso zzso Mass spectral analysis confirmed the molecular weights that were predicted from the zzso acid zzso thus revealing the absence of any zzso zzso such as zzso Although the three zzso zzso resemble zzso zzso in having a zzso zzso in the seventh position from the zzso zzso this zzso is apparently zzso as in turtle zzso When tested by zzso zzso a synthetic replicate of zzso zzso exhibited a zzso pattern of biological activity on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of known peptides revealed that zzso zzso is most similar to turtle zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso These similarities closely reflect zzso zzso and support the hypothesis that functionally distinct zzso evolved from zzso in early zzso However, zzso evolved via different mechanisms in the zzso lineage zzso zzso versus the zzso and zzso zzso in which two different single zzso base changes can account for the separate evolution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
