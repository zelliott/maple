zzso zzso zzso zzso are a major class of zzso that are involved in tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to establish a comprehensive zzso expression profile in gastric zzso with the objective of identifying possible zzso for gastric cancer zzso We have designed zzso zzso according to the consensus zzso motifs to amplify zzso molecules from gastric zzso by reverse zzso zzso The zzso expression profile was established by sequencing analysis of the cloned zzso zzso We have identified 17 zzso from a gastric zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected for in zzso zzso studies because of their higher expression level and their described roles in zzso invasion, and zzso Among the 97 gastric zzso zzso zzso we observed positive zzso zzso of zzso zzso in 69 and positive zzso of zzso zzso in 71 zzso zzso analysis with zzso features indicates that zzso zzso expression is zzso correlated with patients' survival, whereas zzso fails to show similar clinical zzso Our results illustrate the utility of zzso zzso gene family profiling in human gastric zzso and show that zzso zzso zzso may serve as a novel independent zzso marker for gastric zzso zzso
