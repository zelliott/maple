In sensory zzso successful maturation of signaling molecules and regulation of zzso are essential for cell function and zzso Here, we demonstrate a zzso role for zzso as both a molecular zzso uniquely required for zzso maturation and a regulator of zzso that enters zzso cells during light zzso zzso in zzso zzso lead to severe defects in zzso zzso zzso whereas other zzso cell proteins are expressed zzso zzso in zzso also impair the ability of zzso cells to control zzso zzso levels following zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso in zzso lead to retinal zzso that is enhanced by light, suggesting that zzso function as a zzso buffer is important for zzso cell zzso Our results illustrate a critical role for zzso in zzso maturation and zzso regulation and provide genetic evidence that defects in zzso lead to retinal zzso
