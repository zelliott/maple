In a screen for zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso was identified as a candidate as it binds to the zzso lung cancer marker zzso We screened for zzso in all coding regions of the zzso gene in 96 lung zzso samples and their matched adjacent normal lung zzso We found one patient with a zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso 10), which is located at the zzso domain where most zzso zzso have been found in zzso zzso This patient had lung zzso with zzso zzso zzso features in the setting of a prior medical history significant for carotid zzso and severe chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso In order to characterize the genetic features of zzso in lung cancer, we checked for zzso expression and copy number in the 96 lung cancer zzso zzso protein expression was generally zzso in multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso function may contribute to lung cancer development or a zzso of lung cancer with specific clinical zzso
