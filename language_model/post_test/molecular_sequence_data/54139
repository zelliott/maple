The assembly of a zzso zzso and of a zzso zzso using DNA zzso is zzso These DNA machines are activated by zzso and zzso zzso The bipedal walker is activated on a DNA template consisting of four zzso acid zzso The forward zzso of the DNA on the template track is activated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, using the zzso complex or the zzso structure as the DNA zzso driving zzso The backward zzso is activated by zzso zzso and zzso triggers that destroy the zzso or zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso is activated on a circular DNA template consisting of four zzso zzso With the zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso stepping is zzso The operation of the DNA machines is followed zzso by the appropriate labeling of the zzso components with the respective zzso zzso
