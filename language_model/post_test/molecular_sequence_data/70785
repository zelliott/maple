More than a hundred naturally occurring zzso of human zzso zzso zzso have been identified at the zzso acid zzso The abundance of distinct zzso sites and their clinical manifestations make this zzso ideal for zzso analysis zzso We present here a sequence and structure combined analysis by which the severity of clinical symptoms resulting from point zzso of this zzso is correlated with zzso degrees of zzso acid conservation within 23 zzso sequences from different zzso Our analysis zzso on a quantitative basis, a widely held notion that clinically zzso zzso of zzso usually occur at zzso zzso zzso However, marked exceptions to this general trend exist which are most notably revealed by a number of zzso associated with chronic zzso zzso anemia zzso I zzso When mapped onto a zzso structural model of human zzso these class I zzso sites of low zzso acid conservation appear to zzso in two zzso distinct zzso both of which are populated with zzso consisting mainly of clinically zzso zzso zzso class I and class zzso These results of zzso analyses contribute to a further understanding of the zzso relationships of human zzso zzso
