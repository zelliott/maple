The three-dimensional structure of zzso II of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso has provided insights with respect to the nature of the zzso machinery of zzso To support these structural zzso we have carried out an analysis of zzso II by zzso The gene zzso zzso II of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was amplified using the zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso gene was expressed and zzso from zzso zzso at approximately 5 zzso of zzso zzso zzso II was zzso by zzso zzso and characterized using a combination of zzso and independent zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso isolated from its natural source have comparable specific activities against zzso of about 1000 zzso of zzso acid zzso of zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso The substitution of zzso by either zzso or zzso and of zzso by Ala led to a complete elimination of the activity against both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by either zzso Ala or zzso renders the zzso inactive and also zzso the zzso zzso However, the zzso with the conservative replacement zzso zzso is stable and displays only a small decrease of zzso activity but a zzso decrease in activity against zzso There was no appreciable difference in zzso activity between the native, zzso wild type, and zzso zzso zzso These results confirm that the zzso formed by zzso is essential for zzso zzso They also show that the active site of zzso II is more tolerant to a conservative change of the zzso side chain within the zzso than are other zzso with similar zzso zzso
