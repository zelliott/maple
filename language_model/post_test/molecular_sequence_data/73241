The peripheral membrane protein zzso is essential for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and is thought to anchor the zzso complex to the zzso zzso Since zzso transcripts are also found in zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso region of the zzso gene to identify its promoter zzso This region contains several zzso consensus sites, which may account for the widespread expression of zzso zzso Indeed, reporter gene zzso encompassing at least the two zzso consensus sites upstream from the zzso start site were efficiently transcribed in both a zzso and a zzso cell zzso Our data are consistent with the widespread expression of the zzso gene in most zzso zzso
