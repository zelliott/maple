We used three zzso DNA fragments with different substitution rates zzso zzso b and the zzso to zzso zzso relationships among six species of the zzso zzso and compare levels of genetic divergence between the insular, vulnerable zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart to assess the origins of the zzso zzso The larger species found throughout the zzso region zzso zzso zzso aviator and zzso zzso share a unique zzso formula zzso and form a zzso zzso in our zzso zzso zzso zzso a Chinese zzso with zzso zzso is sometimes included in zzso zzso but is genetically very divergent from the latter and deserves full species zzso All zzso b and zzso zzso of zzso zzso are closely related and only found in the zzso zzso but when compared to zzso sequences of zzso zzso levels of zzso divergence are unusually low for zzso zzso This contrasts with the high level of differentiation that zzso zzso has attained in its zzso zzso and zzso calls, suggesting a recent split followed by fast evolutionary zzso The molecular data suggest that zzso zzso originated from a European population of zzso zzso and that the zzso of the zzso occurred at the end of the zzso The zzso populations of zzso zzso also appear to have a European origin, whereas those of the zzso Islands probably came from North zzso In spite of its recent origin and low genetic zzso the zzso bat is well differentiated and consequently represents a unique evolutionary unit with great conservation zzso
