More than zzso of house dust zzso patients are zzso to the major zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso The aim of this study was to develop and characterize an zzso vaccine based on zzso zzso p 2 zzso which should allow reducing zzso and zzso zzso during specific zzso zzso 

Five zzso p 2 peptides zzso were zzso and analyzed regarding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses induced with zzso p 2 and zzso p 2 peptides were determined in peripheral blood zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso induced with zzso zzso p 2 peptides in mice and rabbits were tested for their capacity to inhibit zzso binding and zzso zzso in allergic zzso 

Of five overlapping peptides zzso covering the zzso p 2 zzso two peptides zzso and zzso were identified, which showed no relevant zzso zzso zzso activity, and induced lower zzso p zzso zzso zzso than zzso p zzso However, when coupled to a carrier, zzso and zzso induced zzso p zzso zzso zzso in animals, which inhibited allergic patients' zzso binding to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso similar as zzso induced with zzso p zzso 

zzso zzso p 2 peptides should allow avoiding zzso zzso and because of their low potential to activate zzso T cells, they may reduce zzso zzso during zzso Further, these peptides may be also useful for zzso zzso
