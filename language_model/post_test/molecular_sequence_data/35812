Using a zzso against the zzso sequence zzso zzso we have isolated the zzso zzso zzso from an extract of the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso is located in zzso of sea zzso Application of low zzso of zzso to zzso preparations of sea zzso strongly increased the frequency and duration of spontaneous zzso suggesting that this zzso is involved in zzso zzso has a free zzso yet its zzso sequence makes it relatively resistant to degradation by zzso zzso Thus, we have discovered another strategy by which sea zzso protect the zzso of their zzso zzso
