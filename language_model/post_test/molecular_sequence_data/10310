The ability to display zzso proteins and peptides on the surface of different types of zzso has proven extremely useful in protein zzso zzso To display such proteins in a zzso environment, we have produced a zzso allowing for fusion of proteins to the zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso major envelope zzso zzso Such fusion proteins incorporate into the zzso zzso and display the zzso zzso zzso We have further produced zzso zzso displaying the green fluorescent protein zzso and the zzso virus envelope zzso E1 and zzso The incorporation of the zzso zzso and zzso fusion proteins into the zzso particle was demonstrated by western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of the display of the zzso protein or the individual zzso virus spike proteins on the surface of an enveloped zzso Such a zzso viral display system may be useful for the display of proteins dependent on zzso for activity and for targeting of zzso zzso to novel host cell types as a gene transfer zzso
