zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacterial zzso in the Northwest Mediterranean Sea were studied using zzso data of the zzso zzso We have described and compared the zzso the distribution of zzso zzso Units zzso within the two zzso the spatial distribution, and the zzso composition of FL and PA bacterial zzso The number of zzso in the present work was two orders of magnitude higher than in previous zzso Only zzso of the total zzso were common to both zzso whereas zzso zzso were exclusive to the PA fraction and zzso to the FL zzso The zzso exclusively present in PA or FL zzso were very low in abundance zzso of total zzso zzso of the rare zzso revealed the larger richness of PA bacteria that was hidden in previous zzso zzso dominated the FL bacterial zzso and zzso dominated the PA zzso zzso were important in the PA fraction mainly at the zzso The high number of sequences in this study detected additional zzso from the PA zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso
