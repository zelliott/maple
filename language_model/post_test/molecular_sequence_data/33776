zzso a possible ABC zzso maturation and zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of the leader zzso of zzso which is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso in zzso zzso activity of the full-length zzso zzso in zzso membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso We found that the presence of unusual zzso acids in zzso is required for leader zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso this finding strongly suggests that zzso like other zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso activity depended on zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso domain of zzso may zzso function with the zzso zzso zzso This is the first in zzso study on zzso that reports the processing mechanism of a full-length zzso ABC zzso
