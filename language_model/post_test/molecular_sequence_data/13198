zzso zzso zzso a set of zzso zzso called zzso by a type III zzso zzso Upon infection of cultured zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across the host cell plasma zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso zzso zzso follows the same zzso We analyzed zzso of zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso producing truncated zzso and zzso proteins fused to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso hybrids were readily zzso by zzso zzso The zzso domain required for zzso was not longer than 15 zzso of zzso and 17 zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells, revealed by zzso production, only required the zzso 50 zzso acid zzso of zzso and the zzso 71 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are thus modular proteins composed of a zzso domain, a zzso domain, and an zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso across host cell's zzso was also dependent on the zzso of zzso and zzso by the same zzso The zzso fusion approach could be readily extended to study the fate of other proteins zzso by invasive bacterial zzso
