The zzso zzso zzso is a key player in zzso organization, yet our understanding of the regulation of zzso functions by zzso modifications is very zzso We provide here the first functional characterization of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and is zzso enriched at promoters of active zzso where it stimulates zzso by increasing zzso mobility and recruiting a general zzso zzso zzso is dynamic during zzso and marks zzso cells such as induced zzso stem zzso cells and zzso germ cell zzso We propose a model for zzso as a novel regulator of zzso function with a dual role in zzso zzso
