We have investigated the expression patterns of two zzso zzso genes with similarity to mouse steel zzso using zzso in zzso zzso Areas of overlapping expression include the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso neural tube, zzso zzso and a superficial region of the zzso while zzso is in the zzso and facial nerve projecting to visceral arch 3, the zzso arch, and the zzso of anterior zzso Thus, both transcripts exhibit partially overlapping expression patterns, but their tissue distribution differs significantly from that of zzso expression in the mouse and zzso
