The complete zzso acid sequences of human kidney zzso H zzso zzso and human kidney zzso L zzso zzso were zzso zzso H contains 230 zzso and has an Mr of zzso The sequence was obtained by sequencing the light, heavy and mini chain and the peptides produced by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso form of the zzso The zzso mini chain is a zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso Human zzso L has 217 zzso acid zzso and an Mr of zzso Its zzso acid sequence was deduced from zzso sequences of the heavy and light chains and from the sequences of zzso zzso fragments of the heavy zzso The fragments were aligned by comparison with known sequences of zzso H and L from other zzso zzso H and L exhibit a high degree of sequence zzso to zzso B zzso zzso and other zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
