In the central nervous system, zzso zzso terminate the actions of this neurotransmitter by concentrating it into cells surrounding the zzso by a process involving sodium and zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso These zzso contain two zzso oriented zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 1 originates from the zzso but its tip is close to that of hairpin 2, which enters the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Here we address the question of whether hairpin 1 and/or zzso surrounding it undergo zzso changes during the transport zzso zzso we zzso the zzso of zzso introduced into hairpin 1 and the zzso ends of zzso zzso 6, 7, and 8 of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso In each domain, except for zzso domain 6, zzso zzso were found in which the zzso of zzso transport by the zzso zzso was increased when external sodium was replaced by zzso a condition expected to increase the proportion of zzso zzso zzso the zzso blocker zzso protected against the zzso in several of these zzso presumably by zzso the zzso in an zzso zzso Moreover, external zzso decreased the zzso zzso of two zzso each introduced at the tip of each zzso Our results are consistent with a model based on the crystal structure of an zzso zzso According to this model, the inward movement of hairpin 1 results in the opening of a zzso between the binding pocket and the zzso lined by parts of zzso zzso 7 and zzso
