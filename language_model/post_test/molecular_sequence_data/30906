We have identified a zzso pair zzso tandem repeat consisting of two zzso a zzso zzso potential zzso sequence and a zzso unique zzso This repeat is located between and zzso regulates two zzso units, rat zzso and zzso organized in zzso zzso zzso expression experiments showed zzso and zzso zzso activity of the zzso repeat in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso organization establishing the two zzso as zzso zzso zzso analysis of crude nuclear extracts identified at least six zzso zzso nuclear proteins binding to the zzso zzso These observations demonstrate a zzso gene regulatory sequence structurally and functionally organized like the zzso virus 40 viral zzso and confirm in a specific gene context the contribution of a zzso tract in zzso regulatory mechanisms as a zzso
