A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the soil of a natural cave and characterized by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and forms a distinct branch at the base of a zzso zzso Its closest relative is the type strain of zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso The zzso characteristics were as zzso the zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso the major zzso was zzso the polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso an unknown zzso and an unknown zzso the major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids were zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, it is suggested that the zzso represents a novel species of a new zzso within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
