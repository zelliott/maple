Satellite DNA sequences are known to be important components required for the construction of zzso and are common to all higher zzso Nevertheless, their zzso sequences vary significantly, even in zzso related zzso In order to zzso how the zzso sequences define the zzso character of zzso satellite DNA, an evolutionary path toward repetitive units has been zzso In that context, the DNA zzso of fish satellite DNA was evaluated in two ways: the organization of zzso and sequence characteristics were zzso and the differences in stacking energies between zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso units making up currently observed repetitive sequences have evolved through zzso amplification of zzso ancestral sequences by increasing the length of the zzso In addition, we suggest that potentially key sequences required for DNA amplification comprise highly flexible zzso Thus flexibility of the DNA structure may be a primary prerequisite for DNA zzso
