The regulation of the human zzso zzso B gene that plays a crucial role in zzso metabolism is apparently very complex, with multiple zzso and zzso regulatory zzso One of these factors is an zzso region in the second zzso In this region a point zzso at position + zzso has been found that is zzso by the restriction zzso zzso The report of zzso et zzso (1991) could suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso To investigate further the possible effect of this zzso on plasma cholesterol levels, we have compared the frequency of the zzso zzso between 206 zzso Norwegian or Czech subjects on one hand, and 165 zzso Norwegian or Czech subjects on the other zzso No significant difference in frequency was found between the zzso and the zzso zzso This finding indicates either that the zzso at position + zzso does not affect the zzso activity or that this in zzso zzso activity is of little or no clinical zzso One of the Norwegian zzso subjects who was of Czech descent possessed the zzso zzso zzso that leads to defective binding of low density zzso zzso to the LDL zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene in her family showed that the zzso zzso was identical to that reported in other countries, indicating a common gene zzso
