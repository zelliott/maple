Central nervous system zzso zzso are the most common solid zzso in zzso zzso and molecular genetic studies of these zzso have previously shown abnormalities of zzso 17, implicating genes on this zzso in zzso To identify zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we have zzso the five highly zzso regions of this gene in 29 mixed zzso zzso zzso No zzso were detected by this zzso In order to identify other candidate disease zzso on zzso 17, we have carried out a detailed deletion mapping analysis using 16 zzso DNA markers on 19 of the above zzso and an additional four zzso zzso of zzso 17 occurred in nine cases zzso six of which were primitive zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that it is unlikely that the zzso gene is directly involved in the development of common zzso brain zzso This is in contrast to findings from adult brain and other zzso zzso Moreover, the frequency of zzso 17 zzso especially in zzso suggests that other genes on this zzso contribute to zzso
