We attempted to detect zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso samples of 18 zzso zzso patients with pneumonia, using rapid cycle DNA zzso A zzso zzso based on zzso hot air was used for rapid temperature control of zzso samples in this glass zzso zzso After a total amplification time of 15 zzso the amplified products were zzso on zzso gels and zzso with zzso zzso In three cases, zzso was detected at about the time the pneumonia zzso These patients were successfully treated with zzso in the early stages of infection and zzso was not detected by the virus culture zzso In four other cases, zzso zzso was detected in their zzso samples but not detected by zzso zzso These four cases of zzso zzso were successfully treated with zzso For detection of zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso a different temperature setting base on the primer difference was not zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed at the same time for detection of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso amplification is a valuable tool for rapid diagnosis and early treatment of pneumonia due to zzso and zzso zzso
