zzso how zzso zzso replication is regulated and how groups of replication origins are organized into replication bands will significantly increase our understanding of zzso zzso zzso time bands in zzso zzso show overall zzso with structural zzso and zzso patterns as revealed by different zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso bands reflect variations in the zzso structure and function of the zzso but little is known about the structural basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso At the microscopic level, both structural R and G bands and replication bands occupy discrete zzso along zzso suggesting separation by distinct zzso The purpose of this study was to determine replication timing differences encompassing a boundary between zzso replicating zzso zzso Using competitive zzso on zzso DNA from zzso cell cycle zzso we have analyzed the replication timing of markers spanning roughly 5 zzso of human zzso zzso This is only the second report of high-resolution analysis of replication timing differences across an zzso zzso In contrast to previous work, however, we find that band boundaries are defined by a zzso in replication timing rather than by a sharp boundary separating R and G bands into functionally distinct zzso zzso These findings indicate that topographical band boundaries are not defined by specific sequences or zzso
