We identify here a novel class of zzso zzso of zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso small zzso zzso zzso Like the previously isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso animals are defective in zzso In addition, they display unique defects in the removal of zzso cells, revealing a previously zzso function for zzso zzso acts in zzso and engulfing cells to control locomotion and cell corpse zzso respectively, indicating that zzso has distinct functions in different cell zzso Using zzso zzso we find that zzso promotes the degradation of engulfed cell zzso It is required for the efficient recruitment and fusion of zzso to zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso In engulfing cells, zzso is enriched on the surface of zzso We propose that zzso acts on zzso surfaces to promote zzso maturation and suggest that zzso zzso may have a similar function in the degradation of zzso zzso
