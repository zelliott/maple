We have characterized the molecular nature of zzso in wingless zzso a segment polarity gene acting during various stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso have undergone zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso including deletions and point zzso of zzso zzso In a temperature sensitive zzso a zzso zzso zzso is replaced by a zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso unit is not zzso zzso of zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso produce either no zzso zzso or a form of the protein that is retained within zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso for the segment polarity gene zzso show a similar retention of the zzso zzso We have also zzso wild type zzso zzso into zzso tissue culture cells, which then display zzso protein on the cell surface and in the zzso zzso In similar experiments with zzso zzso the proteins are retained in zzso compartments and appear not to be zzso These data provide further evidence that zzso acts as a zzso factor and suggest that zzso provides an accessory function for zzso protein zzso or zzso
