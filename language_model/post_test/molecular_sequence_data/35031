zzso toxins are zzso of zzso zzso channels zzso which bind to the zzso site 3 to inhibit the fast zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso are two new zzso zzso peptides identified by zzso cloning from the scorpion zzso zzso with unknown zzso Here, we report their zzso production, zzso zzso structural and functional zzso By in zzso zzso from bacterial inclusion bodies and further zzso through reverse phase zzso liquid zzso we obtained high purity zzso products with a zzso zzso identified by circular zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp recordings on five cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the insect counterpart zzso all expressed in zzso zzso zzso showed that these two peptides inhibited rapid zzso of the sensitive zzso channels with significant preference for zzso The half zzso effective zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for this channel are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, showing 45 and 38 folds higher affinities than for zzso the most sensitive zzso channel among the five zzso Our functional data confirms that these two peptides belong to the zzso scorpion toxin zzso A combined analysis of the site 3 sequences and the pharmacological data illuminates the importance of the loop zzso of the channel in interacting with the toxins whereas affinity variations between zzso and zzso highlight a key functional role of a zzso side chain at position 28 of zzso zzso expression together with structural and functional characterization of these two new zzso scorpion toxins lays basis for further studies of their zzso zzso
