zzso is a serum protein consisting of two zzso the heavy chain and zzso zzso linked through an zzso bond between the zzso zzso chain of zzso and the zzso group of the zzso zzso of the heavy zzso The heavy chain is zzso with a zzso extension, which is zzso off just before the link to zzso is zzso Our earlier studies indicate that this extension mediates the zzso and we have now found that a short segment on the zzso side of the zzso site is also required for the zzso Furthermore, we previously showed that zzso of the heavy chain precursor and zzso in zzso cells leads to linkage, and we have now used this system to identify a His zzso in the zzso extension that is specifically required for the zzso zzso of the two zzso In addition, we have shown that another zzso zzso zzso zzso will also form a complex with the heavy chain, as will free zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that in zzso there might be other, as yet unknown, zzso zzso zzso linked to the heavy zzso
