The zzso family, previously known as zzso or zzso is involved in various molecular processes including tumor zzso and some members of the family, but not all, exhibit a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten genes are known in humans, in which some members have been extensively zzso In zzso species, the zzso protein family has received, in contrast, far less zzso The picture of the zzso zzso family remains thus incomplete and zzso relationships with zzso counterparts were only partially zzso The present study therefore aimed at characterizing the zzso gene repertoire in zzso with special interest for zzso and providing a comprehensive overview of the zzso gene family evolutionary history in zzso 

In the present study, we present the evolutionary history of the zzso family in zzso and characterize the gene family repertoire for the first time in several zzso zzso Our observations show that zzso zzso genes can be separated in two evolutionary distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to Group I while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to Group zzso The position of zzso is in contrast more debatable due to its very specific evolutionary zzso The present study clearly indicates that zzso zzso zzso and zzso originate from zzso events that occurred before the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso genes of the Group I have a very different evolutionary history as our results suggest that they all arise from a common gene present in the zzso zzso In addition, expression patterns of all zzso zzso transcripts were studied in a broad range of zzso by quantitative zzso and discussed in the light of the function of their zzso zzso 

This work offers an evolutionary framework that will pave the way for future studies on zzso zzso proteins and provides a unified zzso zzso nomenclature that is consistent with the nomenclature in use in zzso Based on protein structure and expression data, we also provide new insight into molecular functions of zzso proteins among zzso and raise intriguing questions on the roles of zzso proteins in zzso
