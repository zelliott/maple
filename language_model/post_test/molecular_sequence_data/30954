Human class 1 zzso growth factor zzso also known as zzso zzso growth factor, is a zzso for a variety of zzso and zzso cells in zzso as well as an zzso factor in zzso Several zzso and growth factors have been shown to be zzso to zzso Four zzso clones coding for zzso have been isolated from a human brain stem zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that alternative zzso generated at least two different forms of zzso zzso Because the difference occurs in the zzso regions, these transcripts may result from the usage of alternative zzso One of the zzso clones contains the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso tail, representing the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso protection zzso suggested this zzso clone zzso to a minor transcript, and the majority of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso downstream from the translation termination zzso The biological significance of this unusually long zzso sequence is not zzso To study the zzso gene structure, we have isolated 50 zzso of zzso zzso DNA coding for the zzso zzso Both restriction zzso mapping and zzso sequencing established that the distance between the first and second zzso zzso is zzso zzso while that between the second and third is zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso as a probe, we showed that human fetal heart expresses high levels of zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be involved in zzso processes such as embryonic development and vascular growth in the zzso
