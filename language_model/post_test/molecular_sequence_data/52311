An approximately zzso zzso protein is rapidly zzso in zzso in the response of zzso to colony stimulating zzso To identify this zzso zzso zzso were incubated with or without colony stimulating zzso the zzso portion of their zzso zzso subjected to size exclusion zzso and the zzso fraction further zzso by reverse phase high pressure liquid zzso zzso zzso peptides of pooled zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso the approximately zzso protein and an approximately zzso zzso and from zzso cells zzso the approximately zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso All seven zzso sequences of 8 zzso peptides present uniquely in the zzso fraction were present in the sequence of the zzso zzso 2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The identity of the approximately zzso protein was confirmed by Western zzso with an zzso raised to a zzso zzso The zzso growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggests that it may be involved in very early events in growth factor signal zzso
