zzso zzso zzso ear zzso domain, zzso zzso are critical for the transport of soluble proteins from the zzso network zzso to zzso by means of interactions with zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso The zzso VHS zzso of zzso form complexes with the zzso zzso of sorting receptors by recognizing zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the X-ray structure of the zzso VHS domain alone, and in complex with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso The VHS domain forms a super zzso with eight zzso similar to the VHS zzso of zzso and zzso zzso movements of zzso zzso and zzso and some of their side zzso create a set of zzso and zzso interactions for correct recognition of the zzso zzso This recognition mechanism provides the basis for regulation of protein transport from the zzso to zzso which is shared by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
