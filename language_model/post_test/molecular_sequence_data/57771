A method is described here for identifying good zzso zzso among approximately zzso possible zzso A library of fusion proteins was constructed containing an zzso domain used to bind to an affinity support, followed by a zzso zzso zzso sequence and the zzso domain of zzso gene zzso Each fusion protein was displayed as a single copy on zzso zzso particles zzso zzso zzso were then bound to an affinity support and treated with the zzso of zzso zzso with good zzso zzso were released, whereas zzso with zzso that resisted zzso remained zzso After several rounds of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sensitive and resistant zzso sequences were identified for two different zzso a zzso of zzso and factor zzso The technique may also be useful for studying the sequence specificity of a variety of zzso zzso
