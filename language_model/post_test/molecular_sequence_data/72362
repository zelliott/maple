zzso zzso peptides represent the zzso units of the soluble plasma zzso Several synthetic zzso zzso have been designed to mimic such structures and have been used to unravel some of the mechanisms involved in the zzso function of the zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhancement of cholesterol zzso from zzso zzso A series of novel synthetic zzso named ID zzso was modeled on the basis of the structural properties common to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In these new zzso however, the segregation between zzso and zzso faces of the zzso is more pronounced than in zzso so that the surface of the zzso and zzso faces of the zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, there are fewer zzso charged zzso in the center of the zzso face of the zzso zzso Most charged zzso acids are located along the edge of the zzso and are susceptible to forming salt bridges with zzso of an zzso zzso such as around a zzso zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of these peptides and their complexes with zzso were compared with those of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso All ID peptides bind zzso zzso more rapidly than the zzso zzso to yield zzso zzso complexes of comparable zzso The zzso content of the zzso ID peptides is close to that of the zzso zzso and increases slightly on zzso zzso The stability of the ID and zzso peptides and of the zzso complexes against zzso zzso zzso is higher than that of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso complexes equals that of zzso zzso complexes, whereas none of the ID peptides tested is able to activate zzso to a significant zzso zzso of the zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso cellular cholesterol zzso and incorporation of cholesterol into the zzso The cholesterol zzso capacity of the zzso complexes is comparable among the peptides and higher than that of zzso zzso In conclusion, although the zzso of the new peptides is higher than that of the zzso model zzso the lack of zzso zzso by the ID peptides suggests that an enhanced segregation of the zzso and zzso zzso equal magnitude of zzso and zzso faces of the zzso and the absence of zzso charged zzso in the central part of the zzso face might account for the lack of zzso activity of these zzso These parameters do not affect the capacity of the zzso complexes to promote cellular cholesterol zzso
