Hundreds of signaling molecules have been assigned critical roles in the zzso of zzso zzso and heart failure based on cardiac zzso from zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso Because permanent zzso zzso expression in this system begins during a period of rapid zzso zzso growth, resulting zzso are the combined consequences of zzso effects and normal zzso zzso We used zzso forced gene expression to investigate zzso between zzso zzso cardiac growth and two functionally divergent zzso zzso zzso development was compared various times after zzso (age 2 to 3 zzso and adult (age 8 weeks) zzso zzso zzso caused zzso zzso and severe zzso depression in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso was minimal in adults, but was widespread in zzso until it spontaneously resolved in zzso Unlike normal zzso cardiac growth, concurrent left zzso pressure overload zzso did not zzso with zzso expression to cause zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso likewise caused eccentric zzso zzso dysfunction, and pathological gene expression in zzso but not zzso Thus, normal zzso cardiac growth can be an essential zzso in development of genetic zzso and may confound the interpretation of conventional zzso transgenic zzso
