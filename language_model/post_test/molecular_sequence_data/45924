Identification and zzso of numerous zzso species is still a difficult problem due to the close zzso zzso The most difficult fine zzso to identify belong to the zzso zzso aggregate, which is the largest group in the zzso zzso Many zzso are considered to be separate species based on quantitative zzso characters, differences in zzso level or the structure of zzso zzso In order to evaluate the zzso value of zzso zzso sequence analysis of the internal transcribed zzso zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in the ten most problematic fine zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso ITS zzso were found in a single case while in other cases only zzso ITS zzso were detected with 1-2 ambiguous zzso Among the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso even zzso zzso were not detected in any of the zzso species zzso Thus, the results do not support the species status of these ten zzso
