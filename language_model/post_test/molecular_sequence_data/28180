zzso zzso zzso cells, alpha and zzso mate after being appropriately zzso by the zzso zzso by the opposite cell type zzso and zzso zzso The binding of a zzso to its zzso is a signal that zzso a series of zzso changes that lead to the specific zzso zzso required for zzso To identify components of the signal zzso pathway, we sought zzso that restored mating competence to zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso The zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso zzso that zzso zzso growth to all strains and mating ability to zzso alpha zzso strains at the zzso zzso In addition, when zzso zzso were shifted to the zzso temperature, they exhibited two zzso characteristic of zzso response, induction of zzso zzso and zzso of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso The zzso zzso also suppressed a deletion of the zzso gene in a zzso Together, these zzso suggest that the zzso zzso product is a component of the zzso response zzso zzso of zzso or zzso which are required in both zzso cell types for mating and response to zzso was not suppressed by zzso suggesting that the zzso product may function before the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an essential gene and is expressed in both zzso cell types as well as in the product of their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were temperature sensitive although they did not arrest in zzso Thus, the zzso product may also have a role in the zzso life cycle of zzso
