zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein implicated in the development and plasticity of zzso connections of zzso zzso to cell surface zzso zzso is indispensable for the biological activity of zzso In the present paper we have studied the structure of zzso zzso using zzso zzso These studies show that zzso contains two zzso zzso connected by a flexible zzso Both of these zzso contain three zzso zzso In addition to this domain structure, zzso contains the zzso and zzso zzso sequences that lack a zzso structure and appear to form random zzso Studies using CD and zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso a zzso change upon binding to zzso and that the binding occurs primarily to the zzso zzso of the zzso Search of sequence data bases shows that the zzso zzso of zzso are zzso to the zzso type I repeat zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso structures found previously in zzso a protein zzso with zzso also zzso to the zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso sequence motif found in various zzso proteins defines a zzso structure similar to that found in zzso and zzso In addition to the apparent structural zzso a similarity in biological functions is suggested by the occurrence of the zzso sequence motif in a wide variety of proteins that mediate zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which the zzso domain mediates specific cell surface zzso
