Avian zzso zzso is an important cause of disease in zzso Although zzso is known to induce zzso in infected cells, the interaction between zzso and its target cells requires further zzso In this report, we show that the zzso isolate strain zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and primary chicken embryonic zzso zzso cells based on the appearance of an increased number of zzso zzso the presence of zzso protein 1 light chain 3 zzso dot formation, and the elevated production of zzso We further demonstrate that the class I zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso induction by zzso zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso increased viral yields, while zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso led to a decrease in virus zzso Altogether, our studies strongly suggest that zzso may play a critical role in determining viral yield during zzso zzso
