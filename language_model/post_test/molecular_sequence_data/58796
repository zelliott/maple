A system has been developed for the expression in zzso coli of zzso zzso zzso from kiwi zzso In this first report of zzso zzso of zzso zzso seven different zzso of the zzso have been zzso and their activities compared to that of the zzso expressed zzso zzso No great loss of activity was observed when zzso was zzso by either Ala or zzso or when zzso was zzso by zzso However, the zzso proteins showed only zzso of the zzso activity when zzso were made of zzso zzso and zzso The results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms by which zzso zzso is activated by carbon dioxide, and in terms of structural motifs suggested by the known structure of zzso zzso an zzso related by mechanism and sequence similarity to zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso a putative carbon dioxide binding site, has no role to play in the zzso activity of the zzso The results support a previous suggestion that zzso zzso shares important structural features with zzso zzso
