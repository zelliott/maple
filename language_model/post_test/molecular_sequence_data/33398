The zzso mouse is a model of selective motor zzso zzso in the cervical spinal zzso Comparing cervical and zzso tracts of control and diseased mice at the early stage of pathology by zzso analysis, we identified 31 proteins by zzso mass fingerprint after zzso zzso and zzso analysis, that were differently represented among the four experimental zzso In healthy mice, patterns of protein expression differed between cervical and zzso zzso proteins of cellular energetic metabolism zzso showed lower expression in the cervical zzso while cellular trafficking proteins were zzso In zzso mice, these differences disappeared and the expression pattern was similar between cervical and zzso spinal zzso We found that most of the proteins zzso regulated in zzso with respect to control cervical tract were related to zzso or involved in zzso cycle, energy zzso and zzso zzso zzso overrepresented in the zzso zzso spinal zzso were zzso proteins and cellular transport zzso in particular the zzso fusing zzso and the zzso 2 of zzso protein 1, involved in zzso zzso We suggest that zzso of proteins involved in zzso trafficking, together with proteins zzso zzso dysfunction can have zzso effects, preserving zzso spinal zzso motor zzso in zzso zzso
