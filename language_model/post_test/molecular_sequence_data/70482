The zzso acid sequences of 22 zzso from family 13 of zzso zzso were analyzed with the aim of revealing the evolutionary relationships between the zzso zzso and their zzso and zzso zzso Two evolutionary distance trees were zzso zzso the first one based on the alignment of extracted zzso sequence regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strand segments of the zzso zzso and a short zzso stretch in domain B protruding out of the barrel in the zzso zzso zzso loop, and zzso the second one based on the alignment of the substantial continuous part of the zzso involving the entire domain B zzso zzso zzso zzso With regard to zzso zzso both trees compared zzso in fact, the same results; zzso all family 13 zzso from domain zzso were clustered with barley zzso zzso which represent all plant zzso The zzso from zzso zzso and zzso coli, representing zzso and zzso zzso respectively, seem to be the further closest relatives to zzso zzso This evolutionary zzso clearly reflects the discussed similarities in the zzso acid sequences of these zzso especially in the zzso sequence zzso Since the results for zzso belonging to all three zzso zzso zzso zzso offered by both evolutionary trees are very similar, it is proposed that the investigated zzso sequence regions may indeed constitute the zzso zzso of a given zzso
