To better understand the characteristics of zzso located in the zzso arthritis zzso zzso 

One cell line, termed zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was done by contrast zzso indirect zzso and zzso O zzso zzso of several zzso and zzso degrading zzso was zzso The expression of zzso for collagen II was detected by in zzso zzso The ability of zzso independent growth was assessed by soft zzso zzso 

zzso showed a high zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso They also expressed zzso for zzso degrading zzso such as zzso zzso B, and zzso zzso zzso independent growth zzso demonstrated that zzso formed colonies in soft zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso zzso was stained intensely with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso reverse zzso zzso showed that the cell line expressed type II collagen zzso 

Alternative zzso cells were identified in the zzso zzso of zzso sharing properties of zzso and zzso These findings suggest that this zzso cell derived from zzso zzso may contribute to the destruction of the cartilage in zzso
