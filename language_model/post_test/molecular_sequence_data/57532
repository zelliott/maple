The zzso gene product zzso can interact efficiently with two of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso depended upon the minimal regions of zzso necessary for its zzso activity, as well as upon the zzso zzso sequence motif shared with zzso DNA tumor virus zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in insect cells generated zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso activated another such zzso zzso Introduction of zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso cell line zzso led to overt zzso zzso whereas zzso expressed alone or together with zzso zzso remained zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited its binding to the zzso factor zzso and reversed the zzso zzso exit block in the cell zzso Thus, all zzso zzso do not function zzso and one of them plays a major role in reversing the zzso function of a known tumor zzso
