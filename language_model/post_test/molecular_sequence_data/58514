The zzso protein of human zzso virus zzso lacks zzso boxes present in the zzso zzso zzso of other zzso instead it contains three zzso motifs zzso zzso We have expressed the zzso end of zzso zzso containing the zzso boxes (the NC domain zzso and analyzed its zzso acid binding zzso Our results show that the NC domain of zzso zzso binds with high affinity to both zzso and DNA, in a zzso manner, as determined by filter binding zzso Analysis of a zzso containing a zzso sequence in place of zzso box I indicates that this motif is required for zzso acid binding and for viral zzso A zzso in zzso box II still binds to zzso and DNA in zzso but virus containing this zzso does not replicate and no nuclear zzso of the zzso protein is found in zzso zzso Surprisingly, a zzso from this zzso that completely lacks zzso box II and exhibits very little nuclear transport of zzso can readily replicate in tissue zzso This finding thus provides a direct evidence that although the sequences in zzso box II can serve as a nuclear transport zzso they are not required for zzso replication and it is unlikely that nuclear zzso of zzso protein plays any critical role during viral zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso protein of zzso may be more analogous to the core protein of the zzso B virus family than to conventional zzso zzso zzso
