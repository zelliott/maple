zzso zzso or zzso plays a critical role in orchestrating the immune response by binding and zzso the zzso zzso that belongs to the zzso zzso zzso exists as both zzso and zzso and both bind zzso but with differential zzso It is well established that the zzso is the zzso zzso and that the interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso play a critical role in determining binding zzso In order to characterize the structural basis of differential binding of the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso we analyzed zzso zzso chemical shift and peak intensity changes and show that they are exquisitely sensitive and can provide detailed insights into the binding zzso We used three zzso zzso a designed zzso a trapped zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso data for the zzso show that zzso zzso that span the entire zzso are involved in the binding process and that the binding is zzso by a network of extensive direct and indirect coupled zzso Interestingly, in the case of zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso complex to the zzso complex, and in the case of the trapped zzso binding results in increased global zzso zzso Increased dynamics is evidence of zzso zzso indicating that binding of the zzso zzso triggers zzso changes that disrupt zzso zzso resulting in its zzso These results together provide evidence that binding is not a localized event but results in extensive coupled interactions within the zzso and across the zzso interface and that these interactions play a fundamental role in determining binding zzso
