zzso zzso type 2 zzso is the primary cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso however, is found in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The objective of this study was to clarify if zzso zzso zzso sequences isolated from pigs from zzso zzso and zzso zzso cluster zzso in two separate zzso All zzso zzso belonged to zzso group 1 and shared a zzso sequence identity of zzso indicating a very homogeneous zzso population in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed no distinctive zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting that there is no link between zzso sequences and zzso disease zzso The appearance of only zzso group 1 zzso in this study zzso from zzso led us to determine if zzso zzso sequences had changed in Denmark over zzso Interestingly, all zzso zzso from before the first outbreak of zzso (2001) belonged either to a new zzso group identified for the first time in this study and named group 3 zzso from 1980, 1987 and zzso or zzso group 2 zzso from 1993 and zzso The shift from zzso group 2 to 1 was confirmed on a more global scale by placing all full zzso zzso sequences submitted to zzso from 1997 to 2006 in either of the groups by zzso zzso The analysis showed that the shift happened in 2003 or even zzso This may indicate that zzso group 1 is a more adapted form of zzso and possibly could be more zzso
