zzso in the zzso loop of zzso channels were discovered in patients with childhood absence zzso All of these zzso increased the surface expression of the channel, whereas some zzso and in particular zzso altered the zzso properties of zzso zzso around zzso were found to produce channels that opened at even more negative zzso than control, suggesting the presence of a gating brake that normally prevents channel zzso The goal of the present study was to identify the minimal sequence of this brake and to provide insights into its zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso loop was zzso from bacteria, and its structure was analyzed by circular zzso These results indicated that the zzso had a high zzso content, as predicted from secondary structure zzso Based on zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso region of the zzso loop may form a zzso zzso This model was tested by zzso followed by zzso measurement of channel zzso zzso that disrupted the zzso or the loop region, had profound effects on channel zzso shifting both steady state zzso and zzso curves, as well as accelerating channel zzso zzso designed to preserve the zzso structure had more modest zzso Taken together, these studies showed that any zzso in the zzso including zzso disrupted the structural integrity of the brake and its function to maintain these low zzso channels closed at resting membrane zzso
