Although the zzso pattern of zzso positioning is broadly zzso quantitative aspects vary over evolutionary zzso We identify the zzso and trans zzso of zzso positioning using a functional evolutionary approach involving zzso strains containing large zzso regions from other zzso zzso In a foreign species, zzso depletion at promoters is maintained over zzso zzso whereas zzso spacing and all other aspects of zzso positioning tested are zzso Interestingly, the locations of zzso zzso and zzso start sites shift in zzso zzso in a foreign species, zzso regions occur zzso in coding regions, and they often act as promoters that are associated with a positioned zzso array linked to the length of the zzso zzso We suggest a three-step model in which zzso zzso general zzso factors, and the zzso zzso machinery are primarily involved in generating the zzso positioning pattern zzso
