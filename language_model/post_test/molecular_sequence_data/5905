A zzso DNA zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso DNA was used to isolate the entire zzso zzso and two adjacent open reading frames zzso from a zzso zzso Express zzso The zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is flanked by an zzso zzso that shares high similarity to zzso zzso genes zzso and downstream by an zzso (131 zzso of unknown zzso This genetic organization is similar to that in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso shows significant similarity to the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso which are responsible for the synthesis and degradation of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso triggering the stringent zzso zzso of the zzso gene generated a zzso zzso that demonstrated its essential role in the response to zzso acid deprivation and resulted in zzso induction of proteins involved in stress response as well as zzso acid zzso as judged by two-dimensional gel zzso The same effects of impaired induction of some zzso proteins could also be shown in a zzso double zzso supporting the role of zzso in zzso of zzso and anabolic genes during stringent zzso
