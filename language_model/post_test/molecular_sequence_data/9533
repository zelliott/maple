The zzso survival of motor zzso zzso protein is a truncated zzso of zzso the spinal muscular zzso zzso disease zzso zzso is selectively localized in zzso and endowed with remarkable zzso zzso At present, the role of zzso in zzso is zzso As a first step to verify a link between zzso and zzso we investigated by means of zzso experiments in zzso zzso hybrid cell line zzso whether zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso part of the protein affected zzso zzso We demonstrated here that either zzso zzso zzso or small zzso zzso located in the Tudor domain consistently altered the zzso capability of inducing zzso zzso in zzso zzso human zzso proteins determined in almost all zzso motor zzso the growth of short zzso with prominent zzso zzso Our data indicate that the Tudor domain is critical in dictating zzso function possibly because it is an association domain for proteins involved in zzso zzso They also indicate that Tudor domain zzso are functionally relevant not only for zzso but also for zzso raising the possibility that also zzso loss of function may contribute to the zzso steps leading to zzso
