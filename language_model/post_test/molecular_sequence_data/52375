Nuclear factors from zzso cells were isolated by zzso of zzso bound proteins with a double stranded synthetic zzso corresponding to the region from zzso to zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso proteins were further zzso and separated from the zzso by zzso exchange zzso zzso within the resulting fraction bound with specificity to the zzso zzso zzso gel analysis and competition with specific zzso zzso show that multiple factors present in this fraction compete for binding within the same region of the zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that these factors contact a zzso element that is within the region that is required for enhanced expression of the gene in zzso zzso One of the factors protects an extended DNA sequence but still contacts the zzso zzso
