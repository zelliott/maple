Total zzso DNA was isolated from three cereal stem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two cereal leaf zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed for the presence of zzso in the zzso region of the zzso DNA repeat zzso A 1 zzso region of the repeat unit between the zzso and the 5s zzso genes zzso was amplified by zzso and was found to be zzso within each isolate and variable in size between races and zzso The zzso results were confirmed by Southern zzso analysis of native zzso In an isolate of race zzso zzso appeared to be due to variable numbers of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Nine wheat stem rust strains representing nine different races produced a unique pattern of zzso while two different zzso of one race were zzso as were five of zzso This may provide a rapid method for race identification in wheat stem zzso zzso and zzso in rye stem zzso zzso stem zzso wheat leaf zzso and zzso crown zzso was less pronounced than in wheat stem zzso In the course of this work, the 5s zzso gene was located and its position and orientation within the zzso repeat unit was zzso
