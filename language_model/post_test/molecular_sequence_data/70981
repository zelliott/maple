zzso oxide zzso zzso is the terminal zzso involved in zzso by zzso No three-dimensional structural information has been published for this zzso We have isolated and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso containing seven to eight copper atoms per zzso zzso of sequence and compositional data with other zzso suggests that zzso is typical and can be expected to have similar domain folding and zzso structure to other members of this family of zzso We present zzso zzso data, zzso using a zzso method for shape restoration, which gave a approximately 20 A resolution structure of the zzso in solution, providing a glimpse of the structure of any zzso and shedding light on the molecular architecture of the zzso The specific activity of zzso was approximately 6 zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity showed both base and temperature zzso The visible spectrum exhibited an zzso maximum at 550 zzso with a shoulder at zzso zzso On zzso with zzso the zzso maximum shifted to 540 zzso and a new shoulder at zzso zzso zzso Reduction under zzso conditions resulted in the formation of an inactive blue form of the zzso with a broad zzso maximum at 650 zzso As isolated, the zzso shows an almost featureless zzso spectrum, which changes on zzso to give an almost completely resolved zzso zzso signal in the zzso region, g zzso zzso with zzso zzso 40 G, consistent with the zzso being partially reduced as zzso Both the optical and zzso zzso of the oxidized zzso are characteristic of the presence of a zzso zzso
