zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with three types of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease, and primary zzso zzso The virus encodes a number of proteins that participate in zzso the immune response, one of which was predicted by sequence analysis to be zzso by open reading frame 4 zzso The predicted zzso protein shares zzso with cellular proteins referred to as regulators of complement zzso In the present study, the zzso profile of the zzso gene was zzso revealing that it encodes at least three zzso by alternative zzso mechanisms, and three protein zzso zzso studies revealed that each zzso protein zzso zzso complement and retains a zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso activity, we propose to name the proteins zzso by the zzso gene collectively as zzso complement control protein zzso zzso zzso is the most complex alternatively spliced gene zzso a viral complement regulator described to zzso zzso zzso the complement component of the innate immune response, thereby possibly contributing to the in zzso persistence and zzso of this zzso
