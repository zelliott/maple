In zzso zzso zzso starts 6 hours after zzso at the zzso transition and therefore the first steps in embryonic development are regulated by zzso inherited proteins and zzso While zzso polarity is already present in the zzso the zzso axis is only established upon zzso by the entry of the zzso and the subsequent rotation of the egg zzso In a screen for maternal zzso whose stability is regulated by this cortical zzso we isolated the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso It encodes a putative zzso zzso expressed zzso and localized predominantly to the vegetal half of the zzso Upon zzso and cortical zzso zzso zzso is displaced together with the heavy zzso towards the future zzso side of the zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso less than in zzso zzso that undergo cortical zzso zzso of zzso by injection of synthetic zzso in whole zzso or in zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso This zzso activity is dependent on the presence of the zzso domain of the zzso In contrast to the two other known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression leads specifically to zzso formation in the absence of zzso zzso
