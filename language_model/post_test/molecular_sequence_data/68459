The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso responsible for inducing expression of several zzso proteins in response to zzso The mechanism of this zzso was zzso An zzso clone was found to produce much lower levels of zzso protein at 26 than at 37 degrees C in zzso zzso although it was transcribed at similar levels at both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli also resulted in zzso production of the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso protein was stable at 26 and 37 degrees C, suggesting that translation rate or message degradation is zzso zzso The zzso zzso appears to be highly unstable and could not be reliably detected in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene into zzso zzso which produces high levels of zzso zzso aided detection of zzso message in zzso zzso zzso of the amount of zzso protein produced per unit of message at 26 and 37 degrees C indicated that the efficiency of translation of zzso message increased with zzso zzso secondary structure predictions suggest that the zzso zzso sequence is zzso in a zzso A model in which decreased stability of this zzso with increasing temperature leads to increased efficiency of translation initiation of zzso message is zzso
