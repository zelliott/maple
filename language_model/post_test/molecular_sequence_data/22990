zzso analysis of the zzso genes from 20 zzso zzso zzso from Turkey zzso with high-level zzso nine with low-level zzso and three that were zzso was performed and zzso trees were zzso Most zzso clustered together within a single branch that was distinct from sequences deposited previously in zzso which suggests that these zzso have probably evolved following new zzso zzso The most prominent zzso zzso which have also been associated previously with resistance, were zzso in zzso zzso followed by zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso All zzso also possessed a zzso block in the zzso zzso instead of the zzso sequence of zzso which is fairly uncommon in zzso zzso This is the first study to zzso zzso in the zzso sequences of zzso isolated in zzso
