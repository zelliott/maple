Using a human zzso zzso zzso zzso probe, we investigated zzso transcript levels in 13 human zzso fragments by Northern zzso zzso 7 zzso disease, 2 zzso disease, 3 endemic zzso and 1 healthy zzso zzso were zzso zzso expression levels were zzso but displayed a close correlation to the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not zzso Overall, zzso transcript levels were low or absent in those zzso in which expression of the major zzso complex class I or II zzso I or zzso was high, thus establishing an inverse relation zzso I, r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso II, r zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that apart from zzso zzso cells themselves were the source of zzso II zzso zzso expression was only zzso in 1 zzso zzso Our findings suggest that next to zzso zzso active regulatory events in the zzso are responsible for the inverse relation between functional parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso markers zzso I and zzso
