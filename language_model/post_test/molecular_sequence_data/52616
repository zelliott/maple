zzso zzso are a classical model to study the events during tissue zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso from the marine sponge zzso zzso fuse within 5 zzso In contrast, zzso are rejected and zzso Here we show that during zzso rejection the cells in the zzso undergo zzso 5 days after transplantation zzso of the cells show signs of zzso In a previous study it was shown that during this process a tumor necrosis zzso zzso is induced in zzso and zzso zzso grouped to the zzso of tumor necrosis factor receptors and a series of associated adapter molecules contain the characteristic death zzso zzso we screened for a zzso zzso such a zzso Here we report on the first zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso a death zzso The potential zzso zzso zzso with a calculated Mr of 24 zzso possesses in contrast to all known zzso death zzso proteins two such zzso with highest similarity to the death domain present in human zzso The expression of this gene is not zzso in control tissue but strongly zzso in zzso only very low expression is seen in zzso Parallel with the increase of the expression of the potential zzso zzso zzso in zzso the level of zzso drastically increases from zzso zzso of protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso during a period of 5 days after zzso the level of zzso in zzso does not zzso Very likely in response to inflammatory reactions the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed both in zzso and zzso These results demonstrate that sponges are provided with zzso zzso similar to those present in zzso and apparently absent in zzso which are composed of molecules zzso a death zzso In addition, it is suggested that in sponges zzso is one zzso which is involved in the initiation of zzso It is zzso that the potential zzso effect of zzso is prevented in zzso by the expression of the zzso zzso
