Several overlapping zzso clones corresponding to the entire coding sequence of the mouse alpha zzso collagen gene zzso zzso were zzso The conceptual zzso acid translation indicated a high degree of sequence identity zzso with the human alpha zzso zzso The cloning experiments also revealed alternative zzso of the sequence coding for 85 zzso located within the zzso region of the zzso domain of alpha zzso Analysis of zzso samples from different embryonic zzso suggested that alternative zzso might be confined to tissue destined to become zzso
