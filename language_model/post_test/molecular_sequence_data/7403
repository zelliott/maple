We describe the isolation and characterization of the zzso gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso which regulates focal zzso zzso is required for cell locomotion and is a critical downstream regulator of zzso zzso The zzso gene spans at least 20 zzso and comprises 14 zzso ranging in size from 75 to zzso zzso zzso extension studies indicate that the major zzso start point is in position zzso relative to the start zzso Northern zzso analysis of mouse zzso zzso identified two zzso species of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso clones and zzso products with the zzso clones identified alternately spliced zzso in both the coding and zzso zzso regions of zzso In the coding region zzso 4 is alternately zzso The major zzso transcript zzso in zzso zzso does not contain zzso 4 and encodes a protein of 70 zzso A minor transcript containing zzso 4, namely zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso Western analysis demonstrated both a major zzso zzso 1) and minor zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The functional significance of these two zzso is currently being zzso
