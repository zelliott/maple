In zzso zzso the zzso program triggered by cell wall stress is coordinated by zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso of the cell wall integrity zzso pathway, and is mostly zzso by the zzso factor zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso complex plays a critical role in orchestrating the zzso response regulated by zzso zzso zzso show drastically reduced expression of cell wall zzso genes and hypersensitivity to cell zzso zzso On stress, binding of zzso Pol II to the promoters of these genes depends on zzso zzso and zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso to direct its association to target zzso Finally, we observe zzso displacement at the zzso gene zzso which relies on the zzso zzso Taken together, our results identify the zzso complex as a key element of the zzso zzso zzso that mediates the zzso zzso necessary for adequate zzso response to cell wall zzso
