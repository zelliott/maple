zzso are emerging pathogens for which culture and identification are partly zzso In fact, zzso zzso sequencing is by far the most widely used zzso methodology that is able to detect such zzso zzso However, this zzso actually has some limitations linked to potential problems of contamination, which zzso zzso To circumvent this, we have devised a simple zzso strategy involving targeting of the gene zzso the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso The complete sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was determined and compared with the published sequences for zzso zzso and zzso zzso From the resulting analysis, zzso zzso zzso were designed and tested for their ability to amplify a portion of the zzso gene from various zzso Using two different pairs of these zzso we succeeded in obtaining specific zzso fragments for all members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso tested and no other zzso Our findings may have significant implications for the development of a new tool for the identification of zzso especially if clinical samples are contaminated or when the infecting strain is zzso
