The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes the zzso of the surface protein array known as zzso zzso sequence analysis of the 374 zzso of DNA immediately upstream of zzso revealed two potential promoter sequences and other possible regulatory zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction analysis showed that the region was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso extension and Northern zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso was directed predominantly by a zzso promoter, zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso with an untranslated zzso leader sequence which contained two predicted zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis of cells grown at 15 degrees C showed that zzso transcript production peaked during the zzso phase of growth zzso zzso zzso At 15 degrees C, the zzso of the zzso zzso was 22 zzso while at 20 degrees C, the zzso was significantly zzso 11 zzso The amount of zzso transcript produced was reduced by growth in the presence of the DNA zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso Environmental factors such as growth temperature and atmospheric oxygen tension also affected the quantity of zzso zzso zzso transcript could not be detected in zzso which produced either low levels of full-length or truncated A protein or no zzso A zzso
