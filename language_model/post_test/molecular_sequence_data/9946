The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with a yield of zzso and a specific activity of 173 to 178 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is the first zzso studied in a zzso zzso The zzso acts on artificial zzso zzso such as zzso blue, but is ineffective with zzso zzso or other soluble zzso electron zzso zzso of zzso zzso belongs to class I of zzso and is a zzso zzso zzso composed of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cloning data revealed, that zzso comprises zzso zzso acid zzso and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso comprises 360 zzso acid zzso and is zzso as a precursor protein which is zzso after zzso at position 45, thus producing a mature zzso of zzso zzso The leader sequence zzso to the signal zzso of small zzso of zzso The zzso plots of zzso and zzso were indicative for the absence of zzso zzso zzso has four zzso zzso and is considered the potential membrane anchor of zzso in zzso zzso zzso genes show the zzso order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene cluster as well as the clustered CO zzso zzso and Calvin cycle zzso genes are arranged within a zzso DNA segment of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
