The salt adaptation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied at the zzso and molecular zzso The freshwater zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to adapt to salt zzso up to 1 M, and the addition of the compatible zzso zzso zzso to the growth medium facilitated adaptation to higher salt zzso Transport studies with cell suspensions revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor studies argue for a primary transport zzso Analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso of known primary zzso zzso zzso This gene cluster was designated zzso zzso zzso zzso Its sequence and gene organization are very similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso revealed a zzso zzso of this zzso zzso is the first identified zzso zzso for compatible zzso in zzso
