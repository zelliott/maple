zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso that interacts with a number of zzso proteins and zzso proteins involved in the regulation of zzso Relatively little is known about the structure of zzso but it has been noted that it contains three zzso that are rich in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sequence of zzso zzso to that of a zzso protein domain zzso zzso and it has been zzso that this and both zzso and zzso may be zinc finger zzso This has not, however, been demonstrated zzso We have studied zzso and show that it is composed of two novel zzso zzso which we term zzso zzso Each bundle contains the sequence zzso and we show that a synthetic zzso zzso one zinc bundle from zzso can fold in a zzso zzso zzso also appears to contain two zinc zzso one with the zzso sequence zzso and we demonstrate that this zzso motif also zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso domain in cellular zzso We show that zzso in any of the four zzso zzso in either zinc bundle of zzso significantly impair this activity and that these zzso also interfere with certain zzso interactions zzso by zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a genuine zzso protein and introduce zinc zzso as novel protein interaction zzso
