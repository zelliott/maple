The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been raised against the human zzso zzso and shown to act as a competitive zzso As a first step in the structural characterization of the zzso the crystal structure of the zzso zzso from this zzso is reported at zzso A zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso A model generated by zzso zzso was used as an aid in the zzso and the zzso zzso structure was subsequently refined zzso R factor zzso zzso The structure obtained exhibits the typical zzso zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso onto standard zzso zzso zzso The zzso loop could be classified according to recently published rules regarding loop zzso sequence and zzso This loop is 14 zzso long, with an approximate zzso zzso which is distorted somewhat by the presence of two trans zzso zzso at the beginning of the zzso It is expected that this zzso loop will facilitate the design of synthetic zzso for the zzso zzso that may be used to investigate zzso zzso
