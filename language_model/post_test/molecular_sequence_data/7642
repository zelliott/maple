The human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein import zzso zzso has been identified and zzso zzso similarities between these three proteins is most pronounced within the zzso third of the zzso However, the zzso protein exhibits only weak zzso to the zzso repeat B domain that is found in zzso zzso is targeted and inserted into the outer membrane of isolated rat heart zzso in the zzso zzso zzso directed against the soluble portion of zzso inhibited in zzso zzso import of a diverse set of precursor proteins (including inner membrane zzso zzso but failed to block import of a fusion protein bearing the zzso sequence of zzso zzso Finally, expression of zzso zzso the respiratory zzso of delta zzso zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso is a component of the zzso import zzso
