zzso zzso zzso has previously been demonstrated to require interaction of the zzso with a DNA duplex region encompassing the zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso O zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The required region, designated region A, includes positions -5 through zzso on the zzso strand and positions zzso through zzso on the zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso defined DNA zzso in zzso I zzso zzso we show that efficient zzso within region A requires additional interaction of the zzso with duplex DNA on the side holding the zzso end generated by zzso By analyzing the interaction of zzso I with DNA zzso varying by single zzso on either strand outside region A, an additional duplex region, designated region B, was zzso to positions zzso The ability of zzso I to interact separately with regions A and B was zzso on sets of DNA zzso containing a zzso series of zzso branch zzso The obtained results demonstrate that the normal zzso zzso equilibrium established by zzso I on continuous duplex DNA is replaced by irreversible zzso on DNA zzso containing branch sites between the zzso site and region B as these DNA zzso allow zzso but prevent zzso due to release of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso interaction mode of zzso I during the zzso reaction is thus indicated by both the absence of zzso duplex stabilization and the wide tolerance for protruding strands between the zzso site and region zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes are zzso competent to zzso added DNA fragments carrying free zzso ends, the results suggest a role of zzso I in illegitimate zzso
