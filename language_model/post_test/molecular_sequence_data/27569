zzso DNA sequence of zzso induced zzso zzso zzso was expressed under control of the zzso promoter sequence in zzso coli using the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso protein expressed exceeded 20 zzso of soluble zzso per liter of zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed the expected molecular weight and zzso zzso assembly on the basis of zzso on zzso zzso gels and gel zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso acid composition analysis of the zzso protein including zzso peptides agreed with the zzso zzso zzso kinetic characterization based on product zzso studies was consistent with the ordered zzso reaction mechanism expected of zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso is the highest reported to date for class I zzso zzso zzso rate by zzso zzso zzso zzso is three times greater than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso greater than that of the rabbit liver zzso and zzso greater than that of the rabbit muscle zzso to which zzso zzso exhibits the greatest zzso The implications of such a high zzso turnover on zzso zzso under zzso is zzso
