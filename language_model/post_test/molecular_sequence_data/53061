zzso is a key component of the zzso envelope of terminally differentiated zzso The human zzso largely consists of 10 zzso repeats and forms a thin 460 A long zzso zzso experimental data and a detailed zzso analysis made with computer modeling resulted in a structural model for the zzso zzso The suggested structure is a left-handed zzso zzso built of a tandem array of zzso zzso The structure enables us to explain the whole set of experimental data and zzso zzso within the zzso It is zzso suited to serve as a scaffold for cell envelope assembly and proposes a possible mode of the zzso interactions of zzso during cell zzso
