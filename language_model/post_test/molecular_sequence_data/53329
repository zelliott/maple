zzso zzso zzso a powerful zzso that binds avidly to DNA by zzso is seen to damage the zzso zzso of zzso sites by zzso charge transport through zzso When zzso zzso to the center of a zzso zzso and delivered by triplex formation within a zzso motif to a specific site on a restriction fragment, zzso can zzso zzso over at least zzso zzso in each direction from the site of zzso zzso migration occurs in both directions from the zzso zzso and on both DNA strands of the target, but the zzso is significantly more efficient to the 3' side of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso when zzso directly to the zzso zzso of the zzso strand as opposed to the center, generate significant amounts of zzso damage only in the immediate vicinity of the zzso zzso Given that long-range charge transport depends on DNA zzso these results suggest that the base stack is distorted at the zzso end of the triplex region in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso damage by triplex formation extends our previous studies of long-range charge transport to significantly longer DNA sequences through a strategy that does not require zzso attachment of the zzso to the DNA being zzso Moreover, triplex targeting of zzso damage provides for the first time a typical distance distribution for zzso charge transport of approximately 200 A around the zzso
