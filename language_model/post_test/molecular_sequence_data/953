We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the Chinese zzso zzso zzso The toxin contains 36 zzso stabilized by three zzso zzso bridges zzso zzso and zzso assigned by a chemical strategy of partial reduction and sequence zzso zzso and zzso using zzso amplification of zzso ends and zzso amplification of zzso ends, the full-length zzso zzso a zzso precursor of zzso Different from other zzso zzso it contains an uncommon zzso site zzso anterior to mature protein and the intervening regions of 5 zzso which is the smallest in zzso toxin zzso identified to zzso Under whole cell recording, zzso showed no effects on zzso sodium channels zzso or calcium channels in zzso root zzso zzso whereas it significantly inhibited zzso zzso with an zzso value of zzso zzso in rat cardiac zzso Different from scorpion zzso it caused a zzso zzso shift in the channel zzso zzso The binding site for zzso on zzso is further suggested to be site 4 with a simple competitive zzso which at 10 zzso eliminated the slowing currents induced by zzso zzso zzso I zzso scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso shows higher selectivity for zzso zzso than other zzso toxins affecting zzso and the toxin hopefully represents an important zzso for discriminating cardiac zzso zzso
