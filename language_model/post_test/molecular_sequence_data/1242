The small zzso Ran has multiple roles during the cell division cycle, including nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear envelope zzso However, regulation of Ran during cell division is poorly zzso zzso is generated by the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso the zzso of which to zzso is necessary for the zzso of zzso in human zzso Using zzso techniques, we show that the zzso interaction of human zzso fused to green fluorescent protein zzso changes during progression through zzso by being highly dynamic during zzso and more stable toward the end of zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso involves the interface of zzso with Ran and requires an zzso region containing a nuclear zzso zzso We show that this region contains sites zzso by zzso protein zzso One site, zzso 11, is targeted by zzso B and is zzso in zzso human zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso its binding to zzso zzso and maintains the mobility of zzso during zzso This mechanism may be important for the localized generation of zzso on zzso after nuclear envelope breakdown and may play a role in the coordination of progression through zzso
