zzso are large zzso that cover zzso surfaces of the zzso All zzso contain at least one zzso domain, a region rich in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also characterized by von zzso D zzso zzso or SEA zzso We have developed zzso methods to identify zzso genes and proteins based on these properties of the zzso Using such methods we are able to characterize different organisms where zzso sequence is available with respect to their zzso zzso 

We have here made a comprehensive analysis of potential zzso zzso by the chicken zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso are zzso within a locus similar to the corresponding human zzso However, the chicken has an additional gene inserted between zzso and zzso that encodes the the zzso of zzso a protein similar to zzso but it is lacking a zzso zzso We also show that the zzso of zzso is the zzso of human zzso The zzso zzso gene is in chicken as well as in zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso like zzso suggesting that these two proteins are evolutionary zzso Unlike previously known zzso the zzso domain of zzso is zzso by multiple zzso where each zzso encodes a repeat unit of the zzso zzso 

We report new zzso zzso in chicken and this information will aid in understanding the evolution of zzso in zzso The fact that zzso a protein not found in zzso was located in the same locus as other zzso zzso provides strong support that these proteins are evolutionary zzso Furthermore, a relationship of zzso and the zzso zzso is suggested on the basis of their zzso properties and their presence in the same zzso Finally, our finding that the chicken zzso is distributed between multiple zzso raises the interesting possibility that the length of the zzso domain could be controlled by alternative zzso
