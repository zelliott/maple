One of the major obstacles in the design of an effective vaccine against zzso is its zzso variation, which results in viral escape from the immune zzso Through a zzso approach, we developed an innovative zzso zzso vaccine comprised of a pool of 176 zzso and zzso peptides representing variable regions of zzso and zzso zzso The potency and breadth of the candidate vaccine against a panel of zzso zzso was evaluated in nonhuman zzso zzso zzso and humanized mouse zzso zzso The results demonstrate strong zzso with both breadth zzso and cellular zzso and depth zzso recognition of widely divergent viral zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso
