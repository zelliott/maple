zzso responsible for blood zzso have yet to be identified in zzso zzso We report here the cloning and molecular zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, from the hard tick zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the soluble fraction of adult tick extracts by zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso expression mainly took place in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso was induced by a zzso zzso A functional zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli efficiently zzso synthetic zzso for zzso a zzso (with the zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso (with the zzso value zzso zzso and zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was found to be optimum at pH 8 and 35 degrees zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity was strongly dependent on metal zzso zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso These results indicate that zzso play an important role for zzso blood zzso zzso
