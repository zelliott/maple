The zzso of zzso in California sea lions zzso is considered to be unusually zzso zzso microscopic examination of some of these zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso with typical zzso zzso While current attempts to cultivate this virus have not been successful, molecular studies employing DNA extracted from zzso zzso allowed both the zzso of the agent and its identification in zzso and zzso tissue zzso Two zzso fragments generated using zzso zzso in zzso demonstrated highest identities with other zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this novel virus, tentatively designated zzso zzso zzso grouped with members of the zzso zzso and was distinct from zzso a previously described zzso zzso An zzso specific zzso was established and used to investigate the presence of this virus in zzso zzso zzso of DNA isolated from animals with these zzso demonstrated that this virus was present in zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, DNA extracted from zzso brain and muscle zzso was also positive in zzso zzso and 50% zzso of cases zzso This preliminary study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that the presence of this novel zzso is a factor in the development of zzso zzso in zzso
