zzso is a zzso protein that functions as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translation factor, and molecular zzso The small zzso zzso has been engineered to bind to the zzso zzso pocket domain of zzso This binding of zzso has two zzso zzso zzso effects through competitive disruption of the zzso complex and zzso zzso effects that zzso stabilize zzso zzso interactions that increase zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We present a methodology using a zzso zzso exchange platform that measures zzso binding to the zzso domain of zzso zzso in order to begin to develop dynamic zzso that evaluate zzso zzso In order to zzso the regions in zzso being suppressed by zzso zzso was incubated with the zzso and zzso zzso exchange was measured after zzso zzso One dynamic segment containing zzso acids zzso exhibited slower zzso exchange after zzso zzso reflecting zzso binding within the zzso zzso However, another dominant suppression of zzso exchange was observed in a motif from zzso acids zzso that reflects surface zzso zzso surrounding the zzso pocket of zzso In order to explore the consequences of this latter zzso interaction site on zzso the zzso and zzso zzso series was zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were fully active in zzso zzso However, the authentic zzso zzso complex exhibited partial resistance to zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso complex retained normal zzso zzso These data reveal the existence of a second functional zzso site in a surface zzso patch of zzso zzso the zzso zzso This reveals two modes of zzso binding by zzso and highlights the utility of zzso exchange as an zzso for measuring zzso effects in zzso
