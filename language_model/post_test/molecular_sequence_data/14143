zzso diseases zzso are human zzso zzso that are characterized by the zzso of truncated zzso heavy chains devoid of light zzso We have previously zzso zzso to the process by which zzso growth factor receptors can be zzso because the genetic defects in zzso result in the production of abnormal zzso heavy chains lacking an zzso domain, these abnormal zzso zzso receptors might engage in zzso zzso zzso zzso development requires the presence of the zzso zzso formed by the association of zzso heavy chains with two zzso surrogate light zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso to the variable and constant portions of zzso light zzso zzso To assess whether zzso zzso of zzso heavy chains results in their zzso zzso we have examined the ability of a zzso zzso protein to promote zzso development in transgenic zzso 

When the zzso zzso zzso is introduced into zzso mice, zzso zzso cells develop zzso To determine whether this zzso development requires surrogate light zzso we zzso mice expressing full-length or truncated zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the truncated heavy chain, but not the normal chain, is able to promote zzso development in the absence of zzso zzso We also show that truncated zzso chains spontaneously zzso at the surface of bone zzso zzso 

zzso of the truncated zzso heavy chain zzso a tightly controlled step of zzso development, which strongly suggests that a zzso signal is delivered by the truncated zzso chain disease zzso The zzso of zzso chain disease proteins might account for this zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of heavy chains could play a role in the genesis of zzso zzso if it occurs at an appropriate stage of zzso zzso namely in a mature B zzso
