Human zzso virus type 1 zzso does not replicate in primary cells of New World zzso To better understand this zzso we expressed zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso monkey kidney cell line, zzso An zzso zzso modified to evade the zzso monkey restriction factor zzso zzso efficiently in these cells but could not replicate in primary zzso zzso zzso T zzso To understand this difference, we examined zzso and zzso zzso from zzso cells and primary zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso cells expressed substantially lower levels of zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso by zzso zzso and reduced but did not abolish zzso replication when zzso expressed in zzso zzso The functional difference between zzso zzso and zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso previously shown to distinguish African green monkey from human zzso We also characterized zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso of zzso 181 of zzso zzso rescued its function and its efficient N zzso All zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but none of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso replication in zzso monkeys is not restricted at entry but can be limited by zzso and zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso does not restrict zzso replication via zzso a property likely useful for the study of zzso zzso
