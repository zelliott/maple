zzso zzso zzso is a widespread environmental zzso arising as a zzso of numerous industrial zzso zzso can reduce toxic and zzso zzso to zzso and less toxic zzso offering promise for an environmental friendly and affordable solution to zzso zzso zzso a class I zzso zzso from zzso zzso is an efficient zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso is yet unknown to the scientific community, hence a three-dimensional zzso structure is very essential for structural studies, protein - zzso interaction simulations and designing novel zzso zzso The zzso model of the zzso zzso zzso protein was predicted using in zzso zzso Due to low percentage of sequence identity for zzso zzso zzso was used for structure prediction which combines the methods of zzso zzso zzso modeling and structural zzso The stereo chemical quality of the best model was validated with zzso zzso under favored region from zzso zzso The modeled protein was submitted to zzso Model Database and can be downloaded with the ID zzso The degree of conservation was mapped onto the predicted model and zzso binding sites were zzso The results of conservation analysis and binding site prediction were combined to show several highly zzso binding zzso Altogether, the structure for zzso has been zzso The work reveals novel universally zzso zzso These zzso could be candidates for binding interactions and provide the basis for designing advanced zzso zzso zzso
