zzso syndrome zzso is a disease characterized by zzso and growth zzso sunlight sensitivity, and a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The two principle proteins involved in zzso zzso and zzso have been hypothesized to bind zzso zzso II zzso zzso and link zzso to DNA zzso We have tested zzso and zzso in zzso designed to determine their role in zzso zzso Using a unique zzso DNA template, we provide zzso evidence that zzso interacts with Pol II molecules engaged in zzso complexes containing DNA and nascent zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso bond is required for the formation of a stable Pol zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso does not directly bind Pol zzso
