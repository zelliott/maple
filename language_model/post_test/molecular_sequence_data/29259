The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso by the gene originally identified by the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains repeated zzso zzso to a variety of proteins that influence cell zzso The protein accumulates during development, reaching a zzso level at the finger zzso Much of the zzso protein is found zzso during development, and in zzso zzso is found in association with zzso zzso zzso of an zzso strain generated by gene replacement reveals a significant increase in zzso zzso when cells are starved in zzso buffer zzso zzso zzso cells are also more adhesive to the underlying zzso and are delayed in zzso zzso with the severity of the delay increasing as cells are grown in the presence of bacteria or on tissue culture dishes rather than in suspension zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso defects of zzso zzso however, expression of additional copies of the gene in zzso cells results in more severe zzso delays and decreased zzso in suspension zzso We propose that the zzso protein functions as an zzso to limit zzso and zzso zzso during development and thus zzso cell migration during zzso
