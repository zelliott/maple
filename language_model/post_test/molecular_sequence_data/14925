A zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of single polar zzso zzso marine zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from sea water collected from a farming pond rearing marine shrimp zzso zzso in zzso zzso province, zzso The strain was able to grow in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso between pH 6 and 9 zzso at pH zzso between 15 and zzso zzso at zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences locate strain zzso in the vicinity of the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso data and zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso sequences of four genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearly differentiated strain zzso from its closest zzso zzso Analysis of zzso features, including zzso activities and zzso and zzso of various carbon sources, further revealed discrimination between strain zzso and zzso related zzso zzso The major fatty acid components are zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso values, it can be concluded that zzso should be placed in the zzso zzso as representing a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso
