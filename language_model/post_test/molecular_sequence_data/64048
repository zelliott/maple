The zzso of zzso receptors on zzso zzso is a key step in zzso junction zzso This process depends on alternatively spliced forms of the zzso zzso with zzso of 8, 11, or 19 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso of the neural B8 and zzso forms of zzso were determined by X-ray zzso The structure of zzso which lacks zzso was determined by zzso The zzso domain adopts a beta zzso zzso The B insert site is flanked by four zzso on one edge of the beta zzso The zzso form a surface that zzso to a versatile interaction interface in the family of structurally related zzso zzso zzso and X-ray data indicate that this interaction interface is flexible in zzso and that flexibility is reduced by zzso zzso The plasticity of the interaction interface could enable different zzso forms of zzso to select between multiple binding zzso
