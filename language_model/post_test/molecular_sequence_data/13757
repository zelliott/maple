zzso belongs to a gene family whose members are characterized by their zzso zzso repeats, which allow them to interact with members of the zzso family of zzso zzso We have zzso a human zzso zzso clone to determine its gene zzso The human zzso gene zzso has six zzso and five zzso that span approximately zzso zzso This zzso organization is similar to that of other members of the zzso gene zzso The human zzso gene shares similar zzso boundaries with the human zzso and zzso zzso which is consistent with their zzso zzso zzso To examine further the evolutionary relationship between human zzso and other members of its gene family, we performed a zzso zzso Although the resulting zzso tree does not identify a common zzso of the zzso and other members of its gene family, it indicates that this family zzso into two groups based on structure and zzso
