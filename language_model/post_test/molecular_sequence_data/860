zzso analysis of zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso has identified over 600 putative zzso zzso The genes zzso nine of these not previously characterized plus the previously described zzso protein were zzso inserted into a zzso adding a zzso tag to the zzso of the gene product, and transformed into zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by western zzso zzso zzso located all 10 fusion proteins in the zzso zzso was localized to a subset of outer zzso zzso For some zzso additional signal was observed in the cell zzso Among the latter was zzso which showed a spotted distribution along the zzso and an zzso at the zzso zzso This pattern is characteristic for zzso transport zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso and zzso with zzso particles in zzso zzso Furthermore, it zzso with zzso complex B protein zzso but not with zzso complex A protein zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel component of zzso complex B and zzso it zzso zzso of zzso are zzso in the zzso of a subset of organisms that assemble zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is 37% identical to the corresponding human zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso are absent from the zzso of organisms that lack zzso and zzso and, interestingly, also from those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has a specialized role in zzso that is not required for the assembly of zzso or zzso in the zzso and zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
