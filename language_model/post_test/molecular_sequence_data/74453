The zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor important for retinal zzso We report here the identification and expression analysis of the avian zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso layer of the neural zzso during early stages of chick zzso Its zzso expression is distinct from that of a related nuclear zzso zzso Chick zzso recognizes and binds to the same target DNA sequence as its zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that chick zzso acts as a zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a common role in retinal development in zzso
