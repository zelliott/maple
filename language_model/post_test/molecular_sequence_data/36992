We have determined the structure of the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso The gene zzso encodes a zzso protein with a zzso of zzso It possesses the alternating zzso regions similar to those found in many other integral membrane zzso The most striking feature of the zzso zzso component zzso by zzso is its striking similarity to the zzso zzso component zzso by zzso Although data available indicate that these proteins do not share any overlap of function, their predicted protein sequences are zzso zzso zzso similar, and their DNA sequences are zzso zzso The upstream regulatory region of zzso contains all of the characterized zzso elements previously reported for zzso zzso zzso zzso six sequences zzso to zzso the element responsible for nitrogen zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso and two sequences zzso to the zzso element responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The finding of these zzso sequences predicted to exist on the basis of zzso expression zzso supports and strengthens the suggestion that these elements mediate the functions we have previously ascribed to zzso
