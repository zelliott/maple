zzso hormone zzso was zzso from zzso of sea bass zzso zzso and its zzso and biological properties were zzso Sea bass zzso zzso was zzso by ethanol zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso column using a linear zzso of ammonium zzso zzso zzso and reverse phase zzso on a zzso zzso column with a linear zzso of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso estimated by mass zzso was of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso After separation by zzso under reducing condition, the intact zzso was zzso in the respective zzso zzso and zzso zzso identity was confirmed by zzso detection and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso decreased the molecular mass of both zzso zzso zzso activated the sea bass zzso zzso zzso expressed in the cell line zzso zzso in a dose dependent zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity, by stimulating the release of zzso zzso from sea bass zzso and testosterone zzso and zzso zzso from zzso tissue cultured in zzso in a dose and time dependent zzso These results showed that the zzso zzso is a zzso hormone, composed of two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso and has biological activity judged by its ability to stimulate its zzso in a specific manner and to promote steroid release from zzso tissue zzso
