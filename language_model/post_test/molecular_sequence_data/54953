zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in most zzso but their functions remain zzso Here, we characterized whether zzso is indispensable for virus zzso zzso transcript was first detected at zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso transcript was zzso zzso analysis revealed two zzso initiation sites, one of which was mapped to the zzso zzso early zzso zzso motif zzso zzso protein could be detected from infected cells harvested at zzso zzso zzso expression zzso showed that zzso zzso localized in the zzso and nucleus of zzso cells with or without zzso To further examine the role of zzso in the virus life cycle, a zzso knockout zzso and a repair zzso carrying zzso under the control of its native promoter elements were constructed using zzso zzso zzso growth curve analysis showed that the zzso of infectious zzso virus production of zzso knockout virus was similar to that of the parental virus or the repair zzso Analysis of the expression of viral early protein zzso late protein zzso and very late protein suggested that viral protein expression was not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso viruses zzso and zzso bodies were indistinguishable from those of the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso showed no significant difference in the zzso values between zzso deletion virus and zzso zzso Our results together demonstrate that zzso is an early gene zzso for virus propagation in zzso and in zzso
