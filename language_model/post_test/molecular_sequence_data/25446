The isolation and characterization of five clones carrying sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso precursors of the rat muscle zzso zzso zzso are zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences indicate that these zzso contain zzso zzso acids and reveal the structural characteristics common to zzso of zzso zzso zzso The pattern of zzso zzso levels in rat muscle shows characteristic changes during development and following zzso suggesting that zzso of muscle reduces the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppresses the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso generated in zzso were injected into zzso zzso zzso resulting in the assembly of two functionally different zzso channel zzso The zzso zzso composed of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso has functional properties similar to those of the native zzso in fetal zzso The zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso channel of the adult zzso Thus in rat skeletal muscle the motor nerve regulates the expression of two functionally different zzso zzso with different molecular composition by the differential expression of zzso zzso
