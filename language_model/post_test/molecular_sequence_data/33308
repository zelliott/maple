The zzso zzso zzso gene is induced in roots after zzso zzso infection and it codes for a putative zzso transfer protein zzso a family of plant small proteins capable of binding and transferring lipids between zzso in zzso Various biological roles for plant zzso in zzso have been proposed, including defense against pathogens and zzso of plant zzso The aim of this study was to shed light on the role of zzso in the symbiotic interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and the mature zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso The zzso binding capacity and zzso activity of the zzso zzso protein were tested in zzso zzso showed the capacity to bind zzso and to inhibit zzso zzso pathogens and zzso growth in zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso in roots after infection with either the zzso pathogen zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso infection, zzso was induced starting from 1 day after zzso zzso It reached the highest concentration at 3 zzso and it was localized in the mature zzso zzso roots were impaired in zzso showing a 50% of reduction in the number of zzso compared with control zzso On the other hand, transgenic roots zzso zzso developed zzso more zzso with respect to control zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso possesses zzso features typical of zzso and that it is required for the successful symbiotic association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
