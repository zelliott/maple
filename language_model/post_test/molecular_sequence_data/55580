zzso zzso is a zzso zzso rod which is gaining recognition as an important human zzso We have previously reported the cloning and expression in zzso coli of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this zzso also encodes two proteins of approximately 14 zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene revealed two open reading frames with strong zzso to genes zzso zzso zzso proteins of the type 4 or zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are complete and are expressed in zzso zzso Southern analysis of ten additional zzso zzso strains revealed that all possess fragments zzso to zzso These data represent the first molecular evidence for zzso in zzso zzso
