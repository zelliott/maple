Based on early zzso studies on a handful of species, the frequency of structural disorder of proteins is generally thought to be much higher in zzso than in zzso To refine this view, we present here a comparative prediction study and analysis of zzso fully described zzso zzso and 87 reference zzso for structural zzso We found that structural disorder does distinguish zzso from zzso but its frequency spans a very wide range in the two zzso that largely zzso The number of zzso binding regions and different zzso domain types also contribute to distinguish zzso from zzso zzso the highest zzso highest zzso predicted disorder is found in zzso zzso zzso zzso often zzso more complex zzso organisms, plants and zzso This trend contrasts with that of the number of domain types, which increases rather zzso toward more complex zzso The level of structural disorder appears to be strongly correlated with lifestyle, because some zzso zzso zzso and zzso have the lowest levels, whereas zzso zzso have the highest level of predicted zzso We conclude that zzso have been the evolutionary zzso of zzso with structural disorder, in a period when structural disorder was actively invented and the major functional classes of zzso proteins zzso
