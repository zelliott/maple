zzso protein zzso zzso are components of sequential zzso zzso that are activated in response to a variety of zzso zzso Members of the zzso family include the zzso response zzso zzso or zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 1 protein zzso zzso are zzso and activated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso which in turn are zzso and activated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have isolated two zzso zzso zzso zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is widely expressed in mouse zzso and encodes for a protein of approximately 180 zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain is approximately zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso 1, 2, and zzso The zzso region of zzso has little sequence zzso to the previously cloned zzso zzso zzso specifically activates the zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso distinguishing it from zzso 1, 2 and 3, which are capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso is localized in a zzso zzso compartment similar to the zzso zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso block zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso has a putative zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso suggesting specific regulatory functions different from those of the previously characterized zzso
