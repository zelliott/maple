zzso was originally identified as an zzso gene in zzso zzso a childhood kidney zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso transcript generates four major protein zzso each having different functional zzso Here we characterized a short transcript originating from a second promoter located within zzso 1 of zzso This zzso zzso transcript encodes a protein of approximately zzso zzso that retains intact zzso and zzso zzso but lacks the 147 zzso acids at the N zzso required for zzso zzso We found zzso to be a more potent zzso zzso than zzso for zzso E and zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso which are normally zzso by zzso The expression patterns of the zzso and zzso transcripts differed slightly in various zzso we found zzso protein in tissue samples from adult zzso and fetal zzso with low-level expression in adult kidney as zzso The zzso transcript, but not the full-length transcript, was zzso in the leukemia samples zzso zzso small interfering zzso retarded the proliferation of leukemia cell line zzso in zzso Finally, zzso cooperated with Ras in transforming primary zzso in zzso Further studies are needed to clarify the zzso behavior of this zzso and to determine the mechanism underlying its zzso in leukemia and other forms of zzso
