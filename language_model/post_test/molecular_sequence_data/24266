We have identified a novel zzso zzso named zzso by zzso difference zzso zzso responds to two zzso zzso systems and behaves as a direct zzso target zzso zzso zzso expression is readily zzso in the zzso small zzso and zzso whereas expression is relatively low in zzso bone zzso and peripheral zzso We cloned a full-length zzso zzso that encodes a zzso nuclear zzso To determine the role of zzso in zzso cellular zzso stable zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested and compared with transformed zzso zzso Although zzso has a diminished transforming activity as compared with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Box II zzso in the zzso transformation zzso This zzso provides evidence for a genetic link between zzso and zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso of zzso human zzso cells in zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso in zzso zzso supporting an emerging concept that zzso target genes constitute zzso points in a network of pathways that lead from zzso to various zzso zzso and ultimately to zzso
