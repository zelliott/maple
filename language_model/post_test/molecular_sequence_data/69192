zzso zzso zzso initiate zzso diseases in plants by zzso zzso which is the major component of the plant cell zzso The present paper reports the first cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso This gene was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library constructed in zzso as zzso and zzso coli as zzso By Southern zzso this gene was shown to be present in a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso restriction fragment, which zzso zzso zzso activity to zzso coli, indicated a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso which includes a 21 zzso acid signal zzso The zzso Da deduced protein displays zzso to zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso cloned in zzso coli was located in the zzso It was zzso to zzso in a zzso procedure from the zzso coli zzso fluid after overproduction using the zzso zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso were similar to those found for the zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso
