The zzso associated protein zzso is an essential protein in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso several species of which are important human zzso The zzso protein is part of a zzso complex known as the invasion machinery or zzso which is required for cell invasion and zzso gliding zzso empowered by an zzso zzso zzso is anchored through its zzso zzso zzso into the inner membrane complex and interacts via a short six zzso zzso tail with other proteins of the invasion machinery in the zzso of the zzso In this paper we describe the zzso resolution crystal structure of the soluble zzso domain from the malaria zzso zzso zzso The structure shows an zzso fold with overall similarity to purple acid zzso with, however, little zzso regarding the nature of the zzso in the active site region of the latter zzso While purple acid zzso contain a zzso bridged zzso zzso coordinated by seven side chains with the zzso zzso apart, zzso in our zzso contains two zzso zzso each with one protein zzso and a distance between the zzso zzso of zzso
