zzso milk zzso zzso is the most frequent cause of food zzso in zzso Most children who are allergic to CM are also zzso to zzso proteins and/or to the zzso fraction and many of them cannot tolerate zzso or sheep's milk zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso that are not associated with allergic zzso to CM are zzso 

zzso children who had severe allergic zzso including zzso after consumption of zzso products but tolerated CM products were recruited in a retrospective zzso Whole zzso and zzso proteins were zzso from CM and zzso zzso and the different zzso were isolated, zzso and used to perform zzso zzso tests zzso and EAST zzso studies with the zzso of the allergic zzso 

Clinical zzso skin prick testing and zzso zzso studies confirmed the diagnosis of zzso zzso without associated CM zzso EAST zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso involves the zzso fraction and not zzso zzso zzso milk zzso were not at all or poorly recognized by the patient's zzso while zzso zzso and zzso from zzso were recognized with a high specificity and zzso In all cases, increasing zzso of CM zzso failed to inhibit the binding of patient's zzso to sheep or goat milk zzso whereas this binding was completely inhibited by zzso zzso 

The characteristics of zzso zzso differ from those of the CM zzso because it affects older children and appears zzso CM products do not elicit any clinical manifestation in zzso allergic patients, whereas CM allergic patients, usually zzso to zzso In all the zzso allergic children, the zzso zzso recognized the zzso but not the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso specificity and affinity was high to zzso and lower to CM zzso despite their marked sequence zzso Doctors and allergic individuals should be aware that zzso zzso requires a strict avoidance of zzso and zzso products because reactions could be severe after zzso of minimal doses of the offending zzso
