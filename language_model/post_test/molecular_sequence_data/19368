zzso zzso coli zzso are zzso agents of zzso The zzso category is heterogeneous, but most in-depth zzso has focused on zzso strain, zzso We hypothesized that zzso another zzso strain, might posses zzso or fitness genes that zzso does not zzso Through zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso including zzso present in other zzso coli and zzso zzso One locus thus identified was zzso a zzso zzso zzso DNA repair gene that has been identified in plasmids from other enteric organisms and which we detected in 21 of 34 zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso showed decreased survival and zzso after exposure to zzso as well as zzso salt exposure, compared to the zzso strain, and these zzso could be zzso in zzso The zzso strain zzso zzso zzso differs structurally from previously described zzso A cryptic zzso zzso present in other zzso zzso is absent from zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in strain zzso occurs from a promoter that is dissimilar to the previously described zzso promoter but is still triggered by zzso zzso In strain zzso the zzso and the zzso adherence zzso I zzso genes are on the same large zzso and the zzso version of the zzso is predominantly seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repair systems are common among zzso even though they are absent in zzso strain zzso
