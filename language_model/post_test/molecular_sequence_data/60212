The zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed for colonizing zzso zzso with a standardized zzso The purpose of this study was to identify each of the eight zzso strains by zzso zzso sequence zzso Three strains were previously identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from its zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of strain zzso zzso is essentially identical to the zzso zzso sequences of the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso (both isolated from zzso and all of these strains probably belong to a single zzso zzso zzso 360 is a novel zzso that clusters with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso falls into an unnamed zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso group zzso This unnamed zzso is in the zzso zzso and is most closely related to the zzso zzso The zzso strain, strain zzso zzso is in the zzso zzso and exhibits sequence identity with zzso zzso of zzso The remaining four zzso zzso which are extremely zzso zzso bacteria, group zzso with the zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 502 fall into zzso cluster XIV of Collins et zzso zzso zzso zzso resembles members of this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso is identical to that of zzso zzso Since the type strain and other viable original zzso of zzso zzso have been lost, strain zzso zzso is a candidate for a zzso zzso zzso zzso 500 branches deeply in the zzso zzso zzso tree but is not closely related to any organisms whose zzso zzso sequences are currently in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence information determined in the present study should allow rapid identification of zzso strains and should permit detailed analysis of the interactions of zzso organisms during development of zzso disease in mice that are zzso with a variety of zzso zzso
