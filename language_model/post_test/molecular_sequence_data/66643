zzso repeat and zzso III zzso zzso has five members in mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in other zzso zzso proteins share zzso repeat zzso zzso type III zzso domain structure, which is also found in zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso genes were expressed at adult stage predominantly in the zzso In the course of development, expression of zzso zzso and zzso started from immature neural cells, whereas that of zzso and zzso was limited to mature zzso zzso commonly zzso zzso spanning the plasma zzso with their zzso located on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were bound by zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to cell periphery where the zzso proteins were zzso These results suggest that zzso proteins are zzso components with a role in the developing or mature zzso nervous zzso
