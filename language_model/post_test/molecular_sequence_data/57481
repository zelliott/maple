The marine sponge zzso zzso contains several zzso The main zzso called zzso is composed of three to four identical zzso The zzso of the zzso were cloned from a zzso zzso two clones were zzso From the deduced zzso sequence of one zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso Da is zzso this value is in good agreement with mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso 25 zzso The sequence of another zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso sequence was deduced zzso zzso The two zzso have a framework sequence of 38 zzso zzso which are characteristic for the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences of various species following their zzso comparison establishes a zzso which reveals that the sponge zzso could be considered as the zzso for zzso zzso zzso
