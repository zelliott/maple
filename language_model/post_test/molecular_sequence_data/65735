Two new members of the zzso zzso zzso gene family zzso and zzso were cloned from raspberry fruits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso products indicated that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso producing both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso like the native protein from raspberry fruits zzso zzso zzso zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso accepted zzso and zzso as starter zzso and zzso the formation of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although activity of zzso was higher with zzso than with zzso the corresponding product, zzso zzso could not be detected in zzso to zzso zzso analysis of the genes and proteins suggested that this feature of zzso was created by variation in the zzso due to DNA zzso at the 3' region of its coding zzso zzso is a typical zzso zzso zzso that uses zzso only as starter zzso and produces zzso zzso exclusively as the reaction zzso
