zzso coli zzso N zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso class zzso that share a common primary structure with consensus zinc binding motif zzso and an zzso motif zzso in the active zzso There is one zzso acid, zzso in zzso I that blocks the extended active site grove of the zzso like zzso domain zzso zzso limiting the zzso to zzso zzso zzso forms a part of the zzso pocket, while making critical contact with the zzso of the zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso forms a salt bridge with zzso in zzso zzso Both these zzso are absolutely zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso pair in zzso interacting factor F3 zzso and zzso pair in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also zzso in respective zzso zzso of either of these zzso individually or together substantially reduced or entirely eliminated zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso studies suggest that the zzso at zzso zzso the protein as much as by zzso zzso while zzso zzso were zzso Crystal structure of zzso zzso reveals that the zzso is inactive due to the reduced zzso zzso zzso Together, data presented here suggests that zzso zzso and zzso H zzso adopted a divergent evolution that includes zzso or its analogous pairs, and these cannot be zzso
