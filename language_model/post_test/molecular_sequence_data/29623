zzso proteins are a recently discovered zzso They presumably evolved to zzso advantages over ancestral linear proteins while maintaining the intrinsic biological functions of those zzso In general, these advantages include a reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso and enhanced zzso In one remarkable family of circular zzso the zzso the zzso backbone is additionally braced by a knotted arrangement of zzso bonds that zzso additional stability and zzso complexity upon the zzso This article describes the discovery, structure, function and zzso of the currently known circular zzso The discovery of naturally occurring circular proteins in the past few years has been zzso by new chemical and zzso methods to make synthetic circular zzso these are also briefly zzso
