zzso B virus infection is associated with zzso zzso claiming 1 million lives annually zzso To understand the zzso mechanism of zzso B zzso zzso zzso we explored the function of zzso interaction with its cellular target zzso Previously, we demonstrated that viral zzso and cellular zzso control zzso zzso formation, regulating zzso zzso By using various fragments of zzso we determined that zzso zzso within zzso are necessary for binding zzso zzso of the zzso motif in zzso abolished its ability to bind zzso and to zzso zzso dynamics in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso which targets to zzso as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso to zzso zzso of viral zzso zzso protein and zzso of zzso zzso altered zzso assembly and induced modifications of zzso and zzso two essential proteins required for zzso formation and function, whereas zzso zzso zzso of zzso did zzso zzso of zzso or fragments of zzso that bind zzso neutralized the effects of viral zzso on zzso dynamics and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a critical target of viral zzso for promoting genetic instability through formation of defective zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso
