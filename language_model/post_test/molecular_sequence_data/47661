The human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso zzso has been previously shown to activate the C1 complex of human complement through direct interaction with its zzso zzso The major interaction site has been located within the zzso zzso region zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso overlapping zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was shown to inhibit binding of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was necessary to allow its in zzso interaction with zzso A zzso competition zzso was used to monitor the effect of zzso peptides derived from segment zzso of zzso on the binding of zzso zzso to zzso Whereas zzso of zzso had no effect, replacement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by Ala abolished the ability of the resulting peptides to inhibit binding of zzso to zzso suggesting that these zzso participate in the interaction between zzso and zzso These findings are discussed in the light of a structural model of the zzso loop of zzso It is proposed that the recognition of zzso by zzso is driven by zzso zzso and that the sites of zzso responsible for interaction with zzso and zzso partly zzso
