We describe several plasmids that are designed to create zzso between zzso or zzso genes and the zzso zzso or zzso reporter zzso These plasmids all contain the zzso origin of zzso but lack the zzso zzso zzso and therefore fail to replicate in strains lacking zzso zzso of target genes are introduced into these zzso and zzso are created in a single step as a consequence of zzso integration of the entire zzso by zzso zzso zzso fragments containing either an intact zzso of the target gene including its promoter or an intact zzso of the gene preserve a functional copy of that zzso while fragments lacking both zzso and zzso of the target gene cause a gene zzso In addition to zzso zzso of gene zzso some plasmids create zzso zzso to zzso or alkaline zzso and are therefore useful in studying the membrane zzso of a target zzso We demonstrate the utility of these plasmids by constructing and testing two zzso zzso and two protein zzso between the zzso gene of zzso zzso and zzso
