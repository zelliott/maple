Recent findings have suggested that the zzso zzso family of channel proteins is the structural basis for zzso influx through the zzso calcium entry zzso zzso We have zzso in bovine zzso zzso cells, the zzso expression of four such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso hormones rendered dynamic effects on the transcript levels of these zzso Most notably, zzso significantly zzso zzso while zzso acid dramatically zzso zzso yet these hormones rendered little change in zzso These findings suggest that the extent of a given zzso channel's participation in zzso is not reflected in zzso of its transcript zzso
