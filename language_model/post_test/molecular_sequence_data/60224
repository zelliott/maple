zzso zzso counts were made of zzso and other bacteria present in the zzso flooded bulk soil of laboratory zzso containing zzso to zzso rice zzso zzso counts with zzso known to be useful for the selective enrichment or the zzso of zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso gave counts of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells per g of dry zzso zzso isolated from the terminal positive steps of these dilution cultures belonged to the zzso zzso zzso with zzso ethanol, and zzso gave much higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells per g of dry soil and led to the isolation of zzso zzso Counting experiments on zzso and ethanol which included zzso zzso in the medium gave zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells per g of dry soil and led to the isolation of zzso zzso The latter strains could grow with zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and/or zzso but apparently most cells of zzso zzso did not initiate growth in counting experiments with those zzso zzso apparently accounted for zzso zzso or less of the zzso zzso It appears that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in approximately equal numbers in the bulk zzso zzso zzso zzso strains of each zzso were found in the same soil zzso
