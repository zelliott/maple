Among four zzso zzso of zzso zzso the smallest zzso with zzso activity was in a zzso zzso it had a molecular weight of zzso A complex of this zzso zzso and human zzso zzso human zzso but a complex of native zzso and human zzso zzso both human and bovine zzso The complex with zzso caused zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso in the presence of human zzso but was inactive in the presence of human zzso bovine zzso or bovine zzso Analysis of the zzso terminal sequence of zzso indicated that zzso by zzso was on the zzso side of zzso the 59th zzso acid of zzso These results suggest that the zzso changes caused by human zzso formation resulted in the generation of an active site of human zzso by zzso
