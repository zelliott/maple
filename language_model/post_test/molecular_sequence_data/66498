zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso as well as a putative zzso transport gene zzso are regulated in response to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulates expression of these genes by zzso zzso and translation control zzso Here we show that zzso also regulates translation of zzso a gene that encodes a protein with similarities to known zzso zzso As a likely zzso site consisting of 11 zzso repeats zzso the zzso translation initiation region, experiments were carried out to determine whether zzso regulates translation of zzso zzso was observed to regulate expression of a zzso zzso fusion zzso in response to zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso binds to the zzso transcript with high affinity and zzso zzso studies revealed that the central seven zzso repeats were protected by bound zzso while zzso results suggest that nine zzso repeats contribute to zzso zzso Additional zzso and in zzso translation analyses demonstrated that bound zzso regulates zzso synthesis by blocking zzso zzso We also identified two zzso coding zzso between the zzso sequence and start zzso of zzso zzso of one of the zzso modestly zzso with translation of zzso
