zzso zzso a zzso that zzso criteria as a zzso mimics many actions of ethanol, and evidence indicates that some of the acute effects of ethanol are zzso in part by zzso Recent studies have shown that chronic ethanol treatment produced a zzso of zzso receptors in zzso brain regions of long sleep zzso mice and that reduced zzso binding capacity was associated with acquisition and zzso of tolerance to zzso locomotor zzso and zzso in these zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether zzso develops between zzso and ethanol and whether chronic zzso infusion produces zzso zzso zzso Animals chronically treated with ethanol were tolerant to zzso locomotor zzso at a dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso and were tolerant to zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso Following repeated injections or continuous infusion of zzso zzso zzso mice showed tolerance to both zzso and zzso zzso and locomotor zzso Indeed, ethanol doses that are hypnotic in control mice zzso zzso were not effective in abolishing locomotor activity following chronic zzso zzso zzso with chronic saline infusion zzso indicate that stress alters sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors in the zzso The results demonstrate that zzso develops between zzso and ethanol, and further support a role for zzso systems in the actions of zzso
