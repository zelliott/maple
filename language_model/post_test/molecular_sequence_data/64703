The zzso zzso E1 component of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso complex is a zzso zzso zzso zzso E1 zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso with the formation of the zzso zzso zzso followed by transfer of the zzso group to the zzso sulfur atom on the zzso of the zzso zzso In order to zzso the zzso mechanism of zzso the zzso and zzso of E1 from zzso zzso zzso have been zzso in zzso coli, zzso and zzso as a stable complex, and the following crystal structures have been zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in complex with the zzso analogue zzso zzso as an zzso complex model, and zzso in complex with zzso zzso as the zzso intermediate zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso a zzso transition in two zzso adjacent to the active zzso Furthermore, upon binding of zzso to zzso the loop comprised of zzso moves close to the active site and interacts with zzso The zzso group of zzso is recognized mainly by zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is recognized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso As an zzso zzso is zzso and zzso linked to zzso and the zzso of the protein loop is almost the same as in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that E1 zzso an zzso zzso change upon formation of the zzso complex with a zzso and the mobile region zzso in the recognition of the zzso group of the zzso zzso complex models of zzso and of zzso built from the above structures suggest that zzso and zzso are potential zzso donors to the zzso group of a zzso and to the zzso sulfur atom on the zzso zzso
