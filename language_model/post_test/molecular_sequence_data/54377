zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso that may contribute to the generation of the zzso repertoire presented by zzso class II molecules in the zzso Although zzso zzso has no quantitative impact on the development of zzso T cells expressing a zzso T cell zzso zzso repertoire, the development of zzso T cells expressing the zzso and Marilyn transgenic zzso is impaired in zzso zzso In this study, we assess the role of zzso in shaping the functional zzso zzso zzso T cell repertoire by analyzing the response of zzso mice to several protein zzso zzso Although zzso mice responded normally to most of the zzso tested, they responded poorly to zzso egg zzso zzso The impaired zzso T cell response of zzso mice to zzso correlated with significant zzso of the dominant zzso chain repertoire expressed by zzso zzso T cells, suggesting that zzso is necessary for the zzso development of cells expressing these zzso Thus, zzso contributes to the diversification of the functional zzso zzso T cell zzso repertoire in the zzso
