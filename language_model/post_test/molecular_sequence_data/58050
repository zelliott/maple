The zzso zzso tract of zzso is required for efficient zzso assembly and zzso of zzso A detailed zzso analysis of the zzso tract of an zzso 2 zzso was carried zzso zzso a zzso in zzso zzso system, it was possible to zzso zzso tract zzso zzso that were otherwise zzso The zzso zzso that were otherwise zzso The zzso zzso were analyzed for in zzso zzso for formation of zzso complexes, and for binding to proteins in the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso that contained the zzso branch point consensus sequence zzso and altered zzso tracts were also zzso zzso analysis showed the zzso First, any zzso in the zzso tract that affected zzso did so by zzso with complex A formation in zzso zzso Second, introduction of zzso into the zzso tract is zzso only if the length of the tract is shortened and if there is a reduction in the number of consecutive zzso zzso Third, zzso and zzso do not have equivalent functions in the zzso zzso Our results with zzso zzso also show that a strong zzso tract can partially replace a weak branch point sequence and a strong branch point sequence can partially replace a weak zzso zzso Finally, the one surprising finding obtained when examining protein binding was that a zzso zzso did not bind to zzso nuclear zzso C proteins and yet spliced close to wild type zzso
