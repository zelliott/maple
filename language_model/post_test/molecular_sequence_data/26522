Two fatty acid zzso genes have been zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso which are responsible for the production of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso and zzso genes is zzso and zzso zzso 405 and 413 zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso share more than zzso similarity and three zzso zzso motifs with other known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot produce zzso and zzso while the deletion of zzso only causes the absence of zzso zzso expression of either the zzso or the zzso gene in zzso zzso resulted in the presence of zzso and zzso when the zzso precursor was zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that zzso and zzso indeed zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso that function as the only ones responsible for zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso respectively, in zzso zzso Because a zzso Acid zzso zzso region and a Low zzso Response zzso zzso which are responsible for regulation of a zzso acid zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso are present in the upstream regions of both zzso we investigated whether the zzso levels of zzso and zzso are affected by supplementation with zzso zzso fatty acids or by low oxygen zzso Whereas both genes were zzso under low oxygen conditions, only zzso zzso was zzso by an excess of zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso transcript level did not significantly zzso These observations indicate that zzso expression is not controlled at the zzso level by fatty acids even though it contains a zzso zzso This study indicates that zzso may be regulated by zzso mechanisms, whereas zzso may be mainly controlled at a zzso zzso
