To gain insight into zzso zzso interactions at the molecular level, the solution structure of differently zzso zzso of the zzso of human zzso zzso have been studied by zzso zzso zzso differences in chemical shifts and zzso zzso were observed for zzso acid zzso close to the zzso chain at zzso upon zzso beyond zzso zzso As no straightforward strategy is available for the calculation of the zzso structure of intact zzso a suitable zzso protocol had to be zzso To this end, the zzso zzso force field designed for structure refinement was extended and zzso Furthermore, a zzso strategy was devised to facilitate successful protein folding in the presence of extended zzso during the zzso The values for zzso and zzso zzso angles of the zzso linkages of the zzso core fragments zzso and zzso are restricted to a limited range of the broad zzso energy zzso accessible for free zzso This demonstrates that the protein core affects the dynamic behavior of the zzso at zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso structures indicate that the zzso at zzso affects the stability of the protein zzso The backbone angular order parameters and displacement data of the generated zzso display especially for the zzso zzso a decreased structural order upon splitting off the zzso beyond the zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso shields the protein surface from the zzso environment through interaction with predominantly zzso zzso acid zzso located in both twisted zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso
