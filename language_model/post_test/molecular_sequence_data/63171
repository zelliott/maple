The evolution rates of zzso in early zzso hold important implications for DNA zzso Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso using a data set of 619 sequences from 224 zzso We found variation within and between species to be much lower in zzso and zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso which has zzso similar to typical zzso Given that recent evidence has shown that zzso also exhibit limited zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely to be zzso for the zzso Higher rates of evolution could have originated independently in zzso and zzso or been acquired in the zzso + zzso zzso and lost in the zzso Low identification success and substantial overlap between zzso and zzso zzso distances render the zzso zzso for DNA zzso zzso is also advised for zzso and zzso because of relatively low identification success rates as even threshold divergence that zzso the zzso zzso does not improve identification zzso
