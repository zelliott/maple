We have mapped the gene for the zzso zzso of zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso in three zzso species and isolated the human zzso gene zzso symbol zzso The bovine gene was mapped by zzso cell hybrid mapping panels to bovine zzso zzso 25 with zzso zzso The mouse gene zzso was mapped using an zzso zzso panel from the cross zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was located on zzso zzso 7, between zzso and zzso From the regions of known gene conservation among these three species, we predicted that human zzso would be located on zzso zzso We zzso a human zzso zzso mapping panel of zzso cell hybrids with the human zzso to confirm this zzso These data taken together indicated that the human zzso gene is located on the short arm of zzso 16 and facilitated the isolation of the human gene from a zzso zzso zzso The human zzso gene spans about 1 zzso and contains three zzso and two small zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso zzso regions of zzso genes are highly zzso between human, zzso and zzso
