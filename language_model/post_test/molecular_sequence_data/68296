The zzso zzso contained in the zzso of higher plants consists of the genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso The primary transcript of this zzso is subject to a series of processing steps which include zzso resulting in four zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso A search for editing sites within the two latter transcripts from zzso led us to the detection of one editing site within the zzso coding region which is zzso at the DNA level in other zzso species and in zzso This shows that editing must be considered as an additional processing step of the zzso zzso zzso primary zzso As is evident from zzso sequences derived from the zzso and/or zzso zzso transcripts which are completely zzso editing is an early step of zzso processing which precedes both zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso and which must, therefore, be independent of the latter two zzso This conclusion is confirmed by a similar observation with the editing site of the zzso transcript which is contained in the zzso transcript of the zzso zzso although here only partial editing is observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
