zzso offer key information for evaluating model simulations of species migration in response to forecast zzso zzso However, their utility can be greatly compromised by the existence of glacial zzso that are zzso in fossil records zzso zzso Despite several decades of investigation, it remains controversial whether zzso the largely zzso area extending from northeastern zzso to the Yukon zzso zzso small populations of certain zzso tree species during the last zzso Here, we present genetic evidence for the existence of a glacial refuge in Alaska that helps to resolve this long-standing zzso We zzso zzso DNA zzso of white spruce zzso zzso a dominant zzso tree species, in 24 forest stands across northwestern North zzso The majority of zzso zzso are unique, and zzso diversity is relatively high in Alaska, arguing against the possibility that this species migrated into the region from areas south of the zzso Ice zzso after the end of the last zzso Thus, white spruce apparently survived long glacial episodes under zzso extremes in a zzso landscape zzso These results suggest that estimated rates of tree migration from fossil records may be too high and that the ability of trees to track anthropogenic warming may be more limited than previously zzso
