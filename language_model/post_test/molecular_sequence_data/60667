Cellular receptors for zzso zzso mediate important protective zzso An extensive panel of zzso zzso zzso was used to identify zzso zzso critical for zzso zzso binding and zzso Although a zzso zzso was able to bind and trigger zzso zzso featuring zzso domain exchanges between human zzso and zzso could not, indicating that both zzso but not the zzso are required for zzso zzso To further investigate the role of the zzso region, numerous zzso each with a point substitution in either of two zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso were zzso With only one exception zzso zzso produced either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or marked reduction zzso in zzso binding and zzso Further support for involvement of these zzso zzso was provided by zzso comparisons of zzso Thus a human zzso zzso zzso which zzso the mouse zzso loop sequence through substitution of two adjacent zzso in the zzso loop, was found, like mouse zzso not to bind zzso In contrast, bovine zzso identical to human zzso within these zzso zzso despite numerous differences elsewhere in the zzso region, did bind zzso We have thus identified motifs in the zzso region of zzso zzso critical for zzso binding and zzso significantly enhancing present understanding of the molecular basis of the zzso zzso
