To study the role of cellulose and zzso in plant growth, we expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased the size of the zzso due to increased cell zzso The change in growth was accompanied by changes in zzso properties due to cell wall structure indicative of decrease in zzso zzso with cellulose zzso by chemical analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The result supports the concept that the zzso sites of cellulose zzso are attacked by zzso zzso to loosen zzso zzso and this irreversible wall modification promotes the enlargement of plant zzso
