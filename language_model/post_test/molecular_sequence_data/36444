zzso was isolated from the zzso large zzso zzso complex with its associated proteins zzso of rabbit skeletal muscle by alkaline zzso followed by gel zzso to remove the associated zzso zzso zzso and DC were subjected to zzso with zzso or zzso and the generated zzso fragments were studied by zzso analysis using seven kinds of zzso raised against zzso corresponding to various regions from the zzso to the zzso of human zzso For some fragments, the zzso acid sequences at the zzso were zzso Two zzso which bear distinct zzso generated very similar fragments from zzso zzso with or without the associated zzso The zzso sites found by mapping the fragments onto the zzso zzso were similar to those found in a previous study using crude mouse muscle cell membrane fraction zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of these results, we concluded that zzso has several unique zzso zzso
