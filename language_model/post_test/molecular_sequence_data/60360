Previous genetic and zzso analyses have established that the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that interacts with zzso zzso zzso to ensure the timely and accurate folding of zzso the zzso major zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso like the zzso coli zzso zzso interacts with zzso primarily through its zzso mobile loop zzso Upon binding to zzso the mobile loop adopts a zzso zzso zzso In this article, we present extensive genetic data that strongly substantiate and extend these zzso zzso These studies begin with the isolation of zzso in gene 31 based on the ability to plaque on zzso zzso bacteria, whose zzso product interacts zzso with zzso Our genetic system is unique because it also allows for the direct selection of zzso of such gene 31 zzso based on their ability to plaque on zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, all of these zzso are zzso because the original 31 zzso is zzso In addition, we show that the classical zzso zzso in gene 31 changes a zzso zzso zzso in the mobile loop to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso which enable growth at the restrictive temperatures, acquire the same zzso previously shown to allow plaque formation on zzso zzso zzso Our genetic analyses highlight the crucial importance of all three highly zzso zzso zzso of the mobile loop of zzso in the productive interaction with zzso
