zzso are known to play a crucial role in zzso sex differentiation in many zzso zzso but also in the zzso sex change of zzso zzso We investigated the expression of two genes zzso key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso during the sex change of the zzso rice field zzso zzso zzso Using zzso with zzso zzso we cloned rice field zzso zzso fragments for both genes zzso and zzso as indicated by the high level of zzso with zzso and zzso sequences from various zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso levels were then assessed during the sex change by zzso zzso and a real-time zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso much less in zzso and barely in zzso zzso zzso was markedly zzso at the onset of zzso zzso These findings underline that regulation of zzso is an important process in the sex change of zzso rice field zzso and they clearly indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso are of pivotal importance to the sex change of this zzso
