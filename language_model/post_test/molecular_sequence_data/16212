Gal zzso zzso binds to two gal operator sites, zzso and zzso which are 16 zzso long similar sequences with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occupation zzso the zzso of the zzso atoms in the major groups of zzso located at positions 1, 3 and 8, and the zzso zzso 3' and zzso of the zzso We have shown that Gal zzso binding to zzso or zzso DNA fragments increases the circular zzso zzso spectral peak in the zzso to 300 zzso zzso The CD change is similar to that observed for zzso zzso binding to its operator site zzso It is consistent with a DNA zzso change during complex formation between Gal zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The CD spectral change was not observed when the central zzso zzso base pairs in the zzso complex were replaced by zzso base pairs, whereas substitution of the zzso zzso base pairs do show the accompanying increase in the zzso during zzso zzso The absence of CD change of the Gal zzso complex with DNA zzso at the zzso base pairs suggest that the central zzso base pairs are required for the zzso induced zzso zzso
