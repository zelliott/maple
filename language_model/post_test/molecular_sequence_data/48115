This paper concerns the zzso of native zzso by differential scanning zzso zzso and zzso The stability of the double zzso is zzso by zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso The role of the external salt concentration is zzso it is shown that zzso is only slightly zzso At ambient temperature, in zzso M zzso native zzso behaves as a loose gel zzso zzso zzso This zzso disappears when temperature is larger than 60 degrees zzso The comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the position of zzso transition is much more influenced by the salt zzso the zzso structure is less stable and the zzso transition presents a zzso between heating and cooling runs when the external salt concentration zzso The zzso zzso is that corresponding to a solution zzso zzso zzso at ambient temperature and in zzso M zzso When the salt excess increases, then a stronger gel is zzso The differences between the two types of samples are clearly established as well as the relations between the zzso and the zzso of the zzso
