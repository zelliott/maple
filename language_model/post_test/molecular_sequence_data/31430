An zzso based, quantitative understanding of the zzso and function of small peptides within zzso brush layers does not currently zzso Earlier work provided a rationale for expecting that an ordered, compact zzso will enter the zzso phase more readily than a zzso of similar size that adopts a less ordered, less compact form, and that zzso will promote zzso retention within the zzso region of the zzso zzso Here we more deliberately describe criteria for zzso integration and structural change within the zzso zzso and discuss the zzso of zzso zzso with changing zzso zzso For this purpose, circular zzso zzso was used to record the zzso and zzso changes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was controlled between zzso and zzso forms by varying the concentration of zzso zzso We show an initially more ordered zzso structure promotes zzso zzso into the zzso zzso Further, a partially zzso zzso zzso an increase in zzso after entry, likely due to zzso loss of capacity for zzso hydrogen zzso zzso interaction with the zzso chains resulted in zzso and zzso change that was irreversible to zzso with changing solution conditions in the case of the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso change of the zzso zzso was zzso These results indicate that responsive drug delivery systems based on zzso zzso layers can be controlled by zzso of solution conditions and zzso zzso
