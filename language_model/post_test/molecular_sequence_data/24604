The recycling of zzso fixed carbon by the action of microbial zzso zzso is a key biological zzso The consortium of zzso zzso involved in this process frequently display zzso zzso appended to one or more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play a central role in the zzso of the zzso activity of plant cell wall zzso through their binding to specific plant structural zzso Despite their pivotal role in the zzso of plant zzso the mechanism by which these proteins recognize their target zzso is zzso This report describes the structure of a zzso zzso zzso in complex with its zzso This zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to both soluble zzso and zzso The three-dimensional crystal structure of zzso bound to zzso has been solved by zzso zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso The protein displays a similar zzso roll fold to that observed in many other families of zzso A groove, zzso A in zzso on the zzso surface of one of the zzso presents two zzso zzso the faces of which are zzso at approximately 240 degrees to one zzso These zzso interactions with the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso the approximate zzso zzso structure of this zzso in the binding zzso of zzso In four of the five observed binding zzso the 2' and 3' zzso of the bound zzso are zzso providing an explanation for the capacity of this zzso zzso to accommodate the highly decorated zzso found in the plant cell zzso
