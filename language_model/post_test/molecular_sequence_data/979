zzso a zzso zzso protein of zzso virus, was previously shown to bind to the peripheral zzso zzso by zzso interactions at the outer zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that an additional property of zzso is the ability to zzso form zzso complexes with the zzso zzso family member zzso in human zzso This binding interaction was identified by both zzso pull-down zzso and tandem affinity zzso from zzso and zzso human zzso zzso binds zzso to human zzso and, under some zzso conditions, to human zzso as well, but not to the other zzso family members zzso Bid, zzso When zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, zzso effectively protects these cells from zzso zzso zzso thereby blocking release of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 9, and zzso of zzso zzso We also demonstrate in zzso studies that zzso can interact with zzso independently of any involvement with zzso Furthermore, cells zzso expressing zzso function to prevent zzso that is induced by zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in a zzso fashion, zzso signals zzso by zzso of zzso
