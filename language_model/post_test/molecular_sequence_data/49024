zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is the founding member of the zzso family of tumor zzso capable of arresting zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso are strongly linked to several types of human zzso These zzso are evenly distributed throughout this small, zzso repeat protein and the majority of them disrupt the native secondary and/or zzso structure, leading to protein zzso zzso and loss of zzso We report here the use of multiple stabilizing zzso to increase the stability of zzso and zzso to restore zzso binding activity of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were predicted using four different zzso The three most effective zzso were combined to create a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso zzso more stable than zzso This engineered construct is zzso in solution with zzso secondary and zzso structure and zzso zzso 4 binding zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso when combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso can significantly restore zzso binding activity, despite the divergent features of each zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso enhance the binding activity of zzso zzso through several different mechanisms, including an increased amount of secondary structure and zzso reduction in exposed zzso zzso and/or a reduced tendency to zzso This apparent global zzso effect suggests that increasing the zzso stability of zzso can be used as a general strategy to restore the biological activity to defective zzso of this important tumor zzso zzso
