Type II zzso also known as zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disorder, which is caused by zzso zzso in the zzso gene on zzso zzso One of the clinical manifestations of type II zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, a zzso female Chinese zzso diagnosed with type II zzso was zzso The diagnosis was based on zzso and clinical findings, including organic acid profiling using a gas zzso mass zzso zzso and the patient's parents were zzso zzso 14 zzso of the zzso sequences of the zzso and two relative genes zzso and zzso from the zzso and 100 zzso controls were captured by zzso capture method followed by zzso next-generation zzso Two zzso zzso were detected in the zzso including the previous reported zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sequence results showed that the patient was a compound zzso for the two zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso which is predicted to affect the normal structure and function of zzso is a candidate zzso zzso Target sequence capture combined with zzso next-generation sequencing technologies is proven to be an effective method for molecular genetic testing of type II zzso
