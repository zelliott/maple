The zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the innate immune zzso It binds carbohydrates surface, acts as an zzso and activates the complement zzso With the aim of studying the evolution of the zzso gene in zzso we zzso its coding region in 12 zzso zzso species and compared them with the human zzso We demonstrated that zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso among primates are highly zzso underlining the importance of this zzso in the defense system against pathogen zzso In particular, in the zzso domain that zzso the characteristic structure to zzso zzso the identity among primates is really zzso In the zzso recognition domain, we evidenced some zzso zzso zzso zzso not resulting in changes of the structure or function of this zzso zzso zzso analysis did not evidence any positive selective pressure in zzso gene among zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is well zzso in agreement with its important role in the immune system: in zzso zzso we did not observe the same zzso of the zzso human zzso where a frequency of more than zzso of zzso variations was described in the coding and promoter zzso
