To study zzso filament organization in zzso we injected zzso zzso which have no significant zzso system of their own, with in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were localized primarily to the zzso surface of the nucleus and to the zzso membrane zzso In the zzso of the animal hemisphere, zzso zzso forms zzso structures and short zzso In contrast, long zzso zzso filaments are formed in the vegetal zzso zzso This asymmetry in the organization of zzso zzso is similar to that of the zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso which suggests that the same cellular factors are responsible for zzso Before zzso zzso breakdown, in the initial stage of zzso zzso large zzso and zzso filament zzso appear in the animal zzso As maturation zzso zzso filaments zzso into soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso while zzso filaments remain intact and zzso is zzso To examine the role of zzso zzso in the zzso reorganization of zzso we deleted the zzso zzso of zzso single zzso zzso this zzso had no apparent effect on the zzso or zzso behavior of zzso In contrast, deletion of zzso acids zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso domain produced proteins that formed extended filaments in the animal zzso of the zzso zzso We suggest that the animal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso contains a factor that actively suppresses the formation of extended zzso filaments through a direct interaction with zzso head zzso During maturation this zzso of extended zzso appears to be zzso leading to the formation of an extended zzso filament zzso
