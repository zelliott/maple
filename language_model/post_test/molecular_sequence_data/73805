zzso is a type II restriction zzso found in zzso zzso zzso that recognizes the zzso sequence zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso and zzso between the first and second base to generate a zzso zzso zzso The cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso system has been described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 252 zzso zzso Here we report the zzso of zzso restriction zzso gene in zzso coli by zzso of the zzso gene into an expression zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso It has the same zzso zzso sequence as the native zzso The zzso expression of zzso from zzso is lethal to zzso coli in the absence of the zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso with either zzso or by zzso zzso chain reaction in zzso and transferred into zzso coli via zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso Surviving zzso were selected that carry zzso zzso which lost zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important zzso for zzso zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso was used to identify zzso and zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can still bind DNA despite the loss of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be located near or within the zzso center, and are likely involved in metal zzso zzso
