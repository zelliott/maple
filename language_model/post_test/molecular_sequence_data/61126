zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 3) is a member of the zzso zzso family which bears a system zzso transport zzso On the Northern zzso of adult rat zzso the expression of zzso is restricted to the zzso In the present study, cellular zzso of zzso zzso and protein in the adult rat brain sections was examined by in zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present both in the cerebral and zzso gray matter but most prominently in the zzso located in the zzso part of the zzso These included zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus of thalamus, zzso zzso central gray around the third zzso and zzso zzso protein was also detected both in the cerebral and zzso gray matter and strong zzso was obtained in the zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Observations at higher zzso revealed that both zzso and protein were expressed by zzso but neither by zzso nor zzso zzso These results confirm the zzso of zzso in the adult rat brain and indicate that zzso is responsible for the zzso system zzso zzso The zzso between the distribution of zzso and its translation product suggests a regional difference in the translation rate of the zzso zzso
