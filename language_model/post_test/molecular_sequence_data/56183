To search for possible zzso of zzso distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have produced a soluble zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso linking the zzso acid human zzso zzso segment with zzso zzso of human zzso heavy chain, thus enhancing the zzso affinity of the zzso zzso through zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso and standard stringency wash conditions, we observed that the binding of zzso to human B zzso zzso cells and red blood cells is virtually inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso even though these cells express levels of zzso and zzso comparable to zzso zzso with these results, zzso did not show any binding to Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with human zzso or zzso However, binding studies on zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells with zzso under low stringency wash conditions revealed that human zzso is a low affinity zzso of human zzso compared with zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso approximately zzso M, zzso The findings are noteworthy given that in the zzso system zzso is the major zzso for zzso No zzso binding was observed to zzso zzso cells despite a report suggesting that zzso may bind to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso T cells and zzso or zzso zzso cells, there was no zzso formation, whereas binding of zzso T cells to zzso zzso cells was readily zzso zzso our findings provide evidence for a conservation of the zzso interaction in the human species that may be of zzso if any, functional zzso Given the importance of the zzso interaction in the zzso system and zzso interaction in humans, it would appear that there has been a divergence of functional zzso zzso during the evolution of humans and zzso
