zzso of functions that render DNA susceptible to zzso is important for a better understanding of zzso zzso In a previous work, we showed that sequences located downstream of a strong promoter are particularly prone to zzso In this paper, the parameters that influence zzso deletions were zzso zzso derivatives carrying the zzso zzso replication origin and a zzso zzso region were zzso zzso formation was zzso in the presence of the replication protein of zzso which introduces a zzso at the zzso replication origin, and in a zzso strain to avoid zzso zzso Our study showed that: zzso 4 h after induction of transcription, a few per cent of the plasmids have experienced a zzso zzso these deletions result in joining of the zzso replication origin to a zzso located in or downstream of the transcribed zzso zzso deletion formation strongly depends on the orientation of transcription, on promoter strength and transcript zzso but is independent of zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso does not induce deletion zzso We propose that deletions in the transcribed region result from zzso between zzso replication and zzso zzso
