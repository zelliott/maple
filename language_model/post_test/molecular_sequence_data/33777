zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which is a small zzso zzso from zzso zzso was first zzso and characterized in our previous zzso Although it has been found that zzso zzso is induced at a high pH under zzso condition, the zzso role of this zzso c has not been clarified zzso zzso to understand its zzso role, further characterization of this zzso expressed in zzso coli was zzso The yield of the zzso protein reached zzso zzso of culture, which was zzso larger than that of native zzso zzso data of the zzso protein exactly agreed with that of native zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was oxidized by partially zzso zzso zzso c zzso from zzso zzso zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike reported zzso c from other zzso zzso the E degrees ' values between zzso zzso and zzso were nearly zzso zzso zzso oxidized very slowly at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas it oxidized more rapidly at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, horse heart zzso c showed higher zzso rates at zzso zzso than zzso zzso It is considered that the high zzso ability of zzso zzso at high zzso is important for its zzso function in the environmental adaptation of this bacteria for superior growth at high zzso under zzso zzso
