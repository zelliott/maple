A novel zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from soil of a zzso field in zzso province, South Korea, and was characterized using a zzso approach to determine its zzso zzso The strain was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the strain belonged to the zzso zzso it was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso data, zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso as major fatty zzso also supported zzso of strain zzso zzso in the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso values of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were 45 and 31 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso tests enabled strain zzso zzso to be differentiated zzso from other established species of zzso zzso the isolate represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
