This report describes the cloning and sequencing of the zzso of a deletion of approximately 166 zzso in the zzso region of a rearranged zzso zzso gamma zzso V gamma 2 gene from the disease cells of a patient with zzso zzso This abnormal zzso was not detected in a biopsy taken during clinical zzso zzso analysis indicated that the deletion zzso occurred at a position immediately upstream of sequences found in the zzso V gamma 2 gene that are closely related to known zzso and zzso zzso signal zzso Furthermore, the zzso was found to have zzso zzso zzso in between otherwise intact V and J zzso These data indicate that this structure may be the result of an zzso zzso event in common with the frequently occurring zzso abnormalities found in zzso zzso This event could either be one directly associated with the zzso transformation or one occurring during normal zzso development but which is coincidental with zzso zzso This represents the first molecular genetic evidence for an zzso specifically involving the zzso locus in zzso
