The zzso specificity of zzso zzso a very potent zzso zzso was investigated in the zzso gene of zzso To analyze the influence of zzso on zzso zzso 86 and 84 zzso zzso were respectively isolated from zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of bacteria with increasing zzso of zzso affected 2-4 times more the survival rate in the zzso context, as compared to zzso zzso of all zzso occurred primarily at zzso base pairs and were substitution events and zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso The six possible substitution events were observed in both zzso In the zzso context, they were dominated by zzso zzso 38% of zzso at zzso base pairs occurred in the consensus sequence zzso or zzso where the G was zzso When zzso was deficient zzso zzso were mainly zzso The proportions of substitution zzso were very similar to those that have been reported for zzso (AP) sites, suggesting strongly that one mechanism for zzso zzso is the formation of intermediate zzso sites that serve as a zzso for zzso zzso Single zzso events consisted essentially of deletions of one zzso base pair in runs of zzso G or C zzso zzso frequency increased with the length of the reiterated zzso suggesting a zzso zzso Other zzso classes were recovered to a lower extent, including zzso zzso and large zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso presented two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso induced by zzso in the zzso backgrounds suggests an influence of the zzso product on strand specificity of zzso zzso particularly in the case of zzso zzso
