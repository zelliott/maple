zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame that has a zzso identity to zzso coli zzso The zzso activity of zzso protein zzso has been confirmed, and its crystal structure has been determined by the molecular replacement method and refined with two crystal forms to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso organized as a zzso of zzso Each zzso is composed of two zzso a larger zzso domain and a smaller zzso domain, similar to that of zzso and zzso zzso members of the zzso family of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso structure with its zzso and zzso analogue was determined and refined at zzso zzso The bound zzso was observed predominantly as an open chain zzso The positioning of zzso and the conservation of important zzso zzso suggest that the reaction mechanism is likely to be similar to that of other members of the zzso family, including zzso In particular, the zzso is zzso to have a role in transferring the zzso of zzso to the zzso group of zzso
