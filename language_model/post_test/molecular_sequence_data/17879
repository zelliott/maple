DNA fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso at least 7 zzso in zzso were zzso to zzso coli expression zzso Three clones of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained by the colony zzso method using zzso zzso In zzso coli, all these genes produced zzso zzso which were detected with Western zzso The zzso acid sequence of chemically zzso zzso fragments was also zzso An approximately zzso zzso DNA zzso of the zzso clone was zzso and we found that portions of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the chemically analyzed zzso zzso it is highly probable that the gene studied in the present experiment is truly a zzso structural zzso
