The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso are unable to assemble the zzso membrane zzso Here we studied the structural integrity of the zzso pole body zzso in zzso zzso during zzso zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso marker zzso zzso showed an excess number of zzso some of which were not localized to the zzso poles and were termed zzso zzso of zzso for zzso I was significantly delayed in zzso cells, although the zzso of zzso and segregation of the sister zzso seemed zzso The zzso of zzso contained zzso outer zzso though zzso layers were less zzso zzso studies of zzso cells showed that the zzso originated from normal zzso at the zzso poles during zzso zzso Among the zzso components tested, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were localized to the zzso but zzso was not always zzso zzso a component of the zzso complex, was also present in about zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso initiated from both the zzso and the zzso We conclude that zzso plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the zzso zzso besides zzso membrane zzso for zzso membrane zzso
