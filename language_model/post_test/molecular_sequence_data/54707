zzso zzso are a group of regulatory zzso that regulate gene expression by binding to specific sequences on target zzso However, functional identification of zzso targets is usually difficult and time zzso Here we report zzso as a new and rapid approach to screen putative zzso targets in zzso 

Fifteen putative target zzso for human zzso zzso zzso including previously confirmed zzso zzso were identified from zzso zzso using zzso Moreover, we randomly validated six different target candidates by zzso reporter zzso and confirmed that their zzso activities were zzso with zzso of zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrated that zzso is an effective and rapid approach for screening putative zzso targets, with much more advantage of zzso low cost, and ease of zzso
