zzso is a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso repair, zzso zzso repair and zzso zzso So far, it has not been shown zzso which zzso of the zzso harbors the zzso activity and which zzso acids contribute to zzso We used an affinity zzso zzso and located the active site to zzso acids zzso of zzso Point zzso generated in this region were analyzed for their role in zzso activity, metal coordination and DNA zzso Several zzso and basic zzso turned out to be required for zzso activity, but not DNA zzso The separation of zzso binding and zzso by zzso will be invaluable in studying the role of this protein in various DNA repair zzso zzso of the active site region of zzso with proteins belonging to the zzso family and a putative zzso zzso zzso family reveals that seven of the zzso of zzso involved in zzso activity are absolutely zzso in the three protein families, indicating that they share a common zzso zzso
