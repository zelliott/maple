We have used an in zzso system to study the effects of major zzso complex class I binding peptides on zzso zzso Fetal zzso zzso from mice deficient in the class I light chain zzso 2 zzso or beta 2 zzso were cultured for 10 d in zzso during which time T cell precursors develop into mature T zzso In these organ cultures, as in the adult or zzso beta 2 zzso zzso zzso mature T cells did not zzso demonstrating that the mature T cells seen during early zzso zzso development are the result of the positive selection zzso To these cultures we added various class I binding peptides with or without a source of zzso beta zzso zzso T cells developed to various degrees only in the presence of beta zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso of differing complexity, we showed that the efficiency of this process is dependent more on zzso complexity than on zzso zzso These data argue for a specific role for peptides in the process of positive zzso Furthermore, this culture system should be useful in identifying peptides that can promote positive selection of cells expressing a specific T cell zzso zzso in zzso transgenic zzso
