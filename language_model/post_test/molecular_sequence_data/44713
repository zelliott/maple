zzso disease type zzso zzso is associated with a zzso tandem DNA zzso in zzso zzso while zzso zzso with liability to pressure zzso zzso is associated with a zzso deletion at this zzso The zzso zzso zzso unit duplicated in zzso and deleted in zzso is flanked by two zzso direct repeats termed the zzso Recently, sequence analysis of the zzso revealed that they contain an internal zzso of the zzso zzso To characterize zzso zzso human zzso zzso the zzso region was isolated and the gene structure and expression profile were zzso zzso spans approximately 135 zzso and consists of seven zzso zzso zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso unit, whereas zzso zzso is located within this zzso zzso zzso VI is contained within the zzso zzso All zzso sites conform to the zzso zzso Analysis of the putative promoter region of the zzso gene indicates that it lacks conventional zzso and zzso boxes, but it does have several potential zzso zzso zzso This gene is expressed in multiple zzso with highest expression observed in the heart, skeletal muscle, and zzso
