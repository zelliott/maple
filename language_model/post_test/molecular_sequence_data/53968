Current zzso tests for zzso zzso use zzso zzso zzso derived from infected zzso One of the major drawbacks of these tests is that zzso quality can vary from batch to zzso Since the quality of the zzso contributes to the sensitivity and specificity of zzso tests, the use of standardized zzso zzso should ensure consistency in zzso zzso Previously, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a candidate diagnostic zzso for use in a zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso in infected zzso In this study, we have zzso zzso and expressed zzso A zzso zzso clone zzso zzso was isolated and shown to be almost full zzso lacking approximately 300 zzso at the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shows that zzso consists of a long, highly charged central repeat region of an uninterrupted alpha zzso indicative of a zzso zzso zzso zzso localized zzso to the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso may be a structural protein involved in forming filament structures within the zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso but the yield was zzso To improve the yield, zzso fragments zzso zzso zzso of zzso were expressed as zzso with zzso One of these fusion zzso zzso is composed of a zzso zzso of the zzso repeat region and contains zzso that react strongly with zzso from cattle zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso should permit the development of an improved zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso against zzso zzso
