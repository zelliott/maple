This paper concerns the manner in which zzso mating proteins of the zzso zzso zzso recognize one another to form complexes that regulate target gene zzso In zzso tightly linked Y and Z zzso genes do not promote development in the combinations present in zzso strains zzso self zzso When the Y and Z genes from two different mating types are brought together by the fusion of two zzso cells, the Y and Z proteins from different mating types recognize one another as zzso form a complex and activate zzso Several Y and Z zzso are present in the population and all zzso combinations of Y and Z zzso are equally zzso We have made zzso genes among zzso zzso zzso and zzso and examined their zzso zzso by transformation and mating zzso These studies show that the specificity of Y protein recognized by Z protein is zzso within a short region of zzso zzso zzso The critical region is not precisely the same in each Y protein and in each zzso protein zzso For zzso protein compared with zzso zzso the critical zzso are in an zzso region of 56 zzso acids zzso zzso with zzso identity and zzso zzso zzso studies show that: the first 144 zzso acids of zzso protein are sufficient to bind zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and proteins deleted of the zzso specificity region do not bind zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus the specificity zzso of the Y protein is essential for zzso recognition, zzso protein binding and mating zzso
