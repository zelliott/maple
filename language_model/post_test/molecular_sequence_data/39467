zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso in complex with the zzso zzso and its structure determined to zzso A resolution using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors of zzso and zzso zzso As predicted from the sequence and shown by the structure, zzso can be assigned to the zzso protein zzso zzso consists of two zzso The zzso domain displays a zzso fold and contains the zzso binding zzso The intact zzso contain the oxidized zzso zzso whose attachment to the zzso binding site is similar to that of zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Due to variations in length and sequence within loop regions zzso and zzso respectively, the zzso zzso of zzso adopts a different orientation in zzso caused by zzso zzso forming hydrogen bonds with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso stacking interactions with the zzso zzso zzso acid replacements in zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso is crucial for the discrimination between zzso and zzso and yielded the zzso zzso with dual zzso zzso The zzso domain contains the putative zzso binding site that was occupied by an zzso zzso As determined by zzso to zzso and by zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are most likely involved in zzso binding and zzso as substitution of any of these zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso for zzso In this context, zzso might serve as a general zzso catalyst by polarizing the zzso function of zzso to enable the transfer of the hydride from zzso to the zzso Here we present the first structure of an zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso reduction of zzso to zzso the final step of a modified zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also emphasize the importance of the zzso zzso in zzso for the synthesis of zzso and related zzso
