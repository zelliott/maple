Two DNA zzso directed against two separate zzso on human zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 is directed to the zzso zzso binding site zzso zzso Our finding that zzso 1 competes with zzso for binding to zzso 1 on zzso suggests that zzso 1 will not be useful for zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 is directed against the zzso zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso 2 bound to model zzso that were formed either by zzso zzso zzso with zzso or by zzso zzso zzso As the zzso content of zzso was increased the rate of zzso 2 zzso into zzso zzso increased, whereas the rate of release of zzso 2 out of zzso zzso zzso This in zzso data suggested that zzso 2 might be useful for zzso imaging because it can bind to zzso 2 on zzso zzso However, in a rabbit jugular vein model using zzso supplemented with human zzso zzso 2 zzso was equal to the zzso control, and did not reflect zzso zzso While the in zzso results with zzso 2 were consistent with zzso imaging, the rapid clearance of zzso 2 from zzso combined with slow mass transfer in the zzso seem to work against in zzso zzso imaging or zzso zzso
