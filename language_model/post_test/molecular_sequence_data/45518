The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a novel type of zzso that tightly binds an zzso zzso The iron is coordinated by two CO zzso one zzso and a zzso zzso which is linked via a zzso bond to a zzso zzso We report here on the crystal structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso at zzso A and from zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso zzso reveals a unique architecture composed of one central and two identical peripheral zzso zzso The central unit is composed of the intertwined zzso segments of both zzso forming a novel zzso zzso The two peripheral units consist of the zzso domain of each zzso The zzso zzso structure of the zzso domain contains a zzso site, which could zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso Another binding site for the zzso zzso is most probably zzso which is located at the bottom of a deep zzso zzso and which has been shown to be essential for zzso zzso zzso to the iron of the zzso zzso as a zzso to zzso an extended zzso extra electron density, interpreted as a zzso fragment, suggests a binding site for the zzso zzso
