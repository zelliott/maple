The zzso zzso assembly proteins zzso and zzso with molecular masses of approximately zzso zzso and the zzso zzso assembly proteins zzso and zzso with molecular masses of approximately 90 zzso catalyze the assembly of zzso into artificial zzso baskets under zzso zzso We have now identified a much smaller approximately zzso zzso assembly protein in zzso M zzso pH zzso extracts of zzso coated zzso and zzso it to near zzso A zzso zzso against this protein did not zzso with any of the other assembly zzso and sequencing data suggest that this new protein is similar or identical to zzso basic protein zzso At a zzso ratio of 3 molecules per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into artificial baskets that appear structurally similar to the baskets assembled by the other assembly zzso In addition, like the other baskets, the zzso baskets are zzso by zzso zzso represents a significant fraction of the total assembly protein activity present in zzso M zzso pH zzso extracts of coated zzso It is not clear if it acts as an assembly protein in zzso but because it is well characterized and easily available, zzso will be a useful protein to investigate the mechanism of zzso assembly and zzso in zzso
