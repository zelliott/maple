zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso have been found to be highly expressed by the mouse T zzso zzso grown in zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso occurred only in low amounts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Neumann, zzso (1991) zzso J zzso zzso differences in the zzso composition of zzso cells grown in zzso and in well defined zzso medium were zzso After transfer of the cells from zzso medium zzso zzso with zzso fetal calf zzso to zzso medium zzso zzso with well defined zzso zzso and zzso decreased and only low amounts of these zzso could be detected in zzso growing zzso The expression of zzso was also diminished but not as strongly as that of zzso and zzso These growth medium zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the original zzso expression was achieved by zzso of zzso growing cells to the initial zzso zzso On the other hand, a zzso zzso supposed to represent zzso and not expressed by zzso growing cells, was induced during zzso zzso and increased strongly after zzso These observations reveal that the zzso composition of in zzso cultivated cells can be modified by the zzso environment due to different supplementation of the zzso growth zzso
