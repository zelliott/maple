zzso zzso zzso zzso from 17 Polish hospitals were zzso The zzso were resistant to a variety of zzso and their patterns of resistance to zzso resembled those of the zzso class C zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso with a zzso of approximately zzso were found in all of the zzso and they were subsequently identified as four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of which the two last ones were novel zzso zzso The zzso were of zzso zzso origin and were closely related to each other, with zzso likely being the evolutionary precursor of the remaining zzso The zzso genes were located exclusively in zzso DNA, within zzso restriction fragments of the same size of approximately 10 zzso In the zzso and zzso zzso an additional zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso with the zzso probe as well, which could have arisen from a zzso event during the evolution of the zzso In all of the zzso the zzso mobile element, which most probably is involved in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was placed at the same distance from the zzso ends of the zzso zzso and sequences located between them were identical in zzso carrying each of the four zzso These data suggested that a single zzso transfer of the zzso gene from zzso zzso to zzso zzso could have initiated the spread and evolution of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The hypothesis seems to be confirmed by zzso gel zzso zzso which revealed several cases of close zzso between the zzso zzso zzso from distant centers and showed an overall similarity between the majority of the zzso zzso
