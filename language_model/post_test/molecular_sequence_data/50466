The zzso zzso protein zzso complex zzso is a global regulator of gene zzso It influences zzso from a number of promoters in zzso coli, including two zzso oriented promoters in the zzso zzso gene zzso To further define the role of zzso in zzso regulation we monitored zzso interactions in zzso and levels of zzso zzso in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso was zzso by a single zzso site centered at zzso positions zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start zzso A target for the zzso regulatory protein zzso was localized adjacent to the zzso zzso The long-range effects exerted from the zzso sites were consistent with the idea that zzso caused a change in the local DNA zzso and that a zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso was formed in the region between the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso became independent of zzso of zzso and the zzso protein in a zzso lacking the zzso protein zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso complex mediates its positive regulatory function by alleviating zzso zzso and, as such, plays a role as zzso
