zzso zzso zzso is recognized as a promising drug for the treatment of zzso infections, but drug resistance can arise by a mechanism that is poorly zzso We show here that in zzso selection for high levels of resistance to zzso produces viruses zzso two substitution zzso in the virus DNA zzso zzso zzso These zzso are located within the regions of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso viruses exhibited zzso to other zzso zzso drugs, while they remained sensitive to other unrelated DNA zzso zzso zzso rescue experiments were used to transfer zzso and/or zzso zzso into a zzso virus Western Reserve zzso Either zzso alone could zzso a drug resistance zzso although the degree of resistance was significantly lower than when virus zzso both zzso The zzso zzso but not the zzso change, also zzso a spontaneous zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso viruses exhibited reduced zzso in mice, demonstrating that these zzso zzso are inextricably linked to reduced fitness in zzso zzso at a dose of 50 zzso of body zzso for 5 days, still protected mice against zzso challenge with the drug-resistant virus with zzso and zzso zzso Our studies show that proposed drug therapies offer a reasonable likelihood of controlling zzso infections, even if the viruses zzso drug resistance zzso
