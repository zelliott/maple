We have examined the promoter sequence requirements for zzso zzso of the human zzso gene by using a transient zzso zzso A zzso deletion study has defined a zzso zzso unit extending to zzso relative to the zzso initiation site which was fully zzso zzso Further zzso abolishing a zzso element at zzso drastically reduced zzso and zzso zzso A zzso analysis has identified four functional elements within the zzso zzso unit which may interact with zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso can partially compensate for zzso in these zzso No zzso specifically abolished zzso zzso Any reduction in absolute zzso levels was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in absolute zzso levels, thereby maintaining a constant relative fold zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter does not require any single zzso zzso zzso We also examined an zzso promoter fragment, containing the zzso element at zzso and the zzso element at zzso out of its normal context by fusing it upstream of a zzso inactive zzso zzso virus zzso zzso deletion construct containing only the zzso zzso The resulting zzso promoter was fully zzso zzso zzso of this promoter fusion demonstrated that the zzso element was essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso element resulted in an approximately zzso zzso in zzso levels and rendered the promoter zzso to zzso
