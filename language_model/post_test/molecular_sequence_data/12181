zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso which is critical for several important cellular zzso including zzso zzso zzso is the target of the zzso drugs zzso A and zzso which inhibit zzso after forming complexes with zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso zzso We report here the crystal structures of full-length human zzso at zzso A resolution and of the complex of human zzso with zzso at zzso A zzso In the native zzso structure, an zzso element binds at the zzso active zzso The zzso geometry and zzso water structure suggest a zzso mechanism involving zzso attack on the zzso zzso by a zzso water zzso In the zzso complex, the zzso element is displaced from the active zzso The site of binding of zzso appears to be shared by other zzso zzso of zzso including a natural zzso zzso
