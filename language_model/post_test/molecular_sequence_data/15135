To induce growth of zzso bacteria residing in an zzso state in zzso of in zzso potato zzso To isolate and identify the induced bacteria and to zzso the strains in zzso of in zzso potato zzso 

The zzso of in zzso potato plants with zzso zzso zzso led to induction of another zzso a zzso zzso zzso that was identified as zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso Two molecular methods were used for zzso zzso in potato zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso A zzso product specific for the zzso zzso was found in DNA isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected by zzso in leaves and stems of zzso as well as zzso potato zzso although the zzso cannot be isolated from the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resides in zzso state within zzso of in zzso potato plants and becomes zzso after zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

In order to develop zzso zzso and zzso agents, a detailed knowledge of the zzso of zzso is zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on increase of the zzso of zzso in response to zzso by zzso zzso
