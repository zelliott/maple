Recently we cloned two zzso gene clusters from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso one designated the embryonic zzso gene cluster zzso zzso and the other the adult zzso gene cluster zzso zzso The E1 and A1 clusters map to linkage groups 8 and 19, zzso The genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are organized in head-to-head orientation with respect to zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso are arranged in tandem with the same zzso The results suggest that a variety of events occurred in zzso gene evolution such as zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso tandem zzso of single alpha genes and the transformation of one pair of zzso genes into zzso zzso zzso acid sequences predicted from the genes were compared with those of 42 alpha and 55 beta zzso zzso using the zzso or maximum likelihood zzso The zzso trees that were generated classified the zzso zzso into at least four groups, tentatively named zzso zzso Group zzso zzso Major Adult zzso Group zzso zzso Adult zzso Group zzso and zzso Adult zzso Group zzso The zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to group I, and zzso and zzso to group zzso Further analysis suggests that zzso and zzso belong to groups III and IV, zzso Thus, zzso genes in the zzso probably were diversified from four ancestral zzso one for each zzso On the basis of the gene zzso we present a hypothetical zzso for zzso gene evolution in the zzso
