The regulation and function of zzso zzso zzso VI zzso which is a highly abundant protein associated with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is poorly understood so zzso It has been shown zzso that zzso zzso a class of regulatory adapter proteins ubiquitous in zzso bind to zzso in zzso in a zzso dependent zzso Here we identify possible zzso binding sites in human zzso by in zzso methods, looking for zzso surface exposed zzso zzso Two of these sites were confirmed as zzso binding sites by zzso polarization competition and X-ray zzso We zzso suggest a role of zzso zzso in the zzso of one of these two binding sites and provide evidence in the form of in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso
