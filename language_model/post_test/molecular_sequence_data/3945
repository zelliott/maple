The initial step of the zzso transport of G zzso zzso their zzso into the membrane of the zzso zzso follows one of two different zzso Whereas one group uses the first zzso domain of the mature zzso as an zzso signal anchor sequence for this process, a second group possesses additional zzso signal zzso The reason this second subset requires the additional signal zzso is not zzso Here we have assessed the functional significance of the signal zzso of the zzso B zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso A green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the signal zzso was zzso and retained in the zzso zzso suggesting that it has a folding zzso To determine the zzso in more detail, zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso tail, first zzso domain, and first zzso loop were zzso We assessed N tail zzso across the zzso zzso membrane in the presence and absence of a signal zzso and show that the signal zzso is necessary for N tail zzso We zzso that signal peptides are necessary for those G zzso receptors for which zzso zzso of the N zzso is impaired or blocked by the presence of zzso folded zzso
