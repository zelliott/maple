The zzso neutral zzso zzso of both zzso zzso protein anchors and related zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso on zzso gel 60, using zzso zzso zzso or a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso acid zzso were used as standards, and zzso up to 11 zzso units could be zzso A comparison of 18 zzso standards revealed that their migration was dependent mainly on the size of the zzso zzso were generally not zzso with the exception of Man alpha zzso alpha zzso and Man alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso were well resolved from structures containing only zzso and/or zzso The utility of this method for the zzso of zzso neutral zzso derived from two zzso zzso using zzso and chemical treatments, is zzso This method is a simple and useful complement to the existing zzso zzso
