To decipher the global network of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling pathway, a large scale zzso analysis of zzso proteins was zzso Here, we focus on characterizing a novel zzso zzso zzso family binding zzso identified in the zzso zzso was found to be zzso at zzso 204 upon zzso zzso and the zzso family was identified as a binding zzso A zzso motif of zzso is recognized by one of the three zzso 3 zzso of zzso and the affinity of the interaction is regulated by the zzso zzso of zzso They zzso in zzso structures, and zzso of zzso induced zzso changes with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso accelerated the zzso zzso zzso by zzso the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso Two spliced zzso of zzso lacking either zzso 5 or 8 are also zzso and the zzso lacking zzso 5 without the zzso motif lacks the ability to bind to the zzso zzso The zzso protein seems to play a key role in the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso
