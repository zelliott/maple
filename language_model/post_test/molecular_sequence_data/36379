We have found that under appropriate conditions, an zzso zzso chain reaction zzso can achieve a sensitivity suitable for measuring specific, zzso zzso in single cell systems or in animal zzso Using the 12th zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso gene as a model system, we have defined conditions that allow for measurement of zzso present at zzso as low as one in zzso gene zzso Our approach involved the use of zzso zzso that created a single mismatch with the zzso zzso zzso but created a double mismatch with the zzso zzso zzso Five out of the six such zzso zzso we tested permitted amplification of the zzso zzso zzso with a high degree of zzso The specificity of the zzso was further enhanced by using a zzso zzso cycle consisting of a zzso step (1 zzso incubation at 94 degrees zzso and an zzso step (1 zzso incubation at 50 degrees zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Reconstruction experiments using zzso DNA demonstrate that this procedure zzso measure the presence of 30 copies of the transforming zzso zzso present amongst 3 zzso zzso copies of the zzso zzso
