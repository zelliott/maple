According to the X-ray structure analysis of an zzso complex zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso sequence specificity is zzso by 12 hydrogen bonds, 6 from each of the two identical zzso of the zzso zzso to the recognition site zzso zzso forms two hydrogen bonds with zzso while zzso and zzso form four hydrogen bonds to adjacent zzso zzso zzso the zzso potential at the recognition site without zzso the rest of the interface should lead to the recognition of zzso sequences zzso et zzso zzso in zzso Engineering zzso zzso zzso & Fox, zzso zzso zzso pp zzso zzso New zzso We have shown previously that replacing zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso affects the activity of the zzso not, however, its specificity zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso We show now that also the zzso of zzso to zzso the double zzso zzso to zzso and the triple zzso zzso to zzso do not lead to a zzso zzso of the specificity of zzso by zzso but significantly impair the zzso activity of this zzso A detailed analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso DNA and a zzso zzso demonstrates that the reduction in activity for all DNA binding site zzso investigated so far is mainly due to a decrease in zzso with the exception of the zzso to zzso zzso which is only impaired in its zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
