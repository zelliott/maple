The paired zzso filament, the principal component of the zzso zzso characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, is shown to consist of two structurally distinct zzso An external fuzzy region can be removed by zzso treatment to leave a zzso zzso recognizable zzso A zzso zzso has been raised which both zzso the core and labels zzso fragments extracted from the zzso zzso acid sequence derived from such peptides was used to design zzso zzso with which zzso libraries were screened and clones coding for the corresponding proteins were zzso The sequences proved to code for two zzso of human zzso protein zzso which contained respectively three or four tandem repeats of 31 or 32 zzso acids each with a characteristic zzso zzso The patterns of zzso expression for the two zzso were found to be stage and zzso specific but were apparently zzso in Alzheimer's zzso The repeat region of zzso is believed to be the zzso binding domain and it is this region of the zzso which is tightly and specifically bound in the core of the paired zzso zzso
