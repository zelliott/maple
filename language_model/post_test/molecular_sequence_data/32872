zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, which specifically bind to the zzso DNA motif zzso and its closely related zzso Unlike its ubiquitous counterpart zzso zzso is thought to be expressed only in B zzso and zzso cells and is mainly involved in zzso gene zzso We show here that zzso is also expressed in the zzso cells of mouse zzso zzso and that this expression is zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends and subsequent zzso cloning indicate that the zzso zzso expresses multiple zzso zzso including a novel zzso named zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso the deduced zzso sequence has an additional 22 zzso acids close to the zzso and a novel zzso zzso resulting from alternative zzso with retention of the last zzso that is spliced out in all other zzso Although zzso has intact zzso and zzso zzso it is unable to bind to the zzso zzso unlike all other known zzso Like zzso both zzso and zzso can activate zzso zzso gene promoter zzso However, zzso by zzso which is independent of DNA zzso is significantly lower than that by zzso Moreover, deletion of the first 114 zzso acids at the zzso of zzso has no effect on zzso this does not support previous reports of the presence of an zzso domain in this zzso
