The mechanisms by which zzso activate zzso zzso zzso function remain zzso We have reported data on a patient with zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso of zzso (a protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso factors have been associated with zzso and zzso zzso To define the molecular mechanisms, we amplified from patient zzso zzso zzso 3 to 6 of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso which encompasses the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso deletion was found zzso zzso The zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso in zzso 3 at the zzso zzso site for zzso 4, leading to a zzso with premature termination in the zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso Our conclusions are that zzso zzso zzso is associated with not only zzso but also impaired zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins regulated by zzso are required for zzso signal zzso zzso of zzso and zzso we have documented the first zzso of a human zzso zzso zzso suggesting a major role of this zzso in zzso production and zzso
