The location of the zzso bond zzso by homogeneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of bovine calf zzso has been determined by using a zzso zzso containing a single central zzso site as a zzso A single product of zzso consistent with zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso site, and leaving a 3' zzso group, was zzso This zzso is, therefore, a class II zzso zzso The zzso zzso of this zzso have been determined by using a variety of natural and synthetic zzso or zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an absolute requirement for a zzso DNA and requires an zzso site as a zzso The presence of a base zzso such as a zzso zzso an zzso group attached to the zzso position of the zzso site, or reduction of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of this zzso zzso zzso sites containing either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso linkages are excellent zzso for bovine zzso These results indicate that zzso has no absolute requirement for either zzso or zzso zzso zzso in its recognition of zzso zzso The zzso may interact with the pocket in duplex DNA that results from the base loss or with the altered zzso of the zzso backbone that result from the zzso zzso
