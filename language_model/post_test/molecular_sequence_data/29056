A method of rapid skin zzso zzso zzso load cycling with an inflated subcutaneous silicone balloon zzso zzso zzso Expansion or zzso permits the surgeon to rapidly zzso skin and create a zzso of greater length for zzso plastic zzso We have previously developed an experimental mouse model to evaluate zzso and have shown that rapid stretching prevents zzso and significantly reduces zzso Although the advantages of zzso have been demonstrated both clinically and zzso the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these benefits were zzso In the study reported here, we used differential display reverse zzso zzso chain reaction to identify genes that are specifically induced by zzso Among four differential gene fragments, the expression of one was confirmed by Northern zzso zzso The zzso zzso was extended and the zzso sequence analyzed to reveal induction of truncated long zzso zzso element 1 zzso or zzso zzso zzso elements are located inside zzso of many genes and among these genes zzso and insulin I are known to regulate cell zzso Northern zzso using specific zzso zzso for zzso and insulin I demonstrated that it also was induced by zzso This is the first reported study to show that zzso zzso and insulin I are responsive to rapid zzso and not rapid linear zzso
