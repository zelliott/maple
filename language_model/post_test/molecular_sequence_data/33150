Two zzso zzso designated strains zzso and zzso which had potent zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso and several clinical zzso zzso zzso were isolated from two soil samples collected from zzso Province and Xinjiang zzso zzso Region in China, zzso The zzso status of these two organisms was established by using a zzso zzso The zzso data were consistent with the assignment of the strains to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the two zzso formed a branch with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso This branching pattern was also supported by the tree constructed with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strains zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso % and zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, the two strains shared low levels of zzso zzso with the type strains of closely related zzso species and were readily distinguished by using a combination of zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
