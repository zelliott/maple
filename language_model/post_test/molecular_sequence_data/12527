We have shown that the zzso heat shock protein zzso and the 42 degrees zzso heat shock protein zzso degrees zzso constitute high molecular mass heat shock zzso To zzso the structure of these heat shock zzso we have screened a zzso library constructed with zzso zzso derived from mouse zzso cells zzso at 42 degrees C for 2 h using an zzso against zzso zzso Two full-length zzso clones were zzso the zzso insert zzso an zzso acid zzso and the zzso insert zzso an zzso acid protein and lacked 44 zzso acids found in zzso The two clones contained the zzso acid sequence found in the zzso zzso fragments from zzso and 42 degrees zzso by zzso zzso In zzso translation products of the zzso transcripts from zzso and zzso migrated to the same positions of zzso and 42 degrees zzso respectively, on zzso gel zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the transcript was approximately 4 zzso in zzso zzso cells and was strongly induced by heat shock and by treatment with zzso or an zzso acid zzso By reverse zzso chain reaction analysis using zzso by which deletion of 132 zzso in zzso could be zzso the zzso chain reaction product corresponding to zzso was increased only after heat shock at 42 degrees C, whereas the product corresponding to zzso was induced by heat shock at either 42 or 45 degrees C and also by other zzso Thus, the zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 42 degrees zzso respectively, and zzso and 42 degrees zzso (a short form of zzso are suggested to be produced by alternative zzso Here, zzso and 42 degrees zzso are renamed zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso A protein sequence zzso search revealed that zzso shares 54, 34, and zzso zzso acid identity with human zzso the sea zzso egg zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, by Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso was revealed to be present in most zzso zzso and to be highly expressed in the zzso
