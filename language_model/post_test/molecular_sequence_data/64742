The expression and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined in cultured human lens zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was evaluated by coupled reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was determined on zzso zzso cells using conventional zzso techniques, as well as zzso of differential cellular components after subjecting the cultured cells to zzso by zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso species specific zzso distinguished zzso from total zzso extracted from zzso cells, as well as from human breast zzso cells zzso which provided a positive zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products were verified by sequence zzso Southern zzso analysis using internal zzso directed to specific primer pairs for zzso and zzso respectively, further confirmed the authenticity of the zzso zzso zzso cells expressed zzso and zzso in association with the nucleus and zzso in the zzso That the zzso zzso correlated with the presence of the zzso zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso The differential zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso lends a new aspect to the zzso zzso system wherein zzso stabilization, possibly through zzso zzso may play a zzso role in the maintenance of cellular zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso in human lens zzso cells suggests that zzso plays a role in the physiology of the zzso The comparative nuclear and zzso distribution of zzso and zzso raises the interesting probability that the two zzso dependent upon zzso zzso may have differential zzso potential, and by zzso disparity in their mechanisms of zzso
