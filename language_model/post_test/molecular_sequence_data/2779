A zzso protein for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from culture fluid of the human lung giant cell zzso zzso cells to zzso homogeneous form through five sequential zzso steps: zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso The molecular mass was determined as approximately 10 zzso by zzso and zzso point was zzso The zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso more potent than that of zzso (5 X zzso zzso and comparable with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso acid composition of zzso strongly suggest that it may be closely related to the putative protein zzso by the zzso clone zzso and almost identical with a part of sequence of the zzso factor derived from zzso human zzso in the 6th to zzso but not the zzso 5 zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso cells produce zzso without any added stimulant and suggest that the previously isolated zzso zzso may zzso to zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso
