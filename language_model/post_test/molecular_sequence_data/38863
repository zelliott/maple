An essential step of zzso zzso assembly is the interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso to form the zzso zzso While the zzso protein zzso appears to play an important role for zzso formation in zzso little is known about the interactions that connect the two zzso particles in human zzso Here, we describe the molecular zzso of a zzso protein form zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibits a significant degree of overall zzso with the zzso zzso including the conservation of multiple zzso zzso repeats zzso making this the likely functional zzso of zzso However, while the zzso zzso is considered to be a zzso zzso the human zzso protein was found to be tightly associated with zzso 20 S zzso zzso This association appears to be primarily due to zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso directed against the zzso zzso elements of the zzso protein specifically and exclusively zzso free zzso zzso but not zzso zzso from zzso nuclear zzso suggesting that the zzso region of the zzso protein is covered by zzso or zzso zzso Since proteins containing zzso elements are typically involved in multiple zzso zzso we suggest that the zzso protein interacts within the zzso with both the zzso and zzso zzso thus bridging the two zzso zzso with this idea, we show that in zzso translated zzso protein binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso which contain, in addition to the zzso zzso all known zzso zzso
