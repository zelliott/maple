A highly efficient, zzso and reliable zzso method for distinguishing zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso complementary to positions in the zzso zzso gene have been zzso zzso analysis with extracted DNA or with cells of different zzso zzso strains resulted in specific zzso The length zzso of the zzso fragments allowed a clear distinction of the zzso zzso zzso The amplified zzso length zzso with the zzso and the restriction zzso length zzso of the amplified products agreed perfectly with the identification based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from cheese starters were investigated by this method, and amplified fragments of genetic zzso were found to be approximately 40 zzso shorter than the typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
