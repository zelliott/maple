To determine the spectrum of zzso gene zzso in Brazilian patients with primary zzso glaucoma, and to correlate the presence of zzso in the zzso gene sequence with clinical aspects of the zzso 

Thirty zzso patients with primary zzso glaucoma were zzso zzso analysis consisted of the zzso region sequencing zzso 2 and 3) and zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso were present in 9 zzso of the 30 zzso The structural changes in the zzso gene previously described in the literature and observed in our study were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three new zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patients carrying zzso gene zzso needed more surgical procedures to control zzso pressure, either when both eyes were evaluated zzso or when the worst eye of the patient was analyzed zzso In relation to the number of affected eyes, all patients with zzso zzso developed bilateral glaucoma, whereas zzso patients without zzso in the zzso gene had bilateral glaucoma zzso 

In this group of primary zzso glaucoma patients, a zzso zzso frequency in the zzso gene was zzso The presence of zzso was associated with a more severe form of the disease, requiring more surgeries for zzso pressure control and with a higher rate of bilateral zzso
