Several zzso box gene lineages involved in flower development have undergone zzso that correlate with the diversification of large groups of flowering zzso In the zzso gene zzso a major zzso zzso with the origin of the core zzso resulting in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function zzso in specifying floral zzso identity but function independently in zzso and zzso identity zzso and in proper fruit development and zzso zzso Many of these functions are largely zzso in other core zzso zzso and zzso zzso but notably, the role of zzso as an zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene is thought to be zzso zzso zzso how functional divergence of the core zzso zzso occurred requires a careful examination of the function of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso gene zzso we show that zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and California zzso zzso zzso function in zzso zzso growth and in floral zzso and zzso identity and that they also play a key role in fruit zzso Interestingly, in zzso zzso these genes also control flowering time and zzso identity, suggesting that zzso zzso might have been independently recruited in zzso zzso Because the zzso gene functional repertoire encompasses all roles previously described for the core zzso zzso and zzso zzso we zzso zzso as the functional outcome after the major zzso gene lineage zzso zzso
