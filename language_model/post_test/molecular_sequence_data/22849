The zzso protein zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso to daughter cells by zzso them to zzso zzso thus ensuring equal distribution and retention of viral zzso To date, only the zzso zzso protein has been shown to bind to zzso zzso We assessed the zzso of 13 different animal and human zzso proteins from seven zzso zzso and we show that most of them are zzso bound to zzso throughout zzso Furthermore, in contrast to the random association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso several of these proteins appear to bind to more specific regions of zzso zzso Using human zzso zzso type 8 zzso we show that this region is adjacent to zzso zzso zzso proteins from both zzso and animal zzso bind to zzso zzso and there are variations in the specificity of this zzso Only the zzso zzso proteins do not zzso associate with zzso zzso throughout zzso These proteins closely associate with zzso zzso and bind to zzso in zzso but not in zzso However, extraction of zzso cells before fixation results in zzso proteins binding to the zzso region of zzso zzso as observed for zzso zzso We zzso that this is the authentic target of these zzso proteins but that additional factors or a specialized cellular environment is required to stabilize this zzso Thus, zzso zzso of viral zzso to zzso zzso is a common strategy of zzso but different viruses have evolved different variations of this zzso
