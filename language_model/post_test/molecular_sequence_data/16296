We have investigated the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter using nuclear extracts prepared from zzso zzso zzso analysis of deletion zzso reveals the presence of multiple zzso elements located both upstream and downstream of the start zzso One of the elements appears to mediate negative regulation, since deletion of this element results in higher levels of zzso Several factors that interact with these control elements have been detected and zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically recognizes the consensus sequence zzso that is reiterated four times within an upstream zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso DNA affinity zzso and identified as a zzso of approximately 50 zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso from the zzso zzso promoter 7- to zzso in a binding zzso zzso
