The Caribbean reef sponge zzso zzso was previously found to contain substantial quantities of zzso zzso and zzso microbes in its zzso but the identities of these zzso and their method of transfer from adult to progeny are largely zzso In this study, both a zzso zzso zzso zzso technique zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and clone library analysis were applied to compare the bacterial communities associated with adults and zzso of zzso zzso to test the hypothesis of vertical transfer across zzso In addition, the same techniques were applied to the bacterial community from the seawater adjacent to adult sponges to test the hypothesis that water column bacteria could be transferred zzso as sponge zzso zzso of both zzso and clone library analysis support the vertical transfer hypothesis in that the bacterial communities associated with sponge adults and zzso were highly similar to each other but completely different from those in the surrounding zzso zzso of prominent zzso bands and of clones from the libraries revealed that the bacterial communities associated with the zzso whether adult or zzso consisted of a large proportion of bacteria in the zzso zzso and zzso while most of the sequences recovered from the community in the adjacent water column belonged to the class zzso Altogether, 21 zzso sequence zzso zzso sequences from both sponge adults and zzso but not from the seawater, were zzso More than half of the zzso sequences fell into these zzso zzso of sequences recovered in this study with those deposited in zzso revealed that more than zzso of zzso zzso sequences were closely related to sequences derived from other sponge species, but none of the sequences recovered from the seawater column overlapped with those from adults or zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, there is strong evidence that a dominant proportion of zzso bacteria present in the zzso of zzso zzso are maintained through vertical transfer during zzso rather than through acquisition from the environment zzso zzso
