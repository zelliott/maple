A novel zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso to zzso zzso factor, zzso was isolated from pepper leaves infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two distinct zzso zzso zzso and B3 uniquely found in higher zzso zzso expression analysis of the zzso fusion construct in zzso zzso and pepper zzso cells revealed the zzso protein to be localized in the zzso The zzso region of zzso fused to the zzso zzso domain was required to activate zzso of reporter genes in zzso In zzso zzso the recognition of zzso and zzso motifs also were essential for the zzso protein to bind to a specific target gene and activate the reporter zzso The expression of the zzso gene was strongly induced early in pepper leaves during the pathogen infection, zzso zzso and environmental zzso zzso transcripts were localized in the zzso cells of leaf zzso during pathogen infection and zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene in transgenic zzso plants induced some zzso genes and enhanced resistance against infection by zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso and zzso stresses by high zzso and zzso The zzso promoter zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso salicylic acid and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso triggering resistance to bacterial infection and tolerance to zzso zzso
