The zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso A to zzso zzso The putative zzso gene of zzso zzso which had been zzso as part of the Genome Project, was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso We confirmed that the gene encodes zzso by measuring the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in complete loss of the zzso activity, indicating that zzso zzso contains only one kind of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso fusion was induced in the presence of excess zzso in the growth zzso and the intact zzso gene was required for this zzso The zzso start site of the zzso gene was located at 37 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso and a zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso a zzso element that is responsible for the zzso repression of a number of carbon zzso genes in zzso zzso was identified upstream of the tentative promoter zzso zzso involving zzso zzso showed that the zzso sequence is involved in zzso zzso zzso
