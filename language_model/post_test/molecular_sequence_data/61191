The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is specifically expressed in a zzso subset of neural zzso zzso In attempts to zzso the regulatory DNA element of the zzso zzso we zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso The zzso initiation site was determined at 297 zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso A zzso acid response element was located on the region between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso sequences fused to the zzso gene showed that the region between zzso and zzso was crucial for the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, nuclear proteins extracted from neural zzso cells such as zzso and human zzso cells bind to the DNA region between zzso and zzso This DNA element was also zzso in the zzso region of the human zzso zzso Our observations strongly suggest that the DNA element (between zzso and zzso contributes to zzso expression of the zzso gene in zzso and human zzso
