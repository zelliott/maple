zzso recruitment to inflammatory sites is zzso by two related zzso zzso zzso receptors 1 zzso and 2 zzso Both receptors share two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas several zzso including growth related zzso alpha zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso are specific for zzso The objective of this study was to map the different zzso acids involved in the binding and zzso of human zzso This was performed by exchanging zzso zzso acids of zzso with their counterparts in zzso The zzso generated showed that: zzso for zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the second zzso loop of zzso are zzso the zzso of zzso is not sufficient and the zzso domain seven is probably zzso zzso for zzso the zzso of zzso is necessary but not sufficient for zzso The zzso study indicated that zzso acids critical for zzso are not necessarily involved in binding zzso Finally, the mechanism of binding of a zzso zzso on zzso was zzso it occurred through zzso zzso which were zzso within the zzso zzso which differed according to the use of zzso or zzso as a competitor and zzso which did not necessarily overlap with zzso binding zzso We also showed that zzso of binding and zzso of zzso involved different zzso zzso
