In response to specific zzso such as a heat pulse or the sequence of zzso each isolated cell zzso and zzso that has been studied characteristically alters gene expression to zzso a set of proteins zzso zzso that are important for zzso zzso To determine whether a corresponding response occurs within zzso cells in zzso when subjected to the complex stress of circulatory zzso liver biopsy specimens were obtained from a zzso model of zzso shock before and after zzso With use of complementary DNA prepared from zzso zzso zzso a library was constructed and screened for differential gene zzso Of zzso clones initially screened as positive for induction after zzso six were confirmed positive by Northern zzso zzso The zzso sequences of two of these six have been determined, and one has been zzso identified as zzso
