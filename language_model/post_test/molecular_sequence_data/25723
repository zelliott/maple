Eight zzso of human zzso growth factor zzso having specific zzso acid zzso in the zzso structure zzso zzso of the zzso domain were generated by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso for each of these zzso zzso zzso was measured by both zzso competition binding and zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso The relative binding affinities obtained by these two methods were generally in agreement for each zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso on the exposed surface of the zzso structure of the zzso domain of zzso have an important role in the formation of the active zzso zzso The substitution of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in decreased binding zzso with the most severe reductions observed with the last two zzso The zzso zzso and zzso introduced zzso acid zzso resulting in slightly increased zzso binding zzso Similar to previous results with zzso zzso in this region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stevens, zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of the positive charge in the zzso substitution had almost no effect on binding zzso indicating the lack of any absolute requirement for zzso interactions at this zzso zzso of zzso which resulted in decreased zzso binding zzso provides further indication of the importance of aromatic zzso in this region of the zzso as found earlier with zzso zzso reference zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
