zzso zzso zzso channels are known to play important roles in various cellular functions, but the direct consequences of disruption of zzso channel function are largely zzso We have generated transgenic mice expressing a zzso form of the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso with zzso at position zzso in pancreatic beta zzso zzso transgenic mice develop zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso with zzso and decreased beta cell population in zzso zzso channel function is found to be impaired in the beta cells of transgenic mice with zzso In addition, both resting membrane potential and zzso calcium zzso are shown to be significantly elevated in the beta cells of transgenic zzso We also found a high frequency of zzso beta cells before the appearance of zzso in the transgenic mice, suggesting that the zzso channel might play a significant role in beta cell survival in addition to its role in the regulation of insulin zzso
