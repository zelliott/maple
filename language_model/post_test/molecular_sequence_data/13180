zzso primary cultures from rat zzso at different zzso stages were used to study the effect of basic zzso growth factor zzso on zzso zzso and zzso three zzso genes expressed in different regions of the developing zzso zzso At embryonic day zzso the regional pattern of expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is maintained in primary culture, suggesting that cells are already committed to a regional identity at this zzso In these cultures, zzso is expressed by precursor cells, whereas zzso and zzso are predominantly expressed by zzso zzso We found that zzso increased zzso expression within precursor cells and the total number of zzso zzso This effect was zzso zzso and temporally zzso with larger effects at earlier stages of development zzso At zzso the effect of zzso on zzso expression was restricted to the zzso zzso Our results suggest that a restricted population of zzso respond to zzso in a temporally regulated fashion by zzso and increasing zzso zzso This interaction between zzso and zzso may be important for the regulation of zzso in the zzso
