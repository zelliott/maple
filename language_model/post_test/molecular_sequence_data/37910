A growing number of medical research teams have begun to explore the experimental advantages of using a genetic animal model, the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a view to enhancing our understanding of genes underlying human zzso zzso In this study, we have compared sequences of zzso cloned human disease genes with the zzso database of predicted zzso Drawing on examples from spinal muscular zzso zzso kidney disease, muscular zzso and Alzheimer's disease, we illustrate how data from zzso can yield new insights into the function and interactions of human disease zzso
