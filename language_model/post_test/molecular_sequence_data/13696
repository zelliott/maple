To identify the zzso termination elements in the mouse zzso zzso we examined zzso transcripts after stable zzso of zzso expression plasmids into the zzso cell zzso The zzso region at the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso gene acted as a zzso zzso When the zzso unit was deleted from its site, the effect of termination zzso Further experiment, using serial deletion zzso revealed that the zzso zzso upstream region from the zzso unit also participated in zzso zzso We propose that the upstream region of the zzso unit might be recognized as a pause site by the zzso zzso II, and an abnormal DNA structure, derived from the zzso unit, might function as a zzso of zzso zzso
