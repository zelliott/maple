zzso zzso is a zzso diverse zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso that are responsible for localized and zzso life-threatening opportunistic infections in zzso and severely zzso patients, zzso Although members of this complex were isolated from patients during a zzso in San Antonio, zzso and from patients and the water system in a Houston, zzso hospital during the 1990s, little is known about their genetic zzso and population zzso This study was conducted to investigate the global genetic diversity and population biology of a comprehensive set of clinically important members of the zzso zzso complex, focusing on the 33 zzso from patients at the San Antonio hospital and on strains isolated in the United States from the water systems of geographically distant hospitals in Texas, Maryland, and Washington, which were suspected as reservoirs of zzso zzso In all, 18 environmental zzso and 88 zzso from patients spanning four zzso were zzso The major finding of this study, based on zzso results from zzso analyses of zzso DNA sequence data and amplified zzso length zzso is that a recently zzso geographically widespread zzso lineage is responsible for over zzso of all clinical zzso investigated, including all of those associated with the zzso in San zzso Moreover, strains of the zzso lineage recovered from patients were zzso shown to genetically match those isolated from the hospital water systems of three zzso hospitals, providing support for the hypothesis that hospitals may serve as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso
