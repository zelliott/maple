We have investigated whether the presence of a DNA repair zzso zzso zzso affects the nature of spontaneous zzso in a zzso cell zzso We compared spontaneous zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene of a Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell line that expressed 14,000 zzso zzso with those in the parental zzso cells lacking this DNA repair zzso The zzso zzso of the two zzso cell lines did not differ zzso However, DNA sequence analysis of spontaneous zzso in the zzso zzso cell line revealed a complex zzso No significant difference from the parental zzso cells was found in the number or type of zzso zzso multiple zzso or zzso The frequency of zzso to zzso zzso was elevated in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso considerably reduced zzso to zzso transitions zzso versus zzso This latter result is the first evidence that this protein is active on an zzso source of zzso that is normally responsible for spontaneous zzso to zzso transition zzso
