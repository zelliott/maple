The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso at the zzso in zzso zzso In this work, the zzso response of zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso by DNA zzso We found 26 genes to be significantly zzso Most of these zzso membrane proteins of unknown function and the zzso system zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso zzso zzso the response of zzso zzso to zzso None of the genes zzso in zzso zzso zzso were induced by zzso in zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the promoter regions of the zzso genes revealed a novel zzso 16 zzso zzso sequence at positions zzso or zzso relative to the putative zzso start zzso Point zzso and deletion of this zzso box abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts in zzso mobility shift zzso with several promoters carrying the zzso zzso The zzso box is also present in other zzso zzso upstream of genes involved in cell envelope zzso zzso was strongly induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and disruption of zzso increased zzso to these zzso We propose here that zzso of zzso zzso controls the immediate response to cell envelope stress in this zzso
