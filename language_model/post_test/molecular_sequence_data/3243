Resistance to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is primarily due to the amplification and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the most common resistance zzso In both resistant and susceptible mosquitoes the zzso and zzso genes are oriented in a head-to-head arrangement, the zzso sequences containing promoter elements for the divergent zzso of both zzso zzso zzso of zzso reporter gene zzso into a zzso zzso cell line was used to study these zzso A control zzso was constructed with the strong zzso zzso zzso promoter driving expression of zzso The zzso promoters from both zzso resistant and zzso insects were highly active in directing zzso zzso zzso with panels of deletions revealed several regions where binding sites for positive and negative regulatory elements are located, and candidate zzso factor sites have been zzso zzso shift zzso have identified one zzso interaction that is stronger with the resistant than with the equivalent but slightly altered susceptible zzso The zzso zzso site zzso zzso upstream of the zzso in both zzso promoters is essential for zzso zzso but a putative zzso box is not zzso
