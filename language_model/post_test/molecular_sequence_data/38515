In nature, genetic variation usually takes the form of a continuous zzso range rather than discrete zzso The genetic variation underlying quantitative traits results from the segregation of numerous interacting quantitative trait zzso zzso whose expression is modified by the zzso To uncover the molecular basis of this variation, we characterized a zzso zzso derived from the zzso tomato species zzso zzso The zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso contents in cultivated tomato fruits in various genetic backgrounds and zzso Using nearly zzso lines for the zzso high-resolution mapping analysis zzso zzso to a single zzso zzso zzso hotspot of 484 zzso spanning an zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the differences between the zzso zzso of the two species are associated with a zzso zzso element that zzso sink strength of tomato zzso Our results demonstrate a link between naturally occurring DNA variation and a zzso zzso of a complex zzso for a zzso zzso
