The tumor zzso zzso gene is one of the most frequently zzso in different types of human zzso Particularly in zzso cancer zzso it is believed that zzso zzso play a role in the zzso transition of tumors during pathological zzso In order to analyze zzso expressed zzso in zzso we examined zzso zzso in tumor samples from 101 patients with sporadic zzso zzso were divided in two groups defined according to whether they exhibit positive or negative zzso protein expression as detected by zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso was a common event in tumors with an overall frequency of zzso By direct sequencing, we report 42 different zzso sequence changes in 55 zzso patients, being two of them validated zzso zzso zzso were more frequent in positive than in negative zzso detection group zzso being the precise figures zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso profiles were also different between the two groups of zzso while most of the zzso detected in zzso positive group were zzso zzso out of zzso changes in zzso negative detection group include 7 zzso 6 zzso 2 nonsense and 1 silent zzso As previously observed, most zzso were concentrated in regions zzso zzso DNA binding domain zzso zzso zzso 248 and 273 together account for zzso of point zzso in agreement with previous observations provided that these zzso are considered zzso zzso Interestingly, we detected two new deletions and two new zzso In addition, in three samples we detected two deletions and one zzso that could be explained as putative zzso zzso or zzso zzso
