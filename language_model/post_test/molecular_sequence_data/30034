zzso and zzso the structural genes zzso the large zzso and small zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were placed under the control of the zzso promoter by creating an artificial zzso The zzso gene was fused next to the promoter, followed by a 14 base pair zzso sequence containing a translation zzso site in front of the zzso coding zzso The engineered zzso has 16 zzso zzso acids from zzso fused to the beta zzso However, the zzso protein shows a zzso value for zzso that is indistinguishable from that of the the native zzso The product of the zzso zzso is not able to complement zzso zzso coli zzso indicating the lack of zzso zzso in zzso We made a deletion in the zzso gene that removed about 150 zzso terminal zzso of the beta zzso The truncated protein showed intact zzso exchange, whereas zzso zzso was zzso This result is similar to that of limited zzso performed on the native zzso that yielded a zzso alpha 2 zzso structure, able to form zzso but unable to bind zzso A deletion of 50 zzso acids from the zzso zzso of the beta chain resulted in the loss of both zzso activities; this suggests the participation of the zzso end of the beta zzso in the active site or in zzso assembly to yield a zzso functional zzso
