An essential step in the zzso by which growth factors trigger cellular proliferation is the induction of high levels of protein zzso This appears in part to be controlled by multiple zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso 4, zzso The main zzso responsible, zzso zzso zzso is activated through the zzso of four sites clustered in a putative zzso domain, which is zzso by a zzso zzso distinct from those used by other well characterized zzso zzso zzso (such as zzso or zzso zzso 10, zzso Here we investigate the role of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso rat zzso zzso with any of three distinct zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso entry into S phase of the cell zzso This effect is preceded by almost complete zzso of the zzso of protein synthesis and the expression of an essential immediate early gene product, zzso The zzso effect on DNA synthesis is also zzso by zzso of the zzso late in zzso phase, consistent with the finding that zzso activity remains high throughout zzso
