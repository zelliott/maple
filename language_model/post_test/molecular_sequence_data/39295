Two groups of previously unknown zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso bacteria, which zzso and zzso displayed a close association with the recently described species zzso zzso were characterized using zzso and molecular zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene sequence divergence of approximately 3 % between the two unknown bacteria and zzso zzso as well as distinguishable zzso zzso demonstrates that these organisms are zzso and zzso distinct and that each group represents a previously unknown zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies further confirmed the zzso of the unidentified bacteria and zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso and zzso findings, two novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso their DNA zzso contents are 58 and 56 zzso zzso
