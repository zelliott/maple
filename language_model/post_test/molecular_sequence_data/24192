In order to identify genes induced during the water stress response in zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression zzso zzso zzso was performed using mixed zzso prepared from zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso as testers and zzso from zzso zzso zzso as zzso A forward zzso zzso library was constructed, from which 960 zzso colonies were picked and zzso Through differential screening of the zzso zzso library, zzso clones were identified as water stress zzso After sequencing, 190 unique expressed sequence tags zzso were obtained by zzso and blast analysis, which included transcripts that had previously been reported as responsive to stress as well as some functionally unknown zzso The zzso with significant protein zzso were sorted into 13 functional zzso A zzso zzso containing the 190 unique zzso was used to analyze their expression profiles in zzso zzso during both zzso treatment and natural zzso The results indicated that 67 zzso in leaves and 113 zzso in roots were significantly zzso by zzso 123 zzso were found to be zzso for at least one zzso point in either zzso leaves or zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso by drought zzso zzso from the zzso cluster analysis suggest that the leaves and roots of zzso zzso had different expression profiles after zzso treatment and that there was a lot of overlap between zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso A set of transcripts has been identified, which have significantly increased expression and probably involved in water stress signaling zzso based on data zzso
