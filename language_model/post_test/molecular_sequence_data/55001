zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kentucky zzso and zzso zzso cultured from individuals were investigated for the presence of zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso 

zzso markers and zzso within the zzso zzso regions of the target genes were investigated by zzso followed by DNA zzso zzso zzso profiling and targeted zzso were performed to demonstrate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso was identified that carried a zzso resistance marker and this was completely zzso 

A zzso zzso isolate carried a zzso gene associated with an zzso zzso group zzso zzso of zzso zzso which was designated zzso The latter zzso resistance to zzso and zzso acid and showed sequence similarity in its core region to zzso zzso whilst the zzso region was similar to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and contained an zzso zzso a complete zzso structure, a truncated zzso element and a zzso marker, followed by zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was identified immediately downstream of the zzso zzso 

This is the first known report of a zzso gene in zzso zzso in zzso Analysis of the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso showed a novel arrangement of this zzso zzso zzso
