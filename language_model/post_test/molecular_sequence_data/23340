The development of freshwater zzso zzso at zzso zzso occurs both in zzso waters and under conditions of high zzso zzso However, the influence of zzso zzso rates on bacterial zzso diversity is poorly zzso We hypothesized that different zzso rates would significantly influence zzso diversity and alter the relative proportions of zzso and zzso community zzso In order to study this hypothesis, freshwater zzso were developed at five zzso rates zzso to zzso zzso in a rotating concentric cylinder reactor fed with zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity was assessed by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso Fifty zzso distinct zzso strains and 16 zzso strains were isolated by zzso and identified by partial zzso zzso gene sequencing, and their zzso was determined by the construction of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed an inverse relationship between zzso rate and bacterial zzso An in zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the relative proportions of zzso and zzso species from each zzso The highest proportion of zzso bacteria was present at high zzso rates zzso to zzso zzso The intermediate zzso rate zzso zzso selected for the highest proportion of zzso bacteria zzso or 17 of a possible 36 zzso zzso Under zzso conditions zzso zzso 41 zzso of a possible 125 zzso interactions were zzso Few zzso zzso or zzso zzso interactions occurred between the 16 zzso zzso In conclusion, these data show that zzso rates affect zzso diversity as well as the relative proportions of zzso zzso
