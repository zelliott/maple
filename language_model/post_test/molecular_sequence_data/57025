A cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 together with the anonymous DNA marker zzso was mapped using zzso gel zzso to a zzso region of zzso zzso The physical proximity of these markers was subsequently confirmed using two zzso zzso and their relative order was established as zzso zzso The pattern of marker representation in a panel of zzso zzso 11 hybrids suggests that the zzso zzso cluster is zzso with zzso closest to the zzso
