zzso is a zzso zzso which processes a wide range of zzso zzso zzso is concentrated in the zzso network zzso where zzso zzso of many precursor proteins takes zzso A significant fraction of zzso however, cycles among the zzso the plasma zzso and zzso indicating that the zzso in the zzso reflects a dynamic zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso and two signals are responsible for retrieval of zzso to the zzso A zzso zzso motif mediates zzso of zzso from the cell surface into zzso An zzso cluster that is part of two zzso zzso II zzso sites zzso is then responsible for retrieval of zzso from zzso to the zzso In addition, the zzso zzso sequence also mediates zzso zzso Here, we analyzed the sorting of zzso in polarized zzso zzso We show that zzso is delivered to the zzso surface of zzso cells, from where a significant fraction of the protein can return to the zzso A zzso motif together with the zzso zzso cluster is required for zzso sorting and constitutes a novel signal regulating zzso traffic of zzso
