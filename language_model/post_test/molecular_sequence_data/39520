Analysis of zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso fly larvae zzso zzso zzso identified a set of diverse zzso that zzso proteins with a relatively high percentage (over zzso of zzso zzso zzso comparison of these putative proteins with known sequences in zzso revealed that the positions of the zzso zzso in the identified proteins were highly zzso within a family of zzso zzso despite very little overall sequence zzso zzso analysis sorted this set of zzso into five different zzso To determine if these zzso indeed zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were generated with two zzso from two different zzso zzso analysis of the zzso proteins against commercial and insect gut zzso demonstrated that the zzso proteins are strong zzso zzso with different zzso Northern zzso and real-time zzso analysis revealed that the different genes were expressed at different zzso stages and in different zzso The overall results indicated that zzso zzso contains a complex of genes that code for zzso zzso which may regulate zzso activities in different regulatory zzso The zzso zzso numbers for the zzso in this paper were zzso to zzso
