The sugar chains of zzso samples zzso from zzso of patients with zzso arthritis zzso contain many fewer zzso zzso than those from zzso of healthy zzso zzso studies revealed that the low zzso content in the zzso of zzso patients results from the reduced activity in the B cells of a zzso zzso zzso which zzso transfers zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso by zzso human B cell zzso However, no difference in the zzso activities toward these two zzso was detected between the B cells from zzso patients and from zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso kinetic studies revealed that an affinity of the zzso in the B cells from zzso patients was lowered for zzso but not for zzso while the affinities for zzso and zzso of the zzso were not changed between the B cells from zzso patients and from zzso patients and healthy individuals in accordance with their zzso zzso The results indicated that the reduced zzso activity toward zzso in the B cells from zzso patients can be ascribed to the lowered affinity for zzso
