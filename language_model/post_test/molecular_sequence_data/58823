Several peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso have been tested as zzso for zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso 3 can modify zzso or zzso followed by zzso In other cases, a zzso in position zzso is required for the zzso of zzso zzso A third type of zzso can be modified by zzso 3 in the presence of zzso The comparison of zzso 3 with other zzso suggests some similar features of this zzso with zzso protein zzso such as zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and also with zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Thus, all these zzso are specifically inhibited by zzso zzso However, zzso is an inhibitor of zzso 2 whereas it activates the modification of certain zzso by zzso zzso A possible explanation for the obtained results is that the consensus sequence for zzso 3 zzso is a zzso adjacent to a zzso or other zzso former zzso and that such recognition could be zzso by the presence of adjacent negative charges or the addition of zzso
