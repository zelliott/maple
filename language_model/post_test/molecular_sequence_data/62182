The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso the zzso are thought to play a role in the regulation of cell zzso and migration during development by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso that sends a forward signal through the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso residing on another zzso The reverse signal is zzso into the zzso cell via zzso zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous work from our laboratory has implicated the activated zzso zzso growth factor zzso 1) as a regulator of a zzso signal that results from zzso of zzso In the present study, we report the isolation of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso and we show that when expressed in zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in the presence of an activated zzso zzso acid zzso were generated in zzso and the resulting zzso were expressed along with zzso and an activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso motif within the zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso zzso is vital for this zzso interaction with zzso More importantly, using deletion and substitution analysis we identify the zzso zzso at position zzso of zzso as being required for the physical interaction with zzso whereas zzso and zzso are zzso Moreover, we show that the region between zzso acids 301 and 304 of zzso is also required for this critical zzso zzso
