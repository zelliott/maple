The zzso acid sequence of zzso a membrane zzso of the zzso zzso of the rat zzso apparatus, is more than zzso identical with zzso a zzso growth factor zzso binding protein of chicken zzso and with zzso a zzso for zzso of plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso zzso from rat brain zzso binds to basic zzso The gene for zzso has been assigned to human zzso zzso To characterize this protein further in the human, its zzso was cloned and zzso The protein has a large zzso domain composed of an initial zzso segment, zzso by an uninterrupted zzso sequence of several zzso zzso Expansion of zzso repeats has been implicated in the zzso of several neurodegenerative zzso The zzso segment is followed by 16 zzso repeats that contain five potential zzso zzso sites, which are zzso in the human, zzso zzso and zzso The large zzso domain of the protein is followed by a single zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso tail, which is identical to that in the chicken, zzso and zzso The overall zzso acid identifies between zzso zzso and zzso range from zzso to zzso In several human fetal and adult zzso three zzso transcripts for zzso of 10 zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso were identified by Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso These transcripts may represent alternatively spliced zzso of the protein or zzso zzso closely related proteins of the zzso apparatus and/or plasma zzso
