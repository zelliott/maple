The zzso spore coat of zzso zzso is composed of three major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The spore coat proteins are zzso zzso in zzso cells shortly after zzso stored in zzso zzso during the zzso stage, and zzso during zzso of zzso We have zzso various portions of the upstream region of zzso to zzso such that a protein consisting of the first nine zzso acids of zzso fused to zzso is zzso in zzso zzso Individual cells that accumulate the zzso can be observed in zzso during early zzso due to the sensitivity of the zzso We have found that zzso cells first appear in a random distribution throughout the zzso with no indication of spatial zzso They subsequently sort out from zzso cells that form a tip on the zzso The zzso regulatory region was subdivided into a zzso and a zzso region, each of which could independently direct proper zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity directed by these two regions appears to be additive in the full-length regulatory zzso The zzso region was shown to be complex in that removal of certain portions partially reduced zzso activity while removal of other portions abolished all zzso Nevertheless, cells transformed with zzso showing attenuated activity expressed the fusion gene at the proper time in development and the activity was localized to zzso zzso The zzso regions responsible for all aspects of zzso regulation appear to be closely opposed within the minimal essential sequence of the zzso zzso
