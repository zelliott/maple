The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was fused to the protein A gene in the zzso zzso zzso coli cells containing this zzso produce a fusion protein with both zzso binding and zzso activities after heat zzso The zzso gene was zzso and the hybrid protein was zzso to zzso in high zzso The zzso protein was shown to have almost identical zzso characteristics to pure zzso This result leads to the conclusion that a free zzso of the zzso is not required for biological zzso The hybrid protein of protein A and zzso was used as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The experiments presented demonstrate that the zzso is a suitable fusion partner in various diagnostic applications where an unique biological activity is zzso
