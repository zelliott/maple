zzso zzso zzso can zzso a broad range of aromatic zzso as sulfur sources for growth in zzso minimal zzso The zzso are zzso zzso to yield the corresponding zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso which were no longer able to zzso zzso were isolated and were found to carry zzso insertions in the zzso zzso which contained genes for an zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso closely related to the zzso coli zzso and a protein related to zzso zzso proteins zzso These zzso were also deficient in growth with a variety of other zzso sources, including aromatic and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso other than the natural zzso zzso and zzso This zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso confirming its key role in zzso metabolism in this zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene product was required for growth with all of the tested zzso except zzso and that the zzso zzso by zzso was required for growth with zzso or zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not required for growth with zzso zzso or zzso but was needed for growth with zzso suggesting that an alternative zzso exists for the former compounds that is not active in transformation of the latter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by an zzso and not by an zzso as in the related species zzso zzso
