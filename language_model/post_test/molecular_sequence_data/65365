zzso in nuclear genes involved in zzso DNA zzso maintenance cause a wide range of clinical zzso associated with the secondary zzso of multiple zzso deletions in affected zzso The majority of families with zzso dominant progressive external zzso zzso zzso zzso in genes zzso one of three zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso zzso in zzso leads to multiple zzso deletions in skeletal muscle and a mosaic zzso of zzso c zzso zzso The disorder presented with visual failure and zzso zzso in childhood, followed by zzso zzso deafness and a zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso skeletal muscle zzso contained zzso levels of multiple zzso zzso and genetic linkage, sequencing and expression analysis excluded zzso zzso and zzso the gene zzso zzso 1, as the zzso This demonstrates the importance of zzso in zzso zzso and implicates zzso in diseases associated with secondary defects of zzso
