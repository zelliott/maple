The zzso zzso band 3, is a ubiquitous zzso It is present in brain and all other zzso zzso Not only is band 3 present in cell zzso but also in zzso zzso and zzso zzso There are four zzso of band 3, the zzso zzso zzso zzso thus far zzso They are products of different zzso zzso are reported to contain zzso but not zzso We hypothesized that induction or zzso of zzso occurs when zzso are transformed as an initial event in the path to zzso We transformed zzso containing a single base zzso with Epstein zzso zzso zzso The zzso of band 3, high transport band 3 zzso exhibits zzso transport that is 2-3 times normal in zzso which contain zzso This facilitated our identification of zzso since the probability that 2 different gene products would have the same zzso approaches zzso Thus, we have a base zzso in addition to linear sequence to identify zzso A 133 base pair zzso zzso including the affected region was amplified from the zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to generate zzso which was zzso The sequence of the crucial 133 base pair segment from high transport zzso was zzso identical to the sequence published for the red blood cell band 3 of the same zzso As reported previously for zzso this zzso is a zzso base change which changes a zzso to zzso in the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from normal and zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso was zzso for the zzso and showed the father to be zzso zzso transport was increased in zzso zzso transformed zzso as was the case with zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso by zzso Thus, zzso transformed zzso express the zzso band 3 zzso in addition to zzso
