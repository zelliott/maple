Using a novel technique designed to identify genes of zzso zzso which carry zzso we have cloned two genes zzso zzso protein zzso Although the genes differ by 15 zzso within their coding regions, they are predicted to zzso identical proteins of 145 zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso contains significant zzso to zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso and to zzso protein zzso of several zzso suggesting a relationship to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that regions of zzso especially those implicated in the accuracy of translation, have been zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Either zzso or zzso alone can support growth, but zzso disruption of both genes zzso the ability to zzso zzso harboring a disruption of both genes cannot survive without an intact gene on a zzso zzso maps to the right arm of zzso zzso and zzso to the right arm of zzso zzso
