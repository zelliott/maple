The construction of six deletion zzso of zzso zzso and their basic zzso characterization are zzso Open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the left arm of zzso IV were deleted using a zzso chain reaction zzso disruption technique, introducing the zzso resistance marker into the respective zzso Gene replacement zzso zzso for use in other strain backgrounds were cloned by zzso using DNA templates from zzso or zzso deletion zzso and inserted into zzso zzso zzso clones of all six zzso were obtained by gap zzso zzso were carried out in zzso cells and, after zzso yielded four viable spores for clones disrupted in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso disruptions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but underwent only a few divisions before zzso growth, suggesting that the respective genes are essential for zzso growth on zzso complete zzso The other deletion zzso grew like zzso at different temperatures and on different carbon zzso A brief zzso analysis of the six zzso studied in this work is zzso
