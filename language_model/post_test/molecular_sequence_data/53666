We have isolated a novel restriction zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso recognizes the unique zzso zzso and zzso the DNA between zzso N and G in its recognition sequence to generate a zzso 3' zzso Cloning and sequence analysis of the zzso modification gene in strain zzso reveal that zzso has a zzso pair zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso The predicted protein sequence of zzso contains zzso motifs typical of zzso and Western zzso indicates that it is an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid product, that has a zzso overlap with zzso The predicted protein sequence from this zzso matches the zzso acid sequence obtained from zzso zzso indicating that it encodes the zzso The zzso zzso genes are not present in either strain of zzso zzso that has been completely zzso but are found in two of 11 zzso zzso strains zzso The significantly lower G + C content of the zzso zzso genes implies that they have been introduced relatively recently during the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso
