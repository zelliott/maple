zzso of zzso to the origin recognition complex zzso is a key step in the assembly of a zzso complex zzso at origins of DNA zzso zzso recognizes specific origin DNA sequences in an zzso zzso Here we demonstrate cooperative binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso on DNA in an zzso manner, which zzso a change in the pattern of origin binding that requires the zzso zzso The reaction is blocked by specific origin zzso that do not interfere with the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso reconstruction of electron microscopic images shows that the zzso complex forms a zzso structure with dimensions similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure is predicted to contain six zzso zzso analogous to other zzso protein zzso We suggest that zzso and origin DNA activate a molecular switch in zzso that contributes to zzso zzso
