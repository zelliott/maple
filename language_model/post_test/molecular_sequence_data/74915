zzso zzso receptors zzso from muscle bind zzso zzso zzso and are composed of four kinds of zzso whereas zzso from zzso brains do not bind alpha zzso and are composed of two kinds of zzso alpha zzso proteins whose function is unknown are also found in zzso All these proteins belong to the same gene zzso The human zzso cell line zzso expresses a functional zzso which binds alpha zzso Surprisingly, the zzso of this zzso cell line has zzso zzso and zzso properties different from zzso zzso and very similar to muscle zzso The zzso zzso binds alpha zzso but is different from alpha zzso proteins in zzso Here we show that zzso expresses the zzso zzso coding for the muscle zzso thereby proving that zzso expresses a zzso zzso that is not expressed in adult zzso The isolated zzso clones should prove useful for expression of large amounts of human zzso zzso zzso protein for studies of the zzso response to muscle zzso in human zzso zzso
