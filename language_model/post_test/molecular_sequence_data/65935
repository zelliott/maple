Two zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in the zzso of a wide variety of unrelated plants as highly zzso zzso zzso We report the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso a 3 zzso a zzso the zzso from the weed zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso a 3 resembles an zzso fold that is essentially identical with that of the two zzso zzso from birch zzso zzso v 4, and zzso grass zzso zzso p zzso The extensive zzso between zzso a 3 and zzso p 7 is demonstrated by competition experiments with zzso zzso from allergic patients as well as specific zzso zzso zzso acid zzso that are zzso for the two zzso zzso family were identified in multiple sequence alignments of zzso from 15 different zzso Next, the three-dimensional structures of zzso a 3, zzso p 7, and zzso v 4 were used to identify zzso zzso acids with high surface zzso to zzso surface patches as potential targets for the zzso zzso zzso response of allergic zzso The essentially identical three-dimensional structures of zzso a 3, zzso p 7, and zzso v 4 explain the extensive zzso of allergic patients zzso zzso with two zzso zzso from unrelated zzso In addition, analyzing the three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso for zzso and surface exposed zzso acids may be a first approach to mapping the zzso zzso on zzso zzso that are recognized by zzso patient zzso
