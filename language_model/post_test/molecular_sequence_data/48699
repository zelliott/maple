zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso controls a wide range of biological functions by regulating the cellular zzso survival, migration and zzso A growing body of zzso data demonstrated that deregulation of the zzso zzso through genetic modification was observed in various types of zzso However, the extent to which genetic modifications interfere with gene regulation and their involvement in cancer zzso remains largely zzso In this work, we performed in zzso profiling of harmful zzso single zzso zzso zzso in the protein zzso domain of zzso zzso index, zzso independent count score, change in free energy score zzso zzso and zzso indicated that seven zzso were found to be deleterious and may alter the protein function and zzso Furthermore, based on zzso properties, two zzso zzso and zzso were found to be most deleterious in protein zzso domain and taken for further structural zzso zzso study showed a complete loss of binding affinity followed by interference in hydrogen bonding and surrounding zzso due to zzso and zzso zzso In order to zzso the mechanism behind the impact of zzso that can generate a ripple effect throughout the protein structure and ultimately affect the function, in-depth molecular dynamics simulation and principal component analysis were zzso The obtained results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso have a distinct effect on the dynamic zzso of zzso zzso Our strategy may be helpful for understanding zzso effects on proteins with function and their role in human genetic diseases and for the development of novel pharmacological zzso
