zzso zzso and atomic force zzso images of zzso zzso and related proteins that form large pores in zzso zzso have revealed the presence of incomplete rings, or zzso Some evidence indicates that these arcs are inserted into the membrane and induce membrane zzso but other experiments seem to zzso zzso Could such zzso only partially lined by zzso be zzso and zzso zzso How would the lipids be structured in such a zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso as a model, we test the stability of pores only partially lined by zzso using zzso molecular dynamics simulations in zzso and zzso zzso The data show that, whereas pure zzso pores close zzso pores partially lined by zzso arcs are stable for at least 300 zzso Estimates of the zzso stability of these arcs using line tension data and implicit zzso calculations show that these arcs can be marginally stable in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso provide an explanation for the observed zzso selectivity in zzso zzso experiments and could possibly be involved in other membrane zzso processes where lipids are thought to participate, such as those induced by zzso peptides and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso
