In plants, the zzso zzso zzso of the plasma membrane is zzso by a zzso zzso The presence within an organ of several zzso prevents a detailed zzso characterization of individual zzso We therefore used the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso host for the expression of zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso transformed by the plant zzso was still able to grow under conditions where the zzso zzso gene zzso was either zzso or zzso The transformed zzso strain was resistant to zzso and its growth was prevented when the medium pH was lowered to zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso has unusual low zzso for zzso zzso zzso and high pH optimum zzso zzso microscopic examination revealed zzso in internal structures of the zzso type which proliferated when cell growth was arrested, either at a zzso pH or at the stationary phase in a minimal zzso Under the latter conditions, zzso zzso on zzso zzso revealed, in addition to the expected plant zzso peak linked to the plasma membrane zzso low density peak containing zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that the partial internal zzso of zzso occurs in zzso derived from the zzso zzso and largely depends on growth zzso
