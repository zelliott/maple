The unidentified zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso is distributed along zzso zzso outgrowth pathways in chicken zzso To better characterize its role in zzso development, the zzso zzso was zzso from chicken zzso by zzso zzso Its zzso zzso acid sequence corresponded to that predicted for chicken zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso were performed to confirm that zzso was indeed the zzso recognized by zzso First, zzso bound to zzso chicken zzso expressed in zzso zzso Second, a rabbit serum raised to the zzso zzso showed the same zzso pattern in chicken zzso as did zzso Lastly, a novel method for direct detection of nerve growth factor zzso bound to its receptors was used to show that in mixed spinal zzso cultures, only zzso that expressed zzso zzso had zzso binding sites for zzso Furthermore, at the zzso level, zzso labeling was zzso with bound zzso The zzso zzso is thus chicken zzso whose role in zzso outgrowth pathways is zzso
