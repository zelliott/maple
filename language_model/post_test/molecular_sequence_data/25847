We have identified two zzso proteins with an zzso raised against a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso to 684 of the predicted protein product of gene zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso They have apparent Mrs of zzso and zzso and are both major zzso components located in the zzso The zzso proteins were first detected in infected cells in minor amounts 6 h after infection at 37 degrees C but were later (from 10 h until 24 h after zzso present in large zzso zzso regulation was investigated using zzso acid zzso an inhibitor of DNA zzso the amounts of the zzso protein zzso were compared with those of zzso an early gene product, and zzso a true late gene zzso The data showed that zzso is regulated as a true late zzso
