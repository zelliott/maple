The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso DNA of a marine zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene consists of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein contains a typical zzso signal zzso of 29 zzso acid zzso followed by a zzso zzso acid sequence that is zzso to zzso module of family 16 zzso zzso a bacterial zzso group 2 zzso domain of 52 zzso acid zzso two zzso zzso of family 6 separated from zzso domain by nine times repeated zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is the first zzso that was identified to possess a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli exhibited zzso activity around 40 degrees C and pH zzso with a specific activity of zzso units zzso a K zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a V zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso zzso zzso but did not act on zzso and zzso
