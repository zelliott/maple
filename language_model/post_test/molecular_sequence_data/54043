The zzso zzso protein zzso in important cellular functions such as DNA repair and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso relationships of zzso has led to identification of several zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies have established that there is a strong correlation between zzso DNA repair and zzso maintenance functions and that zzso complex formation appears to be essential for both of these zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso previously shown to cause zzso defects in DNA repair and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso with respect to DNA repair and zzso zzso In a zzso zzso system, zzso fails to form a zzso or interact with zzso and zzso irrespective of experimental zzso These observations collectively suggest that the zzso substitution in zzso zzso a novel separation of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we observed that while zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso partially zzso the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso it has no effect on zzso zzso in these zzso This result provides additional evidence on possible involvement of distinctive mechanisms in DNA repair and zzso maintenance by the zzso zzso
