A zzso zzso microbial zzso cell zzso in which a specially designed zzso chamber and external electricity supply were not needed, was developed for in zzso zzso production from zzso zzso In batch experiments, the hydrogen production rate reached zzso zzso at the initial zzso concentration of 410 zzso (5 zzso while the zzso hydrogen recovery ( zzso see zzso ) and overall systemic zzso efficiency zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, and the systemic hydrogen yield ( zzso see zzso ) peaked at zzso zzso The hydrogen production increased along with zzso and buffer zzso The highest hydrogen production rate of zzso zzso and zzso see zzso of zzso zzso were achieved at zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso zzso Further evaluation of the reactor under single zzso or zzso mode indicated that further improvement of zzso output and reduction of electron losses were essential for efficient hydrogen zzso In addition, alternate exchanging the zzso and zzso function between the two cell units of the zzso was found to be an effective approach to inhibit zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso genes analysis showed that this special operation strategy resulted same microbial community structures in the zzso zzso of the two cell zzso The simple, compact and in zzso zzso zzso offers new opportunities for reactor design for a microbial zzso zzso production zzso
