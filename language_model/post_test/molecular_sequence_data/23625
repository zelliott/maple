zzso formation is an ideal model to study zzso zzso Although much has been done about zzso mechanism of zzso little is known as to how cellular signaling regulates this zzso We are interested in whether G protein signaling plays a role in zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso acid regions of G proteins were employed to amplify zzso from the pearl oyster zzso zzso As a result, the zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso from the pearl oyster was zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 377 zzso acid zzso which shares high similarity to the octopus zzso zzso zzso The zzso A, C, G zzso zzso switch II functional zzso and the zzso zzso that is a critical site for interaction with receptors are completely identical to those from other zzso However, zzso has a unique zzso acid zzso which encodes switch III and interaction sites of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis revealed that the oyster zzso zzso is widely expressed in a variety of zzso with highest levels in the outer fold of mantle and zzso of zzso the regions essential for zzso We also show that zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso that has impaired zzso zzso diminished its ability to induce zzso zzso Furthermore, the alkaline zzso zzso activity, an indicator for zzso is induced by the zzso in zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso may be involved in regulation of zzso function, particularly in biological zzso
