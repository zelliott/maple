zzso factors are essential zzso survival promoting molecules that are often zzso and that bind to zzso cell surface zzso zzso cell zzso zzso factor, zzso is a potent zzso factor that promotes the survival of zzso zzso in cultures including embryonic zzso zzso We have mapped the gene zzso zzso by two independent zzso using a cell hybrid panel and by fluorescent in zzso zzso We find zzso lies on the short arm of human zzso 5, at zzso ability to promote zzso zzso in zzso zzso The protein was partially zzso and a rat zzso zzso was isolated by screening a zzso zzso library with an zzso probe designed from the zzso of the rat zzso Human zzso sequences were isolated by screening a human zzso library with a portion of the rat zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso We wished to zzso the zzso gene in the human zzso and determine its proximity to possible sites of zzso particularly zzso affecting zzso zzso
