zzso K is a zzso zzso involved in degradation of human type I collagen and plays a primary role in bone zzso We have cloned zzso monkey zzso K by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence for the zzso zzso is zzso identical to that of the human with zzso identity within the mature active form of zzso zzso zzso monkey zzso K was zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and found to be zzso as the zzso in the culture media and 50% activated to the mature form zzso The zzso specificity preference of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Pro in the zzso position when tested with constant zzso at zzso The zzso activity expressed in zzso cell extracts was sensitive to zzso by zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso The apparent second order rate zzso of zzso by zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso expressed zzso monkey and human zzso K, zzso The high similarity between the sequences and the kinetic properties of zzso monkey and human zzso K establishes this monkey species as a suitable animal model for development of novel zzso K zzso as zzso zzso
