The zzso orientation of a zzso zzso influences the mechanism of action and zzso To determine the zzso arrangement of zzso zzso zzso a molecular zzso approach was zzso An eight zzso acid zzso region was engineered between two zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso active and had kinetic zzso salt zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and a functional unit size very similar to the expressed native human zzso By these criteria, zzso was the functional equivalent of native zzso Considering the length of the zzso zzso (no more than 24 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were restricted to a zzso zzso zzso Since zzso demonstrated native zzso properties while constrained to this zzso arrangement, these results provide the first compelling evidence that native zzso zzso are arranged in a zzso zzso orientation within the active zzso Thus, zzso function in zzso zzso and binding to zzso components must now be addressed with this zzso orientation in zzso The utility of the zzso approach to resolve the zzso arrangement of an zzso zzso has been demonstrated with zzso and could be generalized for use with other zzso zzso
