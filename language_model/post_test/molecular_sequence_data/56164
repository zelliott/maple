zzso of many zzso zzso genes requires the zzso form of nitrogen regulator I zzso or zzso which binds to sites that are analogous to zzso zzso A highly zzso regulatory domain contains the site of zzso and controls the function of zzso We analyzed the effects of zzso in highly zzso zzso that are part of the active site of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Fourteen zzso of zzso 54, the site of zzso impaired the response to nitrogen zzso Only one of these zzso zzso zzso zzso could significantly stimulate zzso from zzso the major promoter of the zzso zzso zzso with this zzso grew with zzso as a nitrogen zzso zzso with zzso components showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso at zzso 11 were not as deleterious as those at zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso in which zzso replaces the absolutely zzso zzso is functionally active and efficiently zzso This substitution appears to stabilize the zzso of zzso The differences between our results and those from study of zzso proteins suggest that there may be significant differences in the way highly zzso zzso participate in the transition to the activated zzso
