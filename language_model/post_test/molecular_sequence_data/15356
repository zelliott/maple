zzso from the clones of full-length enriched zzso libraries serve as valuable resources for functional zzso zzso We have zzso 1970 high-quality zzso zzso value zzso 30) that were obtained from sequencing the zzso ends of zzso liver, zzso and zzso clones derived from full-length enriched zzso libraries from Korean native zzso In addition, 50,000 pig expressed sequence tag zzso sequence trace files were obtained from zzso and combined with our sequencing information to facilitate zzso identification in zzso The process generated zzso zzso of which 239 included minimum one sequence from Korean native pig and contained zzso putative coding single zzso zzso zzso Of these, 33 putative zzso were randomly selected for zzso analysis and validated using 20 pigs from four different breeds zzso zzso zzso Korean native zzso Of the 33 putative zzso 20 were confirmed zzso which was similar to the frequency reported in other zzso We also identified 15 new zzso from the validation process, which were not detected by our in zzso zzso Our study shows that zzso genetically diverse pig breeds including the Korean native pig could serve as a useful strategy for generating a large number of zzso
