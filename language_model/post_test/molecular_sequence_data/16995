Studies of color vision in zzso zzso have been very zzso Two zzso genes have been characterized from the zzso zzso but a third cone zzso was suggested by zzso zzso on cone zzso in two other species, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the sequence and zzso zzso zzso of the cone zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the related zzso zzso zzso zzso we have used zzso zzso sequences of the cone zzso of other species, including the zzso zzso to design zzso to amplify the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences by the zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso DNA or retinal zzso as a zzso These zzso will be useful for amplifying cone zzso coding sequences from a variety of zzso zzso products were directly zzso to determine gene structure and coding zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the cone visual zzso indicated that both species have zzso zzso zzso with a predicted zzso maximum zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a predicted zzso at 360 zzso The zzso zzso of the two species differ by two, and zzso by three zzso acid zzso No evidence was obtained for a third cone zzso in either zzso
