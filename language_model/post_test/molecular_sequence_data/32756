zzso analysis of left and right border integration sites of independent, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed three previously zzso zzso of zzso zzso First, zzso zzso sites shared sequence similarity not only with the zzso left and right border regions, as was previously reported, but also at high frequency with the zzso complement of the zzso right border zzso Second, zzso sequences were frequently found to overlap or lie adjacent to zzso target sites, suggesting a high zzso potential for zzso elements during zzso integration and a possible role during the primary contact between the zzso and the target zzso Third, zzso DNA sequences between zzso zzso site DNA and zzso often derive from sequences in the zzso left and right border regions that are clustered around zzso sequences in these zzso regions, suggesting that these zzso elements are zzso zzso for zzso DNA zzso The discovery of zzso sequence similarities at the right border suggests a previously zzso mode of zzso integration that involves zzso formation at both zzso borders and with opposite strands of the target zzso zzso for sequence similarities in both direct and zzso orientation may increase the probability and/or effectiveness of zzso the zzso to the target zzso Variations on this scheme may also account for inversion events at the target site of zzso integration and zzso zzso repeat formation, common sequence organization patterns associated with zzso zzso
