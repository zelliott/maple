zzso streak virus zzso is transcribed zzso from an zzso region and rightward zzso produces an zzso that encodes the coat zzso The zzso region contains promoter elements required for rightward zzso including an upstream zzso sequence zzso which zzso the promoter with full activity in a zzso transient expression zzso The zzso contains two zzso repeats zzso zzso and a long zzso repeat or hairpin with a loop harboring a zzso sequence common to all zzso zzso through the zzso demonstrated the presence of an element, called the rightward promoter element zzso which is responsible for zzso zzso zzso includes the two zzso boxes, which are similar in sequence to zzso binding sites in zzso cells, but not the zzso hairpin zzso zzso binds zzso nuclear factors in zzso and the characteristics of the binding interaction have been determined by 1) binding competition with zzso 2) zzso zzso and 3) zzso interference zzso zzso of zzso nuclear factors to the zzso generates two major bands, slow and fast zzso bands, in gel zzso zzso zzso and factor zzso data suggest that the fast bands arise by the binding of factors to one zzso box while the slow bands are generated by factors binding to both zzso The data further indicate that the factors bind to the two zzso boxes with little zzso and bind on opposite faces of the DNA zzso
