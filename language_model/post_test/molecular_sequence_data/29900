We examined the zzso gene structure in a family with familial central precocious zzso zzso members, four zzso and a family with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso members, three zzso using Southern zzso analysis and sequencing of cloned zzso chain reaction zzso zzso DNA samples were zzso with restriction zzso and zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso bands; zzso zzso and zzso bands; zzso zzso and zzso bands; zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bands; zzso zzso and zzso zzso These sizes were the same as those found by this analysis in normal zzso All family members with familial central precocious zzso or idiopathic zzso zzso showed the same size bands, except for one unaffected member of the family with idiopathic zzso zzso who had an additional band at zzso zzso after zzso with zzso which is thought to be a rare zzso zzso of zzso 2 of the zzso gene from these families, including the zzso borders, revealed a zzso in the signal sequence of zzso that predicts an zzso acid change from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the zzso position of the zzso zzso Although this zzso did not zzso with the clinical disorder in either family, this novel zzso may prove useful in the evaluation of linkage to the zzso gene in other families with zzso zzso No other zzso sequence zzso was found in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region or the four zzso and their zzso zzso
