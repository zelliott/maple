Previous structural studies on the zzso zzso zzso zzso less potent than zzso strongly suggested the presence of an zzso zzso zzso salt bridge that was also observed in the shorter zzso zzso zzso In addition, for these two zzso we have shown that the zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso significantly improves the formation of the native zzso bonds zzso instead of approximately zzso for zzso In contrast to what was zzso from zzso data, molecular dynamics simulations suggested that such an zzso salt bridge would be zzso The zzso zzso has now been zzso at pH zzso and its high-resolution structure determined zzso zzso at zzso A using direct zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso zzso and the overall interface involves two zzso zzso salt bridges, a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations carried out on this zzso clearly showed that the two zzso salt bridges were in this case very zzso zzso equilibrium experiments zzso confirmed that zzso and zzso also exist as zzso in solution at pH zzso On the basis of the new zzso structure, previous zzso data were zzso zzso calculations were performed using 484 zzso and 38 zzso zzso zzso The solution and the X-ray structures of the zzso are very similar zzso zzso of zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso is present in the zzso it can be hypothesized that similar zzso salt bridges could be involved in the in zzso formation of the native zzso bonds of zzso zzso it appears to be likely that the zzso does assist the zzso folding in a zzso manner before successive zzso that yield the zzso zzso zzso
