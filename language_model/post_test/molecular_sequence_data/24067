All zzso express multiple small heat shock proteins zzso which are important components of the cellular zzso machinery and display a spectacular diversity of zzso This ranges from zzso the zzso and zzso zzso to serving as structural proteins in eye lens and zzso zzso Most information is available for the 10 known zzso zzso formally named zzso Only three of them zzso zzso zzso have been reported from zzso zzso while an apparent zzso zzso is found in frogs and zzso zzso To reconstruct the evolutionary diversification of the zzso in zzso we searched for additional zzso in zzso zzso and zzso databases and zzso some avian and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was included in the search, as the zzso of zzso zzso of seven zzso zzso were now found in other zzso zzso Two novel zzso named zzso and zzso were recognized in birds, and four novel zzso named zzso in zzso zzso Secondary structure predictions of zzso zzso from different zzso classes indicate conservation of the zzso structure of the functionally important zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso generally have zzso structures, despite their pronounced sequence zzso The constructed zzso zzso tree is supported by shared zzso zzso and diagnostic zzso The tree zzso putative zzso and zzso zzso which will facilitate the functional and structural comparison of the various zzso zzso The 15 recognized zzso zzso zzso reflect the period of extensive gene zzso early in zzso zzso Eleven of these zzso are grouped in a zzso that might be specific for zzso It is zzso that at least 13 zzso insertions have occurred during the evolution of zzso zzso zzso while a single ancient zzso is maintained in some zzso in line with the general trend of massive zzso gain before or during early zzso zzso zzso is the occurrence of several head-to-head located pairs of zzso zzso zzso
