The objective of this research was to construct a zzso hybrid gene that encodes a functional zzso zzso fusion protein for degradation of zzso zzso zzso is an intermediate in both synthesis and degradation of zzso a toxic zzso acid produced by the tree zzso zzso zzso zzso models of the fusion proteins suggested that joining of zzso and zzso with 0, 3, or 7 zzso zzso as a zzso should produce a functional zzso fusion zzso zzso three hybrid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed in which zzso and zzso were connected with 0, 9, and 21 zzso respectively, zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso When these hybrid genes were expressed in zzso and zzso coli, only one of them, zzso produced a functional zzso fusion zzso having both the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso hybrid gene could complement both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso coli zzso containing the zzso zzso protein was able to degrade zzso This hybrid gene may be useful for developing zzso zzso zzso plants in the zzso
