The zzso zzso zzso are an extended zzso of structurally and zzso related zzso which until now have been isolated from species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To explain the obvious differences in biological activities, the zzso relationships of the zzso zzso zzso were studied by a combination of zzso studies and molecular modeling using the deduced zzso acid sequences of the currently known zzso zzso modeling indicated that the number of active zzso sites per zzso varies between three and zzso Since the number of binding sites is fairly well correlated with the binding activity measured by surface zzso zzso and is also in good agreement with the results of previous studies of the biological activities of the zzso zzso molecular modeling is of great value for predicting which zzso are best suited for a particular zzso
