The regulation of expression of the two zzso zzso and zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso open reading frames zzso of Tomato leaf zzso virus zzso was studied in both zzso and zzso transformed zzso zzso zzso with zzso with the zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso transgenic lines were obtained with each of the four zzso zzso fusion zzso and with truncated versions of the zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso and zzso lacking zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, little or no zzso expression was observed in zzso plants transformed with zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso the complete viral zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were found to direct high-level zzso expression in transient zzso with tobacco zzso suggesting that integration of viral zzso containing functional, zzso genes may lead to repression or deletion of the introduced zzso in transgenic zzso zzso expression in the transient zzso zzso was found to be severely curtailed by specific zzso of the C2 ORF, supporting a role for the C2 protein in zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed distinctive tissue expression patterns in transgenic tobacco plants that could be divided into zzso zzso zzso and zzso predominantly vascular zzso zzso or reduced expression in cells associated with the vascular zzso zzso The significance of these results is discussed in terms of current models of gene function and regulation in zzso
