A single zzso base pair in the zzso zzso is a major zzso of the identity of an zzso transfer zzso zzso of this base pair to zzso or zzso prevents zzso with zzso We show here that, at approximate zzso conditions zzso zzso 37 degrees zzso high zzso of the zzso zzso species do not inhibit zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The observation suggests that, under these conditions, the zzso to A3 substitution increases zzso for zzso by more than zzso Other experiments at pH zzso show that no zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso occurs with zzso levels of zzso This suggests that zzso for these zzso zzso is sharply reduced as well and that the zzso zzso is not due to slow release of charged zzso zzso from the zzso zzso were also done at pH zzso where association of zzso with zzso is generally stronger and where binding can be zzso measured apart from zzso Under these conditions, the binding of the zzso and zzso species is readily detected and is only zzso weaker than the binding of the zzso zzso Although the zzso species was demonstrated to compete with the zzso zzso for the same site on the zzso no zzso could be zzso Thus, even when conditions are adjusted to obtain strong competitive zzso a sharp reduction in zzso prevents zzso of a zzso species with a substitution at position zzso
