zzso screening of a zzso library constructed using zzso amplification techniques from zzso isolated from the zzso portion zzso zzso zzso and visceral zzso of zzso days post zzso zzso mouse zzso led to the isolation of two zzso clones expressed at higher levels in zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that each of these clones was a different member of the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso clones represent mouse zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso declined zzso between days zzso and zzso of zzso and were under our limits of detection by zzso zzso The levels of the zzso zzso declined about zzso between days zzso and zzso of zzso Analysis of the expression of these genes by in zzso zzso revealed striking differences in transcript zzso in early zzso mouse zzso At zzso zzso both zzso were expressed more strongly in zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso While both zzso were expressed in the zzso and zzso only zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso appeared to be expressed only in the zzso while zzso although expressed in both zzso was expressed more strongly in the zzso zzso Thus, the two zzso have relatively zzso sites of expression in the developing zzso zzso zzso of zzso was fairly widespread in the zzso at zzso zzso but by zzso zzso expression was zzso and was observed in the eye and the spinal zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
