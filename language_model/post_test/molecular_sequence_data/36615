zzso resolution from a zzso zzso was used to measure directly zzso zzso in zzso zzso The system is based on a zzso zzso zzso cloned into a zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso which zzso zzso resistance, is resolved when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, provided the zzso carries a functional, intact copy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was independent of the zzso and zzso functions, but dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso has multiple pathways for genetic zzso and allow us to tentatively place the zzso and zzso genes into a new zzso group zzso
