The zzso gene from the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso is specifically limited to those zzso species that cause zzso We have demonstrated that the gene product of zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the formation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso However, the characteristics of this zzso had not previously been studied in detail with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso from zzso but it did not bring about the synthesis of zzso zzso conditions for the highest activity were found to be as zzso pH zzso 30 degrees C, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions, the kinetic values of zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas the specific activity was 186 zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was inhibited at zzso zzso higher than 50 zzso The zzso activity was strongly inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso motif zzso among zzso zzso was zzso in order to investigate its zzso The middle zzso was found to be the most crucial entity for the zzso zzso and two zzso zzso function zzso to enhance the acidity of zzso possibly through zzso zzso The zzso zzso could also react with zzso to generate zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses were carried out with zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso and zzso adopted a zzso zzso but zzso adopted a zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso for the zzso formation are the opposite of those of zzso when it is used as a zzso by zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is folded in a boat zzso whereas zzso folds into a chair zzso for the formation of the zzso of the zzso and zzso skeletons, zzso
