zzso in the family zzso zzso zzso zzso in aquatic zzso Application of a zzso zzso targeting the DNA zzso of viruses in this family has revealed that zzso are quite diverse and appear to be zzso but a limited number of environments have been examined so zzso In this study, we examined the sequence diversity among viral DNA pol genes amplified by zzso from zzso coastal waters of zzso zzso A total of 18 novel zzso sequences were detected along with two other divergent sequences that differ at the zzso relative to other sequences in the zzso Of the 20 new sequence types reported here, three were zzso found to contain protein zzso or zzso zzso analysis of the zzso suggested that all three have zzso zzso and are apparently capable of removing themselves from the translated zzso zzso Two of the three also appear to be zzso meaning they zzso all the motifs necessary for a complete zzso zzso zzso and are therefore capable of horizontal zzso A subsequent zzso survey of our samples with zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso are common in this zzso A search for similar sequences in zzso data sets from other oceans indicated that viral zzso are also zzso but how these genetic zzso might be influencing the ecology and evolution of zzso remains zzso
