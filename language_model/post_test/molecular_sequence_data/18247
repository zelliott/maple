A zzso zzso of zzso is selective for cellular proteins containing zzso sequences zzso related to zzso zzso This zzso is activated in zzso cultured cells that are deprived of serum growth factors and in certain zzso of zzso zzso We have zzso this zzso degradation zzso in zzso Transport into zzso requires a zzso sequence in the zzso protein and zzso and/or degradation is zzso by zzso A member of the heat shock 70 zzso protein family, the 73 zzso zzso heat shock zzso binds to zzso zzso regions within proteins and, in some as yet unidentified manner, zzso transfer of the proteins into zzso Several possible mechanisms of selective protein transport into zzso are zzso
