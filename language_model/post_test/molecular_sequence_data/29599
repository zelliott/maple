zzso zzso membrane proteins zzso are characterized by four zzso regions and zzso located end zzso They are ubiquitous and abundant components of zzso in most, if not all, cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso shuttle between various zzso compartments and are localized in zzso and zzso zzso Based on gene organization and zzso acid sequence similarities zzso can be grouped into three distinct families that are referred to as zzso zzso and zzso zzso membrane proteins zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso constitute the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso the zzso Members of each family are zzso zzso resulting in unique patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified in most zzso organisms, including diverse animal and plant species, but have not been detected in zzso zzso They are subject to protein zzso most notably to zzso and are part of zzso zzso Experimental evidence is reviewed showing that zzso contribute to zzso trafficking and membrane zzso
