We zzso the human zzso zzso zzso gene as a model system to study the regulation of zzso gene expression during normal human zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso gene expression is induced during normal zzso zzso and that the activity of the gene is zzso at least in part, by the interaction of a zzso active zzso zzso promoter and a zzso zzso zzso zzso element located in the zzso zzso 1 region of the zzso We now report that zzso zzso 1 contains a zzso zzso element which is active on a number of zzso promoters in a variety of zzso and human zzso This zzso element has been mapped to a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and gel mobility shift analyses demonstrated that this zzso contains two nuclear zzso sites zzso and zzso which flank a consensus binding site for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso and zzso sequences are each necessary for full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 displayed zzso activity similar to that of its human zzso zzso of the sequences of human and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso sequence motifs have been highly zzso during zzso zzso
