The Eastern zzso zzso zzso is a useful experimental model for evaluating zzso therapy against chronic zzso zzso In the present study, an zzso complex zzso composed of immune zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso particles containing zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso was administered to zzso zzso and natural chronic zzso carriers, with the final aim of evaluating the outcome of zzso infection in both zzso A control group of three animals, infected zzso with viral particles only, was also zzso Following zzso administration, two zzso zzso exhibited persistent infection, with zzso levels 3-6 logs lower than the zzso levels of the controls that developed persistent zzso zzso zzso to zzso was observed in these two zzso and in two control zzso which developed zzso zzso In two of the four chronic carriers, the zzso level decreased significantly (by 4-6 zzso following zzso administration, with no rebound in viral load during zzso zzso zzso to zzso was observed also in these zzso zzso of the sequences derived from envelope proteins confirmed that zzso did not induce the emergence of resistant viral zzso The results of this study indicate that the zzso could be useful for breaking the tolerance in zzso infection and for boosting the zzso innate and adoptive immune zzso
