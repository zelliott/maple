zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by a gene family that is abundantly transcribed in leaves and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso or with zzso delta zzso a zzso deficient in zzso factor production, induced rapid zzso of zzso zzso in roots and root zzso As both zzso and zzso bacteria provoke responses, induction of zzso gene expression may involve symbiotic or defense zzso Four days after zzso with the zzso zzso zzso the transcript levels increased in roots but decreased in root zzso Use of a region unique to the zzso end of a specific zzso gene zzso showed that increases of transcript levels in root hairs 24 h after zzso with both zzso were specific to this zzso zzso of this gene in roots were only zzso 4 days after treatment with zzso It is possible therefore that zzso of zzso follows the infection zzso of zzso entering zzso zzso zzso zzso factors induced zzso of zzso showing that they might be part of the signal zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso
