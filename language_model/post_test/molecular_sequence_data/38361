zzso studies revealed that zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in various zzso zzso relative to normal zzso However, the functional role of zzso zzso zzso in cancer remains to be zzso In this report, we explore the potential role of zzso zzso in zzso cell growth by investigating the effects of partial zzso of this zzso on the zzso zzso of human chronic zzso zzso cells zzso Cloning of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso zzso zzso were successfully zzso Two stable zzso clones of zzso cells were zzso which expressed zzso and zzso of zzso zzso respectively, compared with zzso clone in both zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso In sharp contrast, these two zzso clones expressed no significant suppression of any other related zzso family members, indicating the specificity of these two zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso clones zzso and potentially exhibited cell growth zzso poor zzso growth in soft zzso and loss of serum zzso The results demonstrate that specific zzso suppression of zzso zzso is sufficient to interfere with the growth of zzso cells, indicating that zzso zzso is essential for human chronic zzso zzso cell zzso
