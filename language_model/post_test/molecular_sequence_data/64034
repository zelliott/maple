zzso interference is the process that zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso to zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso application of zzso in functional zzso and zzso cancer gene therapy, and virus protection depends on the efficient delivery of zzso into zzso zzso The availability of high virus zzso infection of a broad spectrum of cell types, and independence on active cell division makes zzso the zzso of choice for zzso zzso To this end, we developed a new zzso shuttle zzso designated as zzso to host zzso promoter and unique zzso and zzso sites for zzso of zzso for expression of zzso In this chapter, we describe an zzso system that uses a commercially available zzso system and zzso to deliver zzso cassette into cells to silence a specific gene in zzso zzso
