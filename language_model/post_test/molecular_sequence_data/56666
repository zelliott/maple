In many zzso zzso release from zzso terminals is triggered by zzso entry via zzso zzso zzso We have looked for zzso for such channels in the nervous system of the marine ray zzso zzso One zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso channels, and two zzso zzso and zzso are similar to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso most closely resembles a previously cloned zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso is a member of a separate branch of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals that zzso is abundant in the zzso zzso is more plentiful in the electric lobe and, therefore, may control neurotransmitter release in motor nerve zzso These results show that the familial pattern of zzso genes has been preserved from a stage in evolution before the divergence of higher and lower zzso zzso 400 million years zzso The cloning of these channels may be a useful starting point for zzso the role of the zzso channels in zzso zzso in nerve zzso
