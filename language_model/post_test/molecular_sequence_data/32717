Red algae are widely known to produce zzso starch but it remains unclear whether the molecular structure of this zzso zzso is distinct from that of the starch zzso by vascular plants and green zzso The present study shows that the zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class zzso produces both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso analysis of zzso length distribution of zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso has a less ordered structure, referred to as zzso as compared with zzso of rice zzso having a zzso zzso The zzso zzso linear zzso zzso which has a zzso of 630 zzso typical of zzso complex and is resistant to zzso zzso zzso accounts for less than zzso of the total zzso We produced and isolated a zzso zzso a zzso starch zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso which is probably the approximately zzso protein bound tightly to the starch zzso resembling the zzso zzso protein of green zzso The present investigation indicates that the class zzso includes species producing both zzso and zzso and species producing zzso zzso
