The function of basic zzso zzso proteins in cell differentiation was shown to be zzso from zzso to zzso exemplified by the function of zzso in zzso muscle zzso In zzso zzso muscle tissue appears first in zzso and the question of its evolutionary position is zzso zzso For this reason we have studied the zzso role of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Based on their zzso ability, four genes of the zzso family of zzso factors were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso While the proteins Id and Ash group with zzso family members from zzso zzso and zzso could not be unequivocally zzso Id is expressed during the zzso budding process and in the adult zzso Ash and zzso are expressed in all life cycle stages from egg to adult zzso and zzso is expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and in late zzso bud zzso The zzso zzso the expression pattern, and the conservation of two zzso specific for a zzso zzso domain suggest that zzso is related to an ancestral zzso zzso Id, zzso and zzso are either expressed in the zzso or its derived zzso the zzso and smooth muscle of the zzso These findings strengthen the hypothesis that the zzso is a zzso structure and that the common zzso of zzso and zzso was more complex in zzso architecture and body organization than commonly zzso
