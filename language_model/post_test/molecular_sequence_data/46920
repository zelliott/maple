zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso signal substance that acts as a zzso of hormone zzso from zzso target cells and fulfills many criteria for the function of a zzso within the central and peripheral nervous zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso by a highly specific zzso Here, we characterize the human zzso zzso zzso by primary zzso functional zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso By screening a zzso constructed from human zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso The longest open reading frame predicts a type II integral membrane protein of 117 zzso The zzso domain contains the zzso + E motif that is characteristic of a certain family of zzso zzso Within this family, the sequences of human and rat zzso reveal an unusual high degree of conservation zzso identical zzso zzso zzso activity was observed after zzso zzso cells with human zzso zzso yielding a zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated a restricted tissue distribution with highest transcript levels in the zzso Using fluorescent in zzso zzso with the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso respectively, we localized the zzso gene to the long arm of human zzso zzso Five independent zzso artificial zzso clones were required to span the complete zzso sequence and revealed that it is distributed on 19 zzso zzso Southern analysis suggests that the gene is present as a single copy in human, zzso zzso zzso dog, zzso rabbit and chicken zzso All of these data further the notion that the zzso is not an ordinary zzso but a specific zzso that has been highly zzso among zzso
