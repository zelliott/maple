zzso provide the zzso zzso for zzso communication throughout plant zzso and participate in a diverse set of zzso zzso Despite their central role in growth and development and zzso resolving their modus zzso remains a major challenge in plant zzso Features of protein sequences and/or structure that determine protein targeting to zzso were previously zzso We identify here a novel family of zzso proteins (called zzso whose members have the features of type I membrane zzso zzso We focus our studies on the first identified type member zzso zzso or zzso and show that, following its altered zzso it is effective in modulating zzso zzso zzso is targeted to zzso via the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso manner, and resides at zzso with its zzso in the zzso domain and its zzso in the zzso Using a deletion analysis, we show that the single zzso domain zzso of zzso contains all the information necessary for zzso targeting of this type I membrane protein to zzso such that the zzso can be used to target zzso proteins to this zzso These studies identify a new family of zzso proteins that affect zzso zzso They exhibit a mode of zzso trafficking and targeting novel for plant biology and provide technological opportunities for targeting different proteins to zzso to aid in zzso zzso
