The zzso zzso of human zzso C virus zzso and the animal zzso responsible for bovine viral zzso zzso and hog zzso zzso have relatively lengthy zzso zzso regions zzso sharing short segments of zzso primary zzso zzso The functions of these zzso are poorly zzso By comparative sequence analysis and zzso modeling of the zzso of multiple zzso and zzso zzso we developed models of the secondary structures of these zzso These zzso zzso are highly zzso zzso despite substantial differences in their primary zzso zzso The assignment of similar structures to zzso segments of primary zzso sequence present in the zzso of zzso resulted in a model of the secondary structure of the zzso zzso which was refined by determining sites at which synthetic zzso zzso was zzso by double- and zzso specific zzso These studies indicate the existence of a large zzso zzso structure within the 3' 200 bases of the zzso of both zzso and zzso which zzso to the zzso landing pad zzso zzso entry zzso of zzso This structure shows little zzso to the zzso landing pad of zzso A virus, suggesting that these functionally similar structures may have evolved zzso
