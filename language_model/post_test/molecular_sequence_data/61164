The presence of a long zzso zzso element, named zzso which is actively transcribed in the zzso zzso zzso has been recently zzso The open reading frame 1 of this element encodes the zzso zzso which has zzso zzso activity and is probably implicated in the first stage of the zzso of the zzso In the present paper we show that zzso effectively removes zzso groups zzso and zzso from damaged DNA zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso activities are present in zzso We propose that these zzso activities would allow the zzso ends to function as targets for the zzso of zzso element, in addition to the zzso sites previously zzso The potential biological function of the zzso protein has also been evidenced by its ability to repair the DNA damage induced by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso agents such as hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso
