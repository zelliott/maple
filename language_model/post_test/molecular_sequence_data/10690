The sequence of a third member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso gene family is zzso This zzso designated zzso zzso is the zzso of the mouse zzso gene zzso zzso To characterize the zzso complex in this zzso we have produced zzso zzso against synthetic peptides based on zzso sequences deduced from the primary sequences of the zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso zzso zzso We have also used zzso zzso produced against zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso Using these zzso we show that zzso cells contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso at least seven distinct zzso Three of these were assigned to specific zzso zzso whereas a fourth was recognized by the zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this gene is also present in the zzso The zzso complex also contains other unidentified proteins that were recognized by the zzso zzso zzso raised against the putative zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso alpha gene expression was shown in zzso growing cells and cells zzso their zzso for different periods to have a similar pattern to the previously identified genes zzso gamma and zzso zzso and also to zzso zzso
