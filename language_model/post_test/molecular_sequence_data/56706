The influence of the rare initiation zzso zzso on zzso translation was investigated by comparing the activity of two pairs of model zzso that differ in the length of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the initiation zzso zzso or zzso all zzso had similar template activity in zzso but translation of zzso zzso depended more on initiation factor zzso 2 and less on zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso the zzso ratio from 2 to 10 progressively inhibited the zzso zzso and abolished their capacity to compete for translating zzso with other zzso but did not affect activity of the zzso zzso The effects induced by zzso are from its different influence on zzso and zzso of the transition zzso zzso zzso initiation complex; depending on the nature of the initiation zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso shifts the position of equilibrium toward binding or zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding and zzso yields zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso at an zzso ratio of approximately 1, indicating that the data are from the interaction of one zzso of zzso with the same zzso binding zzso Both effects are either lost or strongly reduced with zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso by zzso is from the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso which becomes relevant when excess zzso interferes with the formation of zzso initiation complex, presumably by interacting with zzso zzso
