zzso zzso is an ancient zzso zzso insect capable of mounting a powerful immune zzso This response is zzso regulated in part by zzso factors of the zzso Factor zzso B zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized three members of this zzso factor family in this zzso zzso zzso is primarily expressed in early zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso both zzso spliced products of zzso zzso are expressed primarily in the adult fat body in response to septic injury, suggesting their exclusive role in zzso Additionally, we identified putative zzso binding sites in the zzso upstream regions of target genes known to be involved in the innate immune response of zzso
