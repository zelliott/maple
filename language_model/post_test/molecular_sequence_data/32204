The zzso protein zzso normally resides in the zzso but during zzso it zzso to zzso where it is responsible for releasing zzso zzso Using zzso as a model, we have shown that zzso zzso does not commit cells to zzso and they can be rescued by zzso to zzso zzso within a specific zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso change during zzso that has been suggested to regulate conversion from its benign, zzso form to the active, membrane bound zzso We now show that the zzso zzso regulates commitment and zzso zzso but not the zzso to zzso We identify zzso 13 within the zzso of zzso as critical for this zzso The zzso distribution of zzso 13 zzso zzso was identical to zzso zzso in both healthy and zzso zzso However, zzso 13 zzso zzso induced rapid progression to commitment, zzso zzso and zzso Our data identify changes in zzso controlling commitment to zzso that are mechanistically distinct from those controlling its zzso zzso Together, they indicate that multiple regulatory steps are required to activate the zzso function of zzso
