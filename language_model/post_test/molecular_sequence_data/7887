The ability of the zzso generalized mismatch repair system to prevent zzso between partially divergent (also called zzso sequences during transformation in zzso zzso was zzso By using as donor in transformation cloned fragments zzso divergent in DNA sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the zzso system prevents zzso integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other zzso In the latter case, the zzso system becomes saturated zzso due to an excess of zzso it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the zzso Further investigation with zzso donor DNA, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent zzso can lead to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in cellular concentration of either zzso the zzso zzso that binds zzso or zzso the zzso zzso for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously zzso zzso Investigation of zzso transformation by zzso DNA from two related zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso also revealed complete zzso of the zzso zzso Therefore the zzso system is not a barrier to zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results are discussed in light of those described for the zzso system of zzso zzso
