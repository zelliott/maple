The mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso some of the earliest aspects of limb development and leads to subsequent abnormalities in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by embryonic day zzso leading to abnormal zzso zzso of the limb zzso subsequent merging of the skeletal zzso that give rise to cartilage and bone in the digits, and eventual fusion of zzso The zzso zzso and its effect on early digital patterning distinguish zzso from many other zzso that result from later failure of cell death in the zzso zzso Here we use zzso cloning to show that the gene zzso in zzso mice encodes the putative zzso zzso zzso The results provide direct evidence that a zzso zzso zzso is involved in the earliest stages of zzso patterning and support the idea that an ancient genetic mechanism zzso both zzso formation in zzso and zzso formation in zzso In addition to cloning the zzso zzso we have mapped three zzso of zzso for which we suggest possible candidate zzso
