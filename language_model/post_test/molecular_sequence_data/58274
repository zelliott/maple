The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is a basic protein of 84 zzso acids that helps to regulate the activity of zzso In order to obtain structural information on the mechanism of zzso the bovine inhibitor zzso has been expressed in zzso coli and zzso in high zzso The zzso protein has a similar zzso activity to the inhibitor zzso isolated from bovine zzso Progressive zzso and zzso deletion zzso of the inhibitor zzso have been produced either by zzso and zzso or by chemical zzso By zzso the truncated proteins for zzso activity, the minimal zzso sequence of the inhibitor zzso has been defined as consisting of zzso zzso The immediately adjacent sequences zzso and zzso help to stabilize the complex between zzso and the inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso appear to be zzso At zzso pH values, the inhibitor zzso is mainly zzso and forms zzso zzso in zzso Smaller zzso fragments of the inhibitor zzso such as zzso zzso seem to have a mainly random zzso structure in solution, but they can adopt the correct zzso zzso when they from a complex with the zzso However, these latter fragments are mainly zzso in solution, suggesting that the zzso of the inhibitor zzso in solution may be due to zzso zzso zzso formation via the zzso zzso The zzso peptides consisting of zzso zzso and zzso of the inhibitor protein can bind to zzso and interfere with zzso by the intact inhibitor zzso The zzso fragments of the inhibitor protein consisting of zzso zzso and zzso do not compete with the inhibitor zzso for its binding site on zzso
