The zzso capacities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso S have been compared for the human zzso membrane and zzso zzso of three different compositions zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso analogue of the outer leaflet of the human zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso strength, zzso metal zzso and zzso of release of fluorescent markers from zzso and of zzso from intact zzso has been zzso zzso zzso was found to he more effective than zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso somewhat less effective in the zzso analogue and markedly less effective in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso but was able to lyse zzso zzso at a high zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso at high zzso strength zzso zzso zzso but produced a more complex response of stimulation followed by zzso at low zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso either zzso zzso zzso or was zzso zzso exerted effects similar to zzso with zzso zzso at zzso zzso lower concentration except that a weak zzso was observed for the zzso membrane zzso analogue at high zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso by zzso at low zzso strength, but was ineffective or zzso in zzso zzso zzso High zzso concentration also inhibited zzso zzso but again no corresponding effect could he found in any of the zzso zzso zzso These disparities between effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso support the proposal that zzso interactions are of consequence to its zzso zzso Similar experiments were performed with zzso S and zzso in order to compare their zzso properties with those of zzso It was found that each zzso exhibited its own individual pattern of sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso strength and zzso by zzso It thus appears likely that the detailed molecular interactions responsible for zzso are significantly different for each of these three zzso
