The zzso zzso plays a key role in the maturation and zzso of many zzso proteins in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso two populations of zzso transcripts that differ slightly in size zzso and zzso zzso are present in zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso transcripts are seen in zzso zzso and in zzso undergoing zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso were isolated and zzso Although nearly zzso an additional eight zzso sequence was present at the end of the zzso of one of the two zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso transcripts containing the eight zzso extension, were present only in zzso zzso zzso transcripts lacking this sequence were present in zzso zzso and the levels of these transcripts increased in both zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso zzso zzso a nearly identical zzso zzso However, two zzso proteins zzso and 84 zzso were observed on zzso of zzso zzso Only one of these, zzso the 86 zzso protein was detected by an zzso zzso suggesting that the difference in mass of the two zzso zzso was due at least in part, to different levels of zzso zzso
