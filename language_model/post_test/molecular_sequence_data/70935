zzso is one of the most powerful negative regulators of zzso To manage this in an efficient way it has to interact with a set of different cellular zzso Most contacts with the cellular environment occur in the zzso or the zzso domain of the zzso Since we previously found that zzso binds to the regulatory zzso of zzso we now analyzed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso separately for the binding of protein zzso zzso an zzso which seems to have a certain importance for proliferation zzso With different overlay zzso we could map the binding domain of protein zzso zzso to a sequence between zzso acids zzso a region which zzso with the interaction domain of some other zzso binding zzso We also found that the regulatory zzso of protein zzso zzso binds independent of the zzso zzso to this zzso domain of zzso
