zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso composed of five apparently identical zzso two of which form a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dell, zzso Morris, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Murray, zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the nature of the zzso chain of rat zzso was investigated by fast atom zzso zzso zzso and general features of its zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso zzso and linkage analysis demonstrated that each zzso of rat zzso contained one zzso chain, predominantly a zzso zzso structure, attached to zzso The zzso of rat zzso was studied by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and by cultured zzso The results revealed that each zzso of rat zzso was zzso individually as a zzso precursor with a zzso signal zzso The zzso species was sensitive to zzso by zzso H zzso zzso indicating that it possessed a high zzso zzso zzso zzso acquired the ability to bind to zzso and to form the zzso and zzso species prior to acquiring resistance to zzso zzso Studies using zzso revealed that the zzso zzso present in rat zzso was not required for formation of its zzso zzso zzso ability to bind to zzso or zzso The zzso rat zzso however, was still able to bind to zzso and to be zzso by zzso
