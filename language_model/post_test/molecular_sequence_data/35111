zzso heart disease zzso is characterized by the presence of zzso group A zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso mimicry between zzso zzso and self proteins is a hallmark of the zzso of rheumatic zzso We aimed to zzso in zzso patients, zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso with zzso proteins and to evaluate their role in inducing zzso zzso We used an zzso approach with zzso zzso membrane proteins in order to identify zzso recognized by zzso of 140 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso proteins was zzso zzso peptides recognized by serum zzso zzso were found through comparing the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso with human zzso To investigate zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso we performed a Western zzso analysis of whole extracts proteins from zzso or zzso human zzso cardiac zzso cells zzso zzso zzso expression and release of zzso zzso and growth factors were studied by multiplex zzso based zzso zzso We observed zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with heat shock protein zzso and zzso zzso proteins was zzso Comparing the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and zzso with human zzso we found two zzso peptides recognized by serum zzso zzso These zzso were able to stimulate zzso inducing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and release of zzso zzso and growth zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso were able to activate zzso cardiac zzso by amplifying the inflammatory response in zzso
