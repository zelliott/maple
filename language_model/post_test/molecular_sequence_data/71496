zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso and zzso of the giant land snail zzso zzso are a zzso and zzso containing a zzso and zzso at position 2, zzso We succeeded in cloning a zzso zzso a precursor of zzso from the zzso zzso revealing that the zzso present in zzso is coded by a common zzso zzso zzso or zzso The deduced zzso was found to comprise seven repeats of the zzso sequence zzso and one analog zzso flanked on both sides by the typical zzso site zzso Northern zzso analysis of transcripts and Southern zzso analysis of reverse zzso zzso products demonstrated that zzso zzso was localized in the zzso zzso whereas expression of zzso zzso was detected in the atrium as well as in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso gene transcript in the right and left pedal zzso compartments was shown by in zzso zzso on sections of zzso zzso whereas the zzso transcript was observed in the right and left zzso zzso These data suggested that zzso plays an essential role in the regulation of the heart as a neurotransmitter or zzso through production in the pedal zzso and transport to the atrium, whereas zzso serves not only as a neurotransmitter or zzso but also as a novel zzso zzso
