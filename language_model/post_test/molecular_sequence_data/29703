The zzso major zzso identified to date are an zzso protein zzso to zzso v 1 and a zzso zzso zzso to zzso v zzso No studies have reported zzso zzso recognized in patients with positive zzso zzso food challenge zzso results or in patients allergic to zzso but not to zzso 

We characterized the zzso zzso by studying the zzso zzso of 65 patients with positive zzso results and 7 patients with severe zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso were identified by means of zzso and zzso zzso Further characterization was done with zzso acid sequencing, evaluation of the zzso properties of raw and roasted zzso with zzso zzso test zzso assessment of zzso with different zzso by means of zzso zzso and zzso by means of zzso 

All the zzso from the patients with positive zzso results recognized an zzso and a zzso zzso other major zzso were at molecular weights of 32 and 35 zzso zzso to the zzso band was inhibited by birch zzso indicating its zzso with the birch major zzso and abolished in roasted zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso the zzso zzso is a zzso and the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Patients with severe zzso reactions to zzso showed specific zzso zzso to a zzso zzso totally inhibited by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which was heat stable and, when zzso corresponded to an zzso 

The major zzso of zzso is an zzso protein zzso to zzso v 1, and the zzso zzso is presumably an zzso Other major zzso have molecular weights of 47, 32, and 35 zzso
