The rat zzso zzso B zzso gene is induced by zzso in the zzso and zzso containing rat zzso gene promoter zzso are highly zzso in cell zzso Analysis of the upstream zzso to zzso region of the promoter in zzso cells has identified an imperfect zzso zzso response element zzso that is required for hormone zzso Analysis of the zzso gene promoter in zzso breast cancer cells confirmed that zzso zzso the zzso to zzso promoter zzso was zzso in transient zzso zzso However, zzso and deletion analysis of this region of the promoter showed that two zzso sites and the zzso zzso were functional zzso that bound zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso The role of these elements was confirmed in gel mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies in zzso and Schneider zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is dependent, in part, on zzso action which is cell zzso
