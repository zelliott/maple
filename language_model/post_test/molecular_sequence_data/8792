We identified a novel T cell zzso in the South African clawed zzso zzso zzso by a zzso designated zzso This zzso is present in relatively high levels on most zzso approximately zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso but is rarely seen on zzso B cells in any of these zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso zzso in response to stimulation with Con A or zzso whereas the zzso zzso are zzso to zzso zzso analysis indicates that this zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of 71 to 82 zzso The protein core of 64 zzso bears both zzso and zzso zzso side zzso The zzso protein sequence of the zzso zzso shares significant zzso with both the zzso scavenger zzso type 1 motif and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso characteristics and cellular distribution of the zzso zzso suggest that it represents the zzso zzso in zzso zzso While T cells zzso express this highly zzso zzso zzso B cells acquire the zzso zzso only when they are zzso in the presence of T zzso
