zzso expressed genes contain regulatory features which allow expression in virtually all cell zzso In an effort to understand the molecular basis for this regulatory feature, the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso gene was examined by zzso I zzso in zzso of several zzso The promoter contained a strong hypersensitive site in all zzso zzso including those with very high and very low levels of zzso zzso zzso mouse studies revealed that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso I was required to generate a strong promoter zzso I hypersensitive site, and to produce ubiquitous zzso The zzso zzso also contained a zzso zzso activity which mapped to sequences zzso with the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that ubiquitous expression was not dependent on the presence of a functional zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and the ubiquitous zzso within the zzso zzso functioned with zzso promoters in transgenic zzso
