The zzso and zzso proteins represent a class of zzso zzso that are found in the zzso zzso layer of zzso shell zzso zzso These proteins have been shown to zzso interfere with calcium zzso mineral growth in zzso It is believed that both proteins play an important role in zzso zzso selection in the zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso sequences of zzso and zzso represent mineral zzso zzso in both zzso as evidenced by their ability to zzso calcium zzso crystal growth at step edge zzso In this present report, using free zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso representing the zzso AA regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we confirm that both zzso sequences possess putative zzso zzso interaction zzso sequence regions (2 zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso that are random zzso in zzso However, with regard to the remaining sequences regions, each zzso features unique structural zzso zzso possesses an extended zzso or zzso type zzso structure within the zzso zzso and zzso sequence regions, with the remaining sequence regions adopting a zzso structure, a trait common to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses random zzso structure within zzso and zzso sequence regions, and evidence for zzso zzso or loop zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso sequence regions, similar to the structures identified within the putative zzso proteins zzso A and sea zzso zzso zzso zzso The similarities and differences in zzso and zzso zzso domain structure are discussed with regard to joint zzso protein modification of calcium zzso zzso
