In zzso zzso formation is zzso by a zzso zzso which is an intrinsic property of the zzso zzso We cloned a full-length zzso and several zzso fragments from zzso and zzso coding for zzso zzso with a novel domain zzso A putative zzso zzso channel domain contains a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso located zzso after the last zzso span on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso catalyst is zzso zzso DNA zzso of a green fluorescent protein zzso construct into the zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso of the expressed zzso An identical gene coding for an zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of the latter in zzso cells yielded an active zzso zzso zzso The occurrence of this highly unique zzso of zzso zzso appears to be restricted to zzso and zzso
