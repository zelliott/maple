In humans we know 25 zzso that play important roles in zzso regulation, detoxification, zzso protection and viral zzso In particular, zzso M zzso may function as zzso zzso zzso that zzso in the formation of zzso bonds, and can be implicated in calcium zzso However, it presents a zzso motif zzso where U is a zzso and may also function as zzso regulator because its decreased or increased expression regulated by dietary zzso alters zzso zzso No data are reported in literature about its involvement in cancer but only in neurodegenerative zzso In this paper we evaluated the zzso expression in two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso compared to normal zzso The results suggested its involvement in zzso zzso zzso as well as its possible use to follow the progression of this cancer as putative zzso The aim of this study has been to analyze the zzso relationships of zzso zzso zzso we studied the evolutionary history of this protein by zzso analysis and zzso content of genes from various zzso So, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of the human zzso evaluating its energetic stability by molecular dynamics zzso Moreover, we modeled some of its zzso to obtain structural information helpful for zzso drug zzso
