zzso zzso zzso zzso is widespread in various environments and is known to be performed by both zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is predominantly biological under zzso conditions, to date most of the studies on zzso zzso zzso were from environments of zzso zzso The present study was conducted in Lake Grosse zzso a moderately zzso zzso receiving zzso acids from an adjacent zzso with the objective of zzso characterizing and enumerating the zzso responsible for this zzso The zzso of zzso under zzso zzso zzso conditions have shown the enrichment of zzso group of zzso zzso A zzso experiment done on these zzso showed a consumption of zzso and nitrate in accordance with the expected zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso zzso done by most probable number showed the presence of 1 zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per gram fresh weight of zzso The analysis of microbial community by zzso zzso gene zzso zzso showed that these zzso sequences zzso to zzso of bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso zzso isotope probing using zzso was performed with the lake zzso and showed labeling of these zzso This indicated that they might be important zzso in this zzso Although these zzso are not dominant members of the zzso microbial community, they could be of functional significance due to their contribution to the zzso of zzso which has a critical role as an electron zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso organic zzso To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to show the zzso zzso zzso nature of zzso group of zzso zzso
