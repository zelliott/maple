zzso is a novel ubiquitous zzso family member that has been implicated as a zzso gene for type 2 zzso One of the major challenges is that the function of zzso is not yet zzso To address this problem, we zzso human zzso from different sources, including the zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were present as two major forms with different zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was found to be efficiently zzso at the zzso region by zzso but not by other zzso None of these zzso proteins have putative zzso activity under in zzso conditions when examined using different zzso zzso including more than 70 in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results raise the possibility that zzso may require a special zzso zzso or interacting zzso to acquire zzso activity, or it functions by interacting with other proteins rather than through its zzso zzso
