The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family consists of zzso receptors that recognize zzso zzso and zzso them for degradation by zzso The zzso is the zzso of this family, which also contains zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso E zzso 2, zzso and zzso The family members contain four major structural zzso the zzso zzso repeats, zzso growth factor zzso repeats, a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso Each structural module serves distinct and important zzso These receptors bind several structurally dissimilar zzso It is proposed that instead of a primary zzso positive zzso potential in different zzso constitutes a zzso binding zzso This family of receptors plays crucial roles in various zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in cholesterol zzso zzso cause familial zzso and premature coronary artery zzso zzso protein plays an important role in the clearance of zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is essential for fetal development and has been associated with Alzheimer's zzso zzso is the major zzso in zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso in a chicken zzso of zzso cause female zzso and premature zzso This zzso is not expressed in liver zzso however, transgenic expression of zzso in liver zzso zzso in experiment animals, which suggests that it can be a candidate for gene therapy for various zzso The functional importance of individual receptors may lie in their differential tissue zzso The regulation of expression of these receptors occurs at the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is regulated by zzso zzso levels involving novel zzso zzso zzso Other members of the family are not regulated by zzso All the members are, however, regulated by hormones and growth factors, but the mechanisms of regulation by hormones have not been zzso Studies of these receptors have provided important insights into zzso zzso and mechanisms of zzso removal and zzso It is anticipated that increased knowledge about the zzso family members will open new avenues for the treatment of many zzso
