zzso profiles of zzso H5N1 viruses representing major genetic zzso and various geographic sources were investigated using a panel of 17 zzso zzso raised from five H5N1 zzso Four zzso groups from seven zzso of H5N1 virus were distinguished and characterized based on their zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with the variation of zzso of H5N1 strains were identified and further verified in zzso analysis with zzso H5N1 viruses carrying specific zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of some of these genetic variations produced marked improvement to the zzso and zzso of H5N1 strains in zzso utilizing zzso zzso and ferret zzso raised against zzso 1 and 2 H5N1 zzso suggesting that these sites represent zzso significant zzso zzso These results provide a comprehensive zzso profile for H5N1 virus strains circulating in recent years and will facilitate the recognition of emerging zzso zzso of H5N1 virus and aid in the selection of vaccine zzso
