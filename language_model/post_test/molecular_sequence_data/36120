zzso detection of chicken anemia virus zzso DNA in zzso and zzso was investigated by a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Using a pair of zzso constructed to amplify the coding sequence of the zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso was shown to be extremely sensitive, being able to detect 1 zzso of zzso zzso form zzso The zzso zzso used for the zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso amplified product, which was sized by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso samples from seven cases of suspected chicken infectious anemia were obtained for zzso zzso DNA extracted from the zzso suspension of pooled zzso of each case was analyzed by the zzso zzso zzso showed that five of the seven cases were positive for zzso DNA by zzso whereas zzso was isolated from four cases zzso The zzso zzso also detected zzso DNA in two of 37 serum samples from zzso zzso The specificity of zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso analysis of the amplified zzso
