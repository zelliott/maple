zzso virus complement control protein zzso has been shown to possess the ability to inhibit both classical and alternative complement zzso zzso The newly found ability of this protein to bind to zzso has been shown in previous studies to result in zzso by mast cells, possibly promoting tissue zzso It has also been shown to reduce zzso migration of zzso by blocking zzso zzso In addition, this study shows that zzso its ability to bind to zzso zzso zzso on the surface of human zzso zzso able to block zzso binding to surface major zzso complex class I zzso Since zzso binding is critical for many functions of this zzso we have attempted to characterize the molecular basis for this zzso zzso of this zzso generated by genetic engineering of the DNA zzso zzso into the zzso zzso expression system, were used to zzso the regions with zzso binding zzso These regions were then analyzed to more specifically define their properties for zzso It was found that the number of putative binding sites zzso the overall positive charge, and the percentage of positively charged zzso acids within the protein were responsible for this zzso
