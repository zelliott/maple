A zzso analogue of zzso zzso with zzso zzso for zzso at position 9 zzso zzso has been zzso as a precursor for the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso have been prepared by attaching zzso and a zzso zzso capable of zzso either alone or in zzso to the zzso group of zzso at position 9 in zzso The binding characteristics of these novel zzso have been determined at the zzso and V2 zzso receptors by employing membrane preparations of rat liver and kidney zzso All of the zzso zzso during the course of this study bound zzso and with high zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the strategies described in this paper provide a convenient means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with preservation of zzso high affinity binding zzso These parameters establish the potential value of the zzso as zzso for investigating zzso zzso structure and zzso
