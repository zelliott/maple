zzso sequence database searching of tandem mass zzso data is commonly employed to identify zzso modifications zzso to peptides in global zzso zzso In these studies, the accurate identification of these modified peptides relies on strategies to ensure zzso results from sequence database searching in which differential mass shift parameters are employed to identify zzso to specific zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as an example zzso we have observed that the inclusion of differential modification information in sequence database searching dramatically increases the potential for zzso sequence matches to modified zzso making the confident identification of true sequence matches zzso In a zzso study of whole cell zzso zzso we demonstrate the combination of zzso zzso focusing using zzso zzso and an adjusted zzso zzso point prediction algorithm, as an effective means to increase the confidence of zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate the potential utility of this general strategy for improving the identification of zzso which cause a shift to the intrinsic zzso point of zzso
