zzso use trans zzso to place a common zzso zzso sequence on the zzso ends of all of their zzso To identify likely participants in this reaction, we used zzso directed against the characteristic U zzso zzso zzso cap to zzso six candidate U zzso from total zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis using zzso zzso constructed from partial zzso sequence indicated that the four largest zzso (A through zzso are zzso by zzso genes that are not closely linked to one zzso We have cloned and zzso these zzso mapped the zzso ends of the zzso zzso and identified three of the zzso as the zzso U2, zzso and zzso zzso by virtue of their sequences and structural zzso with the corresponding zzso U zzso The fourth zzso zzso B zzso zzso was not sufficiently similar to known U zzso to allow us to propose an zzso Surprisingly, none of these U zzso contained the consensus zzso zzso site, a feature totally zzso among several classes of U zzso including U2 and zzso Similarly, the sequence of the U2 zzso region shown to be involved in zzso zzso recognition in zzso and exactly zzso in zzso U2 zzso was totally divergent in zzso Like all other zzso zzso zzso zzso did not contain a zzso cap and was zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso because of its association with the zzso zzso zzso These two zzso contained extensive regions of sequence zzso which zzso support the zzso model proposed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1988) for the organization of the analogous zzso zzso zzso
