The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso contains at least four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence analysis of two zzso has revealed many single zzso zzso and zzso zzso including several large structural zzso The physical positions of 101 zzso zzso zzso are not distributed zzso across the zzso and are instead concentrated within three zzso hot zzso Two of these zzso hot spots are zzso zzso and zzso and one is apparently zzso The zzso gene is not a zzso hot zzso Thus, these results suggest that not all hot spots are genes and indicate that not all genes are hot zzso Two of the 101 zzso events arose by means of either zzso events involving conversion tract lengths of at least 17 zzso or zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso mapped to the approximately zzso zzso portion of the zzso zzso that contains large amounts of repetitive DNA including zzso in this region the ratio of genetic to physical distance is less than zzso of the zzso zzso These results establish that the zzso faction of the zzso zzso is relatively zzso zzso
