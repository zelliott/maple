An zzso was isolated from a culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso ex zzso zzso grown on zzso zzso as carbon zzso It was zzso to zzso zzso by ammonium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso The relative molecular mass of the native zzso zzso was 158 zzso determined by gel zzso and it is a zzso (Mr zzso zzso 61 zzso The optimal temperature for zzso activity was in the range zzso zzso This zzso showed a high zzso retaining 94 % of its activity after zzso at 60 zzso for 2 zzso The optimal pH for the zzso was zzso and it was stable from pH 3 to zzso when the zzso took place at 60 zzso for 2 zzso It was active against several zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is a zzso with 26 % of structural zzso zzso was a zzso inhibitor with a Ki zzso 22 zzso versus zzso and 12 zzso versus zzso as zzso zzso was a simple competitive inhibitor with a Ki zzso 10 zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso were also zzso of this activity, suggesting the presence of zzso groups in the active site of the zzso On the basis of the sequence of the zzso zzso the studied zzso would be a member of zzso zzso family 36 zzso zzso Given the high optimum temperature and heat stability of zzso zzso zzso this fungus may become a useful source of zzso production for multiple zzso
