zzso during pregnancy in zzso zzso endemic regions is a major cause of mortality and severe zzso zzso is the zzso zzso responsible for zzso of zzso zzso infected zzso to the zzso zzso zzso A zzso in the zzso and is the leading candidate for a zzso malaria zzso zzso induced in rats against the zzso zzso domain of zzso inhibit the binding of a number of laboratory and field zzso zzso to zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso to identify zzso targeted by zzso zzso that inhibit zzso of infected zzso We identified three regions of overlapping peptides which were highly zzso One zzso region distinguished itself particularly by showing a clear difference in the binding profile of highly zzso blocking zzso compared to the zzso with low capacity to inhibit zzso zzso to zzso This region was further characterized and together these results suggest that even though zzso against the synthetic peptides which cover this region did not recognize native zzso the results using the zzso domain suggest that this linear zzso might be involved in the induction of zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso
