The zzso zzso virus zzso DNA zzso gene has been identified and mapped to the zzso D zzso near the zzso of the zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso S zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso D which encompasses the zzso gene and two zzso genes has been determined and zzso Both the zzso DNA zzso and the two zzso genes are closely related in terms of sequence and spatial organization to the zzso sequences from the zzso of the zzso virus zzso indicating that these proteins are zzso not only in their sequence but also by position within the zzso zzso To confirm the assignment of the zzso zzso the putative zzso DNA zzso has been expressed as an active fusion protein in zzso coli and this system should be useful in the analysis of zzso function following the introduction of targeted zzso into the zzso zzso The results of this work shed further light on the evolutionary relationship of the different zzso zzso and indicate that central unique regions of the zzso zzso contain many of the essential viral genes and are thus highly zzso
