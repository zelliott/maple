zzso cell recognition in zzso the oldest living zzso is based on a zzso zzso zzso We have screened individual sponge zzso libraries, identifying multiple related forms for the zzso factor core protein zzso Northern blots show the presence in several human zzso of transcripts strongly binding a zzso zzso The open reading frame for zzso is not interrupted in the zzso direction, revealing variable protein sequences that contain numerous zzso equally zzso We have studied tissue zzso within a sponge population, finding zzso correlation between rejection behavior and the zzso restriction zzso length zzso pattern using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso showed that at least some of the zzso forms are zzso and distribute in the population zzso A pronounced zzso is also observed when analyzing zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bands indicates that zzso are also responsible for the zzso The data presented reveal a high zzso of zzso factor zzso which matches the elevated sponge zzso suggesting an involvement of the cell zzso system in sponge zzso zzso
