The major outer membrane protein zzso zzso 1) of zzso zzso has been produced as inclusion bodies in zzso zzso with the aim to develop a vaccine based on zzso The protein produced in high yield in zzso zzso contained an zzso extension of 11 zzso acid zzso which was found to be necessary for expression in the production zzso In the present study we asked whether or not the removal of this extension would effect the zzso of this protein in zzso as judged by its zzso zzso A zzso was engineered in front of the mature zzso protein to provide a chemical zzso site for zzso to remove the zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso high zzso of zzso binding to the zzso cells similarly to the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso protein can serve as an effective vaccine component irrespective of the presence, or absence, of this zzso zzso
