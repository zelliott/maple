zzso factor zzso inhibitor zzso is a zzso protein which zzso two of the active zzso zzso present during normal blood zzso zzso of both of these zzso factors zzso and zzso is thought to require a factor zzso zzso To begin to investigate the interactions between factor zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso which zzso for the second zzso domain zzso of zzso were zzso zzso and partially zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was accomplished using an zzso coli expression system which produced the zzso at an expression level of approximately zzso of total cell zzso The zzso was localized to zzso zzso bodies which were zzso by reduction in the presence of zzso and the soluble protein zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso mixture using a zzso procedure employing gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso was zzso to apparent zzso as determined by zzso quantitative zzso acid, zzso degradation, and zzso mass zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso The product bound to factor zzso zzso coupled to a solid support in the presence of zzso sodium zzso demonstrating its affinity for this zzso zzso of zzso zzso with factor zzso zzso with zzso zzso the ability of factor zzso to zzso a small zzso zzso Additionally, zzso prolonged the time to zzso formation in a zzso zzso dependent on factor zzso zzso Finally, this zzso mildly prolonged the zzso and modified zzso times of normal pooled zzso Taken together this data demonstrates that this region of zzso zzso factor zzso activity and allows for further characterization of this zzso zzso
