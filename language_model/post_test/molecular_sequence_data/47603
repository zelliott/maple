zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequences from 31 strains of zzso zzso revealed the presence of four distinct zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists only of zzso from zzso zzso strains and is divergent from other zzso zzso from the evolutionary zzso There have been conflicting reports regarding the zzso activity of zzso in the mouse model system; zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso function as an zzso in mice, while a zzso zzso zzso does not play a dominant role as an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso regulator knockout zzso To further examine the zzso activity of zzso we expressed in zzso coli a zzso protein consisting of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We found that this fusion protein caused zzso in the majority zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso This study confirmed and extended that group A zzso zzso were able to induce zzso in zzso mice and had an zzso zzso
