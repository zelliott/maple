zzso zzso zzso from dog and from red fox were compared in transmission trials and with molecular analysis using zzso technique and comparison of the zzso zzso After oral infection of zzso with 20,000 zzso zzso zzso eggs of zzso and canine origin, the vertical transmission to zzso was zzso All animals of both groups developed typical clinical symptoms of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and post zzso results showed no differences between both zzso except for the zzso of zzso zzso stages in mice where the fox isolate showed a significant higher zzso than the dog zzso The zzso showed a similarity zzso of zzso similar to the range of zzso variation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso specimens as zzso The zzso comparison showed a zzso identity between both zzso with no zzso zzso zzso the study shows that the fox and the dog isolate of zzso zzso were identical in zzso transmission and molecular zzso a host adaptation could not be found and the fox has to be seen as a zzso for zzso zzso infections in zzso Considering the increasing number of zzso in urban areas the importance of zzso control in dogs is zzso
