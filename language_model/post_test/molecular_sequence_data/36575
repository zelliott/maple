A fully automated instrument for multiple simultaneous zzso synthesis was constructed to provide large numbers of peptides for zzso zzso The synthesis is performed in a zzso mode with the conventional solid supports contained in 48 individual reaction zzso The instrument is based on a commercial zzso equipped with a zzso syringe for accurate delivery of zzso and a robot arm carrying a zzso zzso Dedicated software was developed to compile overlapping peptides from a given protein sequence and to control all functions of the zzso In zzso zzso by zzso was chosen as the zzso chemistry zzso The peptides are zzso from the zzso in the zzso used for zzso thus minimizing zzso Performance of the instrument was demonstrated by synthesis of overlapping zzso peptides derived from the sequence of zzso reversed zzso A second mode of operation allows the synthesis to be carried out on the surface of zzso zzso zzso derived from the sequence of human zzso were zzso using this method and used to characterize zzso raised against the intact zzso
