Using a large database of protein zzso zzso we test a new method for distinguishing zzso and zzso structural zzso The zzso neighbors included in the test set show no zzso sequence zzso but they may be well superimposed and show functional similarity or other evidence of evolutionary zzso zzso neighbors also show no sequence similarity and may be well zzso but they have different functions and their structural similarity may be the result of zzso zzso zzso results of other zzso we find that remote zzso and zzso are not well distinguished by measures of zzso structural zzso including the percentage of identical zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We show, however, that with zzso alignments of analogous neighbors rarely zzso the particular zzso that is shared among zzso zzso We call this characteristic zzso the zzso core structure zzso and we show that a zzso test for presence of the zzso correctly identifies zzso of remote zzso with a zzso rate of zzso zzso significantly better than discrimination by zzso or other measures of zzso zzso The zzso describes conservation of spatial structure within a protein family in much the way that a sequence motif describes sequence zzso We suggest that it may be used in the same way, to identify zzso neighbors at greater evolutionary distance than is possible by zzso zzso
