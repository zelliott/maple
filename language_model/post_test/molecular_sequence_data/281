How zzso factors interpret the output from signal zzso pathways to drive distinct programs of gene expression is a key issue that zzso development and zzso The zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso upstream stimulating zzso binds zzso regulatory elements zzso to regulate a wide number of gene zzso In particular, zzso is a key component of the zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso on zzso 153 and directly zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, how zzso on zzso might affect the activity of zzso is zzso Here we show that, in response to DNA damage, zzso stress and cellular infection zzso is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is nuclear and interacts with DNA but displays altered gene regulatory zzso zzso zzso is thus proposed to be associated with loss of zzso zzso properties toward several target genes implicated in pigmentation process and cell cycle zzso The identification of this critical zzso zzso modification gives new insights into understanding zzso gene expression zzso associated with cancer zzso
