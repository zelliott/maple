The impact of elevated seawater temperature on bacterial communities within the marine sponge zzso zzso was zzso zzso were exposed to temperatures ranging between 27 and 33 degrees zzso No differences in bacterial community composition or sponge health were detected in treatments between 27 and 31 degrees zzso In contrast, sponges exposed to 33 degrees C exhibited a complete loss of the primary cultivated zzso within 24 h and cellular necrosis after 3 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and clone sequence analysis detected a dramatic shift in bacterial community composition between 31 and 33 degrees zzso Within the first 24 h most of the zzso bands detected in samples from 27 to 31 degrees C were absent from the 33 degrees C sponges whereas eight bands were detected exclusively in the 33 degrees C zzso The zzso zzso sequencing revealed that most of the microbes from sponges exposed to zzso degrees C had highest zzso to known zzso zzso In contrast, many of the microbes from sponges exposed to 33 degrees C were similar to sequences previously retrieved from diseased and zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone library analysis also detected a significant shift in bacterial community zzso The 27 degrees C library was composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the 33 degrees C library contained sequences from the zzso zzso and zzso The clear shifts in community composition at elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of zzso and to the establishment of alien microbial populations including potential zzso zzso of zzso and stress in the sponge occurred at temperatures identical to those reported for coral zzso indicating that sponges may be similarly threatened by climate zzso
