In development, T cells first express their alpha beta zzso receptors in the zzso where they may undergo selection processes leading to major zzso complex zzso restriction and zzso A high proportion of zzso are thought to fail this selection in some way and to be destined for zzso zzso These cells are zzso as the zzso zzso since they constitute most of the cortical zzso they express both zzso and zzso zzso but only very low levels of zzso class I zzso One suggested cause of zzso death is a failure to produce a functional alpha beta T cell zzso zzso due to errors in the zzso of zzso DNA, resulting in V regions being absent or incorrectly spliced to the other segments of the transcribed zzso We have zzso from the C region through to the V region of 14 rat zzso beta chain clones isolated from zzso zzso zzso Of the 14, 13 have complete and correct zzso whereas one was expressed from an zzso zzso Most of these clones are likely to be derived from the cortical population, for Northern zzso analysis showed that these cells and total zzso expressed similar amounts of beta chain zzso Furthermore, the zzso from zzso cells contained a very similar ratio of full-length to truncated beta chain zzso as did activated zzso and mature T zzso The data imply that defective beta chain gene zzso is not a major cause of failure in the selection of zzso The sequences of the rat zzso alpha and beta chain constant regions are also zzso
