zzso comprise a group of zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso By transformation with a disruption zzso zzso we disrupted the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in the inability of this strain to produce zzso zzso as well as a major yellow zzso in the zzso The disruption was attributed to a zzso zzso integration event between zzso and the recipient zzso zzso zzso at a specific zzso designated zzso zzso analysis suggest that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene involved in zzso wall zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were present in the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso No zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found, suggesting that zzso does not zzso zzso activities for processing zzso similar to those required for long chain fatty acid zzso The zzso gene is located in the zzso zzso gene cluster and is linked to the zzso zzso an zzso zzso gene required for converting zzso acid to zzso These two genes are zzso transcribed from a zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a zzso zzso gene required for the early steps of zzso zzso
