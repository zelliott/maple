The critical importance of zzso function for correct zzso migration during development of the cerebral zzso has been underscored by the identities of zzso zzso underlying a number of human zzso zzso The proteins affected include zzso a major zzso zzso and zzso components such as zzso and zzso zzso in these genes are associated with the anatomical zzso zzso which is believed to reflect failure of zzso zzso An important recent observation has been the dependence of cortical zzso migration upon zzso of zzso at zzso 40 by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a recognizable zzso zzso syndrome, characterized by generalized zzso in association with zzso nerve zzso zzso By zzso zzso we show that the molecular basis for this condition is zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of unknown function that is not susceptible to the zzso 40 zzso that regulates zzso function during cortical zzso zzso Together with the unique expression pattern of zzso within the developing cerebral cortex, these observations suggest a role for this zzso zzso component in regulating zzso brain zzso
