zzso zzso of zzso zzso relies upon zzso of whole cells to zzso zzso zzso This procedure is limited in providing maximum zzso information because some zzso in whole cells are masked and because zzso are currently unavailable for some zzso To address masking of zzso in whole cells, we isolated outer membrane zzso zzso from nine representative zzso strains that were isolated zzso in the province of zzso zzso the zzso were used in zzso zzso zzso for zzso to zzso and improved zzso information was zzso A recent proposal assigns zzso based on deduced zzso acid sequences in the variable regions of the class 1 outer membrane zzso This scheme maintains the zzso nomenclature that is based on zzso to zzso by defining the sequences in the zzso recognized by the zzso We used this technique to assign zzso to the zzso strains isolated in zzso For the strains tested, zzso using zzso and zzso based on deduced zzso acid sequences were in complete zzso zzso using deduced zzso acid sequences is superior because it does not depend on the availability of zzso
