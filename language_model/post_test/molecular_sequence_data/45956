To determine if increased negative B cell selection, due to lowered signaling threshold of responsiveness to a zzso as a result of zzso zzso during zzso leads to the origin of zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso zzso zzso from zzso viable zzso zzso and 24 zzso zzso zzso from normal zzso zzso zzso h zzso B cells were examined for their structural zzso None of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso had the characteristic zzso size restriction or zzso zzso noted in zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso genes are expressed at a high frequency in zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso and zzso gene expression is exclusively zzso noted in zzso B zzso Clearly, there is a trend toward higher expression of zzso genes zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso zzso from zzso has increased hotspot triplets zzso to zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso A higher zzso zzso expression is noted in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in contrast to zzso The sophisticated zzso zzso and odds ratio analysis of zzso zzso and zzso expressions in zzso B cells from zzso and zzso mice demonstrates differential composition of the germ line zzso repertoire as a result of zzso zzso These observations suggest that increased negative B cell selection during zzso zzso the developing zzso zzso repertoire but does not directly lead to generation of zzso zzso zzso
