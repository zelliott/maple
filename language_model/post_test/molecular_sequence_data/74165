Sex determination in zzso zzso zzso is governed by zzso at a single locus zzso the complementary sex zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the well-studied sex zzso system of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso are zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso Although at least 15 different zzso zzso are known among natural bee zzso the mechanisms linking zzso interactions to switching of the sexual development zzso are still zzso Here we report a new component of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 12 zzso upstream of zzso The gene zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso gene from which zzso arose and encodes an zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso shares the same arrangement of zzso and zzso with the zzso principal zzso gene zzso zzso but lacks zzso motifs except for a zzso motif that zzso shares only with zzso of another fly, zzso zzso Like zzso the zzso transcript is alternatively zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains a premature stop zzso and yields no functional product, whereas the zzso zzso zzso encodes the functional zzso We show that zzso interference zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso result in male zzso indicating that the zzso product is required for entire female zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of female zzso zzso transcripts result in the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso gene zzso the switch of zzso pathways controlled by zzso at zzso Comparative analysis of zzso and zzso coding sequences from five bee species indicates a recent origin of zzso in the zzso lineage from the zzso zzso and provides evidence for positive selection at zzso accompanied by zzso selection at zzso The zzso locus in bees zzso gene zzso and positive selection as evolutionary mechanisms underlying the origin of a novel sex determination zzso
