A zzso zzso designated as zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and some unique features of the gene were zzso The zzso gene zzso a zzso of zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso had zzso identity with zzso in zzso acid sequence and was two zzso longer than zzso Two open reading frames zzso designated as zzso and zzso were present upstream of the zzso and showed high zzso with the corresponding zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso from zzso contained a region of repeated zzso However, unlike zzso zzso formed the zzso zzso inclusions when the zzso gene was expressed in an zzso zzso zzso strain in the absence of the upstream zzso Furthermore, zzso was less toxic to a zzso species, zzso zzso than zzso in spite of high zzso between the two zzso
