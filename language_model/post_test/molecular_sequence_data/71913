zzso of zzso zzso contain a zzso acid zzso zzso A zzso required for generating the unusual zzso zzso A found in this zzso The zzso has been zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso As shown by zzso and zzso zzso studies, the zzso zzso not only the zzso of zzso zzso but also the transfer the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to generate zzso Like the zzso the zzso activity is not present in zzso coli, zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The specific activity for the zzso reaction is about 2 times higher than that of the zzso The zzso zzso conditions are similar to those used for zzso zzso except that zzso and zzso are zzso The apparent zzso for zzso is approximately 500 zzso versus zzso zzso for most zzso zzso but the zzso specific activity in crude cell extracts is higher than that of most zzso zzso The zzso is absolutely specific for the zzso of zzso and is highly selective for zzso as the zzso The zzso can be zzso from zzso or zzso zzso with zzso A zzso intermediate may account for the dual function of this zzso since a single zzso protein species (Mr approximately zzso can be trapped and zzso by zzso gel zzso of zzso preparations incubated with zzso zzso Although zzso is not detected in cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso may be zzso during zzso or supplied by plant zzso given that soybean zzso is an excellent zzso zzso A bacterial zzso for generating zzso and a direct link between zzso A and zzso zzso have not been reported zzso
