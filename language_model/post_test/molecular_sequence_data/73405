zzso zzso G virus zzso is a newly identified zzso zzso The aim of the study was to compare three primer pairs from the zzso untranslated region zzso envelope region 2 zzso 2) and zzso region 3 zzso 3) of zzso zzso for their ability to detect zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso By using zzso with zzso from different regions of the viral zzso serum zzso zzso was zzso in 200 zzso zzso The sensitivity of this zzso was assessed by a zzso experiment, and zzso sequences of the amplified products were determined zzso Of 200 serum samples, 43 zzso were positive for zzso zzso with at least one of the primer zzso The positive rates by zzso zzso 3, and E 2 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the sensitivity of zzso zzso using zzso zzso was 10 to 100 times more likely to detect zzso zzso than that of zzso 3 and E 2 zzso The average zzso of amplified targets to the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso and the similarity between each amplified target was up to zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso E 2, and zzso 3 regions, zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso is highly zzso and zzso deduced from this region can zzso sensitive and specific zzso zzso for zzso zzso
