zzso zzso zzso were designed to cleave at a zzso accessible site in long zzso zzso and normal human rod zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso is expected to rescue zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso caused by rod zzso zzso 

Energy zzso zzso predicted regions in human rod zzso zzso accessible to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated by in zzso zzso zzso zzso reactions were performed in zzso at various zzso ratios with appropriate controls and analyzed on zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso in a predicted zzso loop was selected as the target zzso zzso zzso were designed to stabilize zzso core zzso zzso reactions with normal and representative zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a decrease of long and short zzso targets and zzso appearance of zzso zzso zzso targeting was proved by lack of zzso of a normal zzso engineered with a silently altered zzso zzso 

zzso zzso targeting all known zzso zzso zzso human rod zzso zzso at the intended target site in zzso These zzso may reduce total zzso zzso and protein in rod zzso as a gene therapy zzso A beneficial outcome on rod survival in zzso is expected although normal zzso levels, already in zzso would also zzso zzso zzso attack an accessible site common to all zzso zzso to avoid redesign and zzso for each new dominant zzso This strategy can be extended to any dominant disease affecting genes normally expressed in zzso
