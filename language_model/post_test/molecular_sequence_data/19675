zzso shell formation is a complicated and highly controlled calcium metabolism zzso Previous studies revealed that several zzso zzso proteins actively participate in the regulation of shell zzso In this study, we cloned a full-length zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso protein (named zzso from the pearl zzso zzso zzso according to the zzso motifs of zzso Although it shares high similarity with the zzso family in its zzso signatures, zzso just has two zzso motifs and belongs to a new separate group from the other zzso proteins according to a zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in shell zzso zzso zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso Moreover, its expression responds quickly only to the shell damage, but not to the damage of other zzso and the infection of the zzso from zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might be an important regulator of shell zzso This finding may help better understand the functions of zzso proteins on the regulation of zzso shell zzso
