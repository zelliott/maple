zzso DNA in zzso is associated with zzso repression and inactive zzso Two activities have been identified, zzso and zzso which bind specifically to DNA containing zzso zzso In this report we characterize zzso We show that it is more abundant than zzso is more tightly bound in the nucleus, and is distinguishable zzso The two proteins share widespread expression in zzso zzso cells, and barely zzso expression in early embryonic zzso zzso containing zzso which has a zzso group at position 5 are not zzso for the zzso The possible role of zzso in zzso gene zzso was tested in in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso from both zzso and zzso DNA templates in zzso probably due to the presence of zzso DNA binding zzso within the zzso We zzso that zzso normally binds zzso DNA in the context of zzso contributing to the long-term repression and zzso of zzso
