Recent evidence suggests that the surface fluid zzso by human airway zzso cells contains zzso zzso The identification of the zzso responsible for the zzso activity in airway surface fluid may bring new insights into lung defense mechanisms and the zzso of zzso zzso are small zzso peptides with zzso zzso activity, and are therefore candidates for the bacterial killing factor in airway surface zzso They are produced in zzso zzso and zzso of several zzso To date no zzso have been isolated from human airway zzso however, such peptides are produced by bovine airway zzso A zzso zzso for a human zzso zzso was recently cloned from the zzso We cloned the full-length coding sequence for zzso from human airway zzso The zzso acid sequence for zzso shared zzso with the zzso and mature peptides of other zzso including bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By Northern analysis, a single approximately zzso zzso transcript was expressed in airway zzso zzso protection analysis demonstrated that zzso transcripts were more abundant in the conducting airways than the gas exchange regions of human lung and that the expression was zzso zzso Human zzso may contribute to the zzso activity of airway surface fluid and play a role in the zzso defenses of the zzso
