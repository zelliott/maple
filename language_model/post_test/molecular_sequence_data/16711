zzso proteins that belong to the major zzso zzso zzso are found in organisms across the evolutionary spectrum and mediate the transport of a variety of zzso ranging from small zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a representative MFS zzso and exchanges zzso for zzso across the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we present a structural model for the protein zzso changes that occur during zzso transport by combining a three-dimensional map of the zzso zzso state of zzso at zzso A determined by zzso zzso with a model of the zzso state of zzso based on the atomic structures of the related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the principal structural change associated with zzso transport is a concerted rocking movement of the two structurally similar halves of the protein relative to each zzso Our structural model places two positively charged zzso zzso and zzso in the central zzso suggesting that zzso interactions between these zzso and the zzso zzso is a key step in generating the zzso change between the open and closed states of the zzso
