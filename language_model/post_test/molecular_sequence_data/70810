zzso virus zzso is a newly identified zzso DNA zzso We zzso zzso serum samples from zzso patients, infected with both zzso C virus zzso and zzso and who had been treated with zzso An elevated serum zzso zzso level after zzso was associated with persistence of zzso zzso in five of seven patients with persistence of zzso compared with normal in all nine patients who showed zzso of zzso irrespective of persistence of zzso zzso of partial viral DNA zzso sequences and zzso analysis showed that viral strains that had a high identity to the zzso virus were more resistant to zzso than those showing low zzso sequence zzso Although we observed no liver cell injury caused by persistent zzso infection, the zzso of zzso resistance to zzso should be further investigated for a better understanding of viral diseases and establishment of zzso
