zzso This study set out to examine the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso zzso This was done in isolated vessels zzso zzso in diameter, incubated with a selective zzso and the novel zzso zzso to part of the human zzso zzso zzso Groups of vessels zzso zzso 6) were incubated with increasing zzso of zzso zzso from 1 to 100 zzso which caused a zzso zzso contraction at the highest dose with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, in six other vessels zzso zzso over the same dose range gave a minimal contraction zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of six vessels with the zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso had no effect on the zzso induced zzso in terms of displacement of the zzso curve or the zzso tension achieved by the zzso In the six vessels exposed to 4 zzso zzso zzso there was a significant shift of the zzso curve and a lower zzso at zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso At the highest zzso of zzso zzso there was a marked suppression of all responses to zzso which at the zzso zzso tested, zzso zzso only reached some zzso of the zzso achievable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso up to 2 zzso in vessels incubated with 40 zzso zzso showed that the blockade could be overcome and that the relationship was shifted to the right zzso zzso zzso by approximately one log unit with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso plot of the data indicated the zzso to be acting competitively at a single population of zzso zzso At the highest zzso tested, 40 zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso indicating a lack of zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that at the rat zzso zzso artery the zzso zzso is the zzso functional zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this study has shown the potential usefulness of this novel type of zzso zzso in blocking zzso zzso
