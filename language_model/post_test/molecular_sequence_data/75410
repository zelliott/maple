The gene zzso the mouse zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso has been isolated on five partially overlapping zzso zzso zzso We have characterized the gene and found that it is split between ten zzso distributed over approximately 70 zzso of the X zzso The zzso range in size from 88 bases to the relatively unusual size of approximately 26 zzso while the zzso zzso zzso sequences conform to the consensus established for other zzso zzso
