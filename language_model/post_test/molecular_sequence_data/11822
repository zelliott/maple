zzso zzso and zzso are small zzso that regulate the formation of a variety of zzso structures and the assembly of associated zzso complexes, but little is known about the target proteins that mediate their zzso Here we have used a zzso search method to identify putative zzso proteins for zzso and zzso A search of the zzso data base for similarity with the minimum zzso interactive binding zzso region of a potential zzso protein zzso has identified over 25 proteins containing a similar motif from a range of different zzso These candidate zzso proteins include family members of the mixed lineage zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso a human protein zzso and several novel zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and a candidate protein from zzso zzso zzso interact strongly with the zzso form of both zzso and zzso but not zzso in a filter binding zzso Three additional candidate zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed binding to the zzso form of zzso and weaker binding with zzso and again no interaction with zzso These results indicate that proteins containing the zzso motif bind to zzso and/or zzso in a zzso manner, and they may, therefore, participate in downstream zzso
