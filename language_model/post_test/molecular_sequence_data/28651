The structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli shows that the protein consists of highly similar N and C terminal zzso zzso matches suggest that this fold is widespread among different species, including zzso Many of these zzso are zzso but apparently connected with the metabolism of aromatic zzso The domain shows similar zzso to the C terminal domain of zzso zzso zzso a functionally related zzso despite lacking significant overall sequence zzso zzso is known to catalyze two rather different zzso and comparisons with zzso allow some tentative conclusions to be drawn about the active zzso Key zzso within the active site apparently allow zzso with this fold to carry out a variety chemical zzso
