The origin of the H5N1 influenza viruses that killed six of zzso infected humans in 1997 and were highly zzso in chickens has not been zzso These H5N1 viruses transmitted directly to humans from infected zzso In the poultry markets in Hong Kong, both H5N1 and zzso influenza viruses were zzso raising the possibility of genetic zzso Here we analyze the zzso and genetic features of zzso influenza viruses with different zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest three distinct zzso Among the chicken zzso zzso six of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken zzso virus isolated in China, whereas the zzso and zzso genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail zzso zzso zzso zzso that many of the 1997 chicken zzso zzso in the markets were zzso The similarity of the internal genes of zzso virus to those of the H5N1 influenza viruses suggests that the quail virus may have been the internal gene zzso Our findings indicate that the human and poultry H5N1 influenza viruses in Hong Kong in 1997 were zzso that obtained internal gene segments from zzso However, we cannot be certain whether the replicate complex of H5N1 originated from zzso or whether the reverse transfer zzso the available evidence supports the former zzso
