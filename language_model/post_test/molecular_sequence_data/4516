We report the molecular zzso zzso mapping and zzso zzso pattern of a putative zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso transcript of this first zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso deduced zzso The zzso protein contains a approximately zzso zzso zzso domain flanked by extensive zzso and zzso sequences showing no similarities to other zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso on the X zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso is zzso zzso accumulating zzso during early zzso zzso and late zzso zzso zzso The presented molecular zzso provides the basis for a genetic dissection of zzso zzso
