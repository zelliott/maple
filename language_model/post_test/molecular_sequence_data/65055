In this work, we report the characterization of a novel zzso gene zzso whose expression is regulated by a number of zzso nuclear receptors (including liver X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso and zzso nuclear zzso which have been shown to be involved in zzso zzso zzso encodes a previously zzso protein with similarity to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso has zzso zzso zzso However, zzso has a highly zzso zzso pattern of expression with its zzso counterpart and is regulated in a distinct manner by several different nuclear zzso The identification of the liver zzso zzso and its characterization as a target of zzso nuclear receptors implies the existence of a previously unknown nuclear zzso signaling zzso that links zzso and zzso zzso
