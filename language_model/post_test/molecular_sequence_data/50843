Southern zzso studies on zzso B zzso zzso DNA integration in 13 human zzso zzso zzso patients revealed the presence of several distinct zzso integration sites in different human liver disease zzso In one zzso patient the DNA zzso containing the zzso integration also zzso to an zzso B zzso The zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was cloned and zzso and showed that zzso DNA is integrated next to a cellular DNA zzso which is zzso to the zzso protein zzso domain of the human zzso growth factor zzso gene and other cell surface zzso zzso The zzso cellular DNA sequence is expressed in this zzso patient, suggesting a possible role for this gene in zzso
