zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli was fully zzso at 65 degrees C, according to zzso zzso by zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso as the active site directed inhibitor by a slight modification of zzso procedure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 46, zzso The determination of kinetic zzso for the zzso showed that the process took place through the formation of a stabilized zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies suggested that the zzso intermediate complex was formed more rapidly and zzso at a lower rate than it was for other zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso determined by zzso mass zzso analysis, revealed that one zzso of the inhibitor was zzso bound to each zzso zzso The binding site for zzso B zzso was identified by the isolation and partial sequence analysis of the radioactive zzso obtained by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tandem mass analysis of the labeled zzso showed that the inhibitor was zzso bound to zzso This result, in agreement with data obtained from sequence alignments of zzso zzso zzso with other zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso family 1 zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso acid zzso in the active site of the zzso
