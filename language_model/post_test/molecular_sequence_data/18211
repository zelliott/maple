zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in several zzso processes and they may also play a direct role in the plant's defense against zzso zzso In an effort to characterize the zzso gene family, complementary DNA clones zzso an zzso form of zzso have been isolated from zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso coli and shown to zzso a zzso zzso The protein sequence zzso by the zzso was found to match the partial protein sequence of zzso a previously characterized zzso The protein zzso by the zzso was zzso from the zzso fluid of zzso tobacco leaves and found by zzso methods to zzso to zzso zzso From a detailed analysis of the zzso it is clear that this zzso represents a third structural class of zzso which differs substantially from both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso It has previously been demonstrated that the basic form of zzso is zzso as a zzso and upon maturation the 21 zzso acid signal zzso and a 22 zzso acid zzso zzso are zzso This processing event has been proposed to be involved with the zzso zzso of the zzso By comparing the deduced protein structure of zzso to that of the basic form it is evident that this zzso zzso is missing the zzso 22 zzso zzso The role of a zzso zzso zzso in the processing of zzso and other zzso proteins from tobacco is zzso
