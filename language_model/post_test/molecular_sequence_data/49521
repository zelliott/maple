zzso are highly endangered species and their protection warrants immediate remedial zzso Development of DNA markers is zzso to complement global efforts of the conservation of these extant zzso zzso associated sequence amplification zzso of DNA from Indian zzso zzso zzso and three zzso of South African black zzso zzso zzso was carried out using a primer based on consensus sequence of the zzso repeat locus zzso Several bands in the range of zzso zzso zzso to 650 base pairs zzso were identified that were useful for successful differentiation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Of these fragments, a zzso zzso one, unique to zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso The band patterns uncovered by zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso may be zzso as a tool for zzso the zzso zzso zzso from that of zzso zzso This approach may also be adopted for the development of zzso genetic zzso useful for identification of other endangered zzso
