zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of putative regulatory proteins attached to specific sequences of the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso gene in normal human zzso The pattern of zzso interactions observed for the human zzso promoter in freshly isolated human zzso cells was identical to that seen in DNA from the zzso line zzso The protein interactions involving the human zzso zzso promoter spanned a region from positions zzso to zzso relative to the cap site which encompasses that part of the zzso zzso promoter previously shown by deletion analysis to zzso virus zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso performed on isolated zzso revealed a pattern of zzso interactions for the promoter region of the zzso zzso gene similar to that obtained with zzso zzso performed on whole cells, with the appearance or disappearance of only a few additional protected zzso outside the region identified by the use of zzso These results provide the first direct evidence for the presence of proteins bound in zzso to those parts of the zzso zzso promoter between positions zzso and zzso previously shown by deletion analysis to zzso virus zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The pattern of zzso interactions observed for the zzso zzso promoter after virus induction was identical to that seen before zzso in keeping with the finding that many zzso zzso are present in both induced and zzso zzso
