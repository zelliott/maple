For small zzso zzso zzso derivatives can be obtained by zzso synthetic versions that incorporate modified zzso such as zzso or zzso However, such a synthetic approach is not yet feasible for zzso greater than approximately 40 zzso We have been investigating zzso a zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso whose structure was solved recently (Cate zzso et zzso 1996, Science zzso To incorporate zzso a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso segment, containing the majority of the zzso was transcribed in zzso using a zzso zzso zzso to cleave the nascent transcript and give a zzso 3' zzso A synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the remainder of the sequence was then zzso to the transcribed piece of zzso The resulting zzso appeared structurally and functionally sound as judged by zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso Four versions of this zzso system with zzso zzso at different positions zzso under the same conditions as the native zzso yielding two useful zzso derivatives of zzso The position of the zzso atoms for the derivatives could be determined in the absence of phase information, and an zzso electron density map was calculated using only the data from the two zzso zzso This approach is expected to be readily adaptable to other large, structured zzso zzso
