zzso were made on a simplified protein zzso zzso zzso achieve better computer simulation of protein zzso To check the zzso of such improvements, we chose the zzso folding protein zzso zzso as an example and explored several aspects of its zzso The zzso zzso is a mainly zzso protein of 61 zzso from zzso zzso We found that the simplified model of zzso zzso can fold into a global minimum state with a zzso structure in good agreement with its native zzso
