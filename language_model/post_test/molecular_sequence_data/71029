zzso is a novel zzso protein that has been shown to zzso to nuclear proteins in a manner analogous to zzso and zzso Recently, human zzso was reported to be zzso by a single zzso of zzso Here, we show that human zzso is also zzso by a single zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso in human zzso are sufficient for zzso In addition, the equivalent zzso fragments of other zzso have been shown to be zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso site revealed that zzso in human zzso is zzso by zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso at position zzso in zzso is zzso in all zzso family members, including human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and -5 and zzso zzso zzso suggesting the possibility that other zzso family members are zzso by zzso at a zzso zzso of equivalent zzso
