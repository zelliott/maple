We have examined the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso DNA fragments which contain isolated zzso binding zzso A 145 base pair zzso was prepared on the basis of the sequence of zzso DNA, which contained no zzso or zzso binding sites for these zzso zzso binding sites were introduced into this zzso at discrete locations where the minor groove is known to face toward or away from the protein core when zzso onto zzso core zzso The interaction of zzso with target sites on these zzso DNA fragments was assessed by zzso I zzso We find that zzso zzso can bind to single zzso sites which face both toward and away from the protein core, without affecting the zzso zzso zzso binding is also observed on zzso fragments which contain two or more drug binding sites, though in these cases the zzso are accompanied by the presence of new zzso products in positions which suggest that the zzso has caused a proportion of the DNA molecules to adopt a new zzso positioning on the protein zzso zzso zzso does not affect zzso zzso with any of these zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not able to bind to single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are observed on zzso fragments containing two or more zzso sites, but there are no changes in the zzso patterns in the remainder of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when included in the zzso zzso
