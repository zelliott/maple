Human gamma delta T cell clones having V gamma zzso and V delta zzso T cell zzso zzso gene zzso were isolated form an individual donor and tested for zzso restricted zzso against the B zzso cell line, zzso Most clones were highly zzso but zzso clones had very low activity, comparable to that of zzso alpha beta T cell zzso Although there was a tendency for clones with low zzso function to produce high levels of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso this correlation was not zzso zzso gamma and delta zzso sequences were obtained and were found to be different for all zzso There were no consistent structural differences between gamma delta zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but gamma or delta zzso regions of all three zzso clones had unusual zzso One clone had a particularly short gamma chain zzso zzso one had a short delta chain zzso sequence and the third clone was the only one of the panel which failed to zzso the D delta 3 zzso If the gamma delta zzso is involved in target cell recognition in this model of zzso restricted killing, such variations in zzso structure may be sufficient to inhibit recognition and thereby reduce the zzso capacity of a minority of V gamma zzso delta zzso zzso Also, a panel of gamma delta T cell clones expressing V gamma zzso delta 3 isolated from a different zzso were all highly zzso against zzso indicating that these target cells can be zzso by zzso cells expressing a zzso other than the V gamma zzso delta 2 zzso The possible influence of other cell surface molecules on zzso restricted zzso function is zzso
