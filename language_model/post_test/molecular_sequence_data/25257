zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso closely associated with an zzso zzso zzso system in zzso Its active form, zzso zzso zzso conversion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso We present here the zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso locations, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The isolated zzso for zzso zzso consists of zzso base zzso The open reading frame of 1,125 base pairs encodes a sequence zzso 29 zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the mature protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso Three potential zzso sites for zzso zzso chains were confirmed to be zzso Moreover, the zzso contains six zzso zzso chains in the zzso light chain generated after zzso The zzso site that accompanies zzso zzso by zzso active factor B, proved to be an zzso zzso The resulting zzso heavy chain is composed of a typical zzso zzso domain, with a sequence similar to that of human zzso factor zzso zzso or factor zzso zzso The light chain has a unique zzso domain which shows no significant zzso with any other known zzso Thus, this zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso domain and a structural domain not zzso identified in zzso and complement zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso is localized in large zzso of zzso
