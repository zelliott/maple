The zzso gene encodes a zinc zzso factor and frequently is rearranged in diffuse large cell zzso We have reported here the isolation of the zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso promoter region contains zzso box but no zzso box and a number of potential regulatory elements including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Studies of the promoter activity showed the first 657 zzso of the zzso region significantly drove zzso of the zzso reporter gene in human zzso zzso cell zzso
