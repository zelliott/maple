The fourth zzso domain of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso the C4 region of zzso 120 zzso is an zzso stretch of zzso acids that, based on zzso zzso constitutes a major component of the zzso binding region in zzso In the absence of zzso and zzso data on C4 in intact zzso we sought to gain insight into zzso zzso and accessibility in zzso by taking an zzso zzso In this study, a zzso composed of a repeat zzso of C4 zzso acids zzso from zzso of zzso was zzso for use as a zzso constrained zzso zzso zzso studies disclosed that the zzso zzso zzso in zzso M zzso zzso pH zzso at 25 degrees C contained a dominant zzso structure zzso zzso zzso compared with 2 zzso zzso zzso content for the zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso induced the production of rabbit zzso that recognized zzso and native zzso but, consistent with the literature, the C4 zzso having no zzso constraints did zzso The experimental results show that only those zzso formed against a zzso zzso from C4 will recognize zzso and native zzso and, therefore, the results support the notion that C4 is an zzso in zzso
