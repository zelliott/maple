A zzso statistical method called correspondence analysis was used to examine the zzso usage of zzso nuclear genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso Forty percent of the variation in zzso usage was due to bias toward G or zzso versus A or zzso zzso zzso in levels of zzso zzso showed the weakest correlation with the major zzso usage zzso The bias toward C or U versus A or G in the silent third zzso position of synonymous zzso accounted for approximately zzso of the variation in zzso zzso The zzso content of the silent third zzso position of coding regions was not strongly correlated with zzso content of zzso zzso usage was strongly biased toward zzso ending in G or C for a number of highly expressed genes including most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso usage of genes zzso storage proteins and regulatory zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors, was more random than that of genes zzso zzso zzso with similar bias toward G or zzso zzso zzso usage in zzso may reflect both regional bias on zzso composition and selection on the silent third zzso zzso
