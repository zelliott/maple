We have previously identified a zzso zzso of 55 zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso We now provide evidence that zzso isolated from adult chick brain, consists of at least two bands, both of which are active, zzso block outgrowth of zzso from chick zzso root zzso zzso An zzso raised against the adult proteins reverses the zzso and preliminary experiments suggest that zzso is restricted to the nervous system, increases during development from very low levels at embryonic day 10 and is most abundant after zzso zzso reveals that zzso is expressed on zzso cultured from an embryonic day 14 chick brain but is barely zzso on embryonic day 10 zzso root zzso zzso or embryonic day 8 zzso zzso the zzso which respond to zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed considerable zzso with zzso a protein previously identified on the basis of binding zzso zzso zzso chain reaction using zzso to the zzso sequence and internal zzso to zzso peptides produced two different zzso chain reaction fragments with zzso to zzso A full length clone zzso corresponding to one zzso chain reaction product and a partial length clone zzso corresponding to the second have been isolated from an embryonic chick brain zzso Both are members of the zzso zzso and have (or are expected to zzso three C2 zzso zzso has zzso zzso with zzso at the zzso acid zzso This sequence only partially matches the peptides from the adult protein and hence is probably not a major component of the adult zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso to zzso at the zzso acid level over the region zzso The sequence matches several of the peptides from the adult protein and is hence likely to zzso to a major component of the adult zzso Thus members of the zzso family are related to zzso zzso zzso and a recently discovered chick protein zzso Our results suggest molecules within this family are capable of acting as cell zzso molecules and zzso of zzso zzso
