zzso opportunities are provided by zzso closely related organisms thriving in zzso cold, or temperate zzso to study zzso modifications of structurally zzso zzso These modifications are of keen interest in basic science as well as in zzso This review highlights structural and functional zzso that differentiate two zzso families of zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso as zzso that signal zzso growth and sexual mating in two marine species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is distributed in Antarctic and Arctic waters, and zzso zzso which inhabits temperate zzso The two protein families show strict conservation of a common zzso bundle in a compact core of the molecular structure, which provides long-lasting integrity and biological activity to these molecules in their natural zzso In the zzso zzso family, zzso appears to have been achieved by zzso an integrated complex of structural modifications on this zzso zzso zzso most relevant appear to be extensions of zzso segments devoid of regular secondary structures, a specific distribution of polar and zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso clusters of zzso charged zzso acid side zzso and a unique role of aromatic zzso in zzso the molecular zzso Due to these zzso the zzso zzso are an example of an elegant combination of high stability of the three-dimensional structures with sufficient structural plasticity for efficient functioning at their zzso low zzso
