Rapid cycle DNA amplification is a zzso chain reaction technique with improved product specificity and cycle times of zzso zzso allowing complete zzso reactions in zzso zzso The presence or absence of the delta zzso deletion and zzso zzso was determined in 104 zzso zzso patients by rapid cycle DNA zzso In separate zzso zzso sequences on both sides of the delta zzso locus were amplified with the 3' end of a discriminating primer at the delta zzso zzso with either a zzso or a zzso zzso With rapid cycling zzso zzso zzso discrimination was achieved over a broad range of zzso temperatures zzso degrees C or zzso with conventional cycling and zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso temperatures of zzso degrees C sufficiently zzso between zzso With rapid zzso zzso could still be assessed with zzso temperatures as low as 25 degrees zzso We conclude that faster temperature cycling can improve the results of zzso zzso
