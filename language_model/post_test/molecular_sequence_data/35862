A zzso chain reaction zzso based on a zzso difference in the zzso region of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was developed to distinguish between zzso zzso and other zzso zzso For this purpose, two pairs of zzso were zzso with one primer of each pair being zzso zzso The zzso product was separated from the zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso and then detected by zzso To achieve a higher sensitivity, the zzso zzso was initially amplified by zzso chain reaction prior to the zzso chain zzso The zzso chain reaction was tested on 19 different zzso species and strains and proved to be a highly specific diagnostic method for the detection of zzso zzso
