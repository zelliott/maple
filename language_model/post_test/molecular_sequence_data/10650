Almost complete zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences were determined for the type strains of nine species belonging to the zzso zzso and for seven strains described as strains of this zzso The sequences were compared with previously published zzso zzso and zzso sequences of the type strains of the other species of the zzso The majority of the species form a zzso coherent cluster within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The cluster consists of zzso zzso lineages containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Some zzso zzso strains are zzso zzso from strains of the described zzso zzso zzso shares extremely high zzso zzso similarity with certain zzso species zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is most likely a misidentified zzso zzso zzso represents a new zzso which branches most closely to the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this zzso
