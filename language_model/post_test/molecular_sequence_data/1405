Three zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have been identified in humans, which tag proteins to zzso zzso zzso and/or enhance protein stability and zzso We report the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a zzso acid protein having an zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso In contrast to zzso which is highly expressed in all of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected mainly in the zzso A single zzso zzso was detected in zzso substituting a highly zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso expression zzso zzso was associated with the elevated levels of activated heat shock factor zzso factors as compared with zzso whereas the levels of zzso were suppressed to an identical zzso The zzso zzso zzso is associated with type I diabetes zzso zzso in families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it may be involved in the zzso of type I zzso
