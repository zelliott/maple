A zzso segment of the zzso zzso of the fungus zzso zzso was zzso and shown to contain two unidentified reading frames zzso These reading frames are 352 and zzso zzso in zzso and would specify unmodified proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequences indicate that these genes are equivalent to the human zzso zzso 1 and 4, with zzso zzso acid zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Both zzso were shown by secondary structure predictions to code for predominantly zzso proteins with strong structural conservation between the zzso and human zzso zzso of zzso zzso have not previously been identified in zzso zzso and the discovery that zzso zzso possesses reading frames so closely zzso with zzso and zzso shows that these genes are of general functional importance in the zzso of diverse zzso
