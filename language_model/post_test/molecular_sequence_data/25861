The zzso sequence of the zzso protein zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined and the zzso acid sequence of the VP deduced and confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso VP is larger than the zzso of other zzso because it has, unexpectedly, 11 more zzso acid zzso at its N zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso of zzso and four other zzso align unequivocally and their zzso as assessed from the percentage of identical zzso correlate well with previously reported zzso tests which have shown zzso to be distant from other zzso
