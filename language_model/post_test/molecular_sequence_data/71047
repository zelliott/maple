The zzso zzso region II of the zzso zzso type a zzso locus was zzso and found to contain four open reading frames termed zzso to zzso zzso was zzso identical to zzso zzso type b zzso previously shown to have zzso zzso activity zzso Van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Low but significant zzso to other zzso was only detected in the zzso part of zzso whereas the zzso part was zzso to several zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might be a zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso was cloned in an expression zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso expressing this protein displayed both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, whereas these activities were not zzso in control zzso zzso was zzso to near zzso and found to zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These had zzso zzso profiles from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity was specific for zzso zzso and zzso in one direction and for zzso zzso and zzso in the other direction and was markedly zzso by zzso The zzso showed activity with zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that zzso encodes a zzso zzso that converts zzso zzso into zzso zzso and further into zzso which is the activated precursor form for incorporation of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso type a zzso zzso
