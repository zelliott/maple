zzso receptors zzso are significant zzso receptors contributing to constant internal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most important class of zzso which has been so far reported exclusively in zzso and zzso In the present study, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso identified from zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a signal zzso six zzso zzso a zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso All the zzso zzso contain highly zzso six zzso zzso to form three pairs of zzso zzso among which zzso was assumed to participate in zzso An attachment site of sequence zzso was found in zzso domain, indicating zzso was an anchor zzso This prediction was confirmed by its zzso on the outer surface of zzso with zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso was zzso significantly by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso A truncated zzso (from zzso to zzso including zzso was zzso and expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso protein displayed unique broad zzso properties not only for zzso low density zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also for various pathogen associated molecular patterns, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso All the results indicated that zzso the most primitive zzso identified to date, was a versatile zzso involved in immune recognition, and the existence of functional zzso might trace back to at least zzso zzso
