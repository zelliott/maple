The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is an important bridging zzso in the zzso zzso zzso To better understand the functioning of zzso in zzso a random zzso screen for peptides that interact with a zzso zzso domain in the protein was zzso A search of the zzso zzso using these zzso peptides as queries resulted in the identification of a number of putative zzso zzso One of these was the zzso factor zzso zzso This zzso interaction was confirmed by zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of the motif identified in the zzso display screen eliminated the interaction, corroborating the results of the zzso display zzso The domain of zzso that interacts with zzso lies at its extreme zzso and is distinct from the part of zzso that binds zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is situated near zzso in the zzso zzso
