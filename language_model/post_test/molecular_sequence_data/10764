zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso leaves zzso has been zzso to zzso and its zzso properties compared with that from zzso roots zzso Each zzso had a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso zzso Although each had a pH optimum around zzso with the same effects of zzso zzso had higher heat stability at 60 degrees C than zzso Moreover, zzso had a lower zzso and a higher specificity constant zzso for zzso leaf zzso than zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso was different from that of zzso The results of zzso acid analysis and zzso mapping suggested that zzso and zzso have different primary zzso
