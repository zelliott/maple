The mechanisms of zzso of gene expression in a complex tissue such as the brain remain poorly zzso To provide a model system for the study of gene regulation in a specific zzso of differentiated zzso we have derived cell lines from tumors created in transgenic mice by targeting zzso virus 40 T zzso expression by using the regulatory regions of the gene for zzso hormone zzso a zzso released from specialized zzso in the zzso zzso into the cultured zzso zzso zzso cell line GT1 have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso which binds multiple GT1 nuclear zzso In particular, one zzso zzso region, zzso is critical for zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso mobility shift zzso to detect a GT1 nuclear protein complex that binds the zzso zzso Close inspection of the zzso zzso sequence revealed zzso to the zzso zzso a sequence known to bind members of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Although we demonstrate expression of a number of zzso zzso genes in GT1 cells, a zzso zzso with zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso is the protein binding the zzso Finally, specific zzso in the zzso region that affected zzso binding were correlated with decreased zzso Thus, zzso binds to the zzso zzso in zzso and this binding is critical to the zzso activity of this zzso zzso in GT1 zzso
