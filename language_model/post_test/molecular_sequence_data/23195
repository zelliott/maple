The zzso protein zzso plays a pivotal role in regulation of cell division in zzso Multiple promoters regulate zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli, zzso and zzso zzso In order to identify promoter zzso regions of the zzso gene of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso in zzso different regions upstream of zzso zzso the zzso zzso region, the zzso open reading frame zzso and different regions of zzso ORF, were analyzed in a zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells containing these zzso fusion zzso revealed zzso expression in the cells harboring the zzso zzso region zzso zzso the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso analyses on zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells, transformed with the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as on zzso from zzso zzso confirmed that the regions identified indeed elicit promoter zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso transcripts driven by cloned zzso promoter regions in zzso zzso cells showed zzso higher promoter activity from zzso zzso than from the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the individual zzso and 3' regions of zzso zzso was almost equivalent to that from the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses on zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso confirmed these promoter zzso Thus, at least three independent regions in the immediate upstream sequence of zzso contain promoter activity, with the major contribution coming from zzso zzso
