zzso zzso is an zzso pathogen that zzso in a specialized zzso within host zzso zzso of this zzso requires the zzso type IV protein zzso zzso By using a zzso protein zzso zzso we found that proteins zzso by the zzso complex across the host zzso membrane can also be transferred from one bacterial cell to zzso The flexibility of this system allowed the identification of several families of proteins zzso by the zzso zzso When analyzed by zzso zzso a protein identified by this zzso zzso was shown to zzso across the zzso zzso to the zzso face of the zzso zzso zzso The identification of large numbers of these zzso and the fact that the absence of any one zzso rarely results in strong defects in zzso growth, indicate that there is significant functional zzso among the zzso zzso zzso
