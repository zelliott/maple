zzso factor VIII zzso with overlapping deletions spanning the region zzso have been expressed in zzso cells, and zzso for biological activity both in zzso and in zzso Two distinct zzso systems were used to measure the activity in zzso The zzso zzso zzso served to assess factor VIII zzso activity while a zzso zzso was used for the zzso of factor VIII zzso activity in factor zzso factor X zzso zzso of the entire zzso zzso resulted in a protein with similar zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, factor zzso which has a deletion that also comprises the zzso sequence zzso had lost factor VIII zzso activity while factor VIII zzso activity was zzso This functional inconsistency was further addressed by comparing zzso factor zzso with factor zzso a zzso with normal in zzso zzso zzso studies of factor zzso formation revealed that higher zzso of zzso were required to develop the zzso activity from factor zzso than needed for factor zzso or plasma factor zzso The zzso significance of this finding was assessed in dogs with zzso zzso Both deletion zzso were similar to plasma factor VIII with regard to binding to von zzso factor and zzso and zzso zzso the zzso bleeding time model, factor zzso was found to be indistinguishable from plasma factor VIII, whereas factor zzso was less zzso The increased zzso of factor zzso thus limits both zzso activity and zzso efficacy in zzso zzso These observations suggest that the zzso sequence zzso although zzso for factor VIII zzso function per se, is involved in the zzso zzso of factor VIII both in zzso and in zzso
