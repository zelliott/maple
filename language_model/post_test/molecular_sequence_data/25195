The human zzso zzso zzso zzso for alpha zzso complexes contains 3 zzso of zzso 500 zzso 85 zzso and 40 zzso zzso sequence analysis of the 500 zzso and 85 zzso zzso analysis of a random selection of peptides zzso 536 zzso from these zzso and analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso part of the 500 zzso zzso provide evidence that the 500 zzso and 85 zzso chains are the zzso and zzso respectively, of a recently cloned zzso membrane zzso termed the low density zzso zzso related protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Stanley, zzso (1988) zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Goldstein, zzso and Brown, zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso sequence analysis of the 40 zzso zzso shows that it is of distinct genetic zzso It is suggested that zzso is the functional zzso for alpha zzso complexes zzso zzso and in addition may have as yet zzso functions in zzso zzso
