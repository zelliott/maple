A zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was fused to the 3' end of a 3' truncated ca beta zzso The zzso zzso form comprised the zzso 3' end of zzso 2, the remaining part of the zzso unit containing zzso zzso to stop zzso and zzso zzso of the 3' zzso zzso The beta zzso form comprised a zzso zzso zzso region and the zzso end of the zzso unit terminating 69 zzso downstream from zzso 2 which encodes the zzso zzso signal zzso and the first 2 zzso of mature beta zzso The resulting hybrid gene driven by the beta zzso promoter was expressed in all eight lines of transgenic mice investigated, although at different zzso In two lines, the yield of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso or zzso 3 zzso of zzso The zzso and zzso zzso expression was similar to that of zzso beta zzso The zzso zzso differed from its goat milk counterpart by the occurrence of four extra zzso at the zzso end, indicating that the signal zzso released the beta zzso signal zzso According to zzso analyses of zzso milk containing zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso the latter essentially occurred in zzso zzso comparative zzso of the behavior of ca alpha zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso upon incremental addition of zzso showed that zzso zzso had the capacity to protect alpha zzso against zzso zzso in forming stable zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
