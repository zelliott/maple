zzso were produced from zzso by using zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso linkage between fatty acids and zzso bases in various zzso The zzso reaction was done in a zzso media prepared with zzso organic zzso and zzso buffer solution containing the zzso We investigated the effects of organic zzso and zzso on zzso production in the zzso zzso Among the organic zzso tested, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoted zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also enhanced by the addition of zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was enhanced by the addition of zzso sodium zzso or sodium zzso to the zzso zzso The most effective zzso of various zzso by the zzso was thus obtained in the zzso zzso system containing zzso sodium zzso Under this condition, the fatty acids released from zzso by the action of the zzso were trapped and diffused into the organic phase, while zzso remained in the zzso zzso Thus the almost complete zzso of zzso was achieved using the zzso system, while at most zzso of zzso was obtained using normal zzso media possibly due to the zzso of zzso reaction by zzso of fatty acids in the reaction zzso
