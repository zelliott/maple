zzso of zzso zzso is the most important process in bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso degrades zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and then the zzso linkage of zzso is zzso to generate zzso zzso and zzso We have characterized three zzso zzso zzso zzso including two genes that are involved in the zzso zzso of two zzso of zzso and one gene that is involved in the elimination of zzso from a zzso zzso However, the first step in the degradation of four different zzso zzso has not been zzso In this study, three alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso transformation activity in zzso coli, were isolated from zzso and zzso in addition to the previously cloned zzso zzso The levels of zzso acid sequence identity of the four zzso zzso which belong to the zzso zzso family, ranged from zzso to zzso Each gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso of the gene products with the four zzso zzso were determined by using zzso zzso liquid zzso with recently zzso authentic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso converted zzso and zzso into zzso and zzso respectively, while zzso and zzso transformed zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the genes indicated that zzso is essential for the degradation of zzso and zzso and that both zzso and zzso contribute to the degradation of the two other zzso zzso
