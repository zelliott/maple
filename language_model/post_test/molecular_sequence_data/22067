Fruit zzso is a unique plant zzso process with direct implications for our food supply, nutrition, and zzso In contrast to zzso fruit, where zzso is zzso the hormonal control of zzso in zzso fruit, such as grape zzso zzso is poorly zzso zzso zzso are zzso hormones, essential for normal plant growth and development but not previously implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso Here we show that increases in zzso zzso levels, but not zzso acid zzso or zzso levels, are associated with zzso in zzso zzso grape zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) were isolated, and the function of the grape zzso gene was confirmed by transgenic zzso of the tomato zzso zzso extreme dwarf zzso zzso zzso analysis of these genes during berry development revealed transcript zzso patterns that were consistent with a dramatic increase in zzso zzso levels observed at the onset of fruit zzso Furthermore, we show that application of zzso to grape berries significantly promoted zzso while zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso significantly delayed fruit zzso These results provide evidence that changes in zzso zzso levels influence this key zzso zzso This may provide a significant insight into the mechanism controlling zzso in grapes, which has direct implications for the logistics of grape production and zzso zzso
