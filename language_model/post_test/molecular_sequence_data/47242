The zzso zzso zzso functions as a negative regulator in zzso cell development, zzso and zzso cellular zzso In zzso T cells, a major zzso band and a minor zzso band were zzso by a zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso domain, while an zzso against the zzso zzso 19 zzso acids recognized only the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was subjected to zzso mapping and zzso which was followed by molecular zzso It revealed that the zzso zzso termed zzso is a zzso alternatively spliced form of zzso zzso is 29 zzso acids longer than zzso and its 66 zzso zzso acids are different from zzso The C zzso of zzso contains a zzso motif zzso a potential zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso of zzso is not detected upon stimulation in zzso T zzso This is apparently due to the lack of a single in zzso zzso zzso site, which only exists in the C zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso zzso was shown to be more active than zzso in the zzso of zzso At pH zzso zzso and zzso exhibited similar zzso zzso It is likely that these two zzso play different roles in the regulation of zzso cell signal zzso
