zzso of the Internal zzso zzso 2 zzso regions of the nuclear zzso repeats from 111 organisms of the family zzso zzso and zzso organisms of the zzso including zzso zzso were zzso The use of zzso energy zzso to generate secondary structures and zzso comparative analysis of the zzso regions revealed a common secondary structure that is zzso despite wide zzso and zzso primary sequence zzso The existence of this zzso zzso structure is supported by the presence of numerous zzso zzso changes as well as by an evolutionary history of insertions and deletions that nevertheless maintains major aspects of the overall zzso Furthermore, this general structure is preserved across broad zzso lines, as it is observed in the zzso of other zzso including flowering plants; previous reports of common zzso secondary structures in other zzso were restricted to the order zzso The reported zzso structure possesses important zzso structural motifs which may help to mediate zzso in the zzso that occur during zzso transcript zzso Their recognition can guide further studies of zzso zzso processing, and their application to sequence alignments may contribute significantly to the value of zzso sequences in zzso analyses at several zzso levels, but particularly in characterizing populations and zzso
