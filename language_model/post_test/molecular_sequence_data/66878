zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso are resistant to zzso agents, including zzso that is abundant in zzso Although zzso cells are typically zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, derived from a patient with zzso were also resistant to zzso zzso cells demonstrate altered cell surface zzso with loss of core 2 zzso zzso for zzso created by core 2 zzso zzso Loss of core 2 zzso on tumor cells was also seen in primary zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso cells are zzso for a zzso point zzso yet this zzso resulted in a dramatic reduction in cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso cells, or zzso zzso cells that lack zzso restored core 2 zzso expression and zzso to zzso whereas zzso zzso lacked activity and did not restore core 2 zzso expression or zzso to zzso zzso zzso did not have a dominant negative effect by affecting zzso or activity of zzso zzso rather, zzso zzso is sufficient for loss of core 2 zzso expression and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso results in altered cellular zzso and resistance to cell death, identifying a new survival mechanism for zzso zzso
