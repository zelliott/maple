In Lake zzso Indonesia, the world's largest known zzso zzso more than 50% of zzso organic matter is zzso through zzso despite high zzso of zzso zzso in the lake zzso zzso zzso accumulates to high zzso (up to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso bottom waters, which contain a total of zzso zzso zzso tons of zzso zzso of dissolved zzso carbon zzso and carbon zzso zzso show that zzso is oxidized in the vicinity of the persistent zzso and that some of this zzso is likely oxidized zzso The dearth of zzso and zzso in Lake zzso waters suggests that zzso methane zzso may be coupled to the reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso considerations reveal that zzso zzso coupled to zzso or zzso reduction would yield sufficient free energy to support microbial growth at the zzso levels present in Lake zzso zzso calculations imply that zzso and zzso must be recycled several times directly within the water column to balance the upward flux of zzso zzso gene cloning identified zzso in the zzso water column, and these zzso belong to groups capable of both zzso and zzso zzso We find that methane is important in C zzso even in this very zzso zzso Such zzso environments are rare on Earth today, but they are analogous to conditions in the zzso oceans thought to prevail during much of the zzso zzso By zzso zzso and zzso could have formed an important part of the zzso Ocean zzso
