A classic zzso response to zzso in humans is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is the central regulator of red blood cell zzso The EPO zzso in turn, is activated by zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is a zzso factor consisting of an alpha zzso zzso and a beta zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso domain protein zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso and egg zzso nine zzso site specifically zzso zzso in a zzso zzso motif (where underlining indicates the zzso zzso This provides a recognition motif for the von zzso zzso zzso a component of an zzso zzso zzso complex that targets zzso zzso for zzso Under hypoxic conditions, this inherently zzso modification is arrested, thereby stabilizing zzso and allowing it to activate the EPO zzso We previously identified and characterized an zzso zzso zzso zzso More recently, we reported two additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we describe the functional characterization of these two zzso as well as a third novel zzso zzso zzso These zzso affect zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We find that all result in impaired degradation and thus zzso stabilization of zzso However, each exhibits a distinct profile with respect to their effects on zzso binding and von zzso zzso zzso These findings reinforce the importance of zzso in human EPO regulation, demonstrate zzso of functional defects arising from these zzso and point to a critical role for zzso zzso to the zzso motif in zzso
