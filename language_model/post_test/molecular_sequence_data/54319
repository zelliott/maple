zzso zzso zzso and generate zzso throughout the central nervous zzso Here, we uncover an unexpected regional specificity in the properties of neural zzso cells, revealed by the function of a zzso zzso is expressed in neural zzso and its zzso results in an zzso of zzso along the zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism zzso the zzso zzso fail to exit the cell cycle, whereas in the zzso they undergo zzso zzso the zzso zzso Among several targets, we functionally identify zzso as a primary target of zzso regulated at the zzso zzso zzso mediates the effects of zzso on zzso through zzso signaling in the zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso but affects zzso only in the zzso via the zzso zzso Our findings show a zzso difference in the responsiveness of zzso to zzso zzso revealing an underlying divergence of their zzso
