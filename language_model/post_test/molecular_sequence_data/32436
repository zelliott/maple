zzso zzso was originally identified as a candidate zzso gene for several mouse skin zzso Several zzso genes sharing a protein domain with zzso the zzso gene of human zzso hearing loss, have been found in the mouse and human zzso and this group is referred to as the zzso domain zzso However, our current comparative zzso analysis identified several novel motifs distinct from the previously reported domain in the zzso zzso We also identified three new zzso genes clustered on mouse zzso zzso We named these genes collectively the zzso zzso zzso expression analysis revealed exclusive expression of zzso family genes in the zzso of the skin and gastrointestinal tract in a highly zzso zzso Further database searching revealed the presence of other related genes with a similar zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso family and related genes have evolved divergent zzso expression zzso
