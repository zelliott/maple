The zzso system is best known for draining zzso fluid from the zzso and returning it to the blood zzso However, the zzso system also provides the means for immune surveillance in the immune system, acting as zzso that convey soluble zzso and zzso cells from the zzso to the zzso zzso where primary zzso responses are zzso One zzso that potentially unites these two functions is the large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a chemically simple zzso of zzso and zzso that fulfills a diversity of functions from danger signal to adhesive zzso depending upon chain length and particular interaction with its many different binding proteins and a small but important group of zzso The two most abundant of these receptors are zzso which is expressed on zzso that traffic through the zzso and zzso which is expressed almost exclusively on zzso zzso zzso much of the zzso within the zzso is turned over and zzso in zzso zzso by a poorly understood process that occurs in the zzso zzso zzso there are several mysterious aspects to zzso in the zzso Here we cover some of these by reviewing recent findings in the biology of zzso zzso cells and their possible roles in zzso zzso together with fresh insights into the complex and enigmatic nature of zzso its regulation of zzso binding by zzso and zzso and its potential function in zzso zzso
