zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso 130 zzso was zzso inhibited in a zzso manner by two zzso zzso bearing side chains of variable zzso namely zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso of the zzso with zzso was attributable to reaction with a single zzso acid zzso within the zzso proven by comparative zzso assisted laser zzso of flight mass zzso Further mass zzso analysis demonstrated that the fourth zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso by zzso By zzso zzso zzso of zzso labeled by zzso it was shown that zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso forming a zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso acid zzso caused increases in zzso decreases in zzso and instability of zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso except zzso could be zzso but all were competitively inhibited by zzso zzso studies revealed that both zzso and zzso could specifically zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso of the zzso zzso Because these zzso were zzso under zzso conditions, it is likely that the affinity labeling reactions were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is located in the middle of a characteristic zzso sandwich zzso zzso a large zzso zzso during inhibitor binding and transition state formation is likely and suggests that a major zzso change is induced by zzso binding during the course of zzso
