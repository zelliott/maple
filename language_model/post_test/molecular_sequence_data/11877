The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed on zzso early during the course of an immune response, suggesting that it may play a pivotal role in the decision between T cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a restricted pattern of zzso it is zzso in B cells, T cells, zzso cells, and zzso cells, but zzso expressed in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso expression of zzso on distinct cell types indicates that zzso is regulated zzso To further characterize zzso zzso we employed zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends and reverse zzso to examine transcripts expressed in a variety of types of zzso and analyzed the zzso organization of the zzso zzso We report here that the zzso locus consists of 12 zzso and demonstrate that zzso 1 through 5 can be used in alternative fashions to produce five distinct zzso differing in their zzso untranslated and signal zzso The expression of these transcripts differs in distinct types of zzso and is modulated by stimuli that activate B zzso These results demonstrate that zzso transcripts are zzso regulated in a zzso fashion and in response to zzso zzso
