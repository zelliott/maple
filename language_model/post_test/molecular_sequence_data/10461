zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso had a molecular mass of 53 zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and 205 zzso by gel zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of the zzso zzso constituted an active zzso The apparent zzso and zzso values of this zzso for zzso were 100 zzso and 39 zzso respectively, and those for zzso were 83 zzso and 32 zzso zzso The structural gene for this zzso was cloned and zzso The length of the gene was zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of DNA around the gene for zzso zzso was also determined, and seven open reading frames were found in this DNA zzso These were the genes for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso product was similar to that of the aromatic hydrocarbon zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso product revealed a similarity to zzso zzso zzso The region between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso on different zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso products exhibited no significant similarity to the reported sequences in protein zzso
