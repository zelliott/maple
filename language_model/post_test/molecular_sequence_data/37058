zzso zzso migration is essential for the development of zzso a human disease zzso by invasion and destruction of zzso zzso zzso requires both zzso of the cell and formation of a zzso zzso As zzso zzso zzso are known to regulate zzso cell zzso and zzso we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso We showed that the zzso domain of zzso comprised a zzso zzso activity in zzso and that overproduction of this fragment, in zzso zzso caused a significant reduction in zzso migration, as measured by dynamic image analysis, indicating an involvement of zzso in this zzso A dramatic loss of zzso as indicated by the increased number of membrane extensions all around zzso zzso was also observed, suggesting that the zzso domain of zzso was necessary for maintenance of cell zzso To support this view, we showed that despite the absence of the consensus motif to bind to zzso and zzso the zzso domain of zzso bound to zzso suggesting that the zzso region was a regulatory zzso In addition, we also found an increased rate of human red blood cell zzso suggesting for the first time an active role for a zzso protein in this zzso Taking together, the results suggest strongly that zzso is a key regulatory element in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
