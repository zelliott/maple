A simple, manually zzso continuous flow apparatus is described for solid zzso phase zzso zzso The approach uses an unsupported zzso zzso form core network at an initial zzso loading of 5 zzso zzso the theoretical zzso The synthesis is performed in a flow reactor under low pressure zzso zzso zzso of zzso solutions and washing zzso is an essential feature that has been developed to facilitate efficient zzso zzso The usefulness of the present system in conjunction with N alpha zzso protected zzso acids is illustrated by the zzso of zzso and zzso The potential for scale up synthesis has also been zzso
