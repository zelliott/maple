With one of the largest iron ore deposits in the world, South Africa is zzso to be among the top ten biggest exporters of iron zzso zzso demand and consumption of this mineral triggered search for processing technologies, which can be zzso to zzso the zzso iron ore minerals that contain high levels of unwanted zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study investigated a potential biological method that can be further developed for the full zzso of zzso iron ore zzso zzso bacterial strains that belong to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the iron ore minerals and identified with sequence zzso and zzso zzso The abilities of these zzso to lower the pH of the growth medium and zzso of zzso zzso were used to screen them as potential mineral zzso Eight zzso were successfully screened with this method and zzso in shake flask experiments using iron ore minerals as sources of K and zzso The shake flask experiments revealed that all eight zzso have zzso to produce organic acids that aided the zzso of the iron ore zzso In addition, all eight zzso produced high zzso of zzso acid followed by relatively lower zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso analyses also indicated zzso zzso substances could play a role in mineral zzso
