The zzso zzso genes are a family of zzso factors that bind to specific DNA sequences in target genes regulating gene zzso Thirty-nine zzso genes have been mapped in four zzso zzso A, B, C, and zzso they act as master genes regulating the identity of body segments along the zzso axis of the zzso The role played by zzso genes in adult cell differentiation is unclear to date, but growing evidence suggests that they may play an important role in the development of zzso To study the role played by zzso genes in cervical cancer, in the present work, we analyzed the expression of zzso genes and the zzso of their transcripts in human cervical zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis and zzso zzso in zzso zzso were used to detect zzso expression in 11 normal cervical zzso and 17 cervical zzso It was determined that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are expressed in normal adult cervical zzso and zzso cervical zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was found only in tumor zzso Our findings suggest that the new expression of zzso zzso and zzso genes is involved in cervical zzso
