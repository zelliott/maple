zzso engineering of tumor cells to express both zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso can induce synergistic immune zzso zzso Paradoxically, the combination has also been reported to zzso certain immune functions, highlighting the zzso of dual zzso zzso We hypothesized that a zzso and zzso fusion zzso zzso could circumvent such limitations yet preserve synergistic zzso We designed a fusion zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso structure computer modeling of GIFT protein predicted for intact zzso binding zzso for both zzso zzso mouse melanoma cells were gene modified to express GIFT zzso and these cells were unable to form tumors in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor vaccine could also induce absolute protective immunity against challenge by live zzso zzso In mice with established melanoma, zzso therapeutic cellular vaccine significantly improved zzso survival when compared with zzso expressing both zzso and zzso We show that GIFT induced a significantly greater tumor site recruitment of zzso than combined zzso and zzso and that zzso recruitment arises from novel zzso feature of zzso In contrast to suppression by zzso of natural killer zzso cell recruitment despite zzso of zzso GIFT leads to significant functional zzso cell zzso as confirmed in zzso beige zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that a fusion between zzso and zzso can invoke greater zzso effect than both zzso in zzso and novel zzso properties can arise from such zzso zzso
