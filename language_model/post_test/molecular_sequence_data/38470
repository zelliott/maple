The zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cells was investigated using zzso and zzso zzso to locate the approximate ends of the zzso and single zzso acid zzso of zzso to identify critical zzso contact zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells are both specific for a zzso zzso whose core encompasses zzso acids zzso zzso acid zzso was identified as the primary zzso contact zzso for both cells, and zzso acid 331 was found to be an important secondary zzso contact zzso however, the importance of other secondary zzso contact zzso and zzso zzso zzso differ between the zzso Additional zzso clones were generated that recognized zzso found in the zzso end or in the center of the zzso These findings indicate that zzso can be presented by zzso in at least three binding zzso This study highlights some of the complexities of zzso zzso such as zzso which contain a zzso set of overlapping T cell zzso and zzso binding zzso
