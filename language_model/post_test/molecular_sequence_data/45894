zzso zzso factor zzso a master regulator of critical genes for cell survival under hypoxic conditions, is known to be related to zzso and progression of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso hairpin zzso are synthetic organic compounds that recognize and bind to the minor grooves of specific DNA zzso We zzso three zzso hairpin zzso targeting the zzso sequences of zzso responsive element zzso a binding site of zzso in the promoter region of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso The effects of the zzso on zzso zzso were evaluated by a zzso zzso using a reporter zzso containing a zzso zzso Real time zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso were performed to examine the effects of the zzso on the zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso cells, which have a zzso zzso in the von zzso zzso A combination of three zzso hairpin zzso suppressed zzso zzso in reporter zzso using zzso cells and successfully suppressed zzso and translation of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interaction was confirmed by an zzso mobility shift zzso An approach using zzso hairpin zzso may be a new strategy for the treatment of zzso cell zzso
