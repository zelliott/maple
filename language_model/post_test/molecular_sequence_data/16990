zzso acid zzso amplification zzso is a sensitive zzso zzso amplification method known to be a suitable tool for zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso technology can be applied to single zzso zzso zzso analysis using human zzso DNA as a zzso Combination of DNA zzso with multiplex zzso of specific molecular zzso makes it possible to zzso discriminate the presence of the zzso of zzso This protocol is zzso zzso and makes it possible to rapidly detect single zzso zzso in clinical or cell line DNA sequences using a large range of DNA zzso Such a real-time zzso DNA zzso zzso can find broad application in clinical zzso
