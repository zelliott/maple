zzso zzso cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso display increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso and they are zzso in the absence of the zzso DNA zzso One explanation for this zzso is that one or more zzso proteins accumulate to toxic levels in zzso zzso zzso To address this possibility, we isolated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso synthetic zzso and identified it as an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso behaved like the zzso zzso in its sensitivity to heat, DNA replication stress, and DNA zzso Surprisingly, deletion of zzso which is known to promote the zzso of zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso synthetic zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso growth sensitivities were found to be suppressed in zzso zzso double zzso This mutual suppression indicates that zzso and zzso interact zzso However, the suppressed strain zzso zzso zzso displayed even higher levels of zzso proteins than the corresponding double zzso Thus, zzso zzso synthetic zzso cannot be due simply to high levels of bulk zzso zzso We speculate that the loss of zzso suppresses the toxicity of the zzso proteins that accumulate in zzso cells by permitting the extension of zzso chains on specific target zzso This additional modification might zzso the activity of the target proteins or channel them into alternative pathways for zzso zzso In support of this latter possibility we find that the zzso zzso is required for suppression by zzso
