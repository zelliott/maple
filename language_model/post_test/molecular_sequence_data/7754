Human zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso component of the central nervous system, is a candidate target zzso for zzso zzso We have isolated and zzso part of a zzso clone that contains the entire human zzso zzso The primary nuclear transcript, extending from the putative start of zzso to the site of zzso addition, is zzso zzso in zzso The human zzso gene contains 8 zzso separated by 7 zzso zzso zzso boundary sites are observed at each zzso The zzso vary in size from 242 to zzso zzso and contain numerous repetitive DNA zzso including 14 zzso sequences within 3 zzso Another zzso element is located in the zzso region of the zzso zzso sequences were classified with respect to zzso zzso Seven hundred zzso zzso zzso of the zzso start and zzso zzso 3' of the zzso addition sites were also zzso The zzso region revealed the presence of several consensus sequences that could be relevant in the zzso of the zzso zzso in particular binding sites in common with other zzso gene zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso repeats were identified and may provide genetic marker tools for association and linkage zzso
