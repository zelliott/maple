zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen which is able to survive and replicate within zzso zzso zzso it has to adapt to a range of different hostile zzso In order to understand the mechanisms of zzso survival employed by virulent zzso zzso zzso an initial approach consisting of analysis of the differences in patterns of protein synthesis in response to heat, zzso and acid pH stresses by two-dimensional zzso zzso gel zzso was zzso Depending on the stress, this involved about zzso to zzso of the zzso protein spots detected in zzso gel zzso On the basis of zzso sequence analysis and database searching, 19 proteins whose level of synthesis was zzso or zzso by stress conditions were zzso Some of them were previously reported for zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight other proteins closely matched proteins found in other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein S1, and zzso zzso E1 component beta zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso could bring specific regulatory mechanisms into play in response to stress zzso For example, the zzso releasing factor in zzso zzso appeared to be a heat shock zzso whereas the zzso zzso described as a heat shock protein for zzso coli, was strongly zzso in zzso zzso in response to heat zzso Some of the identified proteins and their potential specific regulation could be required for the adaptation of zzso zzso to environmental stresses encountered in zzso cells and possibly for bacterial zzso
