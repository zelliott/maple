Using zzso methods, we have studied the structural changes induced in both protein and DNA upon binding of the zzso Group I zzso protein to a zzso sequence derived from mouse satellite zzso We show that these structural changes depend on the zzso of the zzso complexes formed, as determined by Job plots derived from experiments using zzso zzso zzso zzso and melting temperature experiments extended in the far ultraviolet range show that while native zzso is mainly random coiled in solution, it adopts a zzso zzso upon forming a zzso complex in which the protein first binds to one of two zzso stretches present in the zzso zzso structure in the zzso complex is dependent on the sequence of its DNA zzso A zzso zzso complex can also form and is characterized by a small increase in the DNA natural bend and/or zzso coupled to a change in the protein zzso as determined from zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso In addition, a zzso corresponding to an extended zzso domain of zzso zzso an ordered zzso of DNA zzso Based on the constraints derived from zzso zzso zzso we present a model of these zzso zzso Our results illustrate an extreme case of protein structure induced by DNA zzso that may bear on the evolutionary conservation of the zzso motifs of zzso We discuss the functional relevance of the structural flexibility of zzso associated with the nature of its DNA targets and the implications of the binding zzso for several aspects of zzso structure and gene zzso
