zzso zzso zzso formerly designated as neutral zzso zzso from zzso zzso which contains 1 g atom of zzso of zzso is a single chain of 177 zzso acid zzso includes three zzso bonds, and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso determination of the zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli was performed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso of zzso with zzso and of zzso with zzso resulted in almost complete loss of the activity of the zzso zzso It can be concluded that zzso zzso and zzso provide the zzso zzso of the zzso according to a zzso binding zzso Based on zzso zzso experiments, it was demonstrated that the three essential zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso crucial zzso in the zzso zzso may be implicated in a central role in the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a member of a family of zzso zzso with a new zzso zzso zzso defined by the zzso + zzso motif and an zzso acid as the third zinc zzso
