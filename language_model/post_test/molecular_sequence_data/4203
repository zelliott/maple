zzso a member of the zzso family, is zzso in many zzso To understand the zzso underlying this zzso we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the human zzso zzso The promoter is strongly activated in cells expressing zzso zzso and suppressed by zzso zzso At least three functional zzso binding sites, located immediately upstream of zzso 1 (at zzso zzso and zzso mediate this zzso zzso serially deleted promoter zzso and zzso harboring zzso zzso sites were analyzed for their response to zzso expressed zzso or zzso to establish functionality of these zzso zzso of zzso sites was further confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso in zzso followed by competition zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso analysis using zzso zzso In zzso binding of zzso to the zzso promoter was demonstrated using nuclear extracts prepared from zzso zzso zzso The region zzso the highest promoter activity was found to reside between zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso Two of the three functional zzso sites (at zzso and zzso reside within this zzso Our results suggest that regulation of zzso expression is primarily zzso through binding of zzso to target sites at zzso and zzso
