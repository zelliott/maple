In the present work, the activities of protein zzso A zzso in cell zzso have been detected by a zzso zzso resonance light scattering zzso with gold zzso zzso zzso sensitive detection of zzso activity in zzso zzso total cell proteins of zzso cell zzso zzso to 200 zzso is achieved by a selected zzso zzso The experimental results also demonstrate that the zzso can be employed to evaluate expression levels of zzso activity in different cell lines and chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso activity fluctuation in living zzso In addition, zzso zzso by the inhibitor zzso is zzso suggesting the potential for screening zzso zzso at the living cell zzso
