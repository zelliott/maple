Major zzso complex zzso genes have now been cloned from representatives of all zzso classes except zzso The recent zzso of sequence data has given great insight into the course of evolution of these zzso Although the primary structure of the zzso genes varies greatly from class to class and also within the individual classes, the general features of the zzso and zzso structure have been zzso remarkably well during more than 400 million years of zzso The ancestral zzso genes may have been assembled from at least three structural elements derived from different gene zzso Class II zzso genes appear to have been assembled first, and then to have given rise to class I zzso
