On constructing a zzso library for zzso zzso sequences with a significant identity to Apple zzso zzso virus zzso were zzso zzso of the remaining zzso sequence indicated the presence of a zzso virus with an zzso and 2 of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, excluding a zzso zzso encodes a single zzso zzso zzso and shares highest zzso acid identity with zzso at zzso zzso zzso acid motifs typical for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso functions are zzso zzso encodes a single zzso (106 zzso with zzso acid identities to the flat apple isolate of Cherry zzso leaf virus zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting this is a potato strain of zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso region shows that this virus falls within a group separate from the zzso that includes members of the zzso and the zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso dwarf virus and zzso orange infectious zzso zzso Other regions of the zzso have highest identities with both plant and animal infecting members of the zzso virus zzso The evolutionary context of zzso and related viruses is zzso Similar viral sequences from an zzso library of peppermint are also zzso
