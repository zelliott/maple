A model of the zzso zzso domain zzso with a negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Although the zzso receptors belong to the family 3 zzso receptors with a low primary sequence similarity to zzso zzso the high resolution crystal structure of zzso was successfully applied as a template in this model and used to select zzso for zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused complete loss of the zzso binding and blocked the zzso zzso of zzso zzso inwardly zzso zzso channel current and zzso zzso The zzso zzso increased the binding affinity of zzso by zzso and also resulted in a marked decrease in the zzso value (4 versus 128 zzso compared with wild zzso The zzso zzso led to a dramatic reduction in binding affinity by zzso and a large increase in the zzso value zzso versus 128 zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso increased the efficacy of the zzso block of the zzso zzso zzso We observed a striking conservation in the position of critical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical zzso of the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso crystal structure as a template for the family 3 zzso zzso In our model, the aromatic ring of zzso might interact with the cluster of aromatic zzso formed from zzso zzso and zzso thereby blocking the movement of the zzso zzso which is crucial for zzso zzso
