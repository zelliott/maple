zzso are among the most variable nuclear proteins known in zzso In order to learn more about their evolution and function in humans and to explore the possibility of potential applications in forensic medicine we have developed a rapid method to amplify and directly sequence the zzso zzso gene simultaneously in many different zzso The method takes only zzso h from zzso DNA to the sequencing zzso Despite the high zzso of these genes only one zzso site was detected at the coding region level in different zzso This zzso variation does not create a change in the zzso sequence of the zzso Because all the zzso genes zzso from different species are markedly different among them as well as to the human zzso amplification and direct sequencing of this gene can be used to unequivocally identify the human or animal origin of biological zzso Furthermore, the single zzso site detected in the human zzso gene could be useful in conjunction with other markers in identification studies in zzso
