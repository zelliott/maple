zzso triple zzso formation constitutes a new approach to block gene expression via zzso zzso In addition triple zzso might inhibit zzso We have examined the capacity of triple zzso zzso to inhibit the initiation of replication on a zzso DNA template using zzso DNA zzso zzso We show that triple zzso formation at the primer initiation site efficiently zzso DNA zzso by preventing binding of the zzso The effect is dependent on the distance between the zzso of the primer and the triple zzso zzso zzso becomes ineffective when this distance is greater than 3 zzso The presence of three zzso outside the zzso region on the zzso of the primer is therefore sufficient to allow for initiation of DNA zzso
