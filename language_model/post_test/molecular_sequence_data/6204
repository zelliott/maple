We have developed a new procedure zzso zzso for typing zzso zzso by amplifying the entire zzso to zzso variable zzso zzso by long zzso The amplified DNA is then zzso with zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso after zzso gel zzso A simple procedure for preparing DNA of sufficiently high quality from 96 samples was employed zzso This DNA was also used to develop a random amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso The zzso power of the two zzso procedures was compared with previous methods, M zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both procedures were highly zzso but the zzso yield of restriction fragments in zzso typing allows zzso interpretation of zzso
