Many bacterial pathogens cause disease by injecting zzso proteins zzso into host cells via the specialized type III zzso zzso Recently, exceptional progress in identifying zzso was made in the zzso zzso zzso using a novel genetic screen and zzso zzso These studies, along with zzso experiments, suggest that most zzso zzso zzso function by targeting the plasma zzso zzso or zzso of host zzso The type III zzso of zzso zzso is highly variable and zzso a lesson gleaned from a comparative zzso zzso Variation in the zzso repertoire is likely to facilitate the adaptation of zzso zzso to different zzso
