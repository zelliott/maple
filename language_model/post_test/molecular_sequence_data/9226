Human respiratory zzso virus zzso is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout zzso We investigated the genetic zzso of zzso circulating in Ontario during zzso winter season by sequencing and zzso analysis of the G zzso zzso the 201 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more commonly observed than zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso infections were among children zzso months and zzso years old, zzso On zzso analysis of the second zzso region of the 112 zzso zzso 110 zzso clustered within or adjacent to the zzso zzso two zzso were zzso zzso Eleven zzso zzso zzso clustered together zzso as a novel zzso zzso named zzso containing a 72 zzso zzso in the zzso region of the attachment zzso zzso The predicted zzso is zzso by 24 zzso acids and includes zzso zzso acid zzso Using zzso secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of zzso occurrence was zzso The 23 zzso acid zzso G gene zzso results in a repeat of 7 potential zzso sites including three zzso sugar zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso Analysis by zzso zzso analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among Ontario zzso zzso six were found to be zzso which reverted to the previous state observed in the zzso zzso zzso The tendency of zzso zzso in the zzso may zzso a decreased zzso of zzso to the current circulating zzso Further work is needed to document and further understand the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of this novel zzso zzso with zzso zzso G gene zzso
