zzso zzso zzso was zzso from bovine adrenal zzso The zzso is a first protein component in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 56 zzso on zzso whereas the native protein was about 100 zzso suggesting a zzso zzso It zzso zzso reduction of 5, zzso zzso and zzso from various origins but not zzso oxidized zzso zzso acid, or zzso zzso acid and zzso sequence analyses revealed that it had a zzso composed of 21 zzso acids which had features characteristic of a zzso targeting zzso The zzso acid sequence of the mature protein was similar to that of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso and of human zzso zzso zzso and less similar to that of zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso zzso Human and bovine zzso zzso zzso were recently identified to contain zzso zzso as one of their zzso acid zzso We also identified zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso and zzso acid sequence analyses of the zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso which is zzso among all zzso zzso zzso probably functions as the third zzso zzso of the zzso as the zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso which was reported to modify zzso and zzso zzso It is known that zzso zzso zzso is different from bacterial or zzso zzso in, for example, their zzso molecular masses and domain zzso These two different types of zzso with similar activity are suggested to have evolved zzso Our data clearly show that zzso which might have originated from symbiotic zzso contain zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso and different from the bacterial zzso
