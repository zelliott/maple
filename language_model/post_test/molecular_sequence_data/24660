In this paper, an approach is described that combines multiple structure alignments and multiple sequence alignments to generate sequence profiles for protein zzso First, multiple sequence alignments are generated from sequences that are closely related to each sequence of known three-dimensional zzso These alignments then are merged through a multiple structure alignment of family members of known zzso The merged alignment is used to generate a Hidden zzso Model for the family in zzso The Hidden zzso Model can be used to search for new family members or to improve alignments for zzso related family members that already have been zzso Application of a profile generated for zzso zzso indicates that the zzso family of zzso protein zzso zzso contains zzso zzso This conclusion is strongly supported by the results of secondary zzso programs, zzso calculations, and the analysis of comparative models generated for these zzso One of the zzso zzso human zzso has an zzso domain that contains a zzso instead of the zzso zzso at the key zzso position, zzso zzso of the zzso values of the zzso zzso in a number of zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso suggest that this zzso is likely to be neutral around pH 7, thus indicating that it may have lost the ability to bind zzso If this indeed is the case, zzso may contain a domain with an zzso fold that has a modified binding zzso
