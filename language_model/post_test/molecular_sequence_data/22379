We report the first zzso project of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were generated by random sequencing of clones from a zzso library of the zzso juvenile zzso The zzso were zzso resulting in zzso useful zzso that were zzso into functional categories according to zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso had significant similarities to zzso sequences in zzso Of these, zzso had significant similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso belonged to the genetic information processing category followed by metabolism zzso zzso and environmental information processing zzso zzso Several interesting zzso were found that may have roles in the zzso and survival of zzso zzso These included zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso & zzso and aging and stress resistance genes such as zzso zzso zzso heat shock genes zzso & zzso and eat zzso and signaling proteins like zzso coupled zzso regulators of zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso Other interesting zzso include systemic zzso defective protein zzso zzso III family members zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso About zzso of the zzso did not find matches in any of the searched databases suggesting potentially novel genes in this zzso zzso Note: zzso described in this paper have been deposited in zzso under the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
