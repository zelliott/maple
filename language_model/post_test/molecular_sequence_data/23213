zzso DNA is a therapeutic target for a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso interactions of small molecules with DNA usually occur via zzso of zzso compounds between adjacent base pairs or zzso recognition by extended zzso zzso However, the dynamic and flexibility of the DNA platform provide a variety of zzso that can be targeted by structurally diverse zzso Here, we propose a novel zzso template for construction of new therapeutic zzso Four zzso zzso derived from the combined molecular zzso of known zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and their interaction with DNA has been studied by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso core with two terminal zzso side chains strongly promote the interaction with DNA, to prevent the heat zzso of the double zzso The deletion or the replacement of the zzso groups with zzso groups strongly decreased DNA interaction, and the addition of a third zzso side chain on the zzso nitrogen reinforced the affinity of the compound for zzso Although the zzso and zzso molecules both derive from zzso DNA zzso zzso the analysis of their binding mode by means of circular and linear zzso methods suggests that these compounds form zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso signals were recorded in the presence of natural DNA and synthetic AT and zzso zzso The zzso hypothesis was validated by unwinding experiments using zzso zzso zzso gel shifts were observed with the zzso and zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso These zzso together with the documented stacking properties of such molecules zzso for liquid zzso prompted us to investigate their binding to the human zzso DNA sequence by means of zzso surface zzso zzso Under conditions favorable to zzso formation, the title compounds showed only a modest interaction with the zzso zzso zzso comparable to that measured with a zzso zzso Their sequence preference was explored by zzso I zzso experiments from which we identified a composite set of binding sequences zzso short AT stretches and a few other mixed zzso blocks with no special AT zzso The variety of the binding sequences possibly reflects the coexistence of distinct positioning of the zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso unit represents an original zzso for DNA zzso Its zzso structure, with two or three arms suitable to introduce a structural diversity, provides an interesting scaffold to built molecules susceptible to discriminate between the different zzso of zzso zzso
