The microbial content of air has as yet been little zzso despite its public health zzso and there remains a lack of environmental microbial data on airborne zzso in enclosed zzso In this context, the aim of this study was to characterize the diversity and dynamics of airborne zzso in the Louvre Museum using zzso molecular tools and to underline the microbial signature of indoor air in this zzso zzso This microbial community was monitored for 6 month during occupied zzso The quantitative results revealed variations in the zzso of less than one zzso with average values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso equivalent per zzso for bacteria and zzso zzso Our observations highlight the stability of the indoor airborne bacterial diversity over time, while the corresponding zzso community was less zzso zzso diversity characterized by zzso zzso showed high diversity dominated by the zzso which represented zzso zzso and zzso of zzso for each of the three air samples zzso A common bacterial diversity was zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso The core species were belonging mostly to the zzso and zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
