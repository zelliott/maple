The zzso properties of a panel of synthetic peptides that represent the most accessible and mobile segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso corresponding to mouse zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and compared in terms of binding zzso raised in rabbits against the intact zzso Six of these sequences were zzso coupled to diphtheria zzso and used to zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso were zzso in immune zzso by zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the mouse zzso peptides in rabbits could be ranked in the following order: zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso The zzso properties of these short synthetic peptides did not correlate with features of the mouse zzso structure except that the most active sequences appeared to be those that differed from the zzso zzso to the greatest zzso These results have direct bearing on the selection of zzso zzso peptides for contraceptive vaccine studies in humans and zzso model zzso
