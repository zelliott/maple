The zzso zzso is amplified in many tumor zzso It is an important regulator of cell proliferation and has been linked to altered zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso might contribute to tumor zzso Although zzso has been reported to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso the mechanism has not been zzso We have shown that zzso expression of zzso influenced cell proliferation by targeting zzso a tumor zzso gene that is zzso in many common zzso including zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso genes associated with zzso in zzso through deregulation of zzso via the zzso signaling zzso This may be of clinical zzso
