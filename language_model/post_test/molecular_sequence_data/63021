Similar to the zzso family of zzso zzso viruses zzso contain zzso sequences located in the center of the zzso Their function on viral replication or zzso transfer remains zzso although dual initiation of zzso reverse zzso has been zzso To zzso the physical nature of the central region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we performed 3' and zzso zzso zzso Our results revealed that the zzso zzso contains a centrally located gap in the DNA zzso with no zzso termination and start point and of variable zzso We did not find evidence for a DNA zzso zzso The zzso isolate harbors four centrally located zzso elements zzso Only the D element is identical in sequence to the 3' zzso zzso tract zzso We zzso these elements while zzso or altering the overlapping pol reading frame and analyzed the zzso for transient replication in an infectious or for zzso transfer in a zzso zzso In addition, we determined the protein composition of the respective viral zzso The A and B elements appeared to play a role in Pol protein zzso the C element is likely involved in regulating gene zzso while zzso of the D element resulted in an insignificant reduction in zzso replicating virus and an approximately 50% reduction in zzso zzso The reason for this deficit remains to be zzso
