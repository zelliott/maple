A zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from the water of a shrimp zzso zzso zzso pond in zzso No species with a zzso published name showed zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of more than zzso % to this novel zzso The highest sequence similarities displayed by strain zzso zzso zzso were to members of the zzso zzso The zzso properties of this zzso were consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso The novel isolate could be distinguished from all zzso species by several zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso : 1) zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data demonstrate that strain zzso should be classified within a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
