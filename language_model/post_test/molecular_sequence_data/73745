We recently observed two zzso zzso proteins of 40 and 120 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of rats exposed to zzso zzso for 48 zzso The zzso sequences of these proteins were both identical over 16 zzso acids with rat zzso which, in addition to its more common association with milk, is produced by zzso zzso and has been found to have zzso zzso Because of the inflammatory response that accompanies zzso lung injury, we investigated the zzso of bovine zzso by zzso Following exposure to zzso at 4 degrees C for 15 zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso the zzso peptides were separated by zzso zzso One zzso isolated from a peak absorbing at 365 zzso was identified as zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of bovine zzso Analysis of the zzso by both zzso and zzso assisted laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso identified a molecular zzso zzso of zzso zzso which represents an increase of 178 Da from the calculated zzso zzso of the unmodified zzso of zzso zzso Daughter zzso zzso of the doubly charged parent zzso of the zzso further support the zzso of the zzso to the zzso zzso with subsequent conversion to the corresponding zzso with zzso A second pair of products were identified as arising from zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso constituted by zzso acids zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso side product, zzso Exposure of zzso to increasing amounts of zzso revealed that M and Y zzso were the most zzso although bovine zzso contains no C, and a single W, which would not be detected by our zzso The approach described in the present report can be used to evaluate the contributions of distinct mechanisms of zzso in other experimental or pathological zzso
