zzso proteins are common in many species of zzso where they participate in zzso folding and zzso regulation through pairing of small zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins share the distinctive zzso fold, and form zzso structures similar to those of the zzso proteins regulating zzso turnover in zzso However, bacterial zzso proteins are zzso whereas zzso zzso proteins are zzso Recently, zzso proteins with poor sequence conservation were identified in zzso and zzso In this article, we describe crystal structures of the zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso A resolution, respectively, and show that they retain the classic zzso fold despite low sequence zzso In addition, the zzso contacts and zzso site are zzso and we show zzso that the proteins bind very zzso to known zzso coli zzso target zzso in zzso Moreover, when expressed in zzso coli, the proteins cannot mediate zzso zzso zzso It therefore appears that the zzso proteins constitute a specialized zzso of zzso proteins that bind relatively zzso to zzso tracks of regulatory zzso The results have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the zzso fold and the zzso proteins in the bacterial kingdom in zzso
