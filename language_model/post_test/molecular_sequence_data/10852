In zzso the basic zzso zzso protein Twist may be involved in the negative regulation of cellular determination and in the differentiation of several zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Although it has been shown that mouse twist zzso zzso sequesters E zzso thus preventing formation of zzso E zzso complexes and zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor, a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of E proteins and zzso failed to rescue the zzso effects of zzso on zzso We report here that zzso physically interacts with the zzso zzso proteins in zzso and in zzso and that this interaction is required for the zzso of zzso by zzso In contrast to the conventional zzso domain interaction formed in the zzso zzso this novel type of interaction uses the basic zzso of the two zzso While the zzso zzso domain without the basic domain failed to interact with zzso a zzso zzso containing only the basic and zzso 1 regions was sufficient to interact with zzso suggesting that the basic domain contacts zzso The replacement of three zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso basic domain was sufficient to abolish both the binding and zzso of zzso by zzso while the domain retained other zzso functions such as zzso with an E protein and zzso of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso interacts with zzso through the basic zzso thereby zzso zzso
