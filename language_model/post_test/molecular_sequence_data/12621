The zzso trafficking, and zzso of zzso green fluorescent protein zzso in cultured zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso were zzso Fluorescence of zzso in zzso light was found to be strongest when cells were incubated at 30 degrees C but was barely visible at an incubation temperature of 37 degrees zzso zzso cells, primary chicken embryonic zzso cells, and carp zzso cells were zzso labeled under these zzso zzso was distributed zzso throughout the zzso and nucleus independent of cell type zzso When zzso was fused to zzso zzso product, zzso was detected in a unique nuclear zzso pattern indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso showing the potential use of zzso as a fluorescent zzso To analyze both function and zzso trafficking of proteins fused to zzso a zzso zzso zzso fusion construct was zzso The zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso the mouse zzso tumor virus promoter in response to zzso at 30 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C, indicating that temperature is important, even for function of the zzso fusion zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso to nucleus was complete within 15 zzso the zzso could be monitored in a single living cell in real zzso
