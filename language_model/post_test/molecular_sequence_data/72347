The structure and zzso stability of empty and zzso forms of the zzso class II major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso were studied at neutral and mildly zzso zzso The two forms have distinct circular zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso change may accompany zzso zzso zzso stability profiles indicate that binding of zzso significantly increases the zzso stability of the empty zzso at both neutral and mildly zzso zzso Free energies calculated from these data provide a direct measure of this stabilization and show that the empty form of zzso is significantly more stable than that of class I zzso zzso Furthermore, for the two zzso class II proteins that were analyzed zzso and zzso zzso stability was not significantly altered by zzso In contrast, of four class I zzso molecules zzso three have shown a significant loss in complex stability at low zzso The marked stability exhibited by their empty form, as well as their resistance to low zzso as observed in this study, correlate well with the ability of class II zzso molecules to traverse and bind peptides in zzso zzso zzso
