zzso use of zzso on cotton in the zzso has prompted resistance development in the tarnished plant zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso A field population of tarnished plant bugs in Mississippi with zzso higher resistance to zzso was used to examine how gene regulation zzso resistance to this zzso zzso In laboratory zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso effectively abolished resistance and increased zzso toxicity by more than zzso zzso activities were compared in zzso between zzso susceptible and resistant zzso zzso More than zzso 3- and zzso higher activities were obtained with the resistant strain using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Up to zzso and zzso of the zzso activity in the susceptible and resistant zzso respectively, was inhibited by 1 zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity up to zzso and zzso in the susceptible and resistant zzso respectively, was obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso activities in field populations increased by up to zzso during the fall zzso The increase was synchronized with movement of the insect into cotton where exposure to pesticides zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from both zzso susceptible and resistant zzso The zzso zzso contained a zzso open reading frame coding a zzso zzso acid protein which was similar to many insect zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso acid substitution was observed between susceptible and resistant zzso indicating that zzso gene zzso was not involved in resistance development in the resistant strain in zzso Further examination of zzso gene expression levels using quantitative zzso revealed that the resistant strain had a zzso higher level of zzso zzso than the susceptible zzso The results of this study indicated that zzso of the zzso gene appeared to be related to the development of resistance in the tarnished plant zzso
