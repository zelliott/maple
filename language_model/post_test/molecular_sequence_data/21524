The DNA zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso isolated from a hand zzso of an zzso zzso old male was fully zzso zzso and zzso The full zzso of zzso is zzso in length with a zzso content of zzso By comparing the zzso sequence of the complete zzso zzso zzso is zzso placed within zzso species 2 of zzso and is most closely related to zzso and zzso zzso has a typical zzso organization of zzso and contains genes coding for five early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two late zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso contains two zzso zzso the first located between the zzso and E6 genes zzso positions zzso length zzso and the second between genes zzso and zzso zzso positions zzso length zzso The E6 protein of zzso contains two regular zzso zzso at zzso acid positions 29 and 102, whereas the zzso protein exhibits one such domain at position zzso zzso lacks the regular zzso core sequence within its zzso zzso In order to assess the tissue zzso and clinical significance of zzso a quantitative zzso real-time zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso copies per reaction zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of variation were zzso and zzso for 100 copies per reaction, and zzso and zzso for 10 copies per reaction, zzso Testing of a representative collection of zzso zzso and zzso benign and zzso zzso and hair zzso (a total of zzso zzso showed that zzso is a relatively rare zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso linked with sporadic cases of common zzso
