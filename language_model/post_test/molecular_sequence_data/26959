The zzso acid zzso gene zzso is involved in the zzso acid stress response zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene encodes the negative zzso regulator of zzso and is zzso with a downstream zzso zzso which encodes a putative universal stress protein zzso zzso of unknown zzso The zzso gene is zzso during the zzso However, the role and the mechanism of action of the zzso are unknown in zzso zzso zzso to gain insights into the role of zzso in the zzso zzso a zzso deletion zzso was zzso zzso the two genes zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso under its own promoter as a reporter gene in zzso zzso and zzso molecular in zzso interactions between the zzso zzso and the zzso promoter were zzso Although the zzso zzso strain retained zzso zzso zzso activity, it displayed a greater sensitivity to strong zzso conditions compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso cannot be zzso directly by zzso acid in zzso coli zzso cultures but is zzso by zzso when the two proteins are zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso coli cells was supported by zzso mobility shift zzso Although zzso seems not to be absolutely required for the zzso its capacity to zzso zzso indicates that it could serve as an important zzso in acid stress response mechanisms through its capacity to interact with zzso zzso
