The zzso zzso of a zzso brown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to contain four group zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene and three group zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We found extreme zzso in the number of group II zzso for these two genes by analyzing eight zzso zzso specimens collected at worldwide zzso The first zzso of the zzso zzso gene from a zzso collected in France and the fourth zzso from a zzso harvested in Japan exhibited an exceptionally long evolutionary distance when compared with the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso zzso an intact or nearly intact zzso ORF, suggesting they are the result of a recent invasion of zzso zzso Based on the fact that many of the target sites were zzso we propose that opportunity of zzso infection is the bottleneck step of the group II zzso cycle which consists of invasion, zzso and complete loss from the target zzso
