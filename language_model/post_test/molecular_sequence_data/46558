A quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso zzso was developed to measure the amount of human zzso zzso 16 DNA per zzso equivalent in cervical zzso The quantitative approach was based on a combined competitive zzso for both zzso 16, using the general primer zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two competitive zzso involve zzso of target sequences and zzso added DNA zzso carrying a rearranged 30 zzso sequence in the zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso by combining the two competitive zzso zzso was validated on zzso of zzso 16 containing cervical cancer cells of zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of this fully quantitative zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso on a series of crude cell suspensions from zzso 16 containing cervical scrapings revealed remarkable differences in the calculated relative zzso load between zzso We found evidence that correction for both zzso variations in zzso efficiency and number of input zzso of DNA significantly influence the outcome of studies on viral DNA load in crude cell suspensions of cervical zzso zzso accurate zzso on viral DNA load in cervical scrapings require corrections for these phenomena, which can be achieved by application of this fully quantitative zzso
