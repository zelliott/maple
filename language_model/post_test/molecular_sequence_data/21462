zzso zzso is correlated with genetic zzso and zzso zzso Our previous studies indicated that the zzso zzso factor, zzso is responsible for hypoxic suppression of DNA repair in tumor cells by a zzso mode of action that requires the zzso zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in genetic zzso has raised an intriguing question as to whether normal cells would respond to hypoxic stress differently to avert genetic zzso In this study, we chose several mouse cell types ranging from benign to zzso zzso to zzso and determined their responses to zzso zzso In agreement with our previous findings, transient zzso and zzso expression inhibited DNA repair and induced DNA damage in all cell types zzso however, cumulative DNA damage only occurred in zzso zzso cells zzso for sustained expression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso In keeping with the theory of zzso as a cancer barrier, only these zzso cells acquired zzso growth and zzso zzso Furthermore, these cells exhibited increased zzso activity and resistance to zzso by zzso zzso Altogether, our results define an essential role for zzso to prevent zzso genetic zzso and thereby zzso zzso
