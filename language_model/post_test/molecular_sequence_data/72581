A zzso repeat zzso in the zzso gene is zzso zzso is expressed early in cardiac muscle zzso thus the possibility of linkage between this zzso and familial zzso was investigated in three families not linked to genes coding for known zzso zzso zzso was excluded as a candidate for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in these zzso Because expansion of zzso repeats has been shown to be responsible for several inherited diseases, 121 unrelated zzso zzso and 28 unrelated zzso zzso were examined for evidence of expansion of this zzso No expansion of this zzso repeat was seen in any of the 149 zzso zzso
