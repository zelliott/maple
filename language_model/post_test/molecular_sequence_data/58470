zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein of the zzso zzso zzso In both humans and zzso zzso is zzso at or in the zzso The degradation of zzso is regulated as part of feedback control of the zzso zzso Neither the mechanism of degradation nor the nature of the signals that couple the degradation of zzso to the zzso zzso is zzso We have launched a genetic analysis of the degradation of zzso in zzso zzso using a selection for zzso that are deficient in the degradation of zzso an zzso zzso The underlying genes are called zzso (pronounced zzso for zzso zzso zzso So far we have discovered zzso in three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sequence of the zzso gene is zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso also called zzso has been proposed to be a component of the mature zzso zzso The zzso zzso had numerous zzso zzso expected for cells with a compromised zzso and these zzso were zzso by the human zzso coding zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso genes zzso previously unknown proteins predicted to be membrane zzso The zzso protein was zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of at least two different membrane zzso and contained an zzso motif shared with several other zzso zzso had no full-length zzso but contained an zzso ring finger zzso These data suggested a model of zzso protein degradation in which the zzso and zzso proteins conspire to deliver zzso to the zzso zzso Moreover, our results lend in zzso support to the proposed role of the zzso protein as a functionally important component of the zzso zzso Because the zzso genes were required for the degradation of both regulated and zzso zzso of zzso degradation, the zzso genes are the agents of zzso degradation but not the regulators of that zzso
