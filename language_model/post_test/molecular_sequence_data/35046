zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 and 8 are responsible for recognizing viral zzso zzso zzso and are activated by zzso zzso compounds, leading to a series of defensive mechanisms being launched to protect the host against zzso In this study, we identified two zzso (with one probably a zzso and three zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso from Atlantic salmon zzso zzso zzso shotgun zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that salmon zzso and zzso are closely related to the corresponding trout zzso however, salmon zzso and zzso share the highest zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso zzso and formed a zzso of the zzso zzso molecules in zzso tree zzso A zzso gene zzso was found with the salmon zzso members as seen in other zzso zzso zzso domain zzso of salmon zzso and zzso molecules showed similar structural features, with equal numbers of zzso repeats zzso and zzso zzso Individual zzso molecules were expressed in a similar pattern between zzso and zzso with a high expression level in immune zzso zzso analysis predicted several zzso factor binding sites in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family, suggesting zzso regulation of the zzso zzso three zzso zzso type I zzso zzso and zzso were used to study the regulation of the salmon zzso gene expression levels in primary head kidney cells and the zzso Head zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was more sensitive to type I zzso and zzso treatment in primary head kidney cells and zzso cells respectively, with no significant zzso of zzso and zzso by any of the zzso On the other hand, salmon zzso and zzso were most sensitive to zzso treatment in zzso cells and primary head kidney cells, zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells under these same zzso
