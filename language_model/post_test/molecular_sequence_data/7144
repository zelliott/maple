Heat shock factor 2 zzso functions as a zzso regulator of heat shock protein gene expression in zzso cells undergoing processes of differentiation and zzso Our previous studies demonstrated high regulated expression and unusual zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein in mouse zzso suggesting that zzso functions to regulate heat shock protein gene expression in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to test whether zzso regulation in zzso is associated with zzso in the zzso zzso expressed in zzso relative to other mouse zzso Our results show that mouse cells express not one but two distinct zzso proteins and that the levels of these zzso zzso are regulated in a zzso zzso The zzso express predominantly the zzso zzso zzso while the heart and brain express primarily the zzso zzso zzso These zzso are generated by alternative zzso of zzso zzso which results in the inclusion of an zzso coding sequence in the zzso zzso that is skipped in the zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso is also zzso zzso as our results reveal a switch in expression from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso zzso the zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells, is a more potent zzso zzso than the zzso zzso These results reveal a new mechanism for the control of zzso function in zzso cells, in which regulated alternative zzso is used to zzso zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso
