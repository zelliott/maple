Virtually nothing is known about disease resistance in solitary zzso so expressed sequence tag zzso databases were developed to search for immune response genes in the alfalfa zzso zzso We identified 104 putative zzso genes from both healthy and zzso bee larvae, and 12 more genes using zzso zzso The genes identified coded for proteins with a wide variety of innate immune response functions, including pathogen recognition, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso Some immune response genes were highly zzso with honey bee zzso and more zzso related to other zzso The data presented provides the first analysis of immune function in a solitary bee and provides a foundation for the further analysis of gene expression patterns in zzso
