zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso coli, has been zzso to apparent zzso by conventional zzso procedures using zzso oxidized insulin zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso behaves as a zzso protein under both zzso and zzso conditions, suggesting that it consists of a single zzso zzso It is inhibited by zzso agents, including zzso and zzso but not by zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was found to contain zzso zzso of zinc per zzso of the zzso upon analysis by zzso zzso mass zzso Thus, zzso zzso must be a zinc zzso Among the zzso tested as zzso oxidized insulin zzso and zzso are most rapidly zzso zzso insulin is a much poorer zzso than oxidized insulin zzso even though the affinity of the zzso to intact insulin is approximately zzso greater than that to the zzso Since zzso oxidized insulin zzso is capable of zzso the zzso of zzso insulin zzso it also appears to be a zzso zzso zzso also degrades zzso and zzso although to a much lesser extent than oxidized insulin zzso However, it shows little or no activity against proteins larger than 15 zzso zzso zzso and zzso bovine serum zzso zzso of oxidized insulin zzso followed by zzso acid composition analyses of the zzso products reveals that as many as 10 of its 29 zzso bonds are zzso by zzso zzso This ability to zzso relatively small zzso suggests that zzso zzso may catalyze the later steps in the zzso for zzso protein zzso
