Based on recent structural analyses of zzso zzso it appears that a number of these zzso express zzso zzso variable region zzso genes with little or no zzso zzso In addition, our group and others have noted the identity or near identity of some zzso V genes to V genes apparently expressed zzso in the fetal zzso cell zzso To extend these data, we now report that the heavy and light chain V genes of an zzso zzso derived from a healthy individual display zzso zzso sequence zzso with V genes expressed in early B cell zzso zzso comparisons indicate the likely use of zzso V genes by this zzso Taken together with other data on zzso V gene zzso these findings provide further evidence for overlap between the zzso and early zzso expressed V gene zzso and suggest that natural zzso may be instrumental in the development and maintenance of the normal immune zzso
