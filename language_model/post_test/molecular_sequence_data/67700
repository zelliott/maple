A major goal of zzso is the characterization of zzso factors and the zzso programs they zzso Given the speed of zzso sequencing, we would like to quickly zzso regulatory sequences in zzso zzso In such cases, it would be helpful to predict sequence motifs by using experimental data from closely related model zzso Here we present a general zzso that allow to identify zzso factor binding sites in one newly zzso species by performing zzso zzso on the zzso zzso First we set the rationale of our method by applying it within the same species, then we extend it to use data available in closely related zzso Finally, we zzso the method to handle the case when a certain number of experiments, from several species close to the species on which to make zzso are zzso In order to show the performance of the method, we zzso three functionally related networks in the zzso Two gene network case studies are related to the zzso phase of the zzso cell zzso the third is related to zzso We also compared the method with zzso and discuss other types of validation and zzso The first network is well known and provides a biological validation test of the zzso The two cell cycle case studies, where the gene network size is zzso demonstrate an effective utility in zzso new species sequences using all the available zzso from model zzso The third case, where the gene network size varies among species, shows that the combination of information is less powerful but is still zzso Our methodology is quite general and could be extended to integrate other zzso data from model zzso
