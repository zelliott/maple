The heavy and light chain zzso variable region zzso sequences for 219 zzso to human red blood cells were collected from workshop participants, published reports, and zzso Information regarding zzso zzso species of origin, method of zzso and other relevant zzso properties was correlated with the sequence zzso zzso sequences were analyzed to determine the zzso and zzso zzso genes used and the overall extent of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 50% of the sequences zzso zzso with zzso specificity with the remaining sequences zzso zzso to other zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso blood group systems, and several zzso Surprisingly, no sequence data were available for zzso with specificity for a number of common zzso zzso common zzso zzso or zzso of the Lewis, Kidd, or zzso blood group zzso The majority of zzso were of human origin but included a significant number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a small number of zzso zzso zzso Both cellular zzso cell zzso and molecular zzso zzso approaches were used for zzso zzso Analysis of certain groups of sequences demonstrated patterns of zzso gene zzso repertoire shift, and zzso zzso Analysis of other zzso demonstrated the value of zzso sequence data for the design and production of novel zzso useful in blood group zzso
