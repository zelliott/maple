zzso syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability associated with zzso of the upper central zzso as well as distinct zzso findings, short zzso and skeletal zzso Although believed to be genetic in origin, the specific underlying zzso is zzso Through zzso sequencing, we identified deleterious zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso repeat domain 11, also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the disease in a family with three affected members, whereas in a zzso case a de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso sequencing revealed additional de zzso zzso zzso zzso in three other zzso zzso zzso is known to interact with nuclear zzso complexes to modify zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso mainly to the zzso of zzso and accumulates in discrete inclusions when zzso are zzso suggesting that it plays a role in neural zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso in zzso cause zzso syndrome and outline a fundamental role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and central nervous system development and zzso
