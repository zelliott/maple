We present the first molecular zzso examination of the evolutionary position of zzso a group of zzso zzso usually found as zzso of the zzso tracts of zzso Our zzso include small zzso zzso gene sequences from six zzso zzso from zzso and two from zzso All six sequences were highly similar zzso with those from zzso being almost identical to each zzso All zzso methods zzso unequivocally placed zzso with another zzso group, the zzso Surprisingly, all methods zzso supported a position for zzso zzso within zzso as the sister group to zzso This position would conflict with a single origin and uniform retention of the zzso organization displayed by most zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso was not rejected by zzso zzso and expected likelihood weights methods but was marginally rejected by zzso zzso zzso with additional zzso markers are needed to test this controversial branching order within the zzso + zzso zzso Nevertheless, the robust zzso association between zzso and zzso suggests that they share an zzso zzso Because strong evidence indicates that zzso have zzso lost their zzso (rather than being zzso zzso our results imply that zzso are also zzso zzso Of the various groups of zzso originally suggested to be zzso zzso under the zzso hypothesis, all have now been found to have physical or genetic zzso relics (or zzso or form a robust zzso with an zzso with such a zzso
