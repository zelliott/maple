We have isolated and characterized a zzso for zzso zzso zzso and its gene from the chick zzso Using zzso from a zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso clone zzso zzso was isolated from an embryonic zzso chick zzso zzso zzso Although the clone was truncated at the zzso end, the complete coding sequence was obtained from zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends and zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso a 311 zzso acid precursor protein which contains a putative 36 zzso signal zzso The mature 275 zzso acid protein had a predicted zzso of zzso and exhibited 71, 68, 68 and zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso respectively, with conservation of all 18 zzso The zzso contained an zzso zzso but lacked a putative zzso zzso A single transcript of approximately zzso zzso was present in embryonic zzso eye, brain, skeletal muscle, heart and zzso but was virtually absent from embryonic zzso zzso The chicken zzso gene spanned approximately 38 zzso consisted of four zzso and was similarly organized to that of the rat and zzso Southern zzso analysis of chicken zzso DNA suggested that it is zzso by a single zzso The sequence information from the avian zzso should be of value in examining the role of zzso in zzso zzso
