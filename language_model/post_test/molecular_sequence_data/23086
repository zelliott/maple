The abundant zinc finger proteins zzso sharing the zzso zzso a potent zzso repression domain, direct the assembly on templates of zzso repression zzso A pivotal step in this zzso is the assembly of a zzso zzso complex with a primary zzso zzso The zzso dependence of zzso zzso interaction and properties of the complex, therefore, play pivotal roles in diverse cellular processes depending on zzso zzso zzso zzso are functionally zzso The 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso indeed, is necessary and sufficient for zzso repression and for the interaction with the zzso zzso region of zzso while the zzso motif seems to zzso the assembly of the zzso The structural properties of zzso and zzso zzso from the human zzso protein have been investigated by characterizing highly zzso lone zzso and composite zzso zzso zzso and zzso features, investigated by means of gel zzso circular zzso and infrared zzso provide evidence that both zzso and zzso zzso present low zzso structural disorder, residual secondary structure content, flexibility, and tendency to molecular zzso Comparative analysis among zzso and zzso zzso suggests that the presence of the zzso module may influence the properties of lone zzso by affecting the structural flexibility and stability of the zzso The combined experimental data and the intrinsic features of zzso and zzso primary structures indicate a potential role of specific zzso within the zzso in driving structural flexibility, which is proposed to be of importance for their zzso
