Present work reported the cloning and characterization of a human novel zzso binding gene Partner of zzso zzso with a length of zzso and a putative open reading frame of zzso zzso isolated from human zzso It is composed of seven zzso and is localized on zzso zzso Western zzso showed that the molecular weight of zzso is about zzso zzso results in 16 human zzso indicated that zzso is expressed mainly in liver, zzso zzso and zzso slightly in zzso zzso zzso respectively, but not in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, zzso zzso zzso small zzso colon and peripheral blood zzso zzso fusion expression in zzso cells exhibited its zzso in the nucleus, especially in zzso zzso zzso of thirteen zzso fusion zzso deletion proteins showed that the region of zzso zzso is solely responsible for its zzso zzso and zzso domain alone is not sufficient for zzso zzso The zzso family shows significant conservation in both zzso and zzso
