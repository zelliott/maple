Recent advances in molecular zzso led to a new understanding on zzso brain zzso system which play a major role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso neuroendocrine function as well as in the zzso of several pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, affective disorders, zzso drug addiction zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso which were divided into zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso D3 and zzso families of receptors has been zzso The article reviews the recent advances including author's own results concerning the structure and function of main zzso brain system, zzso zzso and zzso The problem of zzso regulation of zzso zzso particularly, the processes of zzso zzso release and metabolism has been specially zzso An involvement of zzso and D3 zzso zzso in the control of these processes and differences in the mode of action of typical and zzso zzso demonstrating various affinities to zzso and D3 zzso receptors are zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso have been determined on freely moving rats using brain zzso and high performance liquid zzso It is hypothesized that zzso D3 zzso is zzso involved in the regulation of zzso release while zzso one is responsible for the control of zzso synthesis and metabolism in rat zzso zzso in zzso
