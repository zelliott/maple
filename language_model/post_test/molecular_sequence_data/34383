The bacterial zzso zzso has only one species, zzso zzso containing five zzso All five are plant zzso among which three are recognized as zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Prevention of their introduction and epidemic outbreaks requires a reliable and accurate zzso Currently, identification of these bacteria is time consuming and often problematic, mainly because of zzso with other zzso bacteria in zzso tests and zzso results in zzso detection zzso Furthermore, distinguishing closely related subspecies is not zzso This study aimed at evaluating the use of zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso sequence for the reliable and fast identification of the zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of zzso using a single primer set had sufficient resolution and specificity to identify each subspecies based on both sequence similarities in cluster analyses and specific signatures within the zzso All five subspecies also generated distinct and zzso zzso zzso profiles, with unique and specific zzso zzso for each subspecies, which could be used as zzso for zzso zzso from both methods were in agreement and were able to distinguish the five zzso subspecies from each other and from representatives of closely related zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso analysis using zzso zzso and zzso sequence are powerful diagnostic tools for the accurate identification of zzso plant zzso
