The plant zzso clock is proposed to be a network of several interconnected feedback zzso and loss of any component leads to changes in zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to sustain this zzso and that the zzso zzso is zzso This zzso is shared with both zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso causes zzso to form zzso in the zzso We used expression data to direct a mathematical position of zzso in the clock zzso This revealed direct effects on the morning clock gene zzso and we determined association of zzso to a zzso region of the zzso zzso A zzso in this region was suggestive of zzso recruitment by the zzso factor zzso consistent with both zzso and zzso acting genetically downstream of zzso Taken together, using integrated approaches, we identified zzso together with zzso to be pivotal for zzso of plant zzso zzso
