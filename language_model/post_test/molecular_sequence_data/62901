zzso was originally cloned on the basis of sequence zzso to zzso and zzso and indeed, a multiple sequence alignment of 32 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso reveals a cluster composed by the four closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (here named zzso zzso of transgenic plants zzso a zzso fusion zzso green fluorescent protein zzso indicates that zzso is broadly expressed within the plant, including key target sites of zzso acid zzso action as guard cells or zzso The expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is strongly zzso in response to zzso zzso In this work, we show that zzso expression of zzso in zzso under a cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso promoter led to reduced zzso sensitivity both in seeds and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Thus, in the field of zzso zzso this work represents an example of a stable zzso in zzso after sustained zzso of a zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in this work, whereas previous studies of zzso zzso of zzso genes were carried out with zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso that carry zzso zzso in zzso regions of the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso zzso of seed zzso however, its zzso rate was similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso seeds together with the reduced zzso sensitivity of zzso plants are consistent with a role of zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso Finally, these results provide new genetic evidence on the function of a zzso in zzso zzso
