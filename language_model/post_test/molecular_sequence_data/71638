We cloned and zzso zzso DNA zzso spanning over 45 zzso surrounding the zzso site of the zzso that is responsible for the zzso defects in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso This region harbors 10 functional zzso units, in addition to the already zzso zzso zzso These include the zzso undefined 1 zzso zzso and zzso each coding for proteins of unknown function, the zzso gene zzso a new zzso putative zzso factor, the fly zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the first zzso member of the zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso a new zzso zzso and a gene coding for a putative nuclear binding protein zzso that is zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso exists in an zzso of the zzso zzso yet is expressed independent of zzso The zzso and zzso genes orient in a zzso manner with their 3' untranslated region sequences overlapping over 44 zzso Thus the partial overlap and zzso organization permitted dense packing of the functional genes within a short segment of the zzso
