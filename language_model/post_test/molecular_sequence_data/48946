The experimental validation of genes predicted from zzso sequence and the identification of functions for these genes is an increasingly important zzso We report a multidisciplinary analysis of zzso a predicted gene adjacent to Mothers against zzso in zzso zzso We cloned and zzso a zzso corresponding to zzso and we show that it is expressed in zzso A zzso analysis shows that zzso contains a number of zzso zzso present in zzso capable of zzso zzso A zzso analysis shows that zzso is the zzso of human zzso zzso and that these genes belong to a novel zzso family with members in animals, plants, zzso and zzso A genetic analysis shows that zzso for a zzso deletion that removes zzso zzso enhances the excess zzso zzso associated with a zzso in zzso an zzso obesity zzso Further, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso this obesity zzso Overall, the data suggests that zzso functions as a zzso and that analyses of its zzso will provide unique insights into zzso metabolism in many zzso
