In order to further understand the unusual specificity of zzso activity, we have examined the interactions of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso by two complementary zzso Using genetically engineered zzso we have zzso a fusion protein containing zzso A zzso zzso and seven zzso of this protein with zzso in zzso zzso These fusion proteins were zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso substantially increased zzso but all the fusion proteins were equally good zzso when zzso at zzso equivalent to zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are important for zzso zzso but not zzso We have also zzso a zzso analogous to zzso alpha zzso This zzso was a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso of zzso but was not an inhibitor of zzso of small zzso zzso These data further indicate that zzso alpha zzso are important in the zzso zzso
