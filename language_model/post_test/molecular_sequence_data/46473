zzso are industrially attractive zzso and their applications have expanded to the field of zzso The challenge of today's biotechnology in zzso studies is to design zzso that not only have a higher activity but are also more stable and could fit well with the condition zzso zzso are known to zzso zzso zzso like zzso aromatic zzso zzso We suppose by increasing the zzso of zzso it would increase the chance of the zzso to meet the zzso zzso in a contamination site, therefore increasing the zzso efficacy of zzso from zzso In this attempt, the applications of evolutionary trace zzso molecular surface accessibility and zzso analysis on zzso sequences and zzso crystal structure zzso are described for optimal design of an zzso with higher zzso Our analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be promising exchanges to be tested in zzso zzso
