A full-length zzso zzso has been cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso from tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains an open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso with a putative zzso zzso at its zzso Southern analysis indicates the existence of one copy of zzso per zzso zzso and no closely related genes were detected by Southern analysis at low zzso We zzso that in tomato, the two zzso zzso may arise from zzso modifications of a single zzso Northern analysis reveals high expression of zzso in roots, lower levels of expression in zzso flowers and leaves, and no zzso expression in zzso In general, there was no correlation between zzso zzso level and protein activity in the zzso zzso again suggesting the importance of zzso events in the regulation of zzso zzso of cloned plant zzso proteins reveals a high degree of zzso throughout the sequence except for a very specific, highly divergent zzso
