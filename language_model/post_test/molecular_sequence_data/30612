An automatic procedure for defining zzso folding motifs in proteins of known structure is zzso These motifs are formed by short zzso fragments of equal size containing between four and seven zzso The method applies a classical zzso zzso that operates on distances between selected backbone zzso In one application, we use it to cluster all protein fragments into only four structural zzso This zzso is rough considering the observed diversity of local structures, but comparable in zzso to the four classes of secondary structure zzso zzso turn and zzso Yet, it discriminates between extended and curved zzso and zzso zzso from zzso In a second application, the zzso procedure is combined with assignment of backbone zzso angles to allowed regions in the zzso zzso This produces an exhaustive repertoire of highly homogeneous families of structural motifs that contains all the zzso beta zzso and alpha zzso previously defined by manual procedures, and new structural families of which two examples, a beta zzso and an zzso beginning, are analyzed in zzso The described automatic procedures should be useful in zzso structure information in zzso thereby increasing our ability to analyze relations between structure and zzso
