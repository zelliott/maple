A zzso analysis was undertaken for the zzso element of zzso zzso in five strains which differ greatly in zzso The zzso element has recently been described in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and consists of three small open reading frames in addition to the toxin A and B zzso A large, zzso transcript zzso zzso was zzso in addition to processing zzso and individual transcripts for toxin A, toxin B, and two of the three small open reading zzso A zzso initiation site and a promoter for the zzso element were identified, as well as major extension products upstream of the toxin A and B zzso These data support models in which the toxin A and B genes are zzso along with the open reading zzso in addition to being transcribed zzso zzso zzso using zzso for the transcripts for toxin A and toxin B, revealed quantitative differences among strains which correlated with quantitative differences in toxin production among these zzso However, DNA sequencing of zzso regions in these strains showed remarkable DNA sequence conservation in these zzso zzso
