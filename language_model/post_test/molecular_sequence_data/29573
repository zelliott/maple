zzso are associated with certain zzso zzso and are introduced into the body cavity of the host zzso during zzso Some of the viral genes are expressed in host zzso and corresponding proteins are zzso into the zzso causing suppression of the host immune zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene product, zzso effectively zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso A precondition for the zzso function is the incorporation of the zzso protein by zzso Here, we show that a zzso domain containing a putative zzso zzso is required for zzso function, since removal of this domain zzso binding and zzso of the zzso protein by zzso
