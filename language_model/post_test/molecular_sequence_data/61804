zzso zzso is an environmental zzso which is responsible for the disease zzso zzso a zzso skin disease emerging in west zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso zzso zzso which is required for the zzso and tissue damage which characterizes zzso zzso We have extracted lipids from the cell envelope and culture zzso from 52 zzso of zzso species, analyzed them with zzso zzso and tested them in a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso to investigate whether these zzso species produce zzso For these studies zzso zzso zzso extracts were prepared from representative zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tested included 16 zzso zzso environmental zzso species isolated from areas in which zzso zzso infection is zzso Although several strains of zzso studied produced zzso zzso none of these produced a zzso on cultured cells consistent with that produced by zzso Two zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and eight of the environmental zzso zzso contained zzso lipids zzso to zzso at zzso of 33 to 1,000 zzso In contrast, zzso produces zzso at less than 2 zzso Analysis of zzso zzso sequences from the eight environmental zzso suggests that these are novel zzso zzso zzso from these studies suggest that, although production of zzso lipids is relatively common among zzso species, the production of zzso as a zzso or zzso zzso appears so far to be restricted to zzso zzso
