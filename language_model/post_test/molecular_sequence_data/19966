The diversity of zzso was studied in zzso and zzso zzso of a semi-arid region in zzso zzso was undertaken at an agricultural site, two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso community structure was zzso using amplified zzso DNA restriction analysis zzso combined with zzso sequencing of an example of each restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso analysis demonstrated that both zzso and zzso zzso were present at zzso depths in the soil at all field zzso Along with previously described soil zzso zzso novel soil lineages and the deeply divergent zzso group of zzso were also zzso A novel statistical method for comparing zzso derived data was demonstrated and implemented using the zzso communities from the four field zzso zzso diversity, as measured by this method, was significantly higher in the agricultural site than at either of the zzso sites or the zzso zzso
