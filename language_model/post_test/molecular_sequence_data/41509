zzso zzso molecules have an enormous potential for therapeutic applications in zzso The major aim of such strategies is to specifically interfere with gene function, thus modulating cellular pathways according to the therapeutic zzso Among the molecules which can block zzso function in a sequence specific manner are zzso zzso acids zzso They are highly stable and efficiently and selectively interact with zzso However, some properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hamper their in zzso zzso 

We generated new backbone modifications of zzso which exhibit more zzso zzso When we examined the activity and specificity of these novel zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules in zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso and selective binding to zzso was zzso In particular, mixing of the novel components with zzso components resulted in mixed zzso with superior zzso zzso of mixed zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso which is important for eye and brain development, resulted in specific zzso zzso 

zzso are well established as powerful zzso zzso zzso of the backbone with zzso zzso side chains further improves their properties and allows the efficient knock down of a single gene in fish zzso
