zzso protein zzso zzso are key regulators of cellular zzso systems that mediate responses to a wide variety of zzso stimuli and should also play a central role in zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso Until now, however, no zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in a member of this zzso zzso Here, we report the identification and zzso of such a zzso zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a degenerative zzso approach, we isolated and completely zzso the zzso zzso for zzso which displays significant zzso to known zzso zzso of different zzso zzso zzso contains all zzso acid zzso which are characteristic for zzso zzso including a zzso zzso motif which identifies the protein as a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and contained 10 zzso Southern zzso zzso studies showed that zzso is present as single copy locus in zzso zzso Using zzso analyses we demonstrated that zzso is expressed in form of three different transcripts which derive from alternative zzso zzso site zzso at zzso zzso Using zzso zzso in Western zzso studies and zzso we detected the zzso protein and its zzso form in the zzso stages zzso and zzso during in zzso zzso and during an infection of the intermediate zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso basic protein in activity zzso indicating that it is a functionally active zzso zzso Finally, we also show that zzso of zzso is specifically induced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso host serum and upon addition of human zzso growth zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is able to sense zzso growth factor from the host which results in an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
