The zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the target of a novel zzso that is effective against zzso and zzso in animal zzso zzso of native zzso zzso from zzso and zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso of about 110 zzso and a slightly smaller soluble zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso clones in zzso yield similarly sized zzso zzso which zzso on zzso gels with the corresponding native zzso zzso of targeted zzso of potential zzso initiation sites suggest that zzso zzso is a product of alternative zzso initiation from an internal zzso zzso zzso Exclusive expression of zzso or zzso can be achieved by preventing initiation at the respective primary or secondary zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso zzso primarily to the zzso plasma zzso while zzso remains zzso zzso and zzso labeling studies reveal that the observed zzso of full-length zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso at zzso acids zzso and zzso We also confirm the functional significance of a putative third zzso zzso site, common to zzso zzso but absent from zzso or insect zzso In zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring a zzso at this site express markedly lower levels of zzso zzso activity, while a triple zzso bearing zzso in all three sites reduces zzso activity to background zzso
