zzso zzso zzso a zzso inherited disease, has been mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat markers zzso the genetic locus and at the same genetic location have been zzso We describe the prenatal diagnosis of zzso using linkage and linkage zzso analyses with these zzso Twelve families were zzso for zzso and of these, seven went on to have prenatal testing (a total of eight fetuses zzso All of these fetuses were predicted to be zzso unaffected zzso zzso Seven fetuses have come to term and are zzso In the absence of a zzso zzso a panel of three zzso and three zzso markers is sufficient to provide zzso zzso markers and an zzso per cent likelihood of a highly zzso zzso In an additional family at zzso risk for zzso no DNA was available from the zzso This family was zzso using linkage zzso to the zzso zzso of the tightly linked marker zzso in conjunction with linkage analysis using data from two unaffected zzso zzso diagnosis in this family indicated an affected zzso
