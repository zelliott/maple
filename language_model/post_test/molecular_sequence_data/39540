The motor protein zzso drives the zzso of zzso across the zzso channel in the bacterial zzso membrane by zzso cycles of zzso changes often referred to as membrane zzso Despite structural data on zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso the identity of the sites of interaction between zzso and zzso are zzso Here, we show that zzso can be zzso to several zzso in zzso loop 5 zzso of zzso and that zzso directly interacts with a part of zzso segment 4 zzso of zzso that is buried in the membrane region of zzso zzso of either the zzso zzso in zzso or zzso in zzso interferes with the zzso activity of zzso but not with binding of zzso to zzso Our data explain how zzso changes in zzso could be directly coupled to the previously proposed opening mechanism of the zzso zzso
