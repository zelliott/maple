zzso zzso zzso of the potato type II family have been identified in a number of zzso zzso Most family members have two zzso zzso which are specific for either zzso or zzso More recently family members have been described with three or six repeated zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso family member produced in the zzso and leaves of the ornamental zzso zzso zzso which has high sequence identity with a zzso member from the same zzso Both proteins are produced as precursors that enter the zzso zzso and are subsequently processed into a series of 6 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso precursor proteins were isolated from immature zzso and zzso by mass zzso which revealed that both proteins had been trimmed at the zzso at a position corresponding to the predicted signal zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, no zzso modifications were zzso
