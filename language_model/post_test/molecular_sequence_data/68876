A restriction zzso zzso an zzso of zzso was zzso to zzso from cell extracts of zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso has a molecular mass of 60,000 zzso and consists of two zzso identical in molecular mass of 30,000 zzso zzso zzso like zzso recognizes the zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso between the T and C to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso is not inhibited by zzso zzso The zzso point of the zzso is zzso zzso activity was maximum at pH zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 55 degrees zzso The zzso was stable up to 60 degrees zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence (30 zzso of zzso did not show any similarity with the sequence of other restriction zzso zzso
