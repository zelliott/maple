The zzso tumor 1 gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor which is expressed in a zzso zzso Our studies indicate that in addition to the promoter, other regulatory elements are required for zzso expression of this zzso A zzso pair zzso specific zzso in zzso 3 of the zzso gene increased the zzso activity of the zzso promoter by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed both a zzso and a zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif decreased the zzso activity by zzso in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that the zzso protein in zzso nuclear extracts binds to this zzso zzso of the zzso containing reporter construct with a zzso expression zzso showed that zzso zzso this zzso increasing the zzso reporter activity zzso Similar analysis of the zzso motif by zzso with the zzso zzso reporter construct and a zzso expression zzso showed that zzso zzso the zzso by zzso A zzso zzso site has also been mapped in the zzso pair zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso are responsible for the activity of this zzso in zzso cells and may bind to the zzso in zzso
