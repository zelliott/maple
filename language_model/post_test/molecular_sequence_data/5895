The opportunistic human pathogen zzso zzso possesses two cell zzso genetic regulatory systems that control expression of a number of zzso zzso zzso These two systems, the zzso and zzso gene pairs, are members of the zzso family of zzso signal generators and signal zzso The zzso gene in zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that zzso the synthesis of an zzso zzso zzso Through a zzso of random and zzso zzso of zzso we have gained a better understanding of how its protein product zzso Eight zzso critical to zzso zzso synthesis by zzso were identified by random zzso and all mapped to a zzso region that spans zzso zzso Seven of the eight zzso were charged zzso acids and the other was a zzso By using zzso zzso we showed that an zzso zzso or zzso was not required for zzso zzso zzso and that two zzso aromatic zzso acids in the zzso active site region could be altered without complete loss of zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso towards the zzso that align with critical zzso in zzso can be altered in zzso without loss of zzso These studies suggest that as opposed to the current models for zzso zzso binding to zzso signal zzso charged zzso acid zzso participate directly in the zzso of zzso zzso synthesis rather than zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
