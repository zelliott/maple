These studies were aimed at an initial characterization of the human zzso precursor and the evaluation of factors leading to zzso by the pathological zzso zzso This zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso segment, which has been considered unnecessary for zzso and the last seven zzso zzso We investigated the role in folding of the last seven zzso zzso by comparing the properties of the zzso precursor and its zzso zzso with those of the corresponding zzso proteins from which zzso had been deleted, leading to the following zzso First, despite modulating effects on several protein properties, the last seven zzso zzso do not make a significant net zzso contribution to precursor zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso precursors to both zzso zzso and zzso buffer unfolding are similar, as are in zzso folding zzso Second, the zzso forms of both precursors are unstable and predicted to fold zzso at zzso pH and temperature, as evidenced by precursor behavior in zzso buffers and by zzso zzso Third, both precursors are significantly less stable than the bovine zzso zzso These results, together with earlier studies elsewhere of zzso precursor behavior within rat zzso are shown to represent a zzso argument for a role for zzso zzso in zzso precursor folding in zzso zzso most probably assisting zzso by zzso interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso This hypothesis provides an explanation for the absence of zzso in the more stable zzso precursor and suggests that the loss of zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso cell culture studies of rat precursor folding are also discussed in this zzso Most generally, the results emphasize the significance of zzso stability in the folding pathways of zzso zzso
