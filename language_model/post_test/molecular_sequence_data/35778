The Human zzso zzso zzso rev protein binds with high affinity to a bubble structure located within the zzso element zzso zzso in zzso zzso After this initial interaction, additional rev molecules bind to the zzso zzso in an ordered assembly process which requires a functional bubble structure, since zzso in the bubble sequence that reduce rev affinity block multiple complex zzso We have used synthetic chemistry to characterize the interaction between rev protein and its high affinity binding zzso A minimal synthetic duplex zzso zzso carrying the bubble and 12 zzso base pairs is able to bind rev with 1 to 1 zzso and with high zzso When the bubble structure is inserted into synthetic zzso molecules carrying longer stretches of zzso zzso zzso rev forms additional complexes resembling the zzso observed with the zzso zzso The ability of rev to bind to zzso zzso containing functional group modifications on base and sugar zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso The results provide strong evidence that the bubble structure contains specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso base pairs and suggest that high affinity recognition of zzso zzso by rev requires hydrogen bonding to functional groups in the major groove of a distorted zzso zzso
