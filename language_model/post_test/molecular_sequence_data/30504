Two structural zzso genes of zzso zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso as detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso were zzso zzso and zzso We designated these genes zzso and zzso A DNA sequence analysis of zzso and zzso showed that each gene possesses a single open reading frame that encodes a zzso these zzso have molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were identified upstream from the initiation zzso of each zzso In addition, a single consensus promoter sequence was identified 121 base pairs upstream from the initiation zzso of zzso suggesting zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso alignment showed that the zzso zzso acid sequence was identical at 206 positions zzso to the zzso zzso Both genes were zzso into zzso zzso and were expressed under the control of the zzso zzso The expression products of zzso and zzso revealed fusion proteins having molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which were identified on zzso by using specific zzso zzso zzso zzso
