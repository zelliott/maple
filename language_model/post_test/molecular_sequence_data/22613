The zzso gene for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso agent zzso zzso is located in a zzso linear zzso In the present study, we identified an zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso fever zzso agent zzso zzso located it in a zzso linear zzso and demonstrated its zzso The functions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene products were evaluated both in zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and in zzso by testing their activities after zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso in zzso coli, and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the conversion of zzso from zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso protein had only zzso zzso activity in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene did not provide zzso in zzso The lack of activity of zzso zzso zzso protein was associated with the substitution of a zzso for a highly zzso zzso at position zzso The zzso zzso zzso locus was further distinguished by the downstream presence in the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and which are not present in the LB agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso cluster of zzso zzso was acquired by horizontal gene zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso causing zzso have a greater capability for de zzso zzso synthesis than those causing zzso thus providing a basis for some of the biological differences between the two groups of zzso
