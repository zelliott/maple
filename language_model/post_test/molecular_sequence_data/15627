In certain zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically interacts with a zzso zzso called zzso zzso factor zzso resulting in high molecular weight zzso Previously, we showed that three regions zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in interaction and zzso with zzso Recently, we found that the zzso span zzso within zzso is essential and sufficient for zzso zzso whereas the zzso and zzso regions are required for formation of large zzso To define the contribution of individual zzso acids in the above three regions to zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso based on sequence differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso which does not bind zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso and affinity by frontal affinity zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to bind zzso and their zzso profiles were essentially similar to that of zzso indicating that these two zzso acids within the zzso region are important for zzso zzso zzso of zzso with E (as in zzso lowered affinity for zzso whereas none of the zzso in the zzso region showed any effect on zzso zzso To further confirm the importance of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso we produced a number of zzso zzso and the results showed that all four zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso that differ between zzso and zzso in the zzso span zzso are required to impart zzso ability to zzso
