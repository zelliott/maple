We have previously identified zzso DNA fragments, referred to as zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we extended our analysis of the zzso zzso that was found to zzso a zzso zzso site, and we demonstrated the specificity of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso (a member of the zzso gene zzso Then, we combined the zzso zzso products of zzso zzso and zzso to develop a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the simultaneous and specific detection of zzso to the three aforementioned major avian mycoplasma zzso For comparative purposes, a novel in-house crude zzso capture zzso zzso was developed in zzso In the latter zzso the zzso zzso were enriched in zzso zzso by capturing zzso crude zzso on coated rabbit zzso zzso that had been extensively zzso with the whole zzso of the zzso zzso With regard to rapid serum zzso both zzso tests were highly specific, and they showed a significant correlation when field zzso from naturally infected birds were zzso zzso proved to be highly specific because zzso values, with the zzso species, were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso than those obtained with zzso Given its zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso seems to represent a valid tool for the specific screening of the three major avian mycoplasma zzso zzso will be particularly useful with regard to trade control because a large number of samples from various fields could be rapidly zzso
