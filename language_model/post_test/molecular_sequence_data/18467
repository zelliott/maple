zzso acid zzso is an important stress zzso that plays an essential role in zzso the signaling networks associated with plant responses to various zzso zzso In the present study, we isolated a gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso varied among different zzso in which higher levels were measured in the leaves than in the zzso The zzso zzso levels of zzso were progressively elevated by zzso and zzso only zzso induced by cold, but not affected by zzso To examine its function in stress zzso transgenic tobacco zzso zzso plants zzso zzso zzso were generated, which contained higher zzso levels than the wild type zzso under both normal growth conditions and drought zzso The transgenic lines displayed enhanced tolerance to dehydration, drought, salt and zzso stresses when compared with the zzso Lower levels of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso were detected in the transgenic plants than in the zzso under zzso and salt zzso On the contrary, transcript levels of several genes associated with zzso zzso zzso adjustment, and water zzso and activities of two zzso zzso were higher in the transgenic plants relative to the zzso under the zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso zzso enhanced tolerance to multiple zzso zzso which may be, at least in part, ascribed to the positive zzso of the zzso zzso
