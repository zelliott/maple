Early zzso move zzso between the cell periphery and the interior through a mechanism regulated by the low molecular weight zzso zzso Here, we identify a novel zzso zzso of human zzso zzso which specifically binds to zzso and is recruited onto early zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso a striking alignment of early zzso along zzso filaments and reduces their zzso This activity depends on the membrane recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso thus uncovering a new role in zzso zzso Our results define a novel signal zzso pathway, in which zzso and zzso are zzso activated by zzso to regulate the zzso of early zzso through interactions with the zzso zzso
