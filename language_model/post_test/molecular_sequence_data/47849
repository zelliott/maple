zzso coli cells expressing fusion proteins consisting of zzso and bacterial zzso protein zzso 60 of zzso coli, zzso zzso or zzso zzso were constructed, and designated as zzso zzso or zzso zzso Fusion proteins prepared from zzso and zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso from human gastric zzso zzso cell zzso On the other hand, the parent strain zzso coli zzso zzso zzso transformed by zzso and fusion protein prepared from zzso did not induce zzso zzso from zzso zzso Other human gastric zzso and zzso cell lines zzso 407 and zzso did not zzso zzso following treatment with these zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from human gastric cells and the levels of zzso differ among the various gastric cell lines, suggesting that zzso might be an important zzso factor associated with chronic gastric inflammation following zzso zzso infection in zzso
