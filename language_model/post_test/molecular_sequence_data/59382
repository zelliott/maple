A zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso and characterized as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We estimated the molecular weight and zzso point of zzso zzso zzso to be 22,000 and zzso zzso This zzso zzso had an unusual pH optimum of zzso and showed zzso of zzso activity even at pH zzso An open reading frame of the zzso specified 209 zzso zzso including a putative signal zzso of 25 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shared significant similarities with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso included two unique zzso zzso in a putative zzso region, raising the possibility that these zzso are at least partially responsible for its zzso zzso
