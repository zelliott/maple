Gene expression of the DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined in the zzso eggs, zzso and zzso stages of the Antarctic sea urchin, zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the gene revealed two highly zzso regions, including a 300 zzso region representing the binding site for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The second 1200 zzso region, likely representing a second zzso zzso binding site, was identified in a second sea zzso species, zzso zzso zzso for zzso were developed from the shorter zzso and expression in sea zzso zzso tissue and zzso and in response to in zzso exposure to ultraviolet radiation was zzso using zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all zzso and zzso stages zzso In controlled zzso experiments in zzso Sound, zzso we found evidence of both zzso expression of zzso and induction in response to in zzso exposure of zzso to zzso zzso of zzso was observed in response to greater ambient zzso (such as zzso water depths or sea ice-free zzso
