Human T cell rearranging gamma genes zzso membrane proteins which are expressed by a minor subset of T zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso gamma gene zzso result from V zzso gamma zzso Here we analyze an unusual zzso involving a zzso sequence flanked by zzso and zzso signals in a zzso zzso T cell clone zzso This zzso designated here as I gamma zzso is distinct from zzso D or J zzso It is located in the first zzso of the first constant region zzso gamma 1) and zzso sequences are zzso in C gamma 2 zzso In zzso cells the I gamma zzso is juxtaposed to the J gamma 2 segment downstream to a V gamma zzso gamma 1 zzso The use of a cryptic zzso site induced zzso cells to produce an zzso zzso transcript containing the I gamma zzso 3' to the first zzso of C gamma zzso Such a zzso occurring downstream to an zzso V zzso gamma junction may induce premature arrest of translation and lack of the zzso part of C gamma involved in zzso zzso
