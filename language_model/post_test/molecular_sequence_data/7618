Human zzso virus type 1 zzso encodes a zzso protein which is important for virus replication and zzso zzso is a zzso protein which exists in both zzso and soluble zzso The zzso form is an zzso membrane protein which is tightly associated with the zzso side of zzso We have analyzed the mechanism of membrane targeting of zzso and its role in zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso basic zzso are required for membrane zzso zzso zzso which disrupt membrane association also inhibit zzso zzso indicating that membrane zzso of zzso is likely to be required for its biological activity in zzso zzso binding of zzso is almost completely abolished by zzso treatment of zzso These results demonstrate that membrane zzso of zzso requires zzso basic zzso and interaction with a zzso zzso This interaction may serve to direct zzso to a specific cellular site, since zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso studies show that zzso is localized predominantly to an internal zzso compartment rather than to the plasma zzso The mechanism of membrane targeting of zzso is different in some respects from that of other zzso membrane zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso which zzso a basic domain together with a zzso modification for membrane zzso zzso targeting of zzso is likely to play an important role in zzso replication and thus may be a therapeutic zzso
