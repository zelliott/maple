The zzso zzso zzso was constructed from the cellular zzso isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso into the expression zzso zzso and transformed into zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso was isolated from inclusion bodies of zzso coli and subjected to zzso into its folded zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso liquid zzso and exhibited a zzso in zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso showed a tendency to zzso its zzso bonds as that observed with native zzso An appreciable decrease in the rate of zzso reaction was observed when zzso was replaced with zzso or zzso was replaced with zzso or zzso These results reflect that the element in controlling the zzso zzso of zzso is closely associated with the charged side chains in the zzso zzso
