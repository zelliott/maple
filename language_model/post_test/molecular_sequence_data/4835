To understand the dominant association of zzso disease zzso with the presence of zzso zzso beta zzso the zzso binding characteristics of this zzso were compared with that of the structurally similar, but zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso First, naturally processed peptides were zzso from zzso zzso molecules of both zzso Both molecules contained the zzso zzso sequence and a particular zzso of the major zzso complex zzso class I alpha zzso Use of truncated zzso of these two peptides in zzso zzso binding zzso indicated that identical zzso frames are used for binding to the two zzso zzso zzso substitution analysis of the zzso class I zzso revealed identical side chain requirements for the anchor zzso at zzso and zzso AT zzso zzso and zzso however, polar zzso (such as zzso zzso G, zzso and zzso were less well tolerated in the case of the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso This most striking difference between the two zzso molecules is the presence of and additional anchor zzso at zzso for the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso whereas this zzso was found not to be specifically involved in binding of peptides to zzso zzso beta zzso Similar results were obtained applying substitution analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins zzso with the zzso class I and zzso zzso zzso well with the binding zzso The results suggest that both zzso and the zzso class I zzso bind zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso in a zzso fashion, following highly similar binding zzso This detailed characterization of unique zzso binding properties of the zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso should be helpful in the identification of zzso zzso
