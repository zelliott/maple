Plasma pools and blood products were zzso for zzso C virus zzso zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso Initially, samples were amplified by zzso zzso using two pairs of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso The method was later modified to amplification with only the outer pair of zzso and a zzso to eliminate amplification of zzso zzso The modified method was as sensitive as zzso zzso However, with samples containing low levels of zzso it is necessary to perform repeat zzso to avoid zzso zzso Ten out of 17 zzso positive pools from paid donors were positive, while none of the zzso pools from unpaid donors was positive for zzso or zzso zzso Four zzso zzso made from contaminated pools were zzso indicating removal of virus during current manufacturing zzso A quantitative zzso method was established using a positive zzso zzso analysis gave an estimated viral zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
