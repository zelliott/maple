Previous attempts to prepare zzso zzso zzso against zzso a zzso cell protein involved in the visual process and a potent zzso for the induction of experimental zzso zzso zzso have yielded zzso which define only zzso terminal zzso In this study we devised alternate strategies to prepare five zzso directed to other regions of the zzso zzso and zzso were prepared against synthetic peptides known to be zzso and they were selected for more detailed zzso zzso was generated against synthetic zzso zzso which contains a zzso consensus sequence for defined T cell zzso zzso as well as a consensus sequence for zzso zzso One human zzso zzso synthetic zzso containing an extensive zzso acid sequence zzso to zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso binding in a competitive zzso zzso zzso was generated against zzso zzso which also contains a zzso zzso The binding site of zzso was determined to be within zzso acid positions zzso to 314 zzso in zzso This binding site corresponded closely to the binding site of an zzso rat zzso zzso raised to human zzso zzso was isolated from a mouse zzso with bovine zzso and was specific for a highly zzso sequence near the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 42 to 48 zzso Both zzso and zzso were useful in screening zzso zzso libraries expressing zzso zzso as fusion zzso Our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing zzso zzso potentially useful in the study of T zzso immune mechanisms in zzso as well as in the zzso of zzso
