On the basis of zzso differences, three subspecies of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In previous studies zzso DNA zzso sequence data showed minimal genetic divergence between the three subspecies and an absence of zzso within zzso zzso zzso Here, population genetic structure and zzso patterns have been analyzed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence data as well as 12 zzso zzso zzso The zzso data suggest genetic differentiation between zzso zzso zzso from Sweden and The Netherlands, between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso data were not consistent with the zzso zzso zzso did support a split between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also demonstrated two zzso zzso zzso zzso clusters that were not geographically zzso This genetic structure can be explained by a scenario of isolation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in zzso during the Last zzso zzso During the zzso separation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso occurred, followed by colonization of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso during the zzso Within zzso zzso zzso founder events, followed by population expansion, took place during the zzso zzso According to the patterns observed in both markers together and their geographic zzso we propose that the three traditional subspecies indeed represent three separate genetic zzso
