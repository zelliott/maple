Despite the zzso protection associated with routine vaccination zzso zzso distemper virus zzso remains an important pathogen of zzso zzso diagnosis of systemic zzso infection may be made by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and/or zzso testing for zzso zzso central nervous system infection often requires zzso confirmation via zzso and zzso An zzso intact male French zzso previously vaccinated for zzso presented with zzso zzso zzso Based on clinical and zzso findings, the dog's disease was zzso as a zzso of unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso hybrid zzso zzso combined with sequence analysis, identified zzso zzso in the dog's zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso and a specific zzso zzso based on the zzso gene identified a zzso versus zzso virus zzso This case illustrates the utility of broadly zzso zzso and sequence analysis for the identification of pathogens in diseases with unknown zzso
