zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which generate fusion zzso are frequent in zzso zzso zzso in Caucasian zzso To determine the spectrum of gene zzso in Japanese patients, we systematically examined 40 zzso zzso zzso for all possible types of gene fusion events involving zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in ten tumors zzso zzso had occurred in two tumors, zzso in one, zzso in six, and a novel zzso zzso in the remaining zzso In this last patient, the zzso novel sequence was fused zzso to the zzso zzso acid zzso thus, the fusion gene may zzso a protein with a zzso zzso domain at the zzso zzso The zzso gene was fused to zzso donor sequences at the beginning of zzso 12 in all ten zzso No zzso involving the zzso gene were found in this panel of zzso Our results indicated that zzso zzso of the zzso by gene zzso is a frequent mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in Japanese zzso
