The zzso related protein Bad is a promoter of zzso and has been shown to zzso with the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso of Bad in zzso zzso cells demonstrated that the protein not only could abrogate the protective capacity of zzso zzso but could accelerate the zzso response to a death signal when it was expressed in the absence of zzso zzso Using deletion analysis, we have identified the minimal domain in the zzso Bad protein that can zzso with zzso A zzso zzso within this domain, which showed significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of related zzso proteins like zzso and zzso was found to be necessary and sufficient to bind zzso To determine the role of zzso in regulating the zzso activity of Bad and the zzso activity of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso pocket in zzso that eliminated the ability of zzso to form a zzso with Bad were tested for the ability to promote cell survival in the presence of zzso Several of these zzso retained the ability to impart protection against cell death regardless of the level of zzso Bad zzso These results suggest that zzso proteins like Bad promote cell death by binding to zzso members of the zzso family and thus zzso their survival promoting zzso
