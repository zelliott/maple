zzso zzso a mechanism that prevents zzso in some families of flowering plants, is zzso by the products of a single genetic zzso the zzso The products of the zzso in the female sexual zzso of zzso zzso are an zzso series of zzso with zzso zzso In this study, we report on the zzso of zzso zzso at the four potential zzso sites of the zzso The zzso from zzso contain from one to five potential zzso sites based on the consensus sequence zzso The zzso contains four potential zzso sites at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated sites I, II, IV and zzso zzso Site III is absent from the zzso Analysis of zzso generated from the zzso by zzso and zzso zzso revealed the types of zzso and the degree of zzso present at each zzso Sites I zzso and IV zzso display zzso site II zzso contains only a single type of zzso and site V zzso is not zzso The zzso observed at site I on the zzso is the same as that observed at the only site, site I, on the zzso zzso et zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso Since the zzso consensus sequence at site I is zzso in all zzso from other species of zzso zzso plants, zzso at this site may be important to their zzso No other zzso modifications zzso zzso zzso were detected on the zzso
