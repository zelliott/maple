Among zzso animals, only zzso and zzso possess zzso ability, so-called zzso zzso For color vision to exist, multiple zzso which zzso visual zzso sensitive to different zzso of light are zzso While the molecular evolution of zzso in zzso has been well investigated, that in zzso remains to be zzso This is mainly due to poor information about the zzso genes of zzso zzso To obtain an overview of the evolution of color vision in zzso we isolated three kinds of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from two jumping zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso belong to zzso one of the most distant groups from zzso zzso and have color vision as do zzso zzso analyses of jumping zzso zzso revealed a birth and death process of color vision evolution in the zzso zzso zzso positions of jumping zzso zzso revealed that at least three zzso had already existed before the zzso zzso In addition, sequence comparison between jumping zzso zzso and the shorter zzso zzso of insects predicted that an zzso of the ancestral zzso had the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the ancestral zzso had at least zzso vision with a zzso zzso and two visible zzso zzso in each zzso and zzso zzso the zzso repertoire was reconstructed by gene losses, gene zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso leading to evolution of color zzso
