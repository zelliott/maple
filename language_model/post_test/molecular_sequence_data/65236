zzso zzso zzso in one of the mismatch repair zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso cause zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso or Lynch syndrome, a zzso inherited cancer zzso zzso Recent reports provide evidence for a novel zzso inherited cancer syndrome with zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso in one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome is characterized by childhood brain tumors, zzso and/or gastrointestinal zzso and signs of zzso type 1 zzso We established an zzso zzso detection zzso for the four zzso zzso since 1) a number of zzso defects may escape detection by the analysis of zzso DNA, and 2) zzso zzso detection in the zzso gene is severely hampered by the presence of multiple highly similar zzso including zzso Using this zzso which is based on direct zzso sequencing of zzso products, we investigated two families with children suspected to suffer from zzso zzso We identified a zzso complex zzso zzso zzso in the index patients of the first family and a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in the index patient of the second zzso Furthermore, we zzso by the analysis of a zzso zzso zzso carrier, that zzso zzso testing effectively avoids the zzso of zzso DNA amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and will, thus, allow more sensitive zzso analysis in zzso zzso and in zzso patients with zzso zzso
