zzso zzso is a soil zzso which can use a variety of steroids as carbon and energy zzso Even if it can be estimated that the complete degradation of the steroid nucleus requires more than 20 zzso zzso the complete molecular characterization of the genes zzso these steroid zzso zzso as well as the genetic organization of them remain to be zzso We have previously reported the cloning and zzso sequence of two zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and a hypothetical protein respectively, located in both ends of a zzso zzso zzso zzso we report the cloning and characterization of another zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso located between these two zzso The analysis of zzso zzso acid sequence predicts a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso This protein bears high zzso with zzso hypothetical proteins of unknown function described in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The predicted protein shows a typical structure of a leader zzso at its zzso A zzso zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso was detected by zzso analysis of in zzso zzso labeled zzso Analysis of gene expression indicates that zzso is tightly controlled at the zzso level by several steroid zzso In addition, zzso analysis of zzso and beta zzso in a zzso zzso strain, indicates that both genes are transcribed as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso integrated into the zzso of zzso zzso demonstrate that a zzso promoter located upstream of zzso regulates the expression of both zzso
