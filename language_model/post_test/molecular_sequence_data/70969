Although the production of zzso zzso from activated zzso zzso has been reported zzso the zzso signaling mechanisms that regulate this T cell function remain totally zzso We have examined whether the zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade plays a role in regulating the production of zzso because the activity of these signaling molecules is zzso in activated T zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells with a dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso resulted in the suppression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso This suppression was accompanied by a parallel zzso of zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso also attenuated the zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso production of zzso from zzso cells or peripheral blood T zzso This study provides, for the first time, direct evidence that the zzso cascade plays a vital role in regulating the production of zzso
