zzso is a software tool able to find directly in zzso databases very distant zzso to an zzso acid query zzso It focuses searches on a specific zzso acid pattern, scoring the matching and intervening zzso as specified by the zzso The program has been developed for searching databases of expressed sequence tags zzso but it is also well suited to search zzso zzso The query sequence can be a variable pattern with alternative zzso acids or gaps and the sequences searched can contain zzso or sequencing errors with accompanying frame zzso Other features include options to generate a zzso zzso set the zzso sequencing error frequency, limit searches to given species, or exclude already known zzso zzso can find sequence zzso that other search zzso would deem unrelated or would not find because of sequencing errors or a too large number of other zzso The ability of zzso to find relatives to a given sequence is exemplified by searches for members of the transforming growth zzso family and for proteins containing a zzso The functions aimed at enhancing zzso searches are illustrated by the zzso zzso cloning of a novel zzso zzso zzso
