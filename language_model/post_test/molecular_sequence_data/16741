The zzso zzso protein zzso originates by zzso of the zzso zzso It is highly basic and contains one or two zinc zzso zzso in either the basic zzso or the zinc fingers can affect several events of the virus life zzso They frequently prevent the specific packaging of the viral zzso affect reverse transcription, and impair zzso zzso In this work, we explore the role of NC in zzso leukemia virus zzso particle assembly and zzso A panel of NC zzso including zzso of the zinc finger and of a basic region, as well as zzso of the NC domain of zzso were zzso Several of these zzso dramatically reduce the release of virus zzso A zzso completely lacking the NC domain is apparently incapable of assembling into zzso although its zzso protein is still targeted to the plasma zzso By electron zzso on thin sections of zzso cells, we observed that some NC zzso exhibit various stages of budding defects at the plasma membrane and have zzso particle zzso electron zzso of cells expressing some of these zzso are zzso similar to those of cells expressing zzso zzso However, the defects of NC zzso with respect to virus release and zzso could be zzso by an zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso the functions of NC in virus budding and zzso are completely distinct from viral zzso zzso
