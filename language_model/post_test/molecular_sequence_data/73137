The three zzso zzso sequences identified to date differ from each other in just two zzso positions, both of which result in changes in zzso zzso Thus, the mature zzso protein product is characterized by a zzso zzso at position 23 zzso and a zzso at position 34 zzso zzso has an zzso at position 23 zzso and zzso at position 34 zzso and zzso has zzso zzso at both positions 23 zzso and 34 zzso These zzso variations in the DNA sequence can be distinguished by selective restriction zzso zzso We studied the zzso of the three zzso zzso by analyzing zzso DNA from 103 Japanese volunteers and 33 patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene containing zzso 23 and 34 were amplified by zzso using specific zzso and the zzso products were analyzed with specific restriction zzso to identify the zzso zzso zzso Only zzso gene was detected in normal volunteers, and no zzso gene was detected in Japanese zzso However, zzso was detected in 4 of 33 zzso patients with zzso
