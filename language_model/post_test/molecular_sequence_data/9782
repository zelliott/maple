Two new zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained from patients with fatal zzso zzso Patients developed characteristic manifestations of severe disease due to zzso zzso including marked zzso pulmonary zzso and zzso zzso isolation was achieved in zzso zzso the zzso and zzso Vincent zzso were detected within 19 and 8 days zzso zzso The zzso were characterized by molecular evaluation of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso heat shock zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso and an incompletely characterized zzso sequence zzso zzso target zzso The sequences were compared with those of the corresponding molecular regions in the type isolate zzso zzso Vincent contained one fewer repeat unit in both the zzso protein gene and the zzso compared with corresponding sequences of the zzso and Arkansas zzso zzso zzso gene sequences from the two new zzso had zzso identity to the corresponding sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and to the corrected zzso zzso gene sequence of the Arkansas zzso The zzso isolate grew more slowly than the zzso Vincent isolate in zzso cells, and both of the new zzso grew more slowly than the extensively zzso Arkansas zzso Although specific associations between zzso zzso and zzso were not identified from these zzso recovery of this zzso from a spectrum of clinical presentations remains an integral step in understanding mechanisms of disease caused by zzso zzso
