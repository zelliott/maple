We have investigated the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and DNA of a zzso with type IV zzso The zzso zzso two alpha zzso zzso one with normal zzso migration and one more rapidly zzso The fast alpha zzso chain was relatively retained within the cell and was present in zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso CB 4-2 contained both normal and rapidly zzso zzso zzso stability of zzso containing the rapidly zzso alpha zzso chain was reduced 6 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso hybrids between zzso total zzso and zzso zzso complementary to alpha zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso A and zzso zzso products seen exclusively in the zzso suggested a structural change in the region coding for zzso zzso The region which zzso to the zzso was amplified using zzso and zzso Multiple restriction zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso suggested a structural change localized to the region coding for zzso zzso zzso revealed a deletion of the 54 zzso zzso zzso 16 in the zzso of one zzso The region of the zzso zzso DNA spanning zzso 15-17 was amplified by zzso The zzso zzso fragments of each zzso were distinguished by zzso hybrid analysis using a zzso complementary to normal zzso DNA from this zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso at the zzso 16 donor site in one zzso The zzso eliminates a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
