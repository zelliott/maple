By analyses of short DNA zzso we have deduced the overall arrangement of genes in the (A + zzso coding sequences of zzso zzso zzso relative to the arrangements of zzso genes in the zzso + zzso coding sequences of the zzso virus zzso zzso and the (A + zzso sequences of the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA from 13 separate sites within the 111 zzso pairs of the light DNA coding sequences of the zzso were zzso into zzso zzso and sequences of up to 350 bases were determined from each of these zzso zzso acid sequences predicted for fragments of open reading frames defined by these sequences were compared with a library of the protein sequences of major open reading frames predicted from the complete DNA sequences of zzso and zzso Of the 13 short zzso acid sequences obtained from zzso only 3 were recognizably zzso to proteins zzso by zzso but all 13 zzso sequences were zzso zzso to gene products zzso by zzso The zzso reading frames identified by this method included zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the regulatory gene product of the zzso reading frame of zzso zzso as well as globally, the order and relative orientation of these genes resembled that of their zzso on the zzso zzso Despite the major differences in their zzso compositions and in the nature and arrangements of reiterated DNA zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso closely related zzso and they share a common organization of these coding sequences which differs from that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
