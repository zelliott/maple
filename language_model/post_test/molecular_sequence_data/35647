The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso species, and is composed of multiple repeats of a consensus zzso A series of zzso zzso reacting with zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso using zzso synthetic peptides based on the consensus repeat zzso The zzso were found to recognize different continuous zzso based on the consensus zzso One zzso zzso was zzso in affinity zzso to obtain zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was used for zzso of zzso The resulting zzso did not recognize zzso zzso on Western blots but reacted specifically with zzso zzso in immune zzso experiments, indicating that the zzso zzso immune response was directed against zzso zzso Despite the diversity of both continuous and zzso zzso recognized by the zzso produced, none of the zzso demonstrated the ability to promote zzso zzso zzso Thus despite its initial apparent promise as a potential vaccine candidate the case for the inclusion of zzso zzso in vaccine zzso cannot be supported at zzso
