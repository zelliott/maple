zzso fatty acids zzso are desirable as renewable chemical zzso for the production of paints, zzso and zzso Toward our goal of creating a zzso crop, we expressed nine higher plant zzso zzso zzso zzso in the seeds of zzso zzso zzso zzso and observed zzso of less than zzso zzso Surprisingly, expression of the zzso coli zzso gene resulted in the zzso of up to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso increases zzso zzso up to zzso in individual zzso zzso However, seeds with more than zzso zzso exhibit zzso seed zzso and reduced size and oil zzso zzso with more than zzso zzso exhibit strongly decreased seed zzso and establishment, and no seeds with zzso more than zzso zzso That previous reports suggest that plant zzso prefers the zzso zzso zzso position whereas zzso coli zzso acts on zzso of zzso prompted us to investigate the preferred positions of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso acts primarily on the zzso position of zzso zzso of zzso results in the incorporation of zzso at the zzso position of zzso zzso This enables a cycle that zzso zzso at both zzso and zzso positions of PC and results in increased zzso of zzso These data provide proof of principle that zzso can accumulate to high levels in transgenic seeds and sets the stage for the identification of factors that will facilitate the movement of zzso from PC into zzso to produce viable seeds with additional zzso zzso
