zzso tube defects zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso are severe zzso zzso that affect zzso in 1,000 live zzso in the United States, with varying prevalence around the zzso zzso in zzso cell polarity zzso genes are believed to cause a variety of zzso in both mice and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Mice that are zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso present with the most severe form of zzso namely zzso A recent study reported that zzso in zzso were associated with zzso in humans, but whether zzso zzso contribute to increased zzso zzso risk is still zzso We zzso the zzso gene in 192 infants with zzso zzso and 190 healthy zzso Among the zzso zzso patients, we identified five novel zzso zzso that were zzso by the zzso zzso Of these five zzso three of them zzso zzso zzso significantly affected the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, we demonstrated that the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso also affected zzso zzso zzso In contrast, only one novel zzso zzso zzso was detected in control samples, and it was predicted to be zzso This study demonstrated that rare deleterious zzso of zzso may contribute to the zzso risk for human zzso zzso
