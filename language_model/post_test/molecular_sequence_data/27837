We studied the zzso backbone modifications that improve the zzso stability of the resulting peptides and yet retain high zzso activity against human plasma zzso A systematic investigation of zzso and zzso modifications at the zzso and zzso sites of zzso peptides that contain part of the human zzso sequence led to the discovery of zzso zzso acids at the zzso site as a useful structural zzso zzso (11) inhibited human plasma zzso with an in zzso potency zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso It is highly selective for zzso and, as anticipated, resistant to zzso zzso Additional study based on molecular graphic zzso has led us to propose a zzso zzso constraint at the zzso zzso This zzso has proved useful in the preparation of active zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited human plasma zzso with an in zzso potency zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This class of compounds also offers structural features for the study of zzso zzso
