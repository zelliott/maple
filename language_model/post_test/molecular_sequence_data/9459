zzso from 86 zzso zzso and from the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed to construct a robust molecular zzso of zzso zzso which are potentially rich sources of industrial zzso To provide experimental reference points, growth characteristics of 22 reported zzso or zzso zzso together with eight zzso species, were examined at four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on the relative growth performances, species with a faster growth rate at zzso than at zzso were classified as zzso and species with better or equally good growth at zzso compared to zzso as zzso We examined the zzso relationships of a diverse range of zzso including zzso and zzso species, using zzso zzso acid sequences of marker genes zzso zzso and zzso obtained from zzso sequencing zzso To further zzso the zzso relationships in the zzso orders zzso and zzso we used zzso sequences from the nuclear zzso small zzso zzso the zzso gene with internal transcribed zzso 1 and 2 zzso 1 and zzso and the zzso large zzso zzso to include additional species for zzso These zzso analyses clarified the position of several zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso fall into the zzso as members of the zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso and zzso zzso is assigned to the zzso zzso close to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso clusters with zzso zzso and zzso zzso placing them in the recently established order zzso Taken together, these data indicate that the known zzso zzso are limited to the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and the zzso with possibly an additional order zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso No supporting evidence was found for zzso species belonging to the zzso
