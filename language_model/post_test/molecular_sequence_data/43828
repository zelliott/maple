A multiplex zzso test based on the simultaneous amplification of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso was designed and evaluated for its ability to directly detect fluorescent zzso zzso of zzso open reading frame, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso open reading frame, 504 zzso in clinical zzso A collection of reference strains including 20 different species of fluorescent zzso was zzso Positive zzso results for both genes were observed only for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including strains of clinical and environmental origin, while only one zzso zzso was amplified from the other fluorescent zzso All other bacteria tested zzso zzso zzso were negative by the amplification zzso The lower detection level for zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso evaluation on testing skin biopsy specimens from patients with burns zzso zzso zzso and zzso samples from zzso zzso patients zzso zzso 49) and other patients zzso zzso zzso showed zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in comparison with zzso This multiplex zzso zzso appears promising for the rapid and sensitive detection of zzso zzso in clinical zzso Further evaluation of its specificity in zzso clinical studies is zzso
