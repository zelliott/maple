Recently, two zzso chain reaction zzso typing zzso methods were reported for the zzso of the bovine zzso zzso zzso One technique is a single zzso zzso method that generates zzso sequences that are subsequently analyzed by the zzso program, while the other technique is a zzso zzso zzso method that allows the analysis of zzso sequences using the assign zzso zzso In this study, these techniques were compared and then integrated to produce an improved zzso zzso The primer set used for zzso was more accurate than those used for zzso Combining zzso with the assign zzso software previously reported for zzso enables rapid and accurate zzso of a large number of DNA zzso
