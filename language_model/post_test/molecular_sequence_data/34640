Recent evidence from our laboratory demonstrated that the zzso protein was necessary for zzso gene promoter pulse activity through its interaction with a specific zzso binding site zzso zzso In light of the importance of this zzso zzso in zzso function, we focused on two other highly zzso zzso sites within this region, zzso zzso previously zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these sites revealed that zzso of zzso but not zzso virtually abolished gene expression zzso in zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso can bind to both zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate clearly that more than one zzso binding site is necessary for zzso promoter zzso Moreover, the lack of an influence observed with zzso on pulse activity indicates that zzso action is not general to all zzso sites, but specific to certain zzso sequences in the zzso region of the zzso zzso
