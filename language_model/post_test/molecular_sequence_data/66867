zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, encodes a number of different zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of zzso and its comparison with the previously identified zzso (formerly known as zzso These are two different zzso zzso of the zzso family, named in accordance with the recent recommendations of the zzso Committee for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Francis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso show resistance to zzso by many zzso zzso zzso and those that do inhibit do so with appreciable differences in their inhibitor profiles for the two zzso Both zzso contain two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso and a zzso domain highly zzso with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of both zzso showed significant differences in their affinities for zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso technique that allows accurate zzso of zzso binding sites, the zzso zzso domain was found to bind zzso with an affinity of approximately 500 zzso The zzso zzso domain bound zzso with a slightly lower affinity of approximately 1 zzso The zzso domain of zzso did not bind zzso whereas the zzso domain of zzso bound zzso with a low affinity of approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso with those found in these proteins were also identified in related zzso zzso Finally, a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be a zzso for the zzso zzso domain, opening the possibility of using this zzso as a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso including screening for zzso zzso zzso
