zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that converts zzso zzso into hydrogen zzso and molecular oxygen and has been shown to contribute to the zzso of many zzso bacteria through its ability to neutralize toxic levels of zzso oxygen species generated by the zzso zzso has also been speculated to be important in the zzso of zzso infections, but the role of this zzso has not been rigorously zzso To examine the contribution of zzso to the zzso of zzso infections, we cloned the zzso zzso gene zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and made zzso via targeted zzso The zzso zzso strains had marked decreases in zzso activity and were zzso more susceptible to zzso oxygen species in zzso A zzso zzso was significantly less virulent than the zzso strain and two independent zzso zzso as measured by cumulative survival in the mouse zzso zzso In zzso studies established that the zzso strain had attenuated growth compared to the growth of the wild type and a zzso strain inside zzso producing reduced amounts of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso the zzso zzso contributes to zzso but is not required for zzso in zzso zzso zzso the decreased zzso of the zzso strain may be due to increased zzso to oxygen zzso within zzso and zzso other zzso defense systems in zzso zzso can compensate for the loss of the zzso zzso in zzso
