Control of gene expression requires zzso regulatory DNA zzso Historically these sequences have been difficult to zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso have recently been identified in zzso genes through zzso zzso DNA zzso and some have been shown to be regulatory zzso Using sequence alignment zzso we compared zzso zzso DNA sequences of the zzso zzso genes in two zzso zzso and rice, and found several zzso in zzso These zzso are present in multiple grass species that represent zzso disparate zzso Six other zzso genes were compared and five contained zzso Based on zzso substitution rates, these zzso exist because they have biological zzso Our analysis suggests that grass zzso are smaller and far less frequent than those identified in zzso genes and that zzso gene regulation may be more complex than that of zzso zzso make excellent zzso zzso genetic mapping zzso They should be useful as characters in zzso studies and as monitors of gene regulatory zzso
