Cellular zzso zzso are crucial for the genesis of correctly folded functional zzso Using several complementary in zzso zzso we find that the zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso is in stable zzso formation that arises through the hydrogen bonding of the terminal zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso function of N zzso zzso formation even though the zzso are separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso formation is likely driven by the exceptionally high zzso specificity of the terminal zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso N protein can zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, following zzso formation, the zzso zzso activity of N also appears to be involved in zzso of the zzso zzso and remains in association with the zzso zzso of the viral zzso following zzso Thus, N likely functions in the initiation of zzso replication to allow efficient initiation of zzso synthesis by the viral zzso The zzso zzso activity of N may be facilitated by an zzso zzso domain that zzso zzso unfolding driven by zzso zzso zzso These observations highlight the essential features that are probably common to all zzso zzso in which the role of the zzso is to zzso zzso higher order structure and formation of functional higher order structure may often be predicted by zzso zzso zzso The data also highlight features of N that are probably specifically important during replication of zzso zzso
