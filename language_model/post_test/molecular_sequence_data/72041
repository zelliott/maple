The zzso zzso receptors zzso are a zzso of nuclear receptors activated by fatty acids and zzso In addition, they are subject to zzso by insulin, resulting in the zzso of zzso while zzso zzso under certain zzso However, it was zzso unclear whether the zzso effect of insulin on zzso was direct and by which mechanism it zzso We now demonstrate that zzso acids zzso of zzso contain an zzso function zzso domain, which is further activated by insulin through a zzso involving the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso Further analysis of the zzso region of zzso revealed that the zzso zzso occurs through the zzso of two zzso protein zzso sites at positions 12 and 21, both of which are zzso across zzso The characterization of a strong zzso region in zzso stimulating zzso zzso as strongly as the viral protein zzso is compatible with the marked zzso zzso activity of this zzso in zzso zzso However, it is intriguing that the activity of this zzso region is modulated by the zzso of two zzso zzso both of which must be zzso in order to activate zzso This is in contrast to zzso which was previously shown to be zzso at a single site in a motif that is not zzso to the sites now described in zzso Although the molecular details involved in the zzso enhancement of the zzso activity of zzso remain to be zzso we demonstrate that the effect of insulin on the zzso region of zzso can be zzso by the addition of zzso zzso zzso a strong zzso of zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient in interacting with zzso is unable to activate zzso These observations suggest that the zzso region of zzso is partially silenced by zzso zzso which might interact in a zzso zzso
