Despite accumulating evidence for selection within natural systems, the importance of random genetic drift opposing Wright's and zzso views of evolution continue to be a subject of zzso The geographical diversification of zzso signals appears to be a suitable system to assess the factors involved in the process of adaptation since both theories were independently proposed to explain this zzso In the present study, the effects of drift and selection were assessed from population zzso and zzso experiments on zzso zzso zzso zzso of Northern zzso We specifically focus on the transient zone between two distinct zzso zzso In contrast to regions where high zzso maintains a zzso zzso zzso the transient zones are characterized by lowered selection and a high zzso zzso As a result, the diversification of zzso may occur via genetic drift without a significant loss of zzso These new zzso may then colonize alternative zzso if successfully recognized and avoided by zzso This study highlights the interplay between drift and selection as zzso processes in the zzso diversification of zzso zzso zzso are consistent with the expectations of the Wright's shifting balance theory and zzso to our knowledge, the first empirical demonstration of this highly contested theory in a natural zzso
