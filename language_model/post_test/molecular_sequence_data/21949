The H5N1 avian influenza virus outbreak among zoo zzso in zzso 2004, with 45 animals dead, indicated that the avian influenza virus could cause lethal infection in a large zzso species apart from zzso In this outbreak investigation, six H5N1 zzso were identified and two zzso zzso and zzso were selected for whole zzso zzso zzso analysis of the 8 gene segments showed that the viruses clustered within the lineage of H5N1 avian zzso from Thailand and zzso The zzso zzso gene of the viruses displayed zzso zzso acids at the zzso site, identical to those of the 2004 H5N1 zzso which by definition are highly zzso avian influenza zzso In addition, sequence analyses revealed that the viruses isolated from zzso zzso few genetic changes compared with the viruses having infected chicken, humans, zzso and a zzso isolated from the early 2004 H5N1 zzso zzso analyses also showed that the tiger H5N1 isolated in October 2004 was more closely related to the chicken H5N1 isolated in July than that from zzso Interestingly, all the 6 tiger H5N1 zzso contained a zzso substitution at position zzso of the zzso protein similar to the human, but distinct from the original avian zzso
