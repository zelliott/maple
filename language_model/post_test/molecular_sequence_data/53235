zzso DNA zzso and deletions are a prevailing feature of zzso zzso cultures that undergo zzso In zzso zzso strains containing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso routinely zzso at elevated temperatures, a process that is initiated by the integration of zzso forms of the plasmids into the zzso zzso Here, we describe a strain that is zzso distinguishable from previously characterized zzso strains and show that zzso can occur in the absence of zzso integration and associated zzso in zzso zzso The zzso strain contains a unique zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso at highly predictable zzso at 37 degrees, 25 degrees and 18 degrees zzso zzso in zzso growth rate zzso with increased levels of the zzso zzso and zzso in the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso interferes with zzso zzso We also report the isolation of a zzso strain that escapes zzso yet still maintains high levels of the zzso zzso Its ability to tolerate a zzso zzso suggests that there are mechanisms in zzso which compensate for the deleterious effects that zzso zzso has on zzso zzso
