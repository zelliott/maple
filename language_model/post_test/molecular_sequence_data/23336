A new real-time zzso method is presented that detects and zzso three zzso resistance zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso in mixed microbial communities resident in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene real-time zzso zzso sets were developed and zzso to zzso the zzso genes present in seven different cattle zzso lagoons, to validate the method, and to assess whether resistance gene zzso correlate with zzso levels in zzso zzso The method proved to be sensitive across a wide range of gene zzso and provided consistent and zzso results from complex zzso water zzso The zzso of the sum of the three resistance gene zzso was correlated with zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the geometric means of individual resistance zzso ranging from zzso to zzso greater in zzso samples with zzso zzso levels zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso Of the three zzso genes tested, zzso and zzso were more commonly found in zzso water zzso zzso development of this real-time zzso zzso will permit other studies zzso zzso gene numbers in environmental and other zzso
