The zzso sequences of the terminal repeat long zzso and internal repeat long regions zzso in the zzso of 13 strains of zzso disease virus type 1 zzso were determined and represent the largest collection of sequencing data from a zzso region zzso zzso in the zzso 1 zzso The collection of strains used in this study has been well characterized with respect to their zzso and contains members of each zzso (4 zzso 1 mildly zzso 3 zzso 2 very virulent and 3 very virulent zzso It has previously been reported that two zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso regions are likely to zzso zzso factors based on comparative zzso studies involving vaccine and virulent zzso Additional studies using knockout zzso have provided stronger evidence that indeed zzso and zzso or the overlapping genes 23 zzso and zzso are involved in zzso In this report, we provide evidence that additional open reading frames zzso in the zzso regions differ significantly between the extremes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A deletion of 10 base pairs has been identified in zzso from two attenuated strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the lower zzso strain zzso A deletion of 40 zzso was also identified in zzso of the attenuated strain zzso passage zzso A 177 zzso zzso within the zzso zzso has been identified in most of the attenuated strains zzso Interestingly, zzso did not contain this zzso but instead truncated proteins are predicted for the three overlapping zzso zzso 23 zzso and zzso due to a zzso zzso Single zzso zzso zzso which loosely partition between attenuated and zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three previously unidentified short zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although no single zzso zzso in the zzso regions could predict zzso their overall contribution to zzso can now be examined in defined zzso containing additional insertions or deletions in zzso suspected of zzso zzso factors, identified by this zzso
