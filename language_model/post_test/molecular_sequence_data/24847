zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso family of zzso proteins and serves dual functions in regulating gene expression in early zzso In the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whereas in the activated egg, it acts as a zzso zzso zzso were performed with zzso zzso in clam zzso and egg zzso to identify zzso accessory zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso in an zzso manner and is absent from egg zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of DEAD box zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso with bona fide zzso activity, is an abundant and integral component of stored zzso in zzso zzso et zzso zzso In zzso clam zzso and zzso are found in large zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso level is constant during zzso in contrast to zzso clam zzso zzso to zzso at the zzso zzso To address the role of this class of zzso in zzso zzso was zzso via 3' zzso zzso sites to zzso zzso following zzso of fusion protein and zzso reporter zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translation three- to fivefold and, zzso zzso in two zzso motifs zzso zzso and zzso activated translation three- to zzso relative to zzso These data suggest that this zzso family zzso translation of maternal zzso in early development, and that its activity may be attenuated during zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso
