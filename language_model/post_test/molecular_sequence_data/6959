The collagen zzso of zzso cartilage vary in diameter depending on zzso stage and location within the zzso In general, growth plates and fetal zzso zzso contain zzso with diameters of less than approximately 25 zzso whereas the permanent cartilage of adult zzso contains zzso of approximately zzso zzso The zzso collagen zzso of fetal cartilage are complex, having at least three collagen types as integral zzso Type zzso a member of the zzso collagen class, has been proposed to limit zzso zzso To test this proposition we sought to determine if Type zzso collagen was zzso associated with zzso of smaller zzso We focused our study on human juvenile rib growth plate, which has thin zzso in the zzso zone, thick zzso in the resting zone or permanent cartilage, and a mixture of thin and thick zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and to the zzso terminal zzso zzso of alpha 1 zzso These studies showed that zzso both zzso of Type zzso collagen were readily accessible to zzso at the zzso surface, zzso Type zzso collagen was associated predominantly with zzso zzso 25 zzso in diameter, zzso Type zzso collagen was not found in thick zzso even after disruption with zzso agents, and zzso collagen zzso II and IX were associated with zzso of all zzso These studies were extended to human newborn zzso cartilage and to fetal calf cartilage, with the same zzso
