The cellular rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generation is determined by the level of a zzso limiting zzso activity, zzso conversion activity, which is predominantly composed of the long sought zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso Butler, zzso zzso and Rosenberg, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Rosenberg, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso were isolated by zzso the zzso zzso with zzso sequencing the zzso peptides as well as the existing zzso zzso employing zzso zzso chain reaction zzso corresponding to the sequences of the peptides as well as the zzso zzso to amplify a zzso from zzso zzso and utilizing the zzso probe to obtain full-length zzso zzso from a zzso zzso Express zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso were isolated by searching the expressed sequence tag data bank with the mouse zzso identifying a zzso human zzso and utilizing the clone as a probe to isolate a full-length zzso zzso from a zzso zzso human brain zzso zzso The expression of zzso mouse zzso as well as protein zzso mouse zzso by transient zzso of zzso cells and the expression of both zzso mouse and human zzso by in zzso zzso demonstrate that the two zzso directly zzso both zzso conversion and zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso exhibit three different size classes because of a zzso region of variable zzso which results from the zzso of zzso base pairs zzso between zzso 216 and zzso however, all zzso contain the same open reading frame of 933 zzso The length of the zzso region ranges from 301 to 430 zzso The zzso acid sequence of mouse and human zzso zzso are approximately zzso similar, zzso novel zzso and zzso acid proteins of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, that are zzso zzso The zzso zzso are predicted to be zzso zzso residents, presumably interacting via their zzso regions with an integral membrane zzso Both zzso species exhibit five potential zzso sites, which account for the apparent zzso between the molecular masses of the zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso and the previously zzso zzso zzso 46 zzso The two zzso species also exhibit approximately 50% similarity with all previously identified forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which suggests that zzso zzso zzso share a common zzso zzso
