zzso labeling with zzso was used to attach zzso this zzso to its binding site of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso We now identify zzso 995 of the large zzso zzso as the zzso acid that is zzso with zzso The identification was carried out by comparative zzso mapping in two zzso systems of peptides zzso labeled with zzso and with the labeled inhibitor zzso followed by automated zzso degradation and zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso by zzso confirmed zzso to be the only zzso acid in the protein forming a zzso zzso with zzso The zzso zzso protein was soluble and active and exhibited normal zzso for the zzso zzso and for the zzso in the presence of zzso However, the zzso selectively induced changes in the zzso by zzso and the zzso by zzso and it abolished the zzso of the zzso by zzso without affecting the zzso by the inhibitor zzso Since UMP is zzso to zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso only two zzso upstream of the site of zzso zzso the results provide structural evidence for earlier proposals which suggested that UMP and zzso bind in a single or overlapping zzso The two zzso are within the region previously proposed as the binding fold for the zzso zzso In the crystal structure of the zzso zzso and zzso are exposed and line a zzso where a zzso zzso was found zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso UMP and zzso appear to bind in this zzso possibly toward the zzso of the zzso in a zzso zzso Their binding in this site is consistent with the selectivity of zzso formation of UMP with zzso and of zzso with zzso It is also consistent with the zzso of zzso for the zzso since the interactions with other zzso that line the zzso must contribute a large part of the binding zzso The lack of an effect of the zzso on the zzso by zzso is consistent with the binding of this zzso in a separate site in the zzso
