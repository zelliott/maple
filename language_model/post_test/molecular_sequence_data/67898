zzso zzso zzso zzso is common in humans and has complex genetic zzso Many genes have been found to contribute to zzso but the full spectrum of genes remains zzso zzso of the entire coding regions and the 3' untranslated region zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso alpha zzso and the zzso zzso zzso identified seven novel single zzso zzso in the zzso in zzso patients with zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso unaffected controls zzso (the zzso zzso Of these seven, four were zzso zzso in the coding regions and three in the zzso zzso of four changes (three in coding, one in zzso were statistically different from those of controls zzso The zzso was identified in zzso cases and zzso zzso This position is zzso in primates and located zzso away from a predicted binding site for the zzso zzso zzso revealed that, in the presence of zzso the zzso significantly zzso zzso activity compared with that of the wild type, suggesting functional significance of this zzso This is the first study providing evidence supporting a role of zzso in human zzso
