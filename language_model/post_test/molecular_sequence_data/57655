zzso of zzso zzso through whole protein zzso and zzso digest mapping allows the identification of structural zzso zzso which result in zzso zzso digest mapping by conventional two-dimensional paper zzso provides high resolution but requires 48 zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso is faster zzso zzso there is decreased zzso zzso analysis provides a fast separation with high zzso We have used zzso to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from normal human zzso A and to analyze zzso zzso from normal zzso The zzso were zzso and peak identification performed using zzso scanning zzso In the zzso zzso digest separation up to 28 zzso could be resolved in zzso 20 zzso These zzso were identified as far as possible and a high-resolution map of the digest was zzso The zzso zzso conditions were used to observe the separation pattern obtained from normal adult zzso zzso common zzso zzso and some rarer zzso zzso
