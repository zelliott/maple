As zzso expression is often suppressed in sporadic zzso zzso we characterized the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in two human zzso surface zzso cell and two sporadic zzso zzso cell zzso Two individual regulatory elements within zzso the zzso element and the potential zzso element were each necessary, but alone not sufficient for zzso zzso in all four cell zzso The latter element showed some affinity for the zzso zzso factor, but zzso zzso stimulation failed to promote its zzso This element did, however, interact with, and was activated by, zzso and zzso which suggests that it can interact with zzso zzso factors and that it may act zzso with zzso factors to regulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso
