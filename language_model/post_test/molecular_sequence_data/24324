zzso zzso zzso is a unique zzso that has no zzso sequence at the zzso zzso level and for which the evolutionary origin is zzso We here propose that zzso is a member of a novel structural zzso of proteins containing zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear transport factor 2, and the zzso of zzso zzso known structures with different zzso The zzso and the active site zzso of zzso are predicted on the basis of its zzso zzso Nine zzso that carry zzso of the proposed zzso zzso were constructed by zzso zzso In addition to these, eight zzso that have a potential to make contact with the zzso were prepared by zzso zzso These zzso were expressed in zzso coli, and their activities in crude extract were zzso Most of the features of the zzso zzso could be explained on the basis of the present zzso model, indicating its zzso We conclude that zzso zzso the zzso abstraction via the zzso zzso zzso by a similar mechanism as described for zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso evolved from a common zzso zzso may have evolved from an zzso showing a zzso zzso
