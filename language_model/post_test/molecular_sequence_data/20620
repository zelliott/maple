Many organic zzso are zzso via zzso A zzso and enter central carbon metabolism at the level of this zzso We recently described the outlines of the zzso pathway, a new zzso zzso strategy that operates in a number of bacteria such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and replaces the zzso zzso This new zzso involves a unique central reaction sequence zzso by characteristic zzso Here, we identified and characterized zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the last unknown step in the central part of the zzso pathway, the zzso of zzso to zzso This zzso is highly specific for its zzso and forms a distinct zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparative sequence analyses with well-studied members of this zzso identified zzso acids that may contribute to the narrow zzso specificity of zzso zzso The central part of the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso using four zzso zzso By this work, the zzso zzso and its zzso course have been completely zzso This allowed defining the minimum set of zzso necessary for its operation and to screen for further organisms following this zzso zzso zzso
