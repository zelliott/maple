zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in the final stages of clinical development as a novel zzso treatment for severe chronic zzso It is the synthetic equivalent of zzso a component of the zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of action underlying zzso therapeutic profile derives from its potent and selective blockade of zzso zzso zzso calcium channels zzso zzso blockade of zzso zzso the activity of a subset of zzso including zzso primary zzso This mechanism of action zzso zzso from all other zzso including zzso zzso In fact, zzso is zzso zzso in animal models of pain in which zzso exhibits poor zzso zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso tolerance to zzso is not zzso Clinical studies of zzso in more than 2,000 patients reveal important correlations to zzso zzso zzso For example, zzso provides significant pain relief to severe chronic pain zzso who have failed to obtain relief from zzso therapy and no evidence of tolerance to zzso is seen in these zzso zzso on regulatory approval, zzso will be the first in a new class of neurological drugs: the zzso calcium channel blockers, or zzso Its novel mechanism of action as a zzso zzso suggests zzso has the potential to play a valuable role in treatment regimens for severe chronic zzso If approved for clinical use, zzso will further validate the zzso zzso peptides as a source of new and useful zzso
