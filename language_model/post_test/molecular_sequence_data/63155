zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been described in garlic zzso Here, the identification of a zzso from garlic is zzso which encodes for an zzso that zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli and shown to metabolize zzso as well as zzso zzso acid to zzso and zzso acid, zzso This zzso feature zzso it as a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis after incubation of zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso revealed the formation of a mixture of different zzso zzso with one zzso often zzso zzso zzso analyses showed a zzso expression of zzso transcripts zzso in zzso zzso of zzso By zzso application of salicylic acid and zzso but not by zzso the transcript was also induced in zzso Whereas the prominent zzso zzso in garlic was the zzso zzso acid, analysis of transgenic zzso expressing garlic zzso showed that zzso zzso acid dominated 24 h after zzso These data indicate that the product pattern of this zzso from garlic depends on the zzso availability and that the zzso is the first member in the group of zzso
