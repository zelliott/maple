zzso fatty acids zzso including zzso acid zzso : 2) and zzso acid zzso : zzso are major components of zzso zzso are produced from zzso fatty acids by several fatty acid zzso zzso in many zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso and humans do not have these zzso Although the zzso pathogen zzso zzso produces zzso : 2 and zzso : 3, the zzso that zzso them have not yet been zzso In this report, two zzso zzso and zzso were identified based on their zzso to other zzso zzso and zzso and zzso gene zzso were zzso zzso and zzso lost their ability to produce zzso : 2 and zzso : 3, zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells expressing zzso converted zzso acid zzso : 1) and zzso : 1 to zzso acid zzso : 2) and zzso : 2, respectively, and zzso cells converted zzso : 2 to zzso : zzso These results strongly supported that zzso encodes the zzso zzso and that zzso encodes the zzso zzso However, zzso analysis demonstrated that the presence of these zzso did not affect the zzso to mice, or zzso in the culture media used to induce zzso change of zzso zzso
