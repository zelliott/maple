zzso has been identified to exhibit an zzso effect on zzso zzso loss of zzso cell zzso Further studies demonstrated that zzso attenuated the zzso zzso in both cultured rat zzso zzso and human zzso cells, as demonstrated by typical zzso changes, cell viability and the zzso flow zzso zzso Gene expression analysis using DNA zzso showed that the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and a zzso family zzso A3 similar protein zzso changed their expression levels significantly in cultured zzso after zzso zzso In this report, we have undertaken a chemical genetic approach to study the molecular basis of zzso effects on the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso completely blocked the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso family zzso A3 similar zzso and partially attenuated the zzso of zzso marker zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso may prevent or reduce the zzso toxicity by regulating the expression of genes involved in the zzso induced zzso zzso These genes may represent a promising target for the therapeutic drug development for Alzheimer's disease zzso and other neurological zzso Furthermore, zzso and its zzso could potentially be developed as zzso protective agents for the treatment of these zzso
