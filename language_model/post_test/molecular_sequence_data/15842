A family of zzso zzso to the zzso portion of zzso a gene involved in zzso have been identified in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso distribution of both zzso and protein of one of these zzso suggest a possible role in the development of the central nervous system zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso show initial zzso in cells along the zzso of the zzso High level expression is restricted in the developing zzso to a subset of six zzso zzso cells abutting growing zzso zzso zzso is suggested by the presence of zzso repeats in the deduced protein sequence and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular data show that this gene zzso to the slit zzso zzso in this locus result in the collapse of the regular scaffold of zzso and zzso zzso tracts in the embryonic central nervous zzso
