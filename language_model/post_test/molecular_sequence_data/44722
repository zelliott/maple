We examined the effect of a single zzso repeat on the stability of a zzso pair zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso the zzso about fivefold in zzso zzso The stabilizing effect of the zzso base was also observed in strains with zzso in the DNA mismatch repair genes zzso zzso and zzso indicating that this effect does not require a functional DNA mismatch repair zzso Most of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso strains were additions or deletions of single zzso repeats, but about half of the zzso in the zzso and zzso strains were large zzso 8 zzso deletions or zzso
