zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in two Mediterranean families, one from Southern Italy and the other from zzso The zzso zzso at zzso 121 was characterized by DNA zzso The zzso genes were associated with the same zzso gene framework zzso and with the rare zzso zzso beta zzso restriction site generating a zzso zzso zzso However, at zzso the gene of the Italian family was associated with the restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso - - - zzso and the zzso zzso gamma zzso site, while that of the Albanian family was associated with zzso zzso - - - zzso but not with the zzso zzso gamma zzso The particular features of these zzso support the hypothesis of an African origin for the zzso zzso gene and a subsequent zzso event leading to the zzso found in the Italian zzso
