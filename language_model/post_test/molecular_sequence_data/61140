The zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso fungus zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso The folding of this zzso to its native zzso was examined in the presence of oxidized zzso and reduced zzso zzso at zzso resembling those present in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso and the applied temperature strongly affected the folding zzso The effect of temperature appeared zzso The conditions for in zzso folding were zzso and a maximum yield of zzso of correctly folded zzso was zzso In zzso folded zzso is equally as active as native zzso zzso They both display similar zzso zzso indicating that they have the same zzso structure and identical zzso zzso Thus, zzso can be folded correctly in zzso This folding can be described by zzso bridge formation leading to scrambled zzso species, followed by zzso zzso to acquire the native zzso The presence of zzso significantly affected the folding of zzso indicating that zzso interactions play a role in directing correct zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the folding rate at least zzso but had no effect on the zzso The folding procedure has also been applied successfully to two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso without the zzso (as present in zzso contains sufficient information to direct correct folding and zzso bridge formation in zzso
