A method was established to detect zzso zzso light chain gene zzso in peripheral blood zzso and frozen or zzso zzso V zzso zzso were used together with a J zzso primer mix in separate reactions to amplify V zzso gene zzso by the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were detected in seven of seven zzso B cell zzso in four of five zzso zzso zzso with frozen zzso and in seven of nine cases of zzso zzso zzso for which zzso zzso specimens were zzso zzso of amplified zzso chain reaction products was confirmed by sequence analysis for several zzso The present study shows that it is possible to amplify zzso zzso gene zzso in the majority of zzso B cell zzso and zzso The method described here, therefore, is a useful supplement to the previously described approach of zzso and zzso gene amplification to detect zzso B cell populations and allows the study of V zzso gene usage and zzso zzso in zzso normal and zzso B zzso
