zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso nearly one-third of the human zzso The success of zzso zzso is based on its complex life zzso a zzso zzso form disseminates infection, whereas an zzso zzso form establishes a zzso chronic zzso zzso and zzso is central to the survival of the zzso and is, in part, zzso by a family of zzso distinct surface zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso that play a dual role in host cell attachment and host immune zzso More than 160 members of the zzso family have been identified with only the zzso zzso structurally zzso Here we report the first structural description of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and small angle zzso zzso The zzso crystal structure of zzso reveals an architecture comprised of tandem beta sandwich zzso organized in a head to tail fashion with the zzso domain responsible for zzso zzso A restructured zzso in zzso results in a zzso site that is significantly reorganized in both structure and chemistry relative to zzso consistent with zzso binding a distinct zzso zzso The small angle zzso scattering solution structure of zzso highlights a potentially important structural role for the zzso zzso zzso that zzso significant flexibility that may promote structural adaptation during zzso zzso This study reveals an unexpected level of structural diversity within the zzso zzso and provides important insight into the role of these zzso zzso
