zzso zzso methods to estimate site by site substitution rate zzso in aligned zzso protein sequences rely on the zzso of a zzso tree and generally assume that the patterns of relative zzso follow a zzso zzso We present a zzso zzso method to estimate the relative zzso of individual sites within large zzso of zzso protein zzso It is based upon two simple zzso zzso that zzso observed between two closely related sequences are zzso in general, to occur at the most variable zzso zzso that zzso zzso acid zzso tend to occur at more variable zzso Our methodology makes no assumptions regarding the underlying pattern of relative zzso between zzso 

We have zzso using data simulated under a zzso distributed model, the performance of this approach to that of a maximum likelihood method that assumes gamma distributed zzso At low mean rates of evolution our method zzso site by site relative substitution rates more accurately than the maximum likelihood approach in the absence of prior assumptions about the relationships between zzso Our method does not directly account for the effects of zzso zzso However, we have incorporated an zzso modification that allows the accurate zzso of relative site zzso in fast evolving and saturated zzso
