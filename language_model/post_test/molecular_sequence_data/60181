To investigate the functional role of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a set of zzso zzso with replacement of the zzso zzso at position 324 was constructed and their zzso properties were zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso to zzso using the zzso column and the molecular masses were determined to be zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso with that of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso displayed comparable zzso activity to that of the zzso zzso while the other zzso zzso showed markedly decreased or no zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso increase in zzso and a zzso reduction in zzso Based on the crystal structure of a zzso zzso pig kidney zzso it is suggested that zzso might play a structural role for proper zzso function of zzso zzso zzso
