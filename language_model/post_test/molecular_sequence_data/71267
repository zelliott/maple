zzso zzso zzso have a central role in zzso control and are activated by complex formation with positive regulatory proteins called zzso and by zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso has been associated with zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been shown to exhibit highest sequence zzso to type D zzso and specifically activates zzso of host cells to a very high zzso 

We have determined the first X-ray structure of a zzso to zzso A zzso The structure of the core zzso is very similar to those of zzso A and zzso H from human zzso To understand the structural basis for the zzso specificity for zzso and the zzso of the complex to zzso of the zzso and zzso families, a zzso model was built on the basis of the known structures of human zzso A in complex with zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso 

Although many critical interactions between zzso A and zzso would be zzso in a zzso complex, some appear zzso or zzso zzso due to shifts in the backbone zzso or zzso differences and may contribute to zzso selectivity for zzso The zzso of zzso complexes to zzso of the zzso family is probably due to structural changes in zzso that lead to a zzso surface area offering fewer potential contacts with the protein zzso In addition, sequence changes in zzso eliminate zzso partners for atoms of the zzso zzso This structure provides the first model for interactions between zzso and host zzso zzso these interactions may be important for virus survival as well as zzso transformation of host zzso
