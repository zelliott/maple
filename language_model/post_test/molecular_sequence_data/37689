We have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso protein of the zzso zzso system at the regulatory zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The two opposing activities of zzso were regulated by zzso which zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso A zzso producing truncated zzso was found to be devoid of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso was zzso carbon zzso repression of zzso disappeared, and the lag phase observed during zzso growth of the zzso strain on media containing zzso plus either zzso or zzso was strongly zzso In addition, zzso exclusion exerted by the presence of zzso on zzso transport in the zzso strain was abolished in the zzso zzso However, zzso expulsion of zzso zzso triggered by rapidly zzso carbon sources was still operative in zzso zzso altered at zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso suggesting that, in contrast to the model proposed for zzso expulsion in zzso bacteria, zzso might not be involved in this regulatory zzso
