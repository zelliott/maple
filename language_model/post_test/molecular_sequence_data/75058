The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso cell growth zzso including its precursor zzso is zzso The sequence was deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso zzso cell growth inhibitor is identical with the zzso sequences of the factors that have been called type beta 2 transforming growth factor and zzso factor B, suggesting that these are zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso cell growth inhibitor differs from that of human type beta transforming growth factor in 32 of the 112 zzso zzso zzso is proposed as the name for the zzso cell growth zzso
