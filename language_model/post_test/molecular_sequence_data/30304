zzso dynamics has been used to study binding of zzso CO2 to the active site of human zzso zzso zzso Three potential CO2 binding sites have been zzso The first is at the zzso zzso pocket (the zzso productive zzso where CO2 is approximately zzso A from the zinc zzso and interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zinc zzso and the zzso hydroxide zzso The second CO2 binding site is approximately 6 A from the zinc zzso where CO2 interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and some zzso water zzso The third CO2 binding site is approximately 10 A from the zinc zzso is largely zzso by water zzso and interacts with zzso zzso and zzso At these three CO2 binding sites, the CO2 zzso is highly localized (the average zzso distance fluctuation is approximately 1 zzso and favors the linear binding orientation toward the zinc zzso This linear binding orientation of CO2 and its zzso interaction with the zinc zzso direct diffusion of CO2 toward the zinc zzso and facilitate the zzso attack from O of the zzso zzso to C of CO2 in the productive zzso binding zzso Finally, the two CO2 binding sites outside the zzso binding pocket, which may represent two intermediate states along the CO2 binding pathway, could play important roles as a CO2 zzso
