zzso affects the synthesis and release of several zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a member of the steroid hormone zzso family, is thought to mediate zzso effects in a zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso is expressed in specific zzso cell types in the human zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34) were collected at the time of surgery, and normal zzso were obtained from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and in zzso zzso zzso was also localized with zzso and protein zzso By zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso expressing only zzso in those producing zzso and zzso and in zzso expressing the zzso zzso No zzso zzso was detected in zzso expressing only zzso without zzso or zzso nor in tumors producing zzso without zzso or zzso In zzso zzso was not as sensitive or specific as zzso zzso analysis performed on seven tumors that were positive for zzso zzso by zzso detected zzso protein in only one zzso zzso and one zzso and yielded negative or zzso results in one zzso zzso three zzso zzso and one zzso cell zzso zzso protein was localized by zzso in scattered cells of the zzso zzso and in a few zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso with the expression of zzso or zzso in contrast, zzso zzso was not detected in zzso that express only zzso or zzso These findings zzso zzso as a zzso zzso factor that may regulate zzso in the zzso
