The expression of zzso region of the zzso zzso causes the high instability of the zzso zzso in the promoter zzso region and zzso in the structural part of the N gene result in the stable inheritance of the zzso The plasmids zzso containing the zzso inserted into the different zzso of zzso region restore the high instability of the zzso inheritance in the strain zzso coding for zzso The plasmids zzso and zzso of the series zzso zzso permit one to obtain the collection of random deletions in the cloned fragments induced by zzso
