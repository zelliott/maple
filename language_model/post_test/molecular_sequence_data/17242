zzso is known to accumulate in brain, therefore transport of zzso through the zzso barrier was studied in an in zzso system using bovine brain zzso zzso cells zzso grown on filter zzso in a zzso system with zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso to zzso resulted in a high zzso of zzso zzso zzso which decreased dramatically upon removal of zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated a possibility of functioning of more than one zzso zzso were incubated in the presence of zzso and zzso of known zzso zzso added from either zzso or zzso zzso zzso by replacement of sodium and expression of zzso zzso were in agreement with earlier reports on the functioning of zzso in zzso zzso For the first time, functioning of zzso was demonstrated in the zzso zzso as well as functioning in both zzso of a low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was confirmed by zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso could be involved in zzso transport in both the zzso and zzso zzso
