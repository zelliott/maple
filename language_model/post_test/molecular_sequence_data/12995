An expression zzso yielding large amounts of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso coli was zzso The zzso zzso obtained after zzso was characterized in its zzso and kinetic properties and appeared to be indistinguishable from that zzso from human zzso However, zzso zzso acid sequencing revealed that about 50% of the zzso zzso still contained zzso as the zzso zzso zzso Such an incomplete processing was not simply due to overproduction of zzso In fact, under growth conditions that lead to a sharp decrease in the production of the protein the zzso zzso was not zzso zzso was unable to zzso across the bacterial membrane when it was fused to the leader zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso and accumulated in the zzso in a soluble and active zzso However, when this fusion protein was produced in a bacterial strain zzso the bacterial zzso zzso and zzso a fraction of zzso was exported into the zzso space with the correct zzso zzso The yield of correctly processed zzso accounted for zzso of total zzso present in the zzso coli zzso Our results suggest that zzso are able to interact with nascent zzso thus maintaining the protein in an zzso form and that zzso coli strains with enhanced zzso characteristics may be obtained by genetic engineering zzso
