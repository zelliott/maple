Recently zzso zzso were isolated from zzso in Ohio and Iowa with a zzso zzso These zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were characterized and compared with other zzso zzso including strains of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso were zzso positive, strongly zzso grew under a zzso zzso zzso atmosphere, and were zzso similar to zzso in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso gene restriction patterns zzso and zzso of whole cell zzso indicated both zzso were similar to zzso zzso strains from zzso Comparisons of nearly complete sequences zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene of the two zzso zzso with zzso zzso strains confirmed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were strains of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso has a broader host range than previously zzso
