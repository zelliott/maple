Based on the sequence of an expressed sequence tag, the full-length zzso of zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso zzso It was designated as zzso zzso a protein of 183 zzso zzso The calculated molecular weight of the zzso protein is zzso k zzso and theoretical zzso point is zzso The zzso localized in zzso Under normal growth conditions, differential expression of zzso exhibited that the expression was the highest in seeds and the lowest in zzso zzso could be induced by zzso zzso zzso and drought zzso Salt and drought zzso of transgenic plants with zzso of zzso are zzso Taken together, these results demonstrated that zzso could regulate the expression of zzso genes and plays important roles in modulating the tolerance of plants to zzso zzso
