Using zzso zzso raised against human pancreatic zzso a full-length zzso coding for an zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso human pancreatic zzso This zzso contains standard 3' and zzso zzso regions, a zzso tail and a central region of zzso zzso coding for a protein of zzso zzso zzso On the basis of sequence zzso the human protein was classified as a zzso A1 which is very similar to the previously described A1 forms from rat and bovine pancreatic zzso The presence of the zzso acid sequences assumed to be of importance for the zzso zzso by its zzso segment, primarily on the basis of the recently reported crystal structure of the B form, further supports the proposed zzso
