zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso the essential precursor of zzso The zzso from peppermint and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso or zzso consisting of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso each zzso were joined with different sized zzso and in both possible orders, and expressed in zzso coli to yield the corresponding fused zzso The properties of the zzso fused version, in which the small zzso was followed by the large zzso with a 10 zzso acid zzso resembled those of the native zzso zzso in zzso product zzso zzso and architecture, and this form thus provided a suitable single gene transcript for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the type that inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the fused zzso zzso zzso apparently by interacting at both the zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso The results of zzso studies, along with the previously established role of the small zzso and related zzso experiments, suggest that zzso zzso zzso employs a different mechanism for zzso determination than do other zzso zzso
