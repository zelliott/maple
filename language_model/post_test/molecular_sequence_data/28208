The coding region for the zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso contains 390 extra base pairs in a region that is highly zzso in other zzso zzso zzso The sequence has all the elements characteristic of group I zzso zzso and interrupts the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso transcripts containing the putative group I zzso were capable of undergoing a zzso reaction which required the presence of zzso zzso
