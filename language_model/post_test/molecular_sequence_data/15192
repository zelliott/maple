A number of studies have confirmed that genetic factors play an important role in zzso spectrum disorder zzso More recently de zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a synaptic scaffolding zzso have been associated with the zzso zzso As part of our gene discovery strategy, we zzso the zzso gene in a cohort of zzso zzso subjects and 190 zzso Here, we report the identification of two putative zzso zzso one being a de zzso deletion at an zzso donor zzso site and one zzso transmitted from an zzso zzso We were able to confirm the deleterious effect of the zzso site deletion by zzso using zzso extracted from cultured zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso to zzso at zzso acid position 68, is perfectly zzso across all species zzso and would be predicted to disrupt an zzso zzso These results further support the role of zzso gene disruption in the zzso of zzso
