zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso and fatty zzso The zzso plays a regulatory role in a variety of zzso events in zzso and also functions as an zzso in particular zzso The crystal structures of neutral zzso from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso forms were determined at zzso and zzso A resolutions, zzso zzso consists of two zzso and the zzso and zzso sites are found within the center of the zzso domain and the interface between the zzso zzso The structural comparison between the zzso and zzso forms revealed an zzso zzso change occurring to loop I upon binding of zzso In the closed state, this loop sits above the zzso coordination site and over the opening to the zzso binding zzso zzso analyses of zzso surrounding the zzso of zzso and rat neutral zzso revealed that the zzso or creation of the zzso linkage of zzso follows a similar mechanism as observed for the zzso zzso The results provide an understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso and synthesis of zzso by the zzso Furthermore, insights into the actions of zzso and zzso neutral zzso as an zzso and zzso of zzso signaling are also revealed, zzso
