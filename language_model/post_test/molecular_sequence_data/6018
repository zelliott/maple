zzso cells from 44 lung cancer patients zzso zzso 19 zzso cell zzso and 3 small cell zzso zzso were examined to contain zzso zzso zzso The zzso amplification zzso method was used for detection of zzso point zzso The reaction was designed to amplify only zzso zzso with zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 12, 13 and 61 were studied with zzso zzso Two cases zzso zzso of the lung and zzso zzso with lung zzso were positive for point zzso at zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso was found in the first case and to zzso in the second zzso Further experiments with colony zzso revealed the zzso were found in zzso of zzso in both zzso There were no point zzso found at zzso 13 nor zzso Our experiments showed it is possible to detect zzso zzso in zzso cells from lung cancer patients, with zzso zzso
