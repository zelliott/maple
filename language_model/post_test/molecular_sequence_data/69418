An zzso encompassing the 3' 147 zzso of the zzso for zzso protein zzso in zzso coli constitutes a naturally occurring zzso intermediate whose formation depends on zzso zzso We have investigated the role of internal zzso structures in the zzso zzso zzso which generates this product from zzso zzso in a partially zzso processing system in zzso Individual zzso have been removed by deletion or zzso by point zzso No single hairpin structure is absolutely required for zzso zzso zzso at the site 147 zzso from the 3' end of the zzso zzso sequences or secondary structures zzso or 3' to this site exert only a modest influence on the specificity of zzso but can strongly modify its zzso Moreover, zzso in the zzso zzso which destabilize stems zzso or 3' to the prominent zzso site also reveal several strong cryptic zzso E zzso zzso These data greatly strengthen the hypothesis that zzso E is a zzso specific zzso Our data further demonstrate that zzso structures adjacent to the prominent zzso site are unlikely to provide a site of recognition for zzso zzso Rather, they appear to stabilize (or zzso the local secondary structure so that the zzso site is zzso and to zzso alternative sites so that the initial products of zzso resist further zzso
