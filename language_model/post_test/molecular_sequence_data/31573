zzso zzso one of the zzso most commonly used for vinegar production, produces the zzso flavor compound zzso Since zzso reduction is important for rice vinegar production, a genetic approach was attempted to reduce zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso using specific gene knockout without introducing zzso zzso resistance zzso A zzso zzso with deletion of the zzso zzso gene zzso was first isolated by positive selection using zzso zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso zzso showed zzso acid zzso zzso and the zzso gene were used for further gene disruption experiments as a host cell and a zzso marker, zzso zzso disruption of zzso or zzso which encodes zzso zzso or zzso zzso was attempted in zzso The disruption of these genes was expected to result in a decrease in zzso zzso A disruption zzso harboring the zzso marker within the targeted gene was constructed for zzso zzso The cells of zzso were transformed with the zzso DNA using zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso revealed the unique occurrence of targeted zzso or zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the amount of zzso was zzso The zzso level in zzso culture was significantly reduced to zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso whereas that of zzso was not affected zzso zzso This indicates that zzso disruption is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has clear application potential in the production of rice vinegar with less zzso zzso
