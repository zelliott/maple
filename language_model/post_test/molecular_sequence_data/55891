We have established an improved method for detecting point zzso by zzso DNA sequencing of zzso fragments generated from zzso zzso The method employs magnetic beads to create immobilized zzso DNA templates, and the sequencing reaction is performed with zzso This method is superior to sequencing with zzso DNA zzso because the uniform peak height with zzso makes zzso easily zzso as double zzso that are half the normal zzso zzso of zzso by this method is illustrated by sequencing a zzso zzso of the human zzso B zzso This zzso contains zzso zzso where a point zzso zzso is found in subjects with the zzso dominant disease familial defective zzso zzso The zzso peak height with zzso DNA zzso makes it more difficult to detect zzso This is also illustrated by sequencing a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
