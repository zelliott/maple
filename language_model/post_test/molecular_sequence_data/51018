A large novel zzso beta zzso zzso associated with unusually high levels of zzso zzso in zzso is described in an Australian zzso The deletion was characterized by restriction zzso analysis followed by zzso amplification and sequencing of the zzso zzso Australian beta zzso extends from zzso zzso zzso zzso to the cap site of the zzso gene downstream for zzso zzso This zzso similar to previously described zzso beta zzso associated with high zzso zzso removes sequences zzso to the zzso gene promoter and emphasizes the functional importance of the zzso zzso region in zzso the unusually high zzso zzso zzso
