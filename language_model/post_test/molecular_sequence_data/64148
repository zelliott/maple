zzso of zzso zzso and other functional cargo into living cells is contingent upon efficient transport across the plasma membrane zzso We have harnessed the signal sequence zzso region zzso to deliver functional zzso to cultured cells and to experimental zzso We now report evidence that two zzso distinct forms of zzso composed of all zzso or all d zzso acids showed similar zzso activity as assessed by zzso zzso flow zzso and direct zzso zzso An attached nuclear zzso sequence ferried by the zzso zzso displayed similar zzso function by zzso zzso nuclear import of zzso factor nuclear factor zzso B and suppressing nuclear factor zzso zzso gene expression of zzso A nuclear zzso sequence comprised of a positively charged cluster of zzso acids was rapidly zzso by zzso zzso to the interior of zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso functional peptides directly through the plasma membrane zzso zzso without involving zzso specific zzso zzso This mechanism of zzso zzso is suitable for facile delivery of biologically active peptides for zzso and zzso functional zzso zzso
