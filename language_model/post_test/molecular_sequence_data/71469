From the initial stages of zzso outgrowth to the formation of a functioning zzso zzso growth cones continuously integrate and respond to multiple guidance zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the establishment of appropriate zzso zzso we have characterized a novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso in the developing limb bud zzso during zzso pioneer zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso acts as zzso guidance zzso critical for zzso zzso and for determining both the initial direction and subsequent zzso events of the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, simultaneous zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I results in a broader range and increased zzso of abnormal zzso pioneer zzso zzso indicating that different zzso family members can provide functionally distinct guidance information to the same growth cone in zzso
