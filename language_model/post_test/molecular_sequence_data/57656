A number of zzso zzso zzso systems for the separation of zzso zzso zzso and five zzso important zzso have been systematically zzso The selectivity of zzso has been compared with several zzso zzso zzso zzso systems and free solution zzso zzso zzso exhibits greater selectivity towards structural differences, but complete separation of the peptides in one zzso zzso run is tedious due to the large differences in zzso zzso zzso gives satisfactory separation in an acceptable time zzso Of the zzso systems examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only zzso with zzso zzso gave a complete separation showing selectivity similar, but not zzso to zzso and providing a complete separation of all six compounds as rapidly as zzso zzso
