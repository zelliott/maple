zzso coli zzso is an zzso zzso consisting of two heat shock zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso activity of zzso by one to two orders of zzso while zzso increases the rate of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Here we show that zzso alone can efficiently degrade certain unfolded zzso such as unfolded zzso and zzso prepared by complete reduction of zzso bonds, but not their native zzso Furthermore, zzso alone zzso a zzso zzso sandwiched by two zzso zzso indicating that it can zzso the internal zzso bonds of zzso Surprisingly, zzso inhibited the degradation of unfolded proteins by zzso This zzso effect of zzso was markedly diminished by substitution of the zzso zzso located in the zzso pore of zzso with zzso suggesting that interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso blocks access of unfolded proteins to the zzso chamber of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is inactive under normal conditions, but may can degrade unfolded proteins when the zzso level is low, as it is during carbon zzso
