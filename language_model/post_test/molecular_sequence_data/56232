zzso zzso viruses of zzso zzso zzso zzso killer toxins to which other cells of the same species and closely related species are zzso zzso toxin consists of two zzso alpha and zzso produced from a single precursor zzso In this work, we cloned complementary DNA for the zzso segment of two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso the beta and alpha zzso zzso Both sequence analysis of the zzso clones and in zzso translation of the zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso can produce full-length zzso zzso in alpha is converted to zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in beta are changed to Pro and zzso respectively, in zzso Although alpha and beta are zzso in a single zzso only the beta zzso is zzso by zzso and only the alpha zzso is zzso by zzso This differential expression of peptides from one precursor is a unique zzso Neither of the zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso The possible effects of these zzso on zzso folding and their consequences for toxin zzso are zzso
