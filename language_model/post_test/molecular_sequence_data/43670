Small zzso infectious particles called zzso cause certain neurodegenerative diseases in human and zzso Limited zzso of infectious zzso zzso zzso yields an zzso zzso termed zzso zzso which encompasses zzso 90 to 231 of zzso and which assembles into 100 to 200 A wide zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that the infectious prion is converted from its zzso cellular form zzso by means of an zzso to zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure analysis, computer zzso and structural zzso methods support this zzso zzso 90 to 145 of zzso which contain two putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be of particular relevance to the disease zzso as zzso zzso at zzso 145 was found in a patient with an inherited prion zzso Moreover, our recent X-ray zzso analysis suggests that the zzso consisting of these zzso zzso zzso zzso closely models the zzso zzso core of zzso In the current study, we have analyzed in detail the X-ray zzso patterns of zzso zzso Two samples were zzso one that was dehydrated under ambient conditions whilst in an external magnetic field (to induce zzso zzso and another that was sealed after partial zzso The dried, zzso oriented sample showed a zzso zzso pattern in which the fiber axis zzso zzso was parallel to the zzso direction of the zzso The major wide-angle zzso indicate the presence of approximately 40 A wide zzso which constitute the zzso Each zzso is composed of several zzso unit cells, normal to the fiber zzso direction, having lattice zzso a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, and c zzso zzso zzso zzso density maps were calculated by zzso zzso synthesis using zzso as an initial phase zzso The distribution of density indicated that there were two types of zzso suggesting that larger and smaller zzso localized to different zzso This would arise from folding of the zzso in which there are turns in the middle of both the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso with a zzso zzso A, b zzso c zzso zzso A and alpha zzso zzso degrees, was found to index all the reflections, including those in the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso are nearly zzso zzso To account for the approximately 100 A wide fibers zzso by negative zzso in the electron zzso the zzso would be arranged in zzso The partially dried sample showed a sharp zzso A reflection (from zzso and five broad zzso superimposed on zzso decreasing diffuse zzso This zzso scattering was modeled by an zzso rectangle with a thickness comparable to a singe zzso The structure, which occurred during dehydration, could be a transient in the zzso to zzso conversion, suggesting that formation of hydrogen bonding precedes the zzso interaction and assembly into the zzso of zzso zzso
