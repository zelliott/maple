The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso converting zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso toward zzso zzso and zzso zzso designed on the basis of zzso acid sequences of zzso fragments, a full-length zzso clone zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The open reading frame encodes a protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso A comparison with the zzso acid sequencing data demonstrates that the protein is not subjected to zzso modification at the zzso and zzso ends except for the removal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity zzso is found to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and to a zzso zzso sequence from zzso of unknown function zzso zzso zzso zzso is assigned as the first member of a new zzso zzso family zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso contains the four zzso characteristic for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso acid sequence before the zzso domain is longer in zzso zzso and in four zzso zzso presently available from other zzso plants compared to the sequences from zzso plants but is concluded to contain a single zzso zzso with the zzso located in the zzso of the zzso and the bulk of the protein protruding into the zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is recognizable at position 493 but this region deviates from the consensus sequence by having an unusual zzso zzso at position zzso The central region of zzso I contains three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the consensus zzso zzso is the only other known zzso zzso using zzso as zzso and contains the same zzso substitution in the consensus sequence of zzso I indicating the importance of these zzso in defining zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which normally helps to form the oxygen binding pocket is zzso The zzso zzso sequence represents the first zzso acid sequence of a functionally characterized zzso zzso zzso from a zzso plant and the first sequence of a zzso zzso with high zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso type have not been previously demonstrated to catalyze zzso pathways in living zzso
