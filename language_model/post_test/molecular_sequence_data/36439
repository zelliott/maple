The relationship of heat shock proteins and zzso arthritis as well as the relevance of zzso in this disease is zzso T cells of six individuals (four expressing the zzso zzso one harboring zzso and one the zzso zzso were cloned in the presence of zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso in order to determine T cell receptors zzso used and the zzso class II restriction patterns of potentially relevant T cell clones zzso All zzso obtained were not specific for zzso but six zzso of one donor zzso were responsive towards zzso zzso zzso One zzso displayed authentic zzso whereas five zzso reacted specifically to serum zzso The zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso crucial for immune recognition were mapped to zzso zzso or zzso of either maternal or paternal zzso The strictly zzso zzso did not recognize zzso L cells implicating specificity for zzso not presented by L cells or the involvement of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso sequences or N zzso of various zzso zzso were not zzso
