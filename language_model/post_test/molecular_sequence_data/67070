zzso of group II zzso as circles has been described only for a few zzso zzso and little is known about the mechanisms involved, the relevance or consequences of the zzso We report that zzso of the bacterial group II zzso zzso in zzso leads to the formation of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We determined that besides being required for the zzso zzso reaction, the zzso domain of the zzso protein also controls the balance between zzso and zzso zzso circle zzso Furthermore, comparison with in zzso zzso products indicates that in zzso the zzso protein appears to promote the use of a correct zzso zzso interaction as well as zzso at, or next to, the expected 3' zzso zzso These findings provide new insights on the mechanism of zzso of group II zzso as zzso
