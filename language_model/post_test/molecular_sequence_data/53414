The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso protein zzso which is an unusual zzso zzso capable of zzso binding oxygen during zzso Similar proteins have not only been observed in other zzso bacteria but also in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the metal reducing zzso zzso zzso A three-dimensional structure of zzso was derived using the multiple zzso replacement phasing zzso Besides a model for the oxidized state (to zzso A zzso models for the reduced state zzso A zzso the oxidized zzso zzso with cyanide zzso 90 A zzso and the reduced zzso zzso with zzso oxide zzso A zzso could be zzso The zzso structure represents a new variation of the class I zzso c zzso The oxidized state reveals a novel sixth zzso zzso zzso which moves away from the iron upon reduction or when small molecules zzso The zzso side of the zzso has a striking resemblance to other zzso proteins that bind gaseous zzso In zzso the liberated zzso group of zzso zzso zzso zzso through a hydrogen zzso
