In zzso stem cell transplantation zzso the outcome is predicted using zzso procedures, which are very zzso There exists substantial evidence of the importance of early donor acceptance in zzso zzso In cases when the donor cannot be perfectly zzso it often is unclear which mismatch is less harmful and thus has a greater likelihood of zzso We modeled and analyzed interactions between the protein products of different zzso zzso of the transplant recipient and natural killer and T zzso cell receptors of the donor's immune zzso zzso between these 2 systems often lead to zzso disease zzso zzso zzso that define zzso I and II zzso predict not only zzso but also zzso and zzso effects, all of which influence the overall transplantation zzso Although complete high-resolution zzso matching of the zzso pair seems to be associated with optimal zzso survival, recent reports suggest that not every zzso disparity is functionally zzso We performed interaction energy calculations for selected pairs of zzso zzso zzso Based on the results, we conclude that the energy of contact between the T zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso can help predict the future development of an immune reaction and, consequently, the outcome of zzso zzso
