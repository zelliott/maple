To explore the influence of the direct repeat sequence zzso in zzso zzso genes on zzso expression in zzso coli, we cloned and zzso the entire open reading frame zzso and upstream sequences of the zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso A pair of zzso zzso was found upstream of each zzso zzso Chi zzso with a series of truncated zzso were cloned and transformed into zzso coli zzso The activity of the zzso without the zzso were significantly higher in zzso zzso than zzso containing the zzso zzso showed that part and full deletion of the zzso increased zzso gene expression by approximately zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso revealed deletion of the zzso regions increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso factors in the zzso coli cell zzso was observed to both the zzso and zzso promoter regions and zzso zzso This is the first investigation to demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso coli is zzso regulated by their upstream zzso regions, which act as zzso zzso
