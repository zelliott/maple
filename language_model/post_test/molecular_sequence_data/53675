The zzso zzso zzso expresses the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because zzso similar zzso zzso expressing some or all of these zzso were shown to be carried by hybrid zzso zzso it was proposed that a similar protein would be found for zzso The identification of a second zzso zzso zzso initiated a study to determine the molecular basis of this zzso 

zzso tests and zzso analysis with zzso zzso were zzso zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso was cloned and zzso after reverse zzso zzso amplification of total zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso encompassing zzso zzso 3, zzso 3, and zzso 4 were also used to clone and sequence zzso DNA from zzso and zzso the original zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso data confirmed that zzso zzso carried zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of genes predicted to zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso hybrid in which the 3' end of zzso zzso 3 had been replaced by a short zzso sequence from zzso 3 of the zzso gene zzso The hybrid zzso sequence contained sequence motifs previously shown to be required for the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is consistent with their presence as detected zzso zzso DNA analysis found that the crossover point in zzso zzso 3 was identical in zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso is produced by a hybrid zzso protein caused by a DNA zzso of zzso into zzso The composition of the hybrid protein is zzso
