zzso zzso proteins zzso from zzso snake zzso are zzso toxins targeting vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso consist of zzso double chains zzso The authors previously described a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which also zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso et zzso 1998, European Journal of zzso zzso zzso The authors report here the whole zzso sequences and some additional zzso characteristics of zzso In addition to the zzso activity of zzso the toxin displays a zzso activity after incubation in zzso zzso These observations indicate that the zzso and zzso functions can be zzso Analysis of the zzso activity also revealed that zzso consists of two similar zzso zzso and zzso which are members of the zzso snake zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso In contrast, the zzso sequences of zzso were identical to that of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with each other to form a zzso zzso similar to the zzso which was detected by native zzso gel zzso These data show some new characteristics of zzso which are important to clarify the zzso pathways in vascular zzso zzso
