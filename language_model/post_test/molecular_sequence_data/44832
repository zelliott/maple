zzso zzso channels display a fundamental zzso remain virtually closed at rest and open upon zzso zzso Here we show that substituting zzso for either of two zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso in the zzso region of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso results in spontaneous channel opening in the absence of zzso Surprisingly, for two single point zzso zzso or zzso application of very low zzso of zzso partially suppressed this spontaneous zzso while higher zzso zzso the zzso When both of these sites were zzso zzso zzso nearly completely suppressed the zzso current and did not zzso the current even at very high zzso This study provides important new insights into the zzso relationship of zzso zzso channels, where modification of the structure of the channel pore region not only alters the zzso transition of the zzso protein but also reverses the polarity of zzso regulation of channel zzso Our results suggest that the sites where these two zzso are located are structurally critical for channel zzso
