A new zzso zzso specific zzso was identified and zzso from the zzso body of the Australian indigenous mushroom zzso zzso The functional zzso named zzso showed zzso activity against zzso treated rabbit and human blood types A, B and O, and exhibited high binding specificity towards zzso as well as zzso and zzso but not against zzso PAL zzso to zzso by a combination of ammonium zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso and size exclusion zzso was zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso was stable at temperatures up to 55 zzso and between pH zzso and did not require zzso zzso for optimal zzso De zzso sequencing of PAL using zzso identified 10 zzso peptides that revealed substantial sequence similarity to the zzso recognizing zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso binding and calcium binding zzso zzso PAL was also found to exert a potent zzso effect on zzso cells zzso zzso zzso that was approximately zzso greater than that observed on zzso zzso a difference found to be due to the differential expression of cell surface zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Further characterization of this activity using zzso zzso zzso revealed that PAL induced cell cycle arrest at zzso phase in a manner dependent on its ability to bind zzso
