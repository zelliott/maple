zzso changes in zzso zzso strength are thought to reflect changes in synaptic abundance of zzso receptors zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso are two similar zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso 1) proteins that interact with zzso receptors 2 and 3 zzso and zzso zzso Both proteins have proposed roles during long-term zzso and long-term depression in the delivery and zzso of zzso receptors at zzso Here we report a zzso of zzso zzso zzso form of zzso called zzso that is zzso at a zzso zzso at position 11 within a novel 18 zzso acid zzso leader sequence zzso through differential zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with internal zzso pools expressed from a zzso virus zzso whereas zzso is membrane targeted and associates with zzso zzso receptors at the plasma membrane in zzso zzso of zzso to zzso blocks the zzso of zzso and targets the protein to zzso zzso confirming that targeting the protein to spines is dependent on zzso zzso zzso is primarily zzso but a zzso with the zzso zzso zzso sequence linked to the body of the zzso protein is targeted to zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso zzso respectively, synaptic and zzso sites for the zzso of zzso receptors during zzso trafficking to and from the zzso
