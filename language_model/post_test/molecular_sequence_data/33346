The zzso factor gene zzso was identified recently as an zzso that is zzso in some human zzso Here we describe a new mechanism of zzso of zzso in human cancer involving gene zzso We show that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the breast and head and neck consistently results in zzso zzso zzso transcripts predominantly consisting of zzso zzso 14 linked to the last coding zzso of zzso The minimal common part of zzso deleted as the result of fusion was zzso 15 including the zzso which contains several highly zzso target sites for zzso and zzso zzso These zzso recently were shown to regulate zzso expression zzso We suggest that deletion of these target sites may disrupt repression of zzso leading to zzso of zzso transcripts and protein and to zzso of critical zzso targets, including genes associated with zzso cell cycle control, cell zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in primary zzso zzso cells did not significantly alter the expression of zzso as compared with zzso cells with zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso fusion is a hallmark of zzso and that deregulation of the expression of zzso and its target genes is a key zzso event in the zzso of zzso Our findings also suggest that the zzso activity resulting from the zzso fusion is a candidate therapeutic zzso
