zzso Reconstruction is the problem of resolving the hidden phase information in zzso data obtained from laboratory zzso zzso this problem is an important intermediate step in gene association studies, which seek to uncover the genetic basis of complex zzso We propose a novel approach for zzso reconstruction based on constrained hidden zzso zzso Models are constructed by zzso refining and zzso the structure of a simple zzso model for zzso data under zzso zzso 

The proposed method is evaluated on real-world and simulated population zzso zzso show that it is competitive with other recently proposed methods in terms of reconstruction zzso while offering a particularly good zzso between zzso costs and quality of results for large zzso 

Relatively simple zzso approaches for zzso reconstruction based on structured hidden zzso models are competitive with more complex, well-established techniques in this zzso
