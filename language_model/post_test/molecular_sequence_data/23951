Type II zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso transfer from zzso to zzso without any zzso zzso zzso accomplish the turnover of zzso zzso the zzso pool, and may contribute to the generation of a membrane potential through complexes III and zzso These zzso are usually constituted by a zzso zzso chain of approximately 50 zzso containing a zzso zzso There are a few compounds that can prevent their activity, but so far no general specific inhibitor has been assigned to these zzso However, they have the common feature of being resistant to the complex I classical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have particular relevance in zzso like zzso zzso and in several zzso whose respiratory chains are devoid of complex I, in which zzso keep the balance and are the main entry point of electrons into the respiratory zzso Our knowledge of these proteins has expanded in the past decade, as a result of contributions at the zzso level and the sequencing of the zzso from several zzso The latter showed that most organisms contain genes that potentially zzso zzso An overview of this development is zzso with special emphasis on microbial zzso and on the identification of three zzso of zzso
