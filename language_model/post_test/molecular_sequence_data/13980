An X-ray crystal structure has been solved of the complex of a zzso zzso with a zzso duplex of sequence zzso The zzso is identical to zzso except for replacement of the first zzso ring by zzso converting a zzso to zzso zzso are zzso with those of the DNA zzso in the absence of zzso Although the zzso for zzso substitution was intended to make that locus on the drug zzso compatible with a zzso base pair, zzso attraction for the two zzso ends of the drug zzso and this zzso binds to the same central zzso site as does the parent zzso But unlike zzso this zzso exhibits zzso disorder in the zzso Both zzso were refined separately to zzso Final residual errors at zzso A resolution for the zzso reflections above 2 zzso in F are R zzso zzso for one orientation zzso with 37 water molecules and zzso for the zzso drug orientation zzso with 40 water zzso This molecular disorder is probably attributable to a weakening of binding to the zzso site zzso by the zzso zzso
