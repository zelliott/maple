zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute a classic example of an zzso zzso zzso and have become an ideal system for addressing questions on zzso zzso and the maintenance of zzso In addition to zzso zzso figs host several types of zzso zzso zzso from a diverse array of zzso zzso with varied natural histories and ecological strategies zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although a few recent studies have addressed the question of zzso between specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso no study has addressed the history of divergence of a zzso zzso community comprised of multiple zzso of zzso associated with a large number of zzso zzso zzso Here, we conduct zzso analyses of zzso DNA sequences zzso using 411 individuals from 69 zzso and zzso zzso zzso species to assess relationships within and between five zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with 17 species of New World zzso figs from section zzso We show that zzso and multiple zzso species per host are ubiquitous across zzso zzso zzso zzso In spite of these findings, zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reveal evidence of zzso among zzso zzso from different ecological zzso Our findings further challenge the classical notion of zzso zzso between figs and their associated zzso and mirror conclusions from detailed molecular studies of other zzso that have revealed common patterns of diffuse zzso and zzso specialization among the zzso
