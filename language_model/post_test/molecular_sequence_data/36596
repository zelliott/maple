zzso zzso consist of zzso zzso that can be divided into at least three zzso zzso screening of a zzso library with zzso zzso identified a gene which is expressed and found only in Group 3 zzso This zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and predicts a deduced protein of 198 zzso acids that is characterized by a zzso zzso zzso can also be grouped by their ability to express certain zzso surface proteins zzso expression of which is restricted among zzso In Southern zzso zzso specific to two zzso were used to characterize zzso Failure to detect zzso genes correlated with inability to express the same zzso Analysis of zzso with these new zzso zzso and confirms the groupings previously suggested using other zzso These genetic differences should allow differentiation of zzso and permit the application of basic zzso techniques to determine the manner of spread and the presence of animal zzso
