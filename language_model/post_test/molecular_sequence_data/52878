To develop transgenic mice harboring zzso in the zzso gene as animal models for zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso dominant disorders characterized by early onset zzso and zzso zzso As a first step in generating a mouse model for zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso of mouse zzso and examined its tissue expression zzso 

Total zzso was isolated from the skeletal zzso of newborn zzso mice and used as a template for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was used for zzso amplification of zzso using three zzso primer pairs designed from the published rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to complete the sequence between the amplified zzso The entire zzso was zzso and the expression pattern of the corresponding transcripts examined by Northern zzso 

A full-length zzso zzso was zzso Analysis showed that the entire translated region of the mouse zzso gene is zzso zzso and the derived zzso acid sequence shows zzso zzso to human zzso Of eight adult mouse zzso zzso tested, zzso expression was detected only in zzso
