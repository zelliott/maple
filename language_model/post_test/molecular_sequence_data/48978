zzso a member of the zzso protein family zzso in familial cold zzso and zzso syndrome, has been recently implicated in zzso However, the mechanism of zzso and regulation of the zzso signaling zzso remains poorly zzso We report here that zzso of zzso with its binding partner, zzso induced both zzso and zzso zzso This signaling was zzso by zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso activates downstream targets as reported for other zzso family zzso zzso zzso the product of the familial Mediterranean fever zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso These results provide evidence for a zzso signaling zzso activated through the induced proximity of zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso
