This paper is the first report on the retention behavior of synthetic zzso and zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The separation mechanism is predominantly an zzso process, but zzso interaction plays a role as zzso The separation is based on the chain length of the zzso Both the addition of organic mobile phase zzso and changes in column temperature affect the retention of zzso zzso A volatile buffer system zzso zzso zzso could be employed to purify zzso and no zzso procedure would be required after the column separation zzso The zzso from the separation are zzso or zzso The maximum loading capacity of an zzso column (35 zzso zzso zzso was found to be more than zzso zzso
