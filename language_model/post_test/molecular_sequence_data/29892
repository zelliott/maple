zzso necrosis factor zzso is one of the few zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B may play a central role in zzso zzso gene regulatory zzso however, the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso B zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we demonstrate with two human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso that zzso zzso rapid and transient zzso and zzso of protein zzso C zzso from the zzso to the zzso which is followed by the emergence of zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso can be linked to induction of zzso zzso B, we tried to block zzso action by use of various protein zzso C zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cells with protein zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso blocked zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso regimen completely inhibited zzso zzso B zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso ability to induce zzso zzso B remained zzso In addition, zzso zzso B was zzso in zzso cells depleted for zzso by long-term exposure to high dose zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso is not required for zzso zzso B zzso by zzso and imply a novel, zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso B zzso
