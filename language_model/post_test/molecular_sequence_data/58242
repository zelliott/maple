The zzso membrane domain of band 3 consists of multiple membrane spanning segments that come together to form a regulated zzso passage for the exchange of zzso In this article we review the structural features of the membrane domain of band zzso zzso microscopic analysis of zzso zzso have confirmed the zzso nature of the protein and has provided the overall shape of the membrane zzso The high degree of sequence identity in the zzso zzso and the finding that these segments are zzso and remain tightly associated after zzso zzso of the connecting zzso suggests that the interactions between zzso zzso are specific and form the foundation for the structure of the membrane zzso zzso of band 3 is not essential for the transport function of the zzso zzso zzso indicates that band 3 can be zzso on multiple zzso and spans the membrane 12 zzso Red cell diseases zzso and zzso that affect the band 3 zzso structure and other properties of the protein are the subject of continued zzso
