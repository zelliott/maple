zzso is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso which is expressed on some activated zzso zzso cells and transformed zzso To facilitate our understanding of biological functions and functional zzso we isolated rat zzso clones zzso the rat zzso of human zzso from a zzso library of a rat zzso line, zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso showed zzso zzso with that of human zzso The deduced rat zzso protein consisted of 493 zzso acids with an zzso of 59 160 and contained a single zzso zzso It lacked the second repeat of the zzso motif in the zzso domain found in human zzso The zzso acid sequence showed zzso and zzso identity with the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso domain, however, the zzso acid sequence was highly zzso in about 100 zzso near the zzso showing zzso identity, whereas the rest of the zzso domain showed zzso zzso This conservation suggests the functional importance of this zzso zzso with the recently reported mouse zzso revealed zzso conservation of the zzso acid sequence and a common structure of the zzso domain which lacks the second zzso zzso Northern blots revealed a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cells and human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso rat zzso lines, whereas smaller transcripts of zzso zzso were found in the zzso A rabbit zzso zzso raised against zzso protein of the zzso domain detected bands with an apparent zzso of 80 zzso and zzso 110 zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso in zzso cells activated zzso zzso in a zzso B zzso manner, indicating that zzso signals activate zzso zzso The zzso location of the gene was identified by zzso in zzso zzso at zzso and appeared to zzso to human zzso where human zzso has been zzso The identification and characterization of the rat counterpart of human zzso will facilitate studies of the biological function of this zzso
