We have determined that human zzso zzso can be induced by zzso beta zzso zzso and that the induced zzso levels can be suppressed by zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Harris, zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show, by nuclear zzso and transient gene expression zzso that zzso beta induction is a promoter function and that zzso suppresses zzso zzso gene zzso For transient gene expression zzso zzso zzso pairs of the zzso promoter region zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso and shorter fragments zzso were cloned into a human growth hormone reporter zzso In zzso human zzso cultures all the zzso with the exception of the one containing the shortest promoter zzso zzso to zzso responded to zzso beta zzso Interestingly, the ability of zzso beta to induce human growth hormone expression decreased as the length of the promoter zzso was zzso zzso treatment suppressed the induced human growth hormone levels by approximately 50% irrespective of the promoter zzso These results suggest that the zzso pairs zzso promoter zzso contains DNA elements required for zzso beta induction and zzso zzso
