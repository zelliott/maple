Three rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variable gene zzso were characterized by new zzso specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso and sequence analysis of expressed and zzso zzso Two zzso were functional and designated zzso present in strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso present in zzso and zzso Their products differed by six zzso zzso two of them in zzso region zzso and one in zzso A third zzso zzso zzso was found in strains zzso and zzso Apart from a single zzso zzso it was identical to zzso All 12 rat strains tested showed association of zzso with zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso which may reflect a different gene order of the rat zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso which bind both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are stained by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso show a slight zzso zzso zzso usage of zzso zzso by zzso but not by zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso hybrids and zzso of zzso and increased frequency of zzso zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest structural differences of the two zzso products as the reason for their contrasting zzso subset zzso
