Human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso with wide zzso specificity and low zzso for zzso was only recently characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in this study we report on its primary zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso and three zzso zzso derived from zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso were used for isolation of the first zzso clone zzso the human zzso zzso zzso coding for 440 zzso acid zzso Additional clones were obtained by using the first isolated clone as a zzso The largest clone of zzso zzso coded for zzso zzso acid zzso it was longer at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The identity of the clone was established by DNA sequencing and by comparison with zzso sequences derived from the zzso zzso which constituted approximately zzso of the total primary structure of the zzso zzso The start zzso was never encountered despite a variety of different approaches zzso zzso acid zzso were expected on the basis of zzso zzso determination of the zzso zzso zzso Despite the great zzso similarity between the zzso and E1 zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the primary structure of the zzso zzso has only approximately zzso of zzso identity with that of the E1 zzso zzso comparison with zzso and zzso Identification Resource database sequences indicated no primary structure of zzso zzso more closely resembling the zzso zzso than that of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso
