Three zzso zzso derivatives containing a zzso replacement in the loop regions were chemically zzso and their properties were zzso All three complexes showed a markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso studies suggested that the complex with zzso at the third zzso of the longer internal loop region has the greatest influence on the zzso of the loop zzso
