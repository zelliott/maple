Our studies of zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli have revealed that some zzso acid sequences can interact with zzso interior zzso particularly with gate components of the exit tunnel, thereby interfering with their own translation zzso Such translation arrest can be regulated by interaction of the zzso portion of the nascent zzso with other cellular components outside the zzso These properties of nascent proteins can in turn provide regulatory mechanisms by which the expression of genetic information at different levels is zzso
