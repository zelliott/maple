zzso zzso the zzso zzso pump protein from zzso zzso was zzso labeled with zzso The incorporation yield was zzso The magic angle sample spinning zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso spectrum of this sample revealed six different zzso superimposed on a broad band of naturally abundant zzso zzso Two of the six zzso signals can be attributed to zzso zzso zzso groups, one of which might be zzso An additional resonance at 110 zzso can be associated with the zzso carbon of zzso indicating an unusual zzso zzso of this zzso acid in zzso zzso Similar zzso performed on zzso purple membrane which lacks the zzso tail display two new intense signals at 178 and zzso zzso If the same spectrum is taken without zzso these signals do not decrease or zzso On the basis of their zzso and their chemical shifts, one can assign in addition to the zzso zzso four zzso zzso facing the zzso zzso In native zzso at least two of these form a zzso bond which also might include the zzso zzso These experiments not only provide data about the chemical environment of the zzso zzso within the zzso core of zzso but also yield information about the interactions between surface zzso
