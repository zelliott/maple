The zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids constitute a family of related zzso All contain a bacterial zzso element downstream of the zzso zzso zzso Whereas 43 zzso with zzso zzso plasmids carry only one zzso zzso strain zzso carries a second copy zzso zzso zzso to the right of zzso and part of the same zzso zzso Two other zzso strains carry an zzso copy on their zzso zzso A study of the unmodified zzso sites of zzso and zzso cloned from closely related zzso enabled us to zzso the zzso zzso zzso has a size of zzso zzso and is terminated by zzso zzso It contains a large open reading frame without a stop zzso However, a stop zzso is generated by zzso into the target sequence zzso zzso is related to five other zzso sequence zzso For two of these, the stop zzso of the largest open reading frame is also created by zzso into a zzso target zzso
