We have previously described an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso bovine zzso zzso that displays zzso zzso channel activity in zzso zzso zzso We now find that the zzso is closely related to zzso assembly protein zzso The zzso and zzso zzso from bovine brain zzso zzso share several structural and functional features: zzso similar zzso zzso each has four major zzso that have similar mobility (Mr values of zzso zzso 50,000, and zzso and relative intensity by zzso zzso zzso similar size as studied by molecular sieve zzso (Mr zzso zzso identical zzso zzso acid sequences for the Mr 50,000 zzso and Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Mr zzso zzso to zzso zzso affinity zzso against the zzso proteins of the zzso zzso display of the in zzso diagnostic feature of assembly zzso they induce the assembly of zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel activity selective for zzso zzso with the same zzso zzso when incorporated into zzso zzso zzso One difference was zzso zzso channels were not blocked by zzso zzso as reported for zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest a possible connection between the zzso signaling pathways and zzso zzso
