The ubiquitous zzso family of proteins is involved in cell zzso or the terminal loss of zzso potential, a model for aging and tumor suppression at the cellular zzso These proteins are defined by the approximately 20 zzso zzso domain that binds a plethora of zzso regulators and zzso factors, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the novel nuclear protein zzso and they are also known components of the zzso complex via interactions with the zzso binding protein zzso We present here the crystal structure of a zzso zzso domain from human zzso whose core consists of two zzso zzso zzso Despite the lack of sequence zzso the core structure has surprisingly striking zzso to a zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies based on the X-ray structure and zzso identified key zzso involved in the binding of zzso and zzso
