zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that binds and activates many different cellular zzso with zzso zzso including the zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso joined by a central zzso each domain contains an zzso hand zzso Four different zzso zzso proteins were used to investigate the role of the two zzso zzso hand pairs in the binding and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso hand pairs in different aspects of zzso zzso function was monitored using three zzso that monitor electron transfer within a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were used to determine the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso when zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso were performed to determine binding zzso of zzso proteins to synthetic zzso zzso domain zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso hand pair of zzso contains important binding and zzso elements for zzso whereas the zzso zzso hand pair in conjunction with the central zzso region is required for zzso zzso binding and zzso The zzso zzso must be zzso with zzso zzso in zzso because of its propensity to zzso when zzso of the highly zzso zzso domain are exposed to an zzso zzso A possible role for zzso zzso in zzso is also zzso
