The mechanisms by which zzso discriminate a vast array of diverse zzso are poorly zzso To gain insight into the organizational strategies underlying this zzso capacity, we have examined the spatial distribution of zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso zzso We have observed zzso distinct patterns of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso cavity is divided into a series of expression zzso The zones exhibit bilateral symmetry in the two zzso cavities and are organized along the zzso and zzso zzso Within each zone, a zzso may select a gene for expression from a zzso gene set via a zzso zzso The observed zzso patterning may serve as an initial organizing step in zzso sensory information zzso
