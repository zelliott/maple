The promoter region of the mouse high affinity zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso and sequences required for expression in zzso cell lines that express high affinity zzso sites were zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells increased both the expression of the zzso zzso gene and reporter genes driven by zzso promoter sequences by zzso zzso analysis revealed that an zzso pair promoter region containing the zzso start site is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this region revealed that a zzso box and the central region of a large zzso zzso are the crucial zzso elements required for zzso zzso The zzso box is bound by at least one factor that is induced upon zzso treatment of zzso zzso The zzso effect was found to be both selective and cell zzso zzso expression in the zzso cell lines required a distinct set of zzso including an zzso zzso and a sequence resembling an zzso zzso however, a more zzso zzso sequence was found to repress zzso activity in zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso gene regulation involves both positive and negative regulatory elements located in the zzso region and that zzso gene zzso involves the coordinate zzso or induction of several factors, including a zzso box binding zzso
