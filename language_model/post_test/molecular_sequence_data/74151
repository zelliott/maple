The zzso zzso protein 1) family is a class of zzso proteins represented by zzso zzso zzso and the recently identified zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the nervous system and thought to mediate interactions of the zzso zzso in neural development and zzso The characteristic structural organization of zzso zzso which are composed of zzso and zzso zzso requires zzso zzso of a precursor zzso zzso by the corresponding zzso zzso zzso function in zzso appears to be fulfilled by a single zzso zzso Although the zzso gene product is known to share several important functional properties with zzso zzso whether it adopts the same basic structural organization has not been zzso Here, we report the identification of a zzso zzso light chain, zzso produced by zzso zzso of a zzso precursor zzso and confirm zzso and zzso of the heavy chain and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the in zzso properties of zzso proteins were further defined through precise zzso identification of a zzso zzso zzso site within the zzso zzso precursor and demonstration of zzso diversity represented by multiple zzso zzso Taken together, these findings establish conservation of zzso processing and structural organization among zzso and zzso zzso proteins and are expected to enhance genetic analysis of zzso zzso functions within the zzso zzso
