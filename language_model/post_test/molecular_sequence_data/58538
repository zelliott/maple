zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso in susceptible zzso zzso mapping studies have indicated that sequences responsible for zzso reside within the zzso zzso To address the question of direct envelope protein zzso in the central nervous system zzso we have generated zzso mice expressing the zzso envelope protein in cells of zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso neural zzso cell line zzso was engineered to express the zzso zzso gene as either zzso zzso or zzso alone zzso zzso expression in these cells resulted in complete zzso interference of zzso with zzso zzso leukemia virus clone zzso whereas zzso expression resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso Introduction of these zzso zzso cells into the brains of highly susceptible zzso mice resulted in significant zzso as integral zzso correct components of the zzso Despite high-level envelope protein expression from the zzso cells, no evidence of zzso zzso was zzso To examine whether early virus replication events were necessary for zzso zzso cells expressing whole virus were transplanted into mice in which virus replication in the host was specifically restricted by zzso to zzso zzso Again, significant zzso cell zzso and infectious virus expression failed to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, transplantation of zzso zzso zzso cells in the absence of the zzso restriction resulted in extensive zzso zzso by 2 weeks zzso zzso examination indicated that infection had spread beyond the zzso cells, and in particular to host zzso zzso zzso in these animals was directly correlated with zzso zzso expression in zzso rather than expression from neural zzso zzso These results suggest that the envelope protein of zzso is not itself zzso but that virus infectious events beyond binding and fusion in zzso are necessary for the induction of zzso zzso
