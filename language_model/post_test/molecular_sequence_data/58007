zzso are the most potent zzso zzso so far zzso and are believed to activate virtually all the T zzso bearing the appropriate V beta segment in their zzso zzso zzso In order to determine whether the expression of the identical V beta gene zzso the same pattern of responsiveness to bacterial zzso we have established a panel of 20 zzso human zzso clones expressing the V beta zzso gene in their zzso The V beta usage was defined by zzso using the V beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and confirmed by DNA sequencing of the zzso Although all the clones zzso expressed the same V beta zzso they had disparate patterns of proliferation to challenge with a panel of bacterial zzso This study demonstrates that the mere expression of the same V beta region by T zzso does not grant an indistinguishable responsiveness to bacterial zzso Thus other, as yet zzso zzso components play a key role in the process of zzso zzso induced by bacterial zzso influencing the effects zzso by zzso zzso on human T zzso
