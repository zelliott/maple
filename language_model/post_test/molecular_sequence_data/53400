As defined by zzso analysis, the zzso segments of the zzso plasma membrane zzso contain seven zzso charged zzso acids zzso and zzso and four positively charged zzso acids zzso and zzso To explore the functional role of these zzso zzso zzso at all 11 positions and at zzso located near the zzso end of zzso have been constructed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso at four of the positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no significant effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at five additional positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to zzso of the zzso and zzso at an early stage of zzso and zzso of zzso allowed measurable zzso but nearly abolished zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of greatest interest were zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso which altered the apparent zzso between zzso and zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significantly reduced pumping over a wide range of zzso values and thus appeared to be partially zzso At zzso by contrast, one zzso zzso was almost completely zzso while another zzso pumped zzso at an enhanced rate relative to the rate of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso occupy positions at which zzso acid zzso have been shown to affect transport by zzso zzso Taken together, the results provide growing evidence that zzso in membrane segments 5 and 8 of the zzso contribute to the zzso transport zzso and that the fundamental mechanism of transport has been zzso throughout the zzso
