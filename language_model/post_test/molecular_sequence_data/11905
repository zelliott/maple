The zzso zzso is seen in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso have been cloned and shown to involve two novel zzso zzso (at zzso and zzso (at zzso which produce a zzso zzso transcript as a result of the zzso Recently, zzso has been shown to be zzso with both copies, zzso and zzso located within distinct zzso of zzso We performed a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for both zzso zzso transcripts in a series of 35 SS (29 zzso 6 zzso to assess its usefulness in molecular diagnosis and to evaluate the zzso of molecular zzso Of the 35 cases, 29 zzso showed a specific zzso zzso product, using a consensus primer for zzso and zzso Upon excluding three negative cases that had poor quality zzso the proportion of zzso rose to zzso zzso The 29 positive cases were further studied using zzso specific for either zzso or zzso 19 cases were positive for zzso and 10 for zzso The relationship of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso to zzso or zzso involvement was not statistically zzso In a single zzso unremarkable zzso zzso a slightly larger zzso zzso product was zzso zzso of this novel zzso showed a zzso segment inserted between the usual zzso and zzso fusion points, of which 126 zzso were derived from a more zzso zzso portion of zzso The 3 zzso immediately zzso to the fusion point could not be assigned to either zzso or zzso and may represent an zzso or a cryptic zzso zzso This zzso maintains the reading frame of the zzso product and encodes a predicted protein larger by 43 zzso zzso which nevertheless replaces the region zzso to the zzso repression domain zzso box, recently recognized in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso with all but the 3' end of the zzso zzso Thus, a diagnosis of SS may be confirmed in zzso zzso of cases using zzso detection of the zzso transcript resulting from the zzso and the zzso of molecular zzso appears zzso
