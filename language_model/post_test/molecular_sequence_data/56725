A method using zzso amplification and primer extension with fluorescent zzso was developed to analyze zzso zzso The sizes of the zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta chains were measured for all possible V zzso beta zzso This analysis shows that beta chains are distributed into at least 2000 groups, a value that provides a lower limit to their zzso The zzso sizes appear to be dependent on the J beta and especially the V beta segment used and zzso with zzso acid sequence motifs in the corresponding zzso zzso This feature of zzso receptors is zzso
