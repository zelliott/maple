zzso in inflammatory zzso diseases of the central nervous system zzso were studied using actively induced experimental zzso zzso zzso in mice as a model zzso Clinical disease scores correlated in time and in intensity with pathology parameters such as zzso in the zzso fluid zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso analysis was employed to measure zzso A and B in the zzso from individual zzso According to their apparent molecular weight zzso zzso A and B appeared with a zzso of 65 and 95 zzso zzso The 65 zzso form was present in all samples, even in those derived from zzso animals, whereas the 95 zzso form was present only in samples from animals developing zzso The levels of 95 and 65 zzso zzso correlated with the zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso basic protein zzso with zzso B and analysis of the zzso products by protein sequence analysis zzso two zzso sites in zzso regions of zzso zzso production within the zzso may constitute an important zzso mechanism for both the disruption of the zzso barrier and the destruction of zzso as observed in several zzso zzso
