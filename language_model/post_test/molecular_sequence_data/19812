zzso the evolutionary origin of the zzso zzso A zzso is of great interest because the zzso is the sole zzso zzso family known to zzso Although zzso zzso have a diverse array of zzso and zzso functions, the original function of the zzso at its birth is zzso Such information may be obtained by studying zzso lineages of the zzso zzso and is necessary for discerning how and why this zzso zzso Here, we clone and characterize 3 zzso genes from the zzso the most zzso zzso examined for zzso We report 1) that all the 3 zzso zzso are zzso active, with one of them having an zzso activity comparable to that of bovine zzso A, the zzso of the zzso 2) that 2 zzso zzso have prominent expressions in adult liver and gut, whereas the 3rd is expressed in adult eye and zzso and 3) that all 3 zzso have zzso activities in zzso These results, together with the presence of zzso and/or zzso activities in multiple zzso related zzso zzso strongly suggest that the zzso started as a zzso mechanism in zzso zzso
