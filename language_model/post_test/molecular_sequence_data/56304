Little is known about the number of mouse protein zzso zzso zzso and their zzso and zzso expression zzso A new procedure based on zzso of amplified zzso zzso detects expression of at least 20 different mouse zzso during zzso The majority of these zzso show zzso regulated expression zzso some display a unique tissue zzso zzso fragments detected in the fingerprint analysis are used here as specific zzso to directly clone two previously unknown zzso expressed zzso and zzso a protein zzso zzso highly expressed in zzso zzso The zzso procedure is also zzso to the analysis of protein zzso zzso and may also be used to study the expression pattern of other zzso zzso
