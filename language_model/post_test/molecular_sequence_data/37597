Human zzso virus zzso zzso can be detected in cervical secretions, zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso individuals with a known exposure to the zzso zzso from zzso exposed zzso individuals zzso neutralize in zzso primary strains of zzso We analyzed the zzso of zzso recognized by serum zzso zzso of zzso individuals to identify the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso subjects, and to verify whether different zzso would be recognized by zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso are detected in zzso of zzso and showed that zzso of primary zzso strains is zzso by the recognition of different zzso in zzso patients and zzso Thus, whereas zzso of zzso individuals recognize zzso expressed both within zzso and zzso zzso of zzso exclusively bind to zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that the zzso recognized by serum zzso of zzso on zzso is restricted to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to coiled zzso pocket in the alpha zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso seen by zzso of zzso patients on zzso is identified by two zzso the first is contained within the zzso loop zzso zzso the second zzso to C terminal region in the extra membrane region of zzso 41 zzso zzso Thus, we have identified and characterized the zzso that mediate zzso of zzso in individuals in whom infection does not occur despite multiple zzso to the zzso These results have important implications for the development of a new therapy against zzso zzso
