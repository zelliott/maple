We isolated zzso from zzso zzso a gene with zzso to various zzso from different bacterial zzso zzso is preceded by genes zzso a two component regulatory zzso Its expression is activated during stationary zzso In minimal medium this zzso is zzso in the presence of zzso The response regulator is preceded by putative promoter consensus sequences recognized by the stationary phase specific zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is in accordance with the initiation of expression at the beginning of stationary zzso zzso of zzso causes no obvious zzso
