XP group C protein zzso and a human zzso of zzso zzso have previously been shown to zzso in a tightly associated zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts in zzso by means of the zzso zzso system, with both zzso and a second zzso of zzso zzso zzso mapping studies have revealed that both zzso zzso interact with zzso at the same highly zzso region in the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso deleted within this domain and that are highly deficient in binding both zzso zzso are also highly defective in zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso mapping studies have also identified a region in the zzso half of zzso that contains the zzso interactive zzso This domain is highly zzso among zzso zzso and zzso
