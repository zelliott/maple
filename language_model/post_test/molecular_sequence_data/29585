The biological mechanisms responsible for aging remain poorly zzso We propose that increases in DNA damage and zzso that occur with age result from a reduced ability to repair DNA zzso To test this hypothesis, we have measured the ability to repair DNA damage in zzso by the base zzso repair zzso zzso in zzso of young zzso and old zzso zzso zzso We find in all zzso tested zzso liver, zzso and zzso the ability to repair damage is significantly reduced zzso zzso with age, and that the reduction in repair capacity seen with age zzso with decreased levels of DNA zzso beta zzso zzso activity, protein and zzso To determine the biological relevance of this age-related decline in zzso we measured spontaneous and chemically induced zzso zzso frequency in young and old zzso In line with previous findings, we observed a zzso increase in spontaneous zzso frequency in aged zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso frequency in response to zzso zzso zzso does not significantly increase in young animals whereas identical exposure in aged animals results in a zzso increase in zzso zzso Because zzso zzso DNA damage processed by the zzso pathway, it is suggested that the increased zzso of zzso with age is related to the decline in zzso capacity that occurs with zzso The inability of the zzso zzso to repair damages that accumulate with age may provide a zzso explanation for the well-established zzso of DNA damage zzso with zzso
