zzso is a zzso semiconductor having strong zzso ability under light zzso zzso the steel target plates modified with zzso zzso have been developed to carry out zzso zzso zzso reactions for online zzso tagging during laser zzso mass zzso zzso zzso Under zzso laser zzso zzso can catalyze the zzso of zzso added to a sample mixture to zzso zzso that can further react with the zzso groups of zzso zzso by Michael addition zzso The tagging process leads to appearance of pairs of zzso with an zzso shift of zzso This online zzso strategy is demonstrated to be sensitive and efficient with a zzso at zzso zzso Using the strategy, the information on zzso content in peptides can be obtained together with zzso mass, therefore constraining the database searching for an advanced identification of zzso proteins from protein zzso The current zzso online tagging method can be important for specific analysis of zzso proteins especially the zzso ones that cannot be completely isolated from other zzso zzso
