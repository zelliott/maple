Three strains of zzso zzso virus, Tip zzso zzso Severe zzso and zzso zzso were compared on the basis of their zzso zzso and coat protein structural zzso Each of the strains could be distinguished on the basis of their reactions on selected test plant species but no differences were observed in the zzso properties of the three zzso zzso zzso weight estimates on zzso suggest the zzso coat protein contains 275 zzso acid zzso and sequence data for zzso of these zzso is zzso The zzso terminal zzso is blocked and has not been zzso The coat proteins of zzso and zzso which cause severe symptoms in infected plants, showed only three sequence differences compared to the zzso or twelve sequence changes between their coat proteins and that of the mild zzso The high sequence zzso zzso between the three zzso strains is similar to that previously reported for two strains of tobacco etch virus and three strains of zzso mosaic zzso zzso zzso between the three strains of zzso and published sequences for the coat proteins of eight distinct zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso
