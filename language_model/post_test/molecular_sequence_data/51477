A dominant zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso of a zzso gene A block promoter zzso In zzso studies indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso We show that the zzso zzso increases the number of zzso competent zzso complexes by affecting a limiting activity in zzso cell extracts that is zzso by excess zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso whose size, zzso and genetic properties are consistent with those of the 70 zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso suggests a means for determining the zzso specificity of a zzso
