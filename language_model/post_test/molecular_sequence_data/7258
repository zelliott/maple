The identification of a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso was isolated as a highly expressed fusion clone from a zzso zzso fusion zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso capable of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso The deduced zzso sequence displays a zzso overall identity to that of zzso from zzso zzso Gene disruption studies indicate that zzso exists as a single copy in the zzso zzso and is essential for growth on zzso Northern zzso analysis of the zzso transcript and measurement of the zzso zzso activities show, in contrast to other known zzso zzso a zzso expression of zzso zzso
