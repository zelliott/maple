zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso which zzso conversion of zzso to oxygen and hydrogen zzso in zzso zzso Here, we cloned and zzso the full-length zzso and zzso DNA of two zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To define whether zzso is a zzso or a zzso zzso a zzso analysis was zzso The zzso structure of both zzso genes was determined with the promoter region zzso In order to investigate their potential role in response to environmental pollutants, zzso zzso were treated with heavy metal zzso zzso and zzso 0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 zzso zzso and industrial chemicals zzso zzso and zzso 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 zzso zzso for 96 zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso level was measured with quantitative real-time zzso along with total zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso possessed evolutionary zzso zzso that are required for metal binding and zzso signature zzso The zzso analysis revealed that zzso was closely clustered to zzso zzso of another zzso zzso zzso zzso gene had four zzso and three zzso while the zzso gene consisted of two zzso interrupted by one zzso In the zzso region of zzso and zzso we observed several zzso regulatory elements such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the response to heavy metals, zzso zzso and zzso both zzso and zzso transcript levels along with zzso levels were significantly increased at high zzso zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso group, the expression of zzso zzso was regulated more sensitively than the zzso zzso level, indicating that the chemical zzso would be not correlated with the form of zzso zzso treatment showed a significant increase in the expression of both zzso zzso level and zzso level from 5 zzso zzso zzso while zzso decreased its expression at high zzso (10 zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso increased both zzso zzso level at 1 zzso zzso zzso and then inhibited its expression from 5 zzso zzso concentration to a lower level than the zzso This finding suggests that zzso and zzso would be an zzso gene upon exposure to heavy metals and zzso and could be used as a potential zzso for the risk assessment of these environmental zzso This is the first report to zzso response of zzso to environmental pollutants in zzso zzso this study would give a clue to better understand the mode of action of zzso genes and zzso under zzso stress in marine zzso
