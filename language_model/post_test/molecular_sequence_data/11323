zzso of the leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso gene results in disrupted zzso architecture, zzso bone development, and losses of functional zzso We here report the identification of an zzso in a functional human zzso gene promoter and alternative promoter usage by this zzso A single zzso start site was identified in zzso zzso cells and a zzso clone containing zzso upstream sequences was found to have promoter activity in zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell, Northern zzso using a probe of the first zzso detected in zzso cells failed to detect zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso revealed an alternative first zzso and a zzso pair zzso zzso region possessed promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso For the zzso promoter active in zzso cells, a minimal promoter was localized within zzso zzso Three regions increased and one inhibited promoter zzso zzso of an zzso region zzso to zzso zzso into zzso promoter either upstream or downstream in either orientation to the zzso reporter resulted in zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the characteristics of an zzso zzso into nine cell lines of different tissue origin indicated that the cloned promoter and zzso in the zzso zzso was zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso zzso to zzso zzso was further localized as the minimal zzso region, in which deletion of either element A zzso to zzso zzso or element B zzso to zzso zzso resulted in the loss of zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed that these two elements bind to specific nuclear proteins zzso In the middle region between element A and B, disruption of zzso integrity also led to a loss of zzso activity, although two zzso and three zzso binding sites did not contribute to zzso zzso These results demonstrate a complex regulation of the human zzso zzso including alternative promoter usage and zzso elements at the zzso zzso
