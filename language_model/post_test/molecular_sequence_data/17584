zzso rat zzso zzso zzso bonds were analyzed employing various zzso zzso The zzso zzso of rat zzso L and zzso were compared and the results are discussed in relation to differences in zzso acid zzso around their binding zzso The specificity of zzso zzso which is characterized by a remarkable preference for zzso zzso acids at the zzso site of the zzso zzso bonds, was analogous to that of zzso as a zzso This analogous specificity suggests that the binding sites of the two zzso are zzso as expected from their zzso zzso acid zzso However, there is a slight difference in the preference for zzso site between zzso That is, zzso L showed a greater preference for bulky and zzso zzso acids at the zzso site than did zzso Based on the zzso deduced structure of the binding sites of zzso zzso the preferences for zzso zzso acids at the zzso site and for bulky and zzso zzso acids at the zzso site of the zzso are supposed to be related to the zzso zzso acid zzso at the zzso site zzso and zzso and the reduction in size at the zzso site zzso and zzso zzso The discussion of the effect of the zzso acid zzso on the zzso activities of zzso L and zzso in this paper provides a basis for more advanced studies of the relationship between structure and function of zzso belonging to the zzso zzso by means of protein zzso
