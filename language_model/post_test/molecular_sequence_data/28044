Human factor VIII zzso as a series of active zzso composed of a light chain zzso zzso linked by zzso metal zzso to a variable sized heavy chain zzso zzso zzso factor VIII zzso were modified with zzso zzso zzso selection was based upon the limited number of free zzso zzso in each zzso zzso of probe incorporation suggested the presence of a single zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso sequence analysis of fluorescent zzso peptides derived from the modified zzso indicated zzso attachment sites at zzso of the heavy chain zzso zzso and zzso of the light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso energy transfer using light chain modified with zzso zzso zzso zzso and heavy chain modified with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paralleled the formation of factor VIII zzso activity, and both effects were zzso with respect to added heavy zzso Based upon the degree of donor zzso a distance of 20 A was calculated separating the two zzso These results indicate a close spatial relationship between the zzso domain of heavy chain and the A3 domain of light chain in the factor VIII zzso
