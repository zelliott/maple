A zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso was zzso for use in examining zzso of its zzso and zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso and evaluated for zzso of rat brain zzso L zzso zzso and zzso zzso or binding to rat brain zzso receptors using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in competitive binding zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso or zzso were zzso active as zzso but were enhanced zzso to zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso yielding Ki 3 zzso and 26 zzso for zzso L and zzso zzso zzso itself was zzso but expressed zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was found with zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso for zzso whereas an zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso less potent than the zzso zzso zzso peptides containing zzso were zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso but were zzso to zzso more potent as zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso itself zzso zzso Two zzso with zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso These data demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso peptides as zzso for exploring zzso zzso and the potential for targeting zzso to zzso or zzso compartments via zzso zzso in zzso
