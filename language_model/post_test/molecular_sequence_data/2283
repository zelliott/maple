zzso basic protein zzso T cell clones were used to study human T cell recognition sites on the zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with a panel of zzso zzso of known zzso acid sequence and with large zzso fragments of human and guinea pig zzso demonstrated ten different patterns of zzso The data provide evidence for at least four different human T cell zzso within the zzso half of the zzso zzso three within the zzso half, and three located within the central portion of the zzso The results indicate that attempts to inhibit zzso responses in zzso in an zzso manner will require the suppression of multiple T cell zzso
