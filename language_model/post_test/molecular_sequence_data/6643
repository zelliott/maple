zzso zzso coli are known to zzso several types of toxins including zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso production was studied in zzso zzso coli zzso Using a quantitative zzso zzso zzso the amount of toxin present in the culture zzso zzso of various zzso coli strains was zzso Variation in the production of zzso toxin was observed for the zzso zzso For zzso coli strain zzso grown in zzso soy zzso the toxin was produced after 4 h of growth and was zzso after about 57 h of zzso The amount of toxin in the culture zzso fraction increased zzso with bacterial zzso Using the rat loop zzso the biological activity of zzso was retained even after the zzso phase of growth when zzso production zzso off zzso from 24 to 74 zzso zzso production by zzso coli strain zzso varied with the culture medium zzso In particular, addition of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso to Davis minimal medium decreased zzso production, whereas addition of zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reversed the repressive effect of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso production was shown to be subject to zzso zzso
