The regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso putative zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso was examined by a variety of methods, suggesting that their expression is regulated at both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of all three zzso measured by quantitative reverse zzso zzso were shown to be most abundant during growth on methanol with zzso zzso zzso levels were also high in media with CO or zzso but much lower with zzso In contrast, zzso zzso to zzso showed high expression levels on CO or methanol with zzso while the zzso zzso fusion showed highest reporter gene activity on zzso with much lower expression on CO or methanol with zzso The activity of zzso and zzso zzso was very low when the strains were grown in methanol or zzso zzso of the zzso fusion was not detected on any zzso despite the presence of an zzso zzso The zzso start sites of all three genes were determined by zzso revealing large leader sequences for each zzso zzso of deletion zzso lacking putative regulatory genes suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso act as zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
