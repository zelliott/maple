zzso is expressed as a zzso and is activated by zzso zzso upon the transmission of zzso zzso Despite extensive structural and zzso zzso many questions regarding the mechanism of zzso zzso remain zzso zzso is zzso during zzso in zzso coli, even in the absence of zzso zzso indicating that zzso has intrinsic zzso zzso When zzso of zzso with altered zzso zzso were prepared, a zzso with six inserted zzso acids showed meaningful zzso activity which was inhibited by zzso The kinetic zzso of the zzso zzso were determined and its three-dimensional structure was solved with and without bound zzso The zzso zzso bound to the inhibitor revealed an zzso One zzso formed a complete active site bound to the inhibitor in collaboration with the zzso loop from the other zzso whereas the other zzso had an incomplete active site despite the bound zzso zzso the two zzso zzso in zzso zzso served as inherent zzso and zzso zzso forming one complete active zzso These data represent the first three-dimensional structure of a zzso zzso bound to a specific zzso zzso and provide insight into the folding mechanism during zzso zzso and the zzso activity level of zzso
