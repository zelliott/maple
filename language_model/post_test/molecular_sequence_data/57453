The full-length zzso sequence of a barley zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso found to increase rapidly in amount during infection attempts by the powdery zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso ex zzso is zzso The zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso which, by sequence comparison, was identified as a member of the 90 zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso The zzso protein most resembles the zzso zzso zzso resident zzso zzso the 94 zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso as it possesses both the characteristic zzso domain including a signal zzso sequence and the zzso zzso retention signal zzso A transcript zzso at high stringency accumulated rapidly in leaves upon heat shock zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis indicated the presence of a family of related genes in the barley zzso
