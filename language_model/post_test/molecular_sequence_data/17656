Based on the hypothetical zzso structure of zzso Y zzso zzso zzso a 17 zzso acid zzso has been zzso replacing the sequence zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso This zzso weight deletion analogue showed nearly comparable zzso affinity to zzso In order to zzso the structural requirements for zzso recognition each zzso acid of zzso was exchanged by its zzso zzso and zzso In addition distinct zzso acids were replaced by closely related zzso Multiple zzso synthesis was applied using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on rabbit kidney membrane zzso The results of structure affinity studies suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso
