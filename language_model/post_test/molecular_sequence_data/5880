Cellular zzso protein zzso is abundant in the retinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells of the zzso where it forms complexes with zzso zzso We examined the distribution of zzso in zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A protein was detected by zzso analysis in extracts of bovine and rat brain and zzso nerve but not in several other zzso This protein had zzso zzso and zzso properties identical to those of zzso from bovine zzso zzso of the masses of zzso peptides and of partial zzso acid sequences derived from brain and retinal zzso indicated that the two proteins are probably zzso zzso zzso and double labeling zzso revealed zzso cells in brain that resembled zzso and not zzso zzso cells, or zzso In zzso rat brain, approximately zzso of the zzso cells were labeled with the Rip zzso a marker for zzso In developing rat zzso zzso the zzso appearance of zzso cells corresponded to that of zzso and not that of zzso In adult rat and mouse zzso nerves, the zzso zzso showed the same distribution as zzso No zzso zzso were associated with zzso isolated from zzso adult bovine zzso The results suggest that zzso has functions in addition to zzso metabolism and visual zzso zzso
