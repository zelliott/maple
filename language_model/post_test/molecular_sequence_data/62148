A strategy devised to isolate a gene coding for a zzso zzso from zzso zzso DNA delivered only clones harboring instead a gene (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso which displays considerable zzso zzso activity (about zzso of the activity detected with zzso in the zzso form as a zzso zzso appears to account for the synthesis of zzso in this zzso since a classical zzso zzso gene could not be found in the recently determined zzso zzso sequence zzso Henne, personal zzso The derived zzso acid sequence displays most of the highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso has no zzso zzso activity, in contrast to zzso coli zzso zzso and thus appears more similar to zzso zzso zzso which do not contain a zzso prosthetic zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso may be responsible for the synthesis of zzso in other bacteria, as well as zzso that have been reported to lack a classical zzso zzso but for which possible zzso have not yet been zzso
