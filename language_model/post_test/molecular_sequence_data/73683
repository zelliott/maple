A zzso zzso target sequence in the zzso variable region of the zzso zzso has been elaborated and was used to develop a zzso zzso The specificity of this probe, named zzso zzso was used to identify all known type strains and distinguish them from other zzso All of the 30 type strains of zzso which are available at the German culture collection Deutsche zzso von zzso und zzso 6 commercially available production zzso and 34 closely related relevant strains (as negative zzso were zzso All tested zzso showed distinct positive signals by colony zzso whereas all negative controls showed no distinct dots except zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which gave slight zzso Furthermore, we established a method for isolation and identification of zzso from food by using a zzso zzso without prior isolation of DNA but breaking the cells with zzso zzso By this method, all zzso strains lead to a DNA product of the expected zzso We also established a quick zzso to zzso measure zzso counts in food and feces by dilution zzso and colony zzso We were able to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of sour milk containing zzso zzso with the specific zzso zzso With these two methods, zzso colony zzso and zzso zzso it is now possible to readily and accurately detect any zzso in food and zzso samples and to discriminate between them and members of other zzso
