zzso variation within zzso of zzso can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of routine diagnosis by zzso zzso The focus of this particular study was to initiate a genetic characterization of zzso type 9 zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains isolated in Canada from 1991 to zzso All zzso strains were initially identified by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso during conventional zzso using the zzso zzso pools and by assessing zzso zzso using zzso zzso Both E9 zzso and zzso zzso were further characterized by sequencing zzso generated from the zzso zzso zzso region of these particular zzso zzso from the provinces of Ontario and New Brunswick were shown to include a number of zzso distinct strains and all the zzso strains were significantly different from zzso E9 zzso when zzso sequences were zzso A similar genetic analysis of two completely zzso zzso from Quebec showed that these viruses seemed to belong to a genetic cluster of zzso that included zzso A16 and zzso 71 zzso The use of genetic typing by sequence analysis provides a molecular tool for determining the zzso diversity of zzso and zzso zzso and their possible zzso to other zzso zzso
