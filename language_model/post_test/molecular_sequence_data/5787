zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso step of zzso tissue zzso The human zzso gene is composed of nine zzso zzso the zzso form and a zzso coding zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that human zzso express a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of a short zzso zzso zzso untranslated region zzso A single zzso of zzso 70 zzso was detected in zzso H mapping zzso Two zzso of 70 and 170 zzso respectively were obtained by rapid amplification of zzso ends and zzso library zzso zzso protection experiments, with zzso derived from the two products, showed that human zzso zzso zzso contains only the 70 zzso zzso zzso extension analysis mapped the zzso start site 74 zzso upstream of the start zzso In zzso a human cell line expressing zzso the presence of the short or the long zzso is mutually zzso The short and long zzso zzso were located zzso and zzso 13 zzso respectively upstream of the first coding zzso Various portions of the zzso region upstream of the short product zzso were linked to the zzso gene and zzso into cells that express zzso zzso cells and rat zzso and do not express zzso zzso zzso High zzso activity was found for zzso containing the sequence between zzso zzso and zzso but not for shorter zzso An analysis of 14 zzso of zzso sequence revealed the presence of five zzso I hypersensitive sites associated with active gene zzso Three of the sites are located in the vicinity of the zzso start site and could be linked to the minimal promoter zzso Two of the sites are located downstream of the zzso containing the start zzso suggesting the presence of zzso regulatory zzso
