The synthesis of the zzso relaxed circular DNA zzso requires two template zzso primer zzso and zzso during zzso DNA zzso zzso sequences serve as donor and zzso templates for these template zzso with direct repeat 1 zzso and zzso for primer zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso These donor and zzso sequences are at, or near, the ends of the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso DNA synthesis of duck zzso B virus zzso has indicated that there are at least three other zzso sequences that make contributions during the synthesis of relaxed circular zzso These zzso zzso M, and zzso are located near the zzso end, the middle, and the 3' end of zzso DNA, zzso The mechanism by which these sequences contribute to the synthesis of zzso DNA was zzso Our aim was to better understand the mechanism by which zzso and M zzso We localized the zzso zzso element to a short sequence of approximately 30 zzso that is 100 zzso 3' of zzso on zzso zzso We found that the new zzso zzso were partially defective for primer zzso at zzso They were also invariably defective for zzso In addition, examination of several new zzso M zzso indicated that they too were defective for primer zzso and zzso Thus, this analysis indicated that zzso and M play roles in both primer zzso and zzso In conjunction with earlier findings that zzso functions in both template zzso our findings indicate that the processes of primer zzso and zzso share a common underlying zzso
