zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that binds neutral carbohydrates on zzso forms complexes with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and triggers the complement zzso zzso through zzso of zzso To identify the zzso binding zzso of human zzso point zzso targeting zzso zzso to the hinge region were produced and tested for their interaction with the zzso and zzso using surface zzso resonance and functional zzso zzso zzso abolished interaction with the zzso and zzso and prevented formation of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished binding to zzso and zzso and strongly inhibited interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished interaction with zzso and zzso but only weakened interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited interaction with zzso and decreased the ability of zzso to trigger the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no interaction with the zzso or zzso likely resulting from a zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso had no impact on the interaction with the zzso and zzso nor on the ability of zzso to trigger the zzso zzso zzso zzso only had a slight effect on the interaction with zzso and zzso whereas zzso at zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In conclusion, the zzso binding site of zzso involves a sequence stretch centered on zzso zzso which may form an zzso bond representing the major component of the zzso zzso The binding sites for zzso and zzso have common features but are not strictly zzso
