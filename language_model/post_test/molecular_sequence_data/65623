The zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate specific zzso is the current marker for prostate cancer zzso Other members of the zzso family are also emerging as potential adjunct zzso for this zzso Our aim was to identify and characterize novel zzso genes with potential as zzso zzso 

Low stringency DNA screening was coupled with amplification techniques to identify novel zzso zzso were examined by Northern zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analysis and in zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization was performed by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso Gene regulation studies were performed by quantitative zzso and promoter reporter zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso designated zzso zzso expressed in prostate 1) which, together with the recently reported zzso and zzso zzso is transcribed from zzso a gene evolved from, and located zzso the zzso zzso zzso in contrast to these other zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso generates an approximately 18 zzso zzso zzso first zzso zzso identified from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is abundant only in normal prostate and is restricted to cells of zzso origin in normal and diseased zzso zzso binding of the zzso zzso increases zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are lower in zzso samples compared to benign zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso is reduced as cells zzso on the zzso to zzso zzso has potential as a marker of both zzso progression and recent evolutionary events within the zzso zzso
