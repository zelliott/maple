The first structure for a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been determined using zzso methods and some of its zzso properties zzso zzso is a 100 zzso zzso zzso protein that both size exclusion zzso and zzso zzso show to be a zzso in zzso The structure of the protein consists of a bundle of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso held together by a largely zzso group of zzso zzso acid side zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso values are similar zzso the sequence indicating that the zzso of the five zzso are in a single zzso zzso The zzso stability of zzso characterized by circular zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso unfolds upon heating with an estimated melting temperature of zzso zzso While the biological function of zzso is still unknown, the presence of zzso proteins predominantly in zzso and zzso bacterial species suggests that zzso may have a biological function unique to these bacteria, and consequently, may prove to be an attractive drug target to combat zzso
