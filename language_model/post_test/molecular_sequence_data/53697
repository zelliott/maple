The zzso zzso is commonly found in the zzso zzso of zzso bacteria and zzso While there is a good correlation between the occurrence of zzso and photosynthesis, a number of exceptions are zzso Most recently, zzso was discovered in the zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso This discovery raised the questions of the zzso origin of genes essential for the zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso and of a function of zzso in root zzso zzso To begin to answer these questions, we isolated and zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso This gene and two other genes located directly 3' of zzso are highly similar to the zzso zzso and zzso genes known to be essential for zzso zzso in the zzso purple zzso zzso zzso This observation confirms the close zzso kinship between these two zzso Furthermore, the reduced similarity of zzso to the plant zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not support a previous zzso gene transfer from the plant as a consequence of close zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso disrupted in zzso is capable of inducing functional zzso and does not show an obvious disadvantage under different laboratory culture zzso Thus far, no specific function can be assigned to bacterial zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a rich set of polar membrane lipids some of which, including zzso may become critical only under growth conditions that still need to be zzso
