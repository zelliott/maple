zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso near the zzso City off the northern coast of zzso This strain showed a cell surface zzso higher than 90 zzso moderate zzso zzso resistance, and it zzso 68 % of the total petroleum hydrocarbon content of an artificial seawater medium containing 1 % zzso zzso diesel oil within 15 days at 25 zzso The closest zzso relative of this strain is zzso zzso CBS zzso but it differs from strain zzso by a zzso % divergence (including 18 zzso zzso and 2 zzso in the zzso domain sequence of the large zzso zzso zzso This difference clearly suggests that the strain zzso represents a distinct zzso zzso zzso does not produce zzso on common zzso media and it can therefore be considered an zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso is proposed as a novel species of zzso zzso
