The challenge in the zzso era is to measure sequence variations over large zzso regions in numerous patient zzso This massive amount of work can only be completed if more accurate, zzso and zzso solutions become zzso Here we describe a novel DNA fragmentation approach for single zzso zzso zzso discovery and sequence zzso The zzso zzso is achieved by creating primer extension products, in which zzso zzso zzso bonds replace the zzso zzso bonds of newly incorporated zzso zzso zzso variations are detected by zzso of this zzso bond and zzso analysis of the resulting zzso In this study, we developed a robust protocol for zzso fragmentation and investigated additional ways to improve its sensitivity and zzso We also present the analysis of several human zzso targets ranging from zzso zzso in zzso By using a zzso sample processing zzso we investigated an array of zzso within a zzso segment of the zzso gene in 48 human DNA zzso We identified and measured zzso for the two common zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso by 123 zzso and then confirmed these values in an independent zzso zzso The calculated zzso zzso in white and African American groups differed significantly, yet both fit zzso zzso This demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of zzso DNA fragmentation and subsequent zzso zzso analysis for the zzso discovery and measurement of sequence variations in fragments up to zzso zzso in length in multiple human blood DNA zzso
