The sequences of the zzso zzso gene zzso and the zzso gene zzso were determined from the same zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The patterns of sequence divergence observed at zzso and zzso were very zzso zzso constructed from the zzso data using two different zzso were statistically robust and were zzso with each other and with the relationships between the species previously proposed using other zzso In contrast, the zzso derived from the zzso data were zzso with each other, and with those from the zzso data, and were statistically poorly zzso These results, along with the uniform distribution of zzso sequence zzso between the species at zzso suggest there has been a history of zzso zzso within the zzso gene of the human zzso species which has obscured the zzso relationships between the zzso This view was supported by Sawyer's runs test, and the Index of Association zzso between zzso which provided significant evidence for zzso zzso between the zzso genes from the human zzso species, but no evidence of zzso zzso between the zzso zzso
