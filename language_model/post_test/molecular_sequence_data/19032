Human populations have experienced dramatic growth since the Neolithic zzso Recent studies that zzso a very large number of individuals observed an extreme excess of rare zzso and provided clear evidence of recent rapid growth in effective population size, although estimates have varied greatly among zzso All these studies were based on zzso zzso in which zzso are also impacted by natural zzso In this study, we introduce targeted sequencing data for studying recent human history with minimal zzso by natural zzso We zzso zzso far from genes that meet a wide array of additional criteria such that zzso in these zzso are zzso zzso As population structure also zzso zzso zzso we zzso 500 individuals of relatively homogeneous ancestry by first analyzing the population structure of zzso European zzso We used very high coverage sequencing to reliably call rare zzso and fit an extensive array of models of recent European demographic history to the site frequency zzso The zzso model estimates zzso zzso growth per generation during the last zzso 140 generations, resulting in a population size increase of two orders of zzso This model fits the data very well, largely due to our observation that assumptions of more ancient demography can impact estimates of recent zzso This observation and results also shed light on the zzso in demographic estimates among recent zzso
