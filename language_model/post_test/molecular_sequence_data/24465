An expression library was constructed from an zzso zzso zzso 1 clinical isolate and screened with serum produced in pigs that had been vaccinated with the zzso fraction of a sodium zzso zzso One zzso coli zzso was isolated that produced a large amount of a protein with an zzso mobility of about 67,000 molecular zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso the protein was localized and characterized by restriction zzso zzso and zzso sequence analysis which showed strong zzso with the zzso gene of zzso zzso One open reading frame of zzso bases in length was detected which zzso a zzso protein from zzso 1, with a calculated molecular mass of zzso The DNA zzso the protein was labeled with zzso and the zzso gene was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was the same zzso but the zzso protein from zzso zzso was slightly larger zzso due to 8 zzso in the zzso acid zzso zzso plasmids containing zzso from either zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso Pigs vaccinated with the zzso zzso were protected from challenge with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
