zzso genes share high zzso among each other, code for small zzso zzso and are expressed in a restricted region of zzso zzso surrounding the zzso We show here that not only zzso but also zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso and that the relative contribution of zzso zzso and zzso to total zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of putative promoter fragments ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso related to the zzso and zzso families in the zzso parts of the zzso The zzso parts show high zzso that extended over zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso between zzso and the other two zzso The most conspicuous potential zzso element is a fully zzso tandem repeat of the sequence zzso close to the respective open reading frames zzso By the analysis of transgenic zzso plants carrying zzso zzso it was shown that all three cloned upstream fragments contain functional zzso that the spatial activity of all three zzso promoters is zzso and that the zzso zzso responsible for the expression in the zzso surrounding region reside in the 265 zzso upstream of the respective zzso
