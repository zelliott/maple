zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to detect the corresponding organisms zzso zzso of zzso with seven other zzso species and six unrelated bacterial species commonly found in humans was zzso Positive control zzso directed against human zzso DNA could be mixed with the zzso zzso without loss of specificity or zzso A detection level of 10 zzso of either zzso species could be readily zzso even in the presence of zzso human zzso The triplex zzso method developed is very simple and does not require zzso or the use of zzso and allows detection and differentiation of these zzso against the background of human DNA found in clinical zzso
