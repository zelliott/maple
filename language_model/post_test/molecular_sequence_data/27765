We report here the complete zzso zzso sequence for the Atlantic salmon zzso gene zzso including 600 zzso of zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso zzso zzso is significantly longer than that of the zzso zzso mainly because of larger zzso sizes, but also because the zzso gene contains an additional zzso zzso zzso The coding regions of the zzso gene have been compared to the corresponding regions from rainbow trout zzso and zzso zzso salmon zzso and zzso salmon zzso With the exception of the rainbow trout zzso zzso all results were in agreement with current zzso of the four zzso The results of a similar comparison with the zzso leader and trailer regions were also consistent with current zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start point have been compared to the corresponding regions from rainbow trout and zzso zzso gene zzso upstream zzso The results showed that the upstream sequences in the two fish species were very similar, while short stretches similar to zzso upstream sequences in the zzso genes were also zzso Some of these zzso sequences are known to be involved in the specificity of expression of the zzso zzso
