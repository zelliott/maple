zzso of cells with zzso of zzso such as zzso and zzso leads to the degradation of zzso and zzso proteins and zzso of zzso to the zzso We now demonstrate that, besides the physical zzso of inactive zzso to the zzso the zzso activity of zzso is regulated through zzso of zzso zzso by protein zzso A zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is maintained in an inactive state through association with zzso or zzso in an zzso zzso zzso that cause the degradation of zzso result in zzso of zzso in a zzso manner and the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso this zzso represents a novel mechanism for the zzso zzso of zzso and the regulation of zzso zzso
