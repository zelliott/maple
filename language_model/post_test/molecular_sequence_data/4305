Enteric pathogens harbor a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso oxygen species which are encountered during zzso To analyze the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso we cloned the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and subsequently constructed an zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed an open reading frame that enabled the deduction of a sequence of zzso zzso acids with zzso identity to zzso of zzso zzso In a mouse infection model, the zzso zzso zzso was strongly attenuated in comparison to its parental zzso After intravenous infection, the survival and zzso of the zzso in the zzso and liver were markedly zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso had only minor effects on survival and zzso in the gut and zzso patches, as could be demonstrated in the zzso infection zzso The reduction in zzso was accompanied by a low but significant increase of zzso of the soda zzso to bacterial killing by zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of the zzso zzso response of zzso These results suggest that the resistance of zzso zzso to zzso oxygen zzso produced by zzso involves the zzso zzso The important role of zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso could also be due to zzso of zzso metabolically produced oxygen zzso which are encountered by zzso enteric pathogens during the invasion of the zzso
