zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso generated from zzso acid that are distinct in structure, formation, and function from the many other zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso have now emerged as founding members of the first class of zzso zzso involved in the resolution of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso ATL, and their zzso stable zzso elicit cellular responses and regulate zzso trafficking in zzso by zzso the specific zzso zzso zzso was the first zzso cloned and identified as a G zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso with demonstrated cell zzso signaling zzso zzso at the level of DNA has sequence zzso to the zzso zzso and as an orphan zzso was initially referred to as the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is the zzso potent zzso for zzso zzso a number of peptides can also activate this zzso to stimulate calcium zzso and zzso in zzso In contrast with zzso the counterparts of many of these peptides in zzso remain to be zzso The purpose of this review is to highlight the molecular characterization of the zzso zzso and provide an overview of the zzso axis responsible for zzso and zzso signals in zzso The information in this review provides further support for the initial nomenclature proposition for this zzso as zzso
