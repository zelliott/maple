zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso for zzso coli zzso zzso that restrict early zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the linear zzso zzso These two zzso serve equally well as zzso zzso in zzso but their in zzso efficiencies and sensitivity to salt and zzso zzso differ zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso and zzso zzso differ at only two sites in the region normally accepted as defining zzso zzso In order to determine which structural features of these two zzso are responsible for their functional differences, a series of hybrid zzso were constructed in which structural features of the two zzso were systematically zzso zzso of hybrid zzso templates revealed that sequences downstream of the termination release sites are responsible for the differences in efficiency of in zzso zzso These sequences also determine the sensitivity of these zzso to elevated salt zzso and to zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the sequences in the region between three and seven zzso downstream of the final zzso release site is sufficient to reduce termination efficiency to that of zzso and point zzso in this region yield zzso with intermediate zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso efficiency in zzso must include elements of the zzso complex other than the structure of the 3' end of the zzso The termination differences between zzso zzso and their hybrid derivatives are overcome in zzso all of these sites become very zzso This finding further supports the hypothesis that protein factors or other cellular features enhance the efficiency and specificity of zzso zzso in zzso
