The zzso are a zzso of zzso zzso that are cell zzso zzso Two families of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found only in the zzso type of zzso zzso They are each present in at least three different zzso with differing spatial and zzso zzso and are specified by two clusters of closely linked genes on human zzso zzso The human zzso zzso coding for the most widely distributed form of the zzso has been found to consist of more than 32 zzso of zzso By using zzso we have determined the zzso zzso The gene is arranged into 17 zzso ranging in size from 46 to 258 zzso zzso 16 is alternatively zzso giving rise to the a and b forms of the zzso This has revealed a remarkable degree of conservation of zzso position with other zzso The zzso zzso organization is more similar to the so-called classical zzso than to the zzso especially in the zzso zzso zzso 1 is the largest in zzso as it is in the zzso in contrast to the classical zzso where zzso 2 is extremely zzso this latter zzso is missing from the zzso
