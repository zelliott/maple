zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso by transferring the zzso zzso from zzso zzso on to zzso in the zzso base, resulting in the formation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is an additional zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Our aim has been to zzso structural features in zzso that govern zzso zzso We have addressed this problem by engineering zzso zzso which contain segments from both the zzso and human zzso Four zzso zzso were engineered zzso of which the zzso zzso zzso in which the first 49 zzso of human zzso were replaced with the corresponding zzso from the zzso zzso zzso exhibited additional specificity for zzso None of the switched zzso forms a part of the zzso or zzso binding region in the available crystal structures of zzso Our data on the zzso zzso zzso provide the first evidence that the zzso approximately 50 zzso zzso although not zzso to the active site in the crystal structure, can in fact zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a reduced zzso for zzso and zzso while its zzso for these zzso bases remains largely zzso Its specific activity for zzso is comparable with zzso but five times more than that for zzso
