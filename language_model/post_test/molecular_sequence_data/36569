The active nuclear form of the zzso B zzso factor complex is composed of two DNA binding zzso zzso B zzso and zzso B zzso both of which share extensive zzso sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso B zzso zzso provides the zzso activity in this complex and serves as an zzso zzso for a zzso inhibitor of zzso B, termed I zzso zzso In contrast, zzso B zzso alone fails to stimulate zzso zzso transcription, and based on prior in zzso studies, is not directly regulated by I zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis for the critical regulatory interaction between zzso B and I zzso zzso a series of human zzso B zzso zzso was identified that functionally zzso DNA zzso I zzso zzso zzso and I zzso zzso nuclear exclusion of this zzso zzso zzso from in zzso expression studies performed with these zzso B zzso zzso revealed the zzso 1) I zzso zzso completely zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso through the human zzso virus type 1 zzso B zzso in human T zzso 2) the binding of I zzso zzso to zzso B zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso B zzso from the nucleus to the zzso 3) selective deletion of the functional nuclear zzso signal present in the zzso zzso domain of zzso B zzso zzso its ability to engage I zzso zzso and 4) the unique zzso of zzso B zzso zzso its own nuclear zzso and contains sequences that are required for I zzso zzso zzso of zzso B zzso DNA binding zzso Together, these findings suggest that the nuclear zzso signal and zzso domain of zzso B zzso constitute a zzso system that is critically involved in the zzso function of I zzso zzso zzso our in zzso studies also demonstrate that I zzso zzso binds directly to zzso B zzso This interaction is functional as it leads to zzso of zzso B zzso from the nucleus to the zzso However, no loss of DNA binding activity is observed, presumably reflecting the unique zzso domain that is distinct from that present in zzso B zzso
