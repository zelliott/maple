zzso of the zzso family play important roles in human zzso signal zzso zzso however, little is known about the function of these proteins in bovine zzso In the present studies, we isolated molecular clones of bovine zzso zzso and the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso from a bovine bone zzso zzso zzso These clones contained complete open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso and 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the bovine zzso acid sequences with those of other species demonstrated a high degree of identity of these proteins across all species, suggesting that these proteins likely play zzso functional roles in bovine zzso signal zzso zzso Comparative Western zzso of these proteins in human and bovine zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was the zzso zzso species and that zzso was the zzso zzso species in bovine zzso zzso Despite the high degree of zzso between human and bovine zzso some of the zzso zzso zzso prepared against human zzso failed to recognize the bovine zzso We also showed by zzso zzso techniques that zzso is localized primarily to the zzso compartment of resting bovine zzso but is zzso to the plasma membrane after stimulation with zzso These findings suggest that zzso does play a role in bovine zzso zzso In addition, these data will be helpful in developing more specific zzso for investigating the role of these proteins in bovine zzso signal zzso pathways and for studying various inflammatory diseases in zzso
