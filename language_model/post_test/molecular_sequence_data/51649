Previous results indicated that zzso small zzso is essential for zzso transformation of zzso cells but zzso for the transformation of cells with a deletion on the short arm of zzso 11 zzso zzso From these results we concluded that zzso cells contain a cellular zzso small zzso factor, which is able to zzso the zzso long control region zzso and to complement zzso large T in zzso Since zzso small zzso and the regulatory 55 zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso have been shown to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso the zzso beta zzso could be the putative zzso zzso zzso In accordance with this hypothesis, we show that the zzso beta zzso is highly expressed in zzso but not in zzso cells and is able to zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso acid resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso small zzso showed a common four zzso acid motif zzso We present evidence that the integrity of this motif is necessary for the zzso ability of zzso small zzso to zzso the zzso zzso
