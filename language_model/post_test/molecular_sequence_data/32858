Two zzso of regulatory zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso named zzso and zzso were identified so far in the sea zzso zzso zzso Out of them, only zzso was zzso in zzso by zzso zzso 2 zzso using zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso itself was sufficient to zzso zzso but zzso was enhanced by the presence of the regulatory zzso zzso Even in the absence of zzso zzso was zzso to a certain extent when it was incubated with zzso This zzso zzso was partially abolished by the known zzso zzso and zzso which suggests the presence of a residual amount of zzso zzso in the preparation of zzso R zzso zzso zzso significantly decreases the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the absence of zzso On the other hand, the sequence of several peptides obtained from the zzso zzso of zzso showed that zzso protein contains the signature sequence common to all zzso family members, within the zzso binding zzso zzso A and zzso Moreover, the degree of identity between the sequences of peptides from zzso as a whole, and those from type II R zzso was zzso but the global identity percentage with type I R zzso was only about zzso so that zzso can be classified as a type II R zzso
