We propose an improved zzso gel for the separation of zzso zzso The separation strategy is based on the incorporation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the gel composition in order to increase zzso interactions between the gel zzso and the membrane zzso Focusing on the most efficient zzso zzso the zzso of the new zzso was evaluated on membrane proteins of the human colon zzso cell zzso zzso analysis was performed using an adapted zzso strategy based on zzso tandem mass zzso As a result of this comparative study, including advanced zzso experiments, more zzso proteins were identified in the new gel zzso zzso zzso than in the classical gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides were identified reaching a GRAVY value up to zzso therefore indicating their probable locations in the zzso Focusing on predicted zzso zzso it can be pointed out that 27 proteins were identified in the zzso gel containing up to 11 zzso zzso in the classical zzso only 5 proteins containing 1 zzso domain were successfully zzso For example, multiple zzso channels and receptors were characterized in the zzso gel such as the zzso channel and the zzso or the zzso receptors whereas they are traditionally detected using specific enrichment techniques such as zzso In total, membrane proteins identified in the classical gel are well documented in the literature, while most of the membrane proteins only identified on the zzso gel have rarely or never been described using a zzso zzso
