The zzso zzso zzso called zzso is a target of zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors induced by the mouse zzso tumor virus zzso These zzso zzso result in the zzso zzso of zzso which is not normally expressed in the adult zzso zzso Previous mapping studies of numerous zzso zzso zzso have failed to reveal any zzso zzso within the gene coding zzso This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso occurs in this system as a consequence of zzso of zzso transcription, rather than from zzso of the gene zzso During an analysis of a new cohort of tumors from the zzso mouse strain, a breast tumor was identified which had a zzso zzso integrated 24 zzso upstream of the zzso stop zzso This zzso zzso generated a fusion transcript which was readily zzso in tumor zzso by zzso The predicted protein product of this fusion transcript is missing 8 zzso of native sequence and contains an additional 8 zzso of cryptic zzso zzso These data document the first exception to the zzso that the zzso coding region is not disrupted by zzso zzso zzso
