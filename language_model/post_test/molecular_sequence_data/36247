The hypothesis that zzso zzso proteins of the zzso family can influence zzso membrane trafficking was tested by expressing five zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and in 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at a zzso zzso These three zzso zzso are defective in the final step in the zzso pathway, the process of zzso The zzso of growth correlated with reduced viability and increased zzso of internal zzso in these zzso when expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partially suppressed the growth zzso of a zzso zzso incubated at a zzso zzso Human zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the lag time associated with adaptation of zzso zzso to zzso zzso These interactions suggest that the zzso may influence specific steps in membrane trafficking associated with cell growth, zzso and plasma membrane zzso
