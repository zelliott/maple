We studied zzso zzso and genetic variation in eight zzso zzso type II zzso zzso patients with electron transfer zzso zzso zzso As measured by zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso flux correlated well with clinical zzso In six patients with severe zzso onset zzso II, zzso of zzso ranged from zzso to zzso of control and of zzso from zzso to zzso of zzso Of two patients with late onset zzso II, one had intermediate residual activities with these zzso and the other normal zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed that three of the six zzso onset zzso II patients had greatly diminished or absent zzso and zzso zzso consistent with a failure to assemble a stable zzso Another zzso onset patient showed normal synthesis of zzso but decreased synthesis of zzso Two zzso onset and two late onset zzso II patients showed normal synthesis of both zzso Analysis of the zzso coding sequence revealed seven different zzso in the six patients with zzso onset zzso zzso The most common zzso was a zzso for zzso substitution at zzso zzso found in four unrelated patients, while all the other zzso were seen in single zzso No zzso were detected in the two patients with late onset zzso zzso
