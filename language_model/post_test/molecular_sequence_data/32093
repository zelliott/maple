Gene zzso followed by divergence is one of the main sources of zzso zzso The patchwork and zzso models of zzso evolution help us to understand these zzso but their assumptions are relatively zzso We used a network-based approach to determine the influence of zzso constraints on the retention of duplicated zzso 

We detected duplicated genes by looking for zzso sharing zzso zzso and uncovered an increased retention of zzso for zzso catalyzing consecutive zzso as illustrated by the zzso acting in the zzso of zzso As a consequence, zzso networks show a high retention of zzso within functional zzso and we found a preferential zzso zzso of reactions that partially explains this zzso A similar situation was found in zzso interaction networks, but not in interaction networks of zzso proteins or gene zzso regulatory networks, suggesting that the retention of zzso results from the zzso rules governing zzso zzso We confirmed a high retention of zzso between chemically similar zzso as illustrated by zzso zzso The retention of zzso between chemically dissimilar reactions is, however, also greater than expected by zzso Finally, we detected a significant retention of zzso as groups, instead of single zzso 

Our results indicate that in zzso modeling of the origin and evolution of metabolism is improved by the inclusion of specific functional constraints, such as the preferential zzso zzso of zzso We suggest that the zzso and patchwork models are not independent of each other: in fact, the network perspective enables us to reconcile and combine these zzso
