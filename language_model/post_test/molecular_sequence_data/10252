To investigate the functional role of different zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso we have applied a gene targeting approach to create a mouse model lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding studies were combined to zzso the expression of the zzso zzso in various zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso sites were decreased by zzso in liver, zzso in heart, and zzso in cerebral zzso of the zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso Because of the large decrease of zzso in the heart and the loss of the zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso mice, the in zzso blood pressure and in zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso were investigated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings provide strong evidence that the zzso is a zzso of the blood pressure and the zzso zzso responses induced by zzso zzso This was demonstrated by the finding that the mean zzso blood pressure response to zzso was decreased by zzso in zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso rings also were decreased by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso knockout mouse model provides a potentially useful tool to zzso the functional specificity of different zzso zzso to better understand the effects of zzso drugs, and to investigate the multiple mechanisms involved in the control of blood zzso
