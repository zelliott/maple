zzso in the DNA zzso zzso gene are a major cause of clinically zzso zzso diseases, associated with zzso depletion and multiple zzso 

To determine the spectrum of zzso zzso in our Dutch patient zzso to evaluate the zzso of novel zzso and to establish zzso zzso 

The authors identified 64 predominantly zzso zzso in 37 patients from a total of 232 patients, consisting of 23 different zzso The substitution zzso was most frequently observed zzso zzso 23), but was as frequent in childhood cases as in adult zzso Five new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The known dominant chronic progressive external zzso zzso zzso zzso was for the first time associated with premature zzso failure as zzso In 19 patients the authors identified only a single zzso zzso or a sequence zzso with unclear clinical zzso The data substantiate earlier observations that in zzso patients a fatal status zzso and liver failure can be triggered by sodium zzso It is therefore important to exclude zzso zzso before administering this zzso 

The clinical features of the patient are the most important features to select putative zzso zzso carriers and not the presence of zzso deletions or zzso zzso zzso zzso The authors conclude that zzso zzso are an important cause of zzso zzso pathology and that more accurate zzso correlations allow a more rapid genetic diagnosis and improved prognosis for zzso zzso
