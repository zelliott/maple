zzso of zzso delta virus zzso zzso occurs in the zzso of infected zzso The replication is zzso by cellular factors containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso activity through a double zzso mechanism and is regulated by delta zzso In this study, zzso zzso experiments were carried out to examine interactions between zzso zzso and proteins present in zzso nuclear zzso Cellular proteins with molecular mass of 23 zzso 36 zzso 38 zzso and 58 zzso zzso bound to full-length zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis on the zzso strand mapped the interacting domain within a zzso zzso but not at the ends of the zzso viral zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso interactions was demonstrated by competition experiments and the specific zzso zzso proteins were zzso through column zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with the zzso zzso demonstrated that the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was relatively stable even in the presence of zzso M zzso zzso analysis including protein zzso identified the zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso domain between zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was involved in the zzso zzso zzso studies further demonstrated an enhancing effect of zzso on the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso In addition, in the presence of zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus where zzso replication zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the replication of zzso
