A full-length zzso zzso a zzso was cloned from the living fossil plant zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The zzso designated as zzso was zzso zzso long containing an open reading frame of 489 zzso The deduced zzso protein had zzso zzso acid zzso which formed a 17 zzso zzso with a predicted zzso point zzso of zzso zzso had an zzso and a zzso indicative of zzso but no zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso and zzso of zzso shared identity with those of other reported zzso indicating that zzso belonged to zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso was also cloned using zzso walker zzso By comparing zzso DNA with the zzso it was found that there was a zzso zzso in this zzso zzso analysis indicated that it contained six zzso boxes, one zzso box, one zzso box and one zzso in the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that zzso belonged to a single copy gene zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso expressed in stems and zzso The increased expression of zzso was detected when zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso acid zzso salt stress and drought zzso These results indicate that the zzso has the potential to play a role in response to zzso and environmental stresses that can cause plant zzso
