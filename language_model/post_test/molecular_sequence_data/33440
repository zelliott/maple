zzso potentially contributing to the lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso than in the northeastern United States include tick zzso behavior resulting in fewer human tick zzso lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso ticks in zzso zzso and genetic variation among zzso zzso zzso to which humans are zzso We determined the population structure of zzso zzso in over 200 infected zzso of the primary bridging zzso to humans, zzso zzso collected in zzso County, zzso This was accomplished by sequence typing the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirteen zzso zzso belonging to 12 zzso were found in California, and the two most abundant, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have not been detected in ticks in the zzso The most prevalent zzso and zzso zzso profile in the population, found in about zzso of zzso was a new zzso zzso strain defined by zzso zzso zzso Eight of the most common zzso zzso in the northeastern United States, including zzso I and K that are associated with zzso human infections, were absent in zzso County zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso where western gray zzso the zzso host, are commonly infected with LB zzso The differences in zzso zzso population structure in California ticks compared to the Northeast emphasize the need for a greater understanding of the genetic diversity of zzso infecting California LB zzso
