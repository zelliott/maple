In the plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein belonging to the zzso family of zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso space group zzso in the presence of zinc zzso and the structure was determined to zzso zzso Previously, the zzso structure has been reported in the absence of any bound metal zzso zzso et zzso (2006), zzso 65, zzso The most significant difference between the zzso structure and the structure of zzso described here is a reorganization of the binding site for zinc zzso which was most likely acquired from the zzso zzso This site is located in the zzso metal zzso domain at the putative active site of zzso In addition, an zzso was also bound within coordination distance of the zzso In order to accommodate this zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso is required as well as several nearby zzso within and around the putative active zzso These observations indicate that binding of zinc serves a functional role in this zzso zzso
