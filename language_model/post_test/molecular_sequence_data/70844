To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms and the signals responsible for the adaptation of higher plants to conditions of varying zzso zzso we have isolated from a zzso root library zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the two earliest components of the sulfur zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso transcripts zzso increased in both roots and shoots of zzso grown under zzso conditions, and rapidly decreased when the external zzso supply was zzso This coordinate response, which was not observed under conditions of limiting nitrate or zzso correlated with the depletion of zzso rather than zzso zzso However, drastically reducing zzso levels through treatment with zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso did not provide an adequate stimulus for the zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso but not zzso effectively zzso both transcripts when supplied to zzso zzso under conditions of blocked zzso zzso Altogether, these data provide evidence for the coordinate regulation of sulfur zzso zzso in higher plants and for the zzso involvement of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of the expression of sulfur zzso zzso
