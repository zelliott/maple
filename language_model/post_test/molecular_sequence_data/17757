The secondary structure of seven hormones of the zzso family was predicted by two known prediction zzso with the following averaging of the results for the whole zzso group of zzso It was shown that the mentioned hormones are related to the zzso type of protein zzso The comparative analysis of the zzso family and the zzso growth hormone family has been carried out on different levels of their structural zzso A conclusion is drawn, that despite the significant differences in the primary structures and small differences in the secondary structures, the three-dimensional structure for the zzso molecules and the growth hormone are very similar and repeat in the same way the packing of zzso The study of the relationship of the zzso structure and function has been carried zzso The regions of the zzso acid zzso able to form zzso zzso sites and zzso incorporated into two highly specific spatial groups were zzso The region of the primary structure zzso determining zzso and zzso function of the zzso and forming the zzso in the zzso structure has been zzso The structural zzso of one of the binding sites of zzso and human growth hormone with zzso zzso was zzso An explanation for the absence of zzso activity in all kinds of growth hormones except human ones has been zzso
