In zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that plays several roles in zzso and zzso zzso (from zzso zzso maintains the same zzso organization as does zzso zzso zzso As part of its zzso we constructed a stable zzso zzso which is sensitive to zzso only at 14 degrees C and has a higher frequency of zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is partially rescued by zzso zzso zzso Other zzso associated with zzso are not present in the zzso zzso zzso By fusion to zzso we were able to show the functionality of the zzso zzso domain and found that the fusion protein changes its cellular location during the cell zzso
