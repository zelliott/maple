The surface zzso zzso gene promoter, one of the major zzso B virus zzso zzso directs the synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso and S zzso The zzso promoter does not contain a classical zzso box, and zzso regulation of the zzso gene has not been fully zzso We zzso two regions involved in zzso gene zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso box and a putative zzso zzso We demonstrated sequence specific promoter activity of the putative zzso sequences in the zzso gene promoter zzso to zzso zzso Using end labeled synthetic zzso we observed specific binding of nuclear extracts to the zzso zzso zzso that was significantly reduced using a zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso sequence was shown which was increased in the zzso containing a classical zzso zzso We zzso the proposed zzso zzso sequence of the zzso promoter region zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso element markedly reduced promoter activity as assessed by zzso zzso zzso shift zzso showed specific binding of nuclear extracts to wild type but not to zzso zzso zzso studies with double zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso element established that both elements are active in zzso zzso
