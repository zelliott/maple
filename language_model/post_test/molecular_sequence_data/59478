zzso is a zzso zzso initially isolated from the zzso that is also found in D cells of the stomach and zzso where it exerts an zzso action on a variety of gastrointestinal zzso Since many of concepts important to an understanding of gastrointestinal physiology are derived from experiments in the dog we examined zzso gene expression and zzso processing in the canine zzso zzso and zzso The canine zzso zzso which is highly zzso to other known zzso zzso was used to examine zzso expression in isolated canine zzso zzso zzso expression induced by zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To examine zzso processing in the canine gut we noted that synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso involves zzso zzso of zzso zzso at both paired and single basic zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of recognizing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were characterized and identified zzso of zzso but not zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso equivalent to those of zzso Since previous zzso studies in canine zzso zzso showed that zzso was zzso without the appearance of a zzso zzso we zzso that zzso is zzso zzso at a zzso site to produce zzso followed by zzso zzso that results in the formation of zzso Furthermore, equivalent amounts of zzso and zzso were zzso from canine zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the generation of these products occurs within the same regulated zzso of zzso
