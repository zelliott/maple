The zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso for vascular zzso growth factor and a critical regulator of zzso cell growth and zzso To study mechanisms of zzso cell differentiation and gene regulation, we have analyzed the zzso of the zzso promoter of human zzso A protected sequence between base pairs zzso and zzso was defined by in zzso zzso I zzso analysis in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso zzso alone produced similar protection, and zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso was indeed the major nuclear protein binding to this zzso Despite the cell type specificity of zzso zzso no cell type differences were observed in zzso interactions in zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso zzso demonstrated marked differences in core promoter interactions between cell zzso Protection of zzso binding sites was observed in zzso by in zzso zzso I zzso whereas in human zzso and zzso cells a pattern consistent with zzso positioning was zzso In zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso interactions occurred within zzso elements in zzso but not in zzso zzso It is possible that distant elements coordinate zzso binding and zzso structure to regulate cell zzso expression of zzso
