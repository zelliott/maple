In order to study the effect of different zzso zzso zzso on the bacterial composition of zzso communities, two reductive zzso enrichment cultures were developed that were able to reduce zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso using hydrogen as electron zzso zzso The zzso for the cultures was material from a zzso zzso bed reactor zzso which was originally seeded with zzso sludge and showed a stable capacity for zzso zzso reduction to zzso for over six zzso zzso methods were used to determine and compare the microbial communities of these two enrichment zzso A clone library of bacterial zzso zzso genes was generated for each zzso The clones were screened into different groups by restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis using two different four base pair recognition restriction zzso A total of 12 sequence types were identified by zzso analysis of nearly complete zzso zzso sequences ( approximately 1450 zzso The sequences were affiliated with six recognized zzso of the domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results led to the identification of an zzso closely related to zzso zzso to be the zzso zzso in both zzso Different electron zzso affected the bacterial diversity and the community profiles of the two zzso Most of the sequences identified in our zzso zzso shared high similarities with sequences previously obtained from other enriched zzso cultures and zzso sediments or zzso suggesting these bacteria may have direct or indirect roles in reductive zzso
