zzso play an important role in the regulation of zzso production and differentiation in zzso However the zzso zzso for these small molecules has not yet been determined, and in zzso synthesis has not been zzso The function of the zzso family of zzso originally proposed to zzso zzso zzso has been in zzso To clarify the function of the zzso family, and to understand the synthesis of the zzso we performed in zzso analysis of this protein zzso zzso proteins consist of two divergent zzso each of which has similarity to the fatty acid synthesis zzso zzso and zzso The two predicted active sites in zzso which is the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso was abolished in all four constructed zzso strongly suggesting that zzso has zzso zzso
