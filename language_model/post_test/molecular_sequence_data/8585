zzso is a ubiquitous calcium zzso protein found primarily in the zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit DNA binding and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso hormone receptors by binding to the zzso sequence zzso present in the zzso zzso of all known members of the zzso hormone zzso zzso To determine whether zzso might be a general regulator of zzso zzso we examined its effect on DNA binding in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso alpha zzso and of other nuclear hormone zzso to zzso zzso DNA elements in zzso However, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cultured cells had little or no effect on zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso the binding of both nuclear and steroid hormone receptors to zzso response elements in zzso our findings suggest that zzso does not necessarily play an important role in the regulation of all classes of hormone receptors in zzso
