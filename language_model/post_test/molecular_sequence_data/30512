A zzso clone bearing an zzso class I gene has been isolated from a human zzso library by zzso to a class zzso zzso This clone encodes the zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso on zzso zzso L zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso has been performed, and the deduced zzso acid sequence was compared with previously published zzso class I zzso zzso acid sequence zzso between zzso molecules and members of the zzso zzso group were observed and allowed us to demonstrate that zzso zzso is the only critical zzso involved in the binding of the zzso zzso zzso defining an zzso common to all zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study also permitted designation of a V zzso at position 189 in the third domain as possibly involved in the binding of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we located clusters of zzso in reference to the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso the ninth zzso of the first zzso domain, the upper surface of the first zzso region, and both beta and alpha structures of the alpha 2 zzso
