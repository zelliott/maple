Using zzso prepared by the DNA zzso technique, zzso E from zzso zzso was zzso in space group zzso with two molecules in an zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso E was solved by molecular replacement followed by refinement with the zzso zzso This resulted in the zzso A structure of zzso E with an zzso of zzso for zzso A data and zzso zzso from ideal values of zzso A and zzso for bond lengths and bond angles zzso The zzso group zzso bound to zzso appeared very clearly in the electron density zzso Except for the active site disturbed by zzso zzso the structural features of zzso E are almost the same as in other zzso The zzso sites are different in detail in the two independent molecules of zzso zzso Based on the structure, the remarkably enhanced heat stability of zzso zzso of zzso E is zzso It is very likely that there is an additional water zzso in the zzso structure, which is hydrogen bonded to side chains of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso
