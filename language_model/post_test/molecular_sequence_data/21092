zzso zzso the zzso with highest specific activity zzso from latex of zzso zzso zzso shows optimum zzso activity at alkaline zzso and it is completely inhibited by the irreversible inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It exhibits zzso activity on several zzso acid zzso zzso with a preference for zzso Ala, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso (K zzso k zzso k zzso zzso The zzso has a zzso value above zzso and a molecular mass of zzso determined by mass zzso zzso of the zzso was obtained by reverse zzso starting from total zzso isolated from zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was confirmed by zzso mass zzso zzso The zzso of the mature protein was determined by automated sequencing using zzso degradation and compared with the sequence deduced from zzso The full zzso zzso sequence was thus obtained with a total of zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso as well as other zzso latex zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso belongs to the zzso class of zzso with two zzso bridges zzso and zzso in the alpha domain, and another one zzso in the beta domain, as was suggested by molecular zzso
