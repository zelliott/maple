From screening a population of zzso zzso lines, two zzso genes were identified, zzso zzso flowering by zzso 1) and zzso that zzso early flowering when zzso The two genes zzso putative zzso proteins which share high sequence similarity and constitute a small zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso also zzso earlier in short days and slightly earlier in long days than the wild type, while no zzso or zzso differences were observed in zzso relative to the wild zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leaf expansion and formation, and stem zzso zzso and zzso are both regulated by the zzso zzso zzso and genetic analyses revealed that zzso suppresses flowering largely through the action of zzso zzso and flowering locus T zzso suggesting that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso The growth defects in zzso were zzso in zzso zzso but the induction of zzso in the double zzso was comparable to that in zzso Thus, while zzso acts as a floral zzso zzso may not be directly involved in zzso but the two genes do have overlapping roles in regulating other zzso zzso zzso and zzso may function collectively to serve as one of the zzso points where the signals of growth and flowering zzso
