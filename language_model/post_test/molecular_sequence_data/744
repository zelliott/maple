The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso is a crucial component of a protein network that controls the zzso of cancer cells and progression of Alzheimer's zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso domain that is followed by five zzso zzso zzso and two different zzso zzso are zzso We identified son of zzso zzso as a novel binding partner of zzso and found zzso of zzso with zzso in human zzso lung zzso zzso cells and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We observe synergistic binding of zzso and zzso to zzso when zzso zzso are used, indicating that the tandem zzso and zzso zzso of zzso can potentially bind in a zzso binding mode, as was described for the zzso protein zzso These results are further zzso by pull-down zzso and zzso zzso zzso showing that both intact zzso zzso are required for efficient binding to the entire zzso domain of zzso The presence of a basic zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso in the long zzso zzso of zzso decreases the affinity to zzso zzso about zzso as determined by zzso zzso Furthermore, it leads to an zzso in the recognition of binding motifs for the interaction with zzso While the zzso abrogates the interaction with the majority of peptides derived from the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso that are recognized by the short zzso zzso it enables binding to a different set of peptides including a sequence zzso the zzso zzso in the long zzso of zzso zzso In the absence of the basic zzso zzso was found to bind a range of zzso and zzso peptides including conventional zzso motifs and zzso recognition zzso zzso the tandem zzso zzso in zzso employ two distinct types of binding modes: One class of peptides is recognized by single zzso zzso whereas a second class of peptides requires the presence of both zzso to bind zzso We conclude that the tandem zzso and zzso zzso of zzso constitute a versatile module for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
