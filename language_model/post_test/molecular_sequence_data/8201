The zzso gene encodes a zzso domain zzso factor expressed in differentiated muscles and their precursors in the zzso zzso zzso deficient for zzso protein due to a deletion of upstream zzso control sequences fail to form muscle, suggesting that the gene is required for muscle cell zzso To directly demonstrate a role for zzso in embryonic zzso we isolated gene zzso containing zzso point zzso characterized the effects of these zzso on zzso protein stability and nuclear zzso and analyzed the resulting muscle zzso Our results show that in the zzso muscle zzso zzso is required for both the formation and patterning of body wall zzso In the absence of zzso zzso there is extensive zzso among the zzso cell zzso In contrast, in the cardiac muscle zzso zzso of the zzso vessel occurs normally but the three zzso zzso genes are not zzso zzso zzso also exhibit an abnormal zzso zzso which zzso with the absence of alpha zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso function, suggesting that zzso regulates the inflated locus which encodes this zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in zzso cells and rare zzso zzso zzso adults fail to fly, consistent with defects observed in the indirect flight zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso gene has multiple functions in zzso and tissue zzso during zzso zzso
