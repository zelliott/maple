zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso efficiently as sources of iron for growth, and has the ability to store zzso on its cell surface, resulting in black pigmentation of colonies on blood zzso zzso However, little is known about zzso iron storage in this zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso proteins and may also contribute to the protection of organisms against zzso stresses generated by zzso free zzso A zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso was cloned from zzso DNA using information on its zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of zzso with those of known zzso and zzso identified the protein as a zzso and positioned it between proteins from the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to contain zzso iron, thus confirming its zzso Construction and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso was particularly important for the zzso to survive under zzso conditions (both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso iron is stored in zzso regardless of the iron source and that the iron stored in zzso is zzso under zzso zzso However, the zzso appeared not to contribute to protection against zzso stresses caused by zzso and atmospheric zzso
