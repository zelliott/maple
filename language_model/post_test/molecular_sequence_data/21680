The aim of this study was to investigate zzso molecular diversity and the zzso profile of zzso patients from zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso followed by sequencing of a zzso pair zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso was performed in samples from zzso zzso A total of 45 sequences were aligned with final manual zzso The zzso analyses showed a higher prevalence of zzso zzso B in the studied population zzso with only one sample yielding an F1 zzso The viral zzso prediction showed that zzso zzso was the most prevalent in the studied zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso prediction were zzso and zzso zzso There was no statistical significance, either in viral load or in zzso T cell count when zzso and zzso prediction groups were zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was the most common zzso loop core motif identified in the zzso strains studied zzso followed by zzso identified in zzso of the zzso The high level of B zzso in this Brazilian population reinforces the nature of the zzso epidemic in Brazil, and corroborates previous data obtained in the Brazilian zzso zzso
