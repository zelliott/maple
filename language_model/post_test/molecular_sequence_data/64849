A stable full-length infectious zzso clone of the zzso strain of zzso encephalitis virus zzso zzso was developed by a long zzso zzso and zzso cloning zzso The infectious clone zzso had four zzso acid zzso and produced smaller plaques when compared with the parent zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso were reverted to restore the parent virus sequence zzso Although genetically zzso parent virus zzso zzso and virus recovered from zzso demonstrated some biological differences that are possibly explained by the presence of zzso with differing zzso characteristics within the original virus zzso These observations may have implications for vaccines based on modified infectious zzso It was also demonstrated that the zzso acid substitution zzso at position 40 in the envelope zzso zzso was responsible for plaque size reduction, reduced infectious virus yields in cell culture and reduced mouse zzso Additionally, two zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also contributed to zzso of zzso in mice, but did not demonstrate a noticeable biological effect in baby zzso kidney cell zzso Comparative zzso tests revealed how the zzso of individual zzso zzso zzso and zzso can result in the zzso of a zzso
