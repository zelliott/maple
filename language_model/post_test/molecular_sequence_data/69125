When comparing two subsequent stages of zzso tumor progression we identified zzso as a new potential progression marker, the expression of which was correlated with zzso behavior of various human melanoma cell lines in nude zzso In this study, we describe a good correlation between zzso and protein levels in the zzso of these cell lines and extended these experiments to a panel of 120 routinely processed human zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso expression was elevated in melanoma zzso as compared to several types of zzso zzso zzso zzso using a specific zzso zzso showed a more complex zzso A stronger zzso in a higher percentage of positive cells was observed in thick primary melanoma zzso or zzso zzso zzso as compared to thin primary melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was also present in a higher percentage of cells showing a stronger zzso in zzso with higher Clark levels zzso zzso corresponding to the vertical growth phase of primary zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso was confined to the zzso part and was highest in the lower parts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potential precursors of melanoma, did not show any expression at all, either in zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the expression to the zzso part of zzso zzso and primary zzso may reflect interactions with the zzso of the zzso zzso that occurs with vertical zzso
