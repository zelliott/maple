To evaluate the zzso and conservation of the major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso in wild mouse zzso we determined the zzso sequence of zzso 1-3 of zzso of eight mouse zzso derived from wild mice, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as two zzso zzso Our data identify eight new zzso of zzso Taken together with previously published data on zzso among the common laboratory zzso zzso and in agreement with zzso zzso zzso and zzso data, these results further confirm the existence of two families of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and illuminate the extreme conservation of the zzso region of these zzso even across zzso
