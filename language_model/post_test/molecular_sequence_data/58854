The three-dimensional structure of bacterial zzso zzso was predicted using a protein fold recognition zzso the search of a library of known structures showed that the zzso sequence is highly compatible with the zzso zzso I structure, which suggested that zzso adopts a structure similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence alignment based on the prediction revealed that, despite the lack of overall sequence similarity (less than zzso zzso those zzso of zzso I that are involved in the zzso of the zzso bond, including two zzso zzso (His zzso and His zzso of the active center, are zzso in zzso In addition, a zzso zzso sequence motif was found, which includes two zzso critical zzso zzso 251 and His zzso A sequence database search showed that the motif is highly specific to zzso zzso I and bacterial zzso The functional roles of zzso zzso identified by the sequence comparison were consistent with the results from zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed by zzso zzso They completely abolished their zzso zzso A model for the zzso complex structure was built to investigate how the zzso specifically recognizes its zzso The model suggested that a set of zzso zzso among bacterial zzso including zzso 28 and zzso 55, might be important in the zzso zzso The predicted structural similarity and the conservation of the functionally important zzso strongly suggest a distant evolutionary relationship between bacterial zzso and zzso zzso zzso These two zzso must have acquired the specificity for different zzso in the course of zzso
