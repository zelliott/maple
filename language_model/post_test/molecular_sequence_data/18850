zzso extension with zzso from an zzso III zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a primer complementary to the zzso zzso gene revealed two major extension zzso Two different extension products were observed using zzso from either wild type zzso or the zzso zzso with a primer complementary to zzso zzso of the zzso of these extension products to the zzso zzso region indicated that all four putative zzso start sites were preceded by possible promoter zzso These putative promoters were zzso by the zzso and cloned into zzso a zzso zzso promoter probe zzso Transfer of the zzso derivatives to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that all four cloned fragments had promoter activity in zzso The activities of the four promoters changed over the course of growth of zzso zzso and studies in three zzso factor zzso strains demonstrated that three of the promoters were zzso zzso Northern zzso studies showed that the levels of the zzso transcripts remained relatively constant over the course of growth of zzso zzso zzso but that on a zzso basis, the levels of the zzso and zzso transcripts were considerably lower than those of zzso zzso is a cold shock protein in zzso zzso and the activity of the zzso promoters increased during cold shock at zzso resulting in a zzso increase in zzso activity, compared with the activity at zzso
