zzso the human zzso zzso encodes a zzso channel with properties similar to the rapidly zzso component of the delayed zzso zzso current zzso zzso of zzso cause the zzso zzso syndrome zzso presumably by zzso the normal function of zzso The current produced by zzso is not identical to zzso however, and the mechanism by which zzso zzso cause zzso remains zzso To better define the role of zzso in the heart, we cloned zzso from mouse zzso and cardiac zzso zzso zzso has 16 zzso and maps to mouse zzso 5 in an area zzso to human zzso zzso the map locus of zzso We isolated three cardiac zzso of zzso zzso is zzso to zzso and is expressed in heart, brain, and zzso zzso lacks the first 59 zzso acids of zzso and is not expressed zzso and zzso has a markedly shorter divergent zzso zzso domain and is expressed specifically in the zzso The zzso zzso like zzso produce inwardly zzso zzso currents when zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso produce currents with slow zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso currents zzso more zzso zzso zzso with zzso to form channels with zzso zzso that are more rapid than those of zzso or zzso and nearly identical to zzso In addition, a zzso of zzso is present in human cardiac and smooth zzso Thus, we have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso that is expressed specifically in the heart, has rapid zzso zzso and zzso with the longer zzso in zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso may determine the properties of zzso and contribute to the zzso of zzso
