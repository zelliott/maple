zzso development is a unique mode of zzso development in which a single zzso generates multiple zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso insect zzso zzso shows one of the most extreme cases of zzso producing up to 2,000 zzso from a single zzso In addition, this zzso exhibits an unusual zzso producing two zzso distinct zzso zzso termed precocious and zzso that develop zzso from the same zzso This form of development seems incompatible with a model of insect development in which maternal zzso of the egg specifies embryonic zzso zzso Here we show that maternal zzso in the form of germ zzso creates cellular asymmetry at the zzso stage zzso of zzso that is zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso of cells show that the cell inheriting the germ zzso regulates both the fate and proliferation of the zzso zzso Thus, we have uncovered a new mechanism of zzso zzso zzso by the regulatory capacity of a single zzso This study shows that the evolution of zzso zzso development of an insect zzso relies on a novel cellular context that might ultimately enhance zzso zzso
