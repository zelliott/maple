zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso library resulting in identification of alternatively spliced zzso zzso II zzso and zzso and a novel zzso zzso predicted to zzso a zzso zzso which was designated the zzso A clone predicted to zzso a zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was isolated with a variable domain structure similar to a zzso but with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso II zzso A full-length zzso construct expressed in zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso properties similar to expressed zzso composed of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso and related zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso was documented in zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso zzso II zzso containing the zzso acid insert were identified by Western analysis of partially zzso zzso zzso II from carotid zzso smooth muscle and brain using a zzso zzso zzso zzso of tissue zzso indicated a comparatively high level of expression of zzso containing the insert in brain and provided evidence for their zzso with other more abundant zzso into zzso zzso II zzso Our analyses indicate the following patterns of zzso expression: vascular smooth muscle, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain, zzso and related zzso zzso zzso
