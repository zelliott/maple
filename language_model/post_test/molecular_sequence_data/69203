zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso is a zzso of 28 zzso it contains two zzso atoms per zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence is homogeneous and zzso to the previously described zzso zzso which encodes a highly charged 14 zzso zzso without a leader zzso Although one of the two iron centers, zzso has previously been described as a zzso zzso site, zzso of the zzso form proves very similar to that of the zzso zzso coordinated iron in zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso both systems have spin S zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso site in zzso the zzso site in zzso has a pH dependent zzso potential with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Upon reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits an unusually sharp S zzso 2 resonance in zzso zzso The second iron, zzso has S zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso upon reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso turns zzso
