zzso stimulation of the zzso system results in increased zzso zzso cells and in cells expressing the final zzso in the synthesis of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The genes activated during adrenal zzso are not well zzso We have reported that the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells is zzso by zzso The zzso gene is expressed mainly in zzso and is associated with cell zzso In this study, we searched for similar genes in a rat zzso zzso zzso library, and examined the regulation of the expression of these zzso We found the zzso zzso which has been reported to be similar to human zzso zzso as well as two similar zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso and zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso 16 were mainly expressed in zzso zzso The product of zzso 10 is thought to be a zzso zzso unlike those of 8 and 16, and its expression in the adrenal was weak in zzso The control of the expression of zzso or zzso 16 genes differs depending on the zzso zzso in A10 cells zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso was not zzso by zzso nor was it influenced by salt intake in the adrenal zzso but it was reduced in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso of rats on a low sodium zzso These results show that genes similar to the human zzso gene family are expressed in rat adrenal zzso cells and zzso but their expression is not regulated by zzso The function of these genes in zzso and adrenal is zzso
