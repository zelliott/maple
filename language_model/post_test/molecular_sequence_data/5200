Using functional zzso with a zzso zzso zzso library, we have isolated a clone zzso a zzso phase progression defective zzso The newly isolated zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso at a restrictive temperature of 36 degrees C and DNA content analysis of the zzso indicated a zzso in cell cycle progression at the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso clones zzso this zzso zzso at 36 degrees C show that it encodes a protein that has 50% zzso acid identity with zzso zzso from zzso zzso and garden zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed extensive zzso throughout the primary sequence and protein structure, and contained zzso acid sequences of the active site region zzso from zzso to higher zzso Gene disruption and zzso analysis showed that zzso is an essential gene for cell zzso Northern analysis indicates that zzso expression of this gene is not zzso according to the cell zzso However, it is certain that malfunction of this zzso protein blocks the progression of cell cycle from zzso to S zzso The sequence of the zzso gene is available in zzso under zzso Number zzso
