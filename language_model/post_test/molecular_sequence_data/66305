We performed the first comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso from zzso insects by analyzing the zzso of two major zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso For the experiments we selected four related species of zzso zzso zzso three of which are known to attack several important food zzso zzso sequences were identified by zzso mass zzso tandem fragmentation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed novel sequences not known from other insects so zzso Most zzso and zzso ambiguities could be solved by either specific zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The identification of the specific sequences provides a solid basis for forthcoming pharmacological tests to study the neuroendocrine system of these zzso zzso However, it should be mentioned in this context that the sequences of the peptides from different zzso are likely not representative of zzso in zzso The forthcoming release of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso will provide sufficient data to clear this zzso
