zzso strains of human zzso virus type 1 zzso are known to adapt to replication in cell lines in zzso by becoming sensitive to soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lines favor isolation of zzso that use zzso as a zzso while primary zzso predominantly use zzso We have now studied how a primary zzso zzso zzso adapts to prolonged replication in primary human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso After 19 passages, a zzso virus, zzso had increased sensitivity to both zzso and zzso zzso that binds to a zzso site zzso zzso but decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso retains the zzso zzso its resistance to other zzso was zzso its sensitivity to various entry zzso was zzso and its ability to replicate in zzso was modestly zzso We define zzso as a primary zzso adapted zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis combined with zzso studies on zzso zzso viruses derived from zzso and the zzso zzso showed that the most important changes were in the zzso loop structure, one of them involving the loss of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed from zzso and the zzso zzso did not differ in their affinities for zzso suggesting that the structural consequences of the sequence changes were zzso at the level of the native, zzso zzso zzso Overall, the adaptation process probably involves selection for zzso with higher zzso affinity and hence greater fusion efficiency, but this also involves the loss of some resistance to zzso by agents directed at or near to the zzso The loss of zzso resistance is of no relevance under in zzso conditions, but zzso would presumably be a zzso pressure against such zzso changes in zzso at least when the zzso immune response is zzso
