Two spore stages in the life cycle of zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso of zzso zzso were identified by matching small zzso zzso zzso gene sequences of zzso from a zzso with zzso from zzso A zzso zzso zzso collected in the Willamette River, Oregon, USA was found to produce a zzso zzso which was distinguishable from previous records by its large size zzso 500 zzso zzso and number of germ cells zzso zzso Its small zzso zzso zzso gene sequence was zzso similar to zzso zzso from zzso Two of ten zzso from the Willamette had zzso infections with zzso zzso which were smaller than the type description of zzso zzso zzso zzso but were consistent with subsequent zzso zzso zzso was designed to selectively amplify zzso zzso in the presence of another common kidney zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences of spores from the fish were identical to each other and were zzso similar over zzso zzso to the spores from the zzso The zzso sequence divergence comprised zzso at five zzso which suggested that multiple zzso were present in the zzso zzso This is the first zzso species shown to have two spore stages in its life cycle and to zzso an zzso The infected zzso underwent zzso zzso to produce two daughter worms with zzso stages in their zzso zzso which suggested that zzso zzso may be sustained and dispersed within the zzso host zzso
