zzso compounds can protect DNA against zzso DNA damages not only by scavenging of zzso but also by chemical zzso repair or modification of such damages by zzso To investigate the influence of chemical repair and modification on zzso induced by zzso free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso solutions of zzso zzso zzso DNA were exposed to zzso under zzso in the presence of 5 zzso zzso The exposed DNA was subsequently zzso to zzso zzso coli and zzso in the zzso target were zzso This target in fact contains three different target zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso alpha gene and a 144 zzso zzso zzso The zzso spectrum obtained was compared with those in the absence of zzso under zzso and zzso In the latter case, the ratio of zzso and zzso available for reacting with DNA is about the same as under zzso + zzso The results show that chemical repair and/or modification by zzso of potentially lethal zzso takes place, leading to a much higher survival of zzso zzso DNA in the presence of zzso than could be expected on basis of scavenging of zzso and zzso zzso This higher survival appeared to be accompanied with a higher zzso zzso However, the zzso + zzso zzso spectrum shows a remarkable resemblance with the zzso This holds for the total zzso target, as well as each of the three targets, although the zzso obtained in each of the three targets under the same zzso conditions are quite zzso Thus, it can be concluded that zzso is mainly effective on zzso potentially lethal DNA zzso and not so much on zzso zzso Moreover, the type of zzso appeared to be strongly dependent on the zzso target zzso
