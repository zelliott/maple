The sequences of several members of the zzso family of molecular zzso are evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso a new zzso zzso zzso predicts structurally ambivalent sequence elements by analyzing the output from a secondary structure prediction zzso These ambivalent sequence elements form secondary structures that are hypothesized to function as switches by undergoing zzso zzso For chicken skeletal muscle myosin, 13 discrete structurally ambivalent sequence elements are zzso All 13 are located in the heavy chain motor zzso When these sequence elements are mapped into the zzso zzso structure, they form two compact regions that connect the zzso binding site to the zzso zzso zzso site, and the zzso site to the zzso site for the zzso zzso of the motor zzso These regions, predicted by the new zzso to undergo zzso zzso include the published known and putative switches of the zzso motor domain, and they form plausible zzso connections between the three main functional sites of zzso The sequences of several other members of the zzso I and II families are also zzso
