zzso of the zzso zzso marina are composed of thin parallel filaments running zzso and lack the arched structure common to the zzso The zzso and molecular organization of these zzso including the zzso and arrangement of zzso is still zzso We investigated the locations of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on these zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for these three genes were designated according to known partial zzso zzso products amplified from total DNA were labeled with zzso zzso by random zzso and used as zzso After zzso zzso zzso signals were amplified and zzso with zzso The number of signals was 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso This study is the first to locate zzso genes in the nucleus of a zzso although the zzso were greatly damaged during the FISH zzso The copy number of each gene per cell was estimated using real time zzso zzso copy numbers of zzso zzso and zzso were, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
