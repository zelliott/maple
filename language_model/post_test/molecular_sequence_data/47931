Limited information is known regarding the regulation, structural features, and functional zzso of zzso zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso at or near zzso and/or zzso in bovine serum zzso was associated with an increase in zzso zzso Since the zzso is predicted to be in a region between the zzso domain and predicted zzso structure in the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso Springer, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 94, zzso zzso we hypothesized that this connecting region is important for zzso zzso zzso zzso of human serum zzso which has an zzso but lacks the zzso present in bovine serum zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso encompassing zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso with zzso demonstrated that zzso only zzso the activity of intact zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may have similar effects on zzso zzso with this is the observation that both zzso decreased the affinity of zzso for mixed zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso region of zzso is important in regulating zzso zzso
