Although surface zzso resonance zzso zzso technique has been used to study zzso interactions and to detect zzso changes of zzso it has not been shown whether the zzso zzso can be used to study a complex kinetic system such as the zzso zzso which sometimes involves several binding steps as well as dynamic zzso changes of the zzso In this study, we have used zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the model system to study the interactions of the zzso with a series of DNA zzso duplexes containing different number of zzso and zzso contents at various positions near the primer zzso In general, the binding zzso measured by the zzso are several zzso smaller than those determined in solution, indicating the limitation of the zzso technique for measuring zzso zzso However, the distinct zzso binding profiles obtained for DNA duplexes differed by as low as a single mismatch suggest that the zzso data can be used for relative comparison purpose among a set of experiments carried out under identical zzso The successful fitting of the binding profiles using the established zzso model also demonstrated that zzso can be used to monitor zzso changes, as well as to derive relative kinetic values, within a complicated zzso interaction zzso The results also demonstrated that zzso zzso may be used as a sensitive technique for studying molecular recognition events, such as zzso discrimination involved in zzso zzso
