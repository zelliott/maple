A zzso protein (called zzso from zzso zzso was identified as zzso because it zzso with at least four different zzso raised against zzso and was isolated, with a zzso zzso zzso by zzso cycling procedures used to purify zzso from zzso zzso Furthermore, at least three zzso of zzso symbiotic zzso zzso zzso and zzso that contain conspicuous zzso zzso zzso displayed a strong zzso in zzso when treated with zzso zzso raised against zzso Here we zzso results that lead to the conclusion that this zzso protein has no zzso to zzso zzso is an zzso stress protein zzso zzso is a highly zzso family of zzso proteins which includes the zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis (an active component of zzso complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso also known as zzso include zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso the pea zzso zzso and many other proteins involved in protein folding and the stress zzso
