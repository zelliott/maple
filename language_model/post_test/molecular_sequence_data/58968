The molecular basis for patterning of complex organ structures like the lung and insect zzso system is zzso Here, we describe the zzso gene zzso zzso and demonstrate that it is a key zzso of the zzso branching zzso zzso is required for zzso branching and is expressed zzso in clusters of cells surrounding the developing zzso system at each position where a new branch will form and grow zzso zzso zzso of zzso can direct branch formation and outgrowth to new zzso zzso zzso activates later programs of zzso gene expression and zzso resulting in massive networks of zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso growth factors zzso and appears to function as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso expressed on developing zzso zzso The results suggest that this zzso zzso specifies the zzso branching pattern by guiding zzso cell migration during primary branch formation and then zzso later programs of finer branching at the ends of growing primary zzso
