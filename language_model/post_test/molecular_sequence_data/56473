Recently, we showed that zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit nuclear transport of zzso proteins in zzso In this study, we examined the involvement of zzso in nuclear transport using a zzso zzso transport zzso zzso of the zzso extract required for nuclear transport of zzso by incubation with zzso zzso reduced the nuclear transport activity significantly, and addition of zzso zzso to the depleted extract restored the transport zzso We examined the zzso of zzso during nuclear transport in zzso by indirect zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the nucleus when bovine serum zzso zzso zzso to zzso large zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso peptides zzso or zzso was added zzso to the zzso zzso but not when zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso zzso of zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso temperature, and zzso and was sensitive to wheat germ zzso zzso of excess zzso zzso to the zzso extract competitively inhibited the nuclear zzso of zzso labeled zzso or zzso but did not affect zzso of zzso into the zzso These results show that zzso is required for nuclear transport and that it is zzso with zzso proteins during their active import into the nucleus in zzso
