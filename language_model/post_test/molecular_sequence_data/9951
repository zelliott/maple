zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of two gene clusters zzso and zzso upstream of the previously zzso zzso B2 structural and immunity genes zzso and zzso zzso products of zzso and zzso have sequence similarity to proteins of zzso zzso signal zzso systems, and those of zzso and zzso have sequence similarity to proteins of signal zzso zzso zzso zzso products of zzso zzso and zzso are class zzso zzso precursors with potential leader peptides containing zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso locus contains information required for the production of, and immunity to, the zzso zzso B2 and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, this locus is involved in the production of at least one additional zzso compound and an zzso factor that plays a role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso (with the latter zzso zzso zzso and its immunity protein on the zzso and two small transcripts containing zzso are transcribed only in induced zzso These transcripts are zzso and subject to zzso zzso zzso Similar regulation of the zzso zzso is mirrored by the similarity in the zzso sequence of their promoter regions, all of which contain two imperfect direct repeats resembling those in zzso regulated promoters upstream of the zzso start zzso
