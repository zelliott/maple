zzso plants often prevent zzso through mechanisms of zzso zzso The loss of zzso has occurred many times zzso because it provides short-term advantages in situations where zzso or zzso are zzso The zzso zzso which is closely related to zzso contains a pair of closely related zzso species, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso To zzso the transition to zzso and its relationship to zzso of zzso zzso we have made use of comparative sequence zzso Our analyses indicate that zzso zzso separated from zzso zzso recently ( approximately zzso years zzso and that breakdown of zzso occurred at approximately the same zzso zzso the zzso diversity patterns of the 2 species, we found that zzso zzso has only 1 or 2 zzso at most zzso suggesting that it originated through an extreme population zzso Our data are consistent with zzso zzso by a single, zzso individual, most likely living in zzso The new species subsequently zzso the Mediterranean by Northern and Southern routes, at a time that also saw the spread of zzso The presence of zzso diversity within modern zzso zzso suggests that this species will be an interesting model to understand divergence and adaptation, starting from very limited standing genetic zzso
