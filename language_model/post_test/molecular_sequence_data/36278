The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displays two alternative modes of zzso In the Mediterranean, larvae are zzso in a zzso mass while in the Atlantic and English Channel, larvae follow a zzso zzso This paper attempts to discern whether this difference is expressed at the population, zzso or species zzso zzso of zzso zzso and representatives of a number of control species were sampled from zzso Channel and Mediterranean zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso end of six representative species allowed one to zzso the relative position of zzso zzso within the zzso and the position of the latter within the animal zzso The relative genetic distances calculated between the different species were also used to approach the zzso problem raised by the differences between the Mediterranean and zzso Channel population of zzso zzso The genetic distance between Mediterranean and Atlantic populations of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are of the same order, suggesting that differences between the populations of zzso zzso are zzso
