Progressive external zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disorder characterized by the zzso of multiple point zzso and large deletions in zzso zzso dominant zzso was recently shown to zzso with a zzso zzso zzso in the human gene zzso the sole zzso DNA zzso DNA zzso gamma zzso zzso Since zzso is a highly zzso zzso critical for zzso recognition among family A DNA zzso we analyzed the effects of the zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso of DNA synthesis by the zzso human zzso zzso in complex with its accessory zzso The zzso zzso retains a zzso zzso rate zzso but suffers a zzso decrease in apparent binding affinity for the incoming zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso less accurate for base pair zzso than zzso pol gamma despite the action of intrinsic zzso zzso The full zzso effect of the zzso substitution was revealed by genetic zzso of the zzso and error rates for certain zzso were elevated by zzso The zzso DNA synthesis observed for the zzso pol gamma is consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso in patients with zzso
