We have previously reported that a majority of zzso and class II zzso or zzso T cell zzso zzso by natural infection with zzso virus zzso zzso focus on regions of the zzso zzso that have featured in zzso drift and exhibit extensive diversity in their ability to discriminate between zzso viruses with zzso acid zzso in these zzso The structural basis for the loss of recognition of a major zzso site, zzso zzso was investigated by zzso comparing the effects of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso 129 zzso 132 zzso 135 zzso with the corresponding zzso in synthetic peptides or zzso by assessing the effects of single zzso acid zzso (to zzso in the alpha k chain zzso zzso on the ability of Ak zzso to present zzso Despite the failure to zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides were zzso as efficiently as zzso peptides in association with zzso zzso However, the zzso Ak zzso identified a different set of alpha k zzso zzso 56, 65, and zzso as being critical for presentation of zzso zzso Taken together with our previous findings that defects in zzso presentation of zzso zzso are reversed by single zzso in the alpha k chain zzso 56 and zzso it would seem that the zzso drift zzso in zzso zzso alter the profile of contact sites with class zzso
