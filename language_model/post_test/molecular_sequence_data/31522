DNA viruses often target cellular proteins to zzso host cell cycles and facilitate viral zzso zzso However, whether proliferation of white spot syndrome virus zzso requires regulation of the host cell cycle remains zzso In the present study, we show that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso can interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso and zzso could also bind to zzso zzso family protein 1 zzso in a manner similar to how they bind to zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso as a model system, we demonstrated that both zzso and zzso could zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso and subsequently activate zzso to stimulate the zzso zzso Our findings provide the first evidence that zzso may regulate cell cycle progression by targeting the zzso zzso
