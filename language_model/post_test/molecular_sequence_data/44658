An zzso zzso zzso zzso a new zzso protein zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence zzso to a zzso containing two zzso recognition motifs zzso and a basic zzso An affinity for zzso acids was confirmed in binding zzso using in zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments on sections of flowers and zzso showed expression only in growing zzso zzso zzso filaments and during zzso expression is located in the zzso proper and the zzso up to late heart zzso zzso is not detected in the zzso during zzso This results suggests an expression pattern correlated with dividing zzso
