An zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the culture broth of a zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso was cloned by zzso chain reaction using mixed zzso designed from zzso and internal zzso acid zzso sequences of the zzso zzso The determined zzso zzso sequence of zzso revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso that zzso a putative signal sequence (27 zzso and a mature protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from a culture broth of zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso It had a molecular mass of 105 zzso and a zzso value of zzso The maximum activity was observed at pH 8 and 55 degrees C in zzso zzso The degradation products from zzso or zzso acids were zzso acid, like the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso exhibited moderate zzso to those of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso identity for zzso High zzso was observed in a suitably aligned internal region of the three zzso zzso zzso and some of the zzso zzso zzso appeared to form the zzso core of the zzso
