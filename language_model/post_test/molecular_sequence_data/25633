zzso isolated from the zzso regions of pea stems was examined using X-ray zzso and energy zzso The X-ray zzso pattern suggested that the backbone zzso takes an extended zzso zzso similar to common zzso In order to study side chains zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso energetically preferable zzso were searched by calculation of interactions between zzso atom zzso A zzso calculation for the zzso of zzso zzso gave 10 allowed area zzso maps which are useful to deduce zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in the walls of growing plant zzso
