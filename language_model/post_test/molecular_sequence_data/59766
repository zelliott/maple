We describe the mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso zzso a protein built of zzso repeats, based on the crystal structure of the complex between the inhibitor and zzso zzso The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined to an zzso of zzso at zzso A zzso zzso A binds to the zzso region of the inhibitor protein zzso its parallel zzso and zzso The inhibitor covers the zzso active site and directly contacts several zzso zzso The inhibitor only partially mimics the zzso interaction and does not zzso the zzso zzso pocket of zzso A, where a zzso zzso remains zzso The zzso zzso of accessible surface area buried upon complex formation may be one of the major contributors to the extremely tight association zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction is predominantly zzso there is a high chemical zzso with 18 putative hydrogen bonds and salt zzso but the shape zzso is lower than in most other zzso zzso zzso inhibitor changes its zzso upon complex zzso the zzso change is unusual in that it is a plastic reorganization of the entire structure without any obvious hinge and reflects the zzso flexibility of the structure of the zzso There is a good agreement between the crystal structure and other zzso studies of the zzso The structure suggests that the zzso flexibility of zzso and an unusually large contact area that compensates for a lower degree of zzso may be the principal reasons for the ability of zzso to zzso inhibit diverse zzso However, the zzso is lost with zzso zzso that have zzso most zzso corresponding to zzso zzso in zzso A, and with bovine seminal zzso that prevents inhibitor binding by forming a zzso
