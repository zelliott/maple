zzso play an important role in zzso zzso and possibly in stress tolerance in many plant zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso catalyzing the formation and extension of zzso zzso typical of zzso was zzso from barley zzso zzso zzso It occurred in two closely similar zzso with indistinguishable zzso properties, both consisting of two zzso with apparent masses of 49 and 23 zzso zzso designed according to the sequences of zzso peptides from the large zzso were used to amplify corresponding sequences from barley zzso The main zzso generated was cloned and used to screen a barley zzso expression zzso The longest zzso obtained was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and shown to zzso a functional zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso comprises both zzso of zzso It has high similarity to plant zzso and other zzso zzso but only little to bacterial zzso catalyzing the same type of reaction as zzso
