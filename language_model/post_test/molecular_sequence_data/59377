The gene zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso sequence of zzso has been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence indicated that zzso codes for a precursor of zzso zzso acids and the precursor is composed of four regions including a signal zzso an zzso zzso a mature zzso region and a zzso extension region of 215 zzso acids as previously described for zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso zzso showed high sequence zzso with those of other class I zzso The zzso region was characterized by a repeat of 94 zzso acids zzso which showed about 50% similarity with those of the zzso zzso of several known zzso from zzso zzso
