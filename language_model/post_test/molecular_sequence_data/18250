zzso directed at the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso can mediate a severe form of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from plasma of one patient zzso with this form of zzso displays a public zzso termed zzso The zzso zzso has been found in the plasma of several patients with zzso usually in association with zzso zzso As a step in the understanding of the molecular zzso of this form of zzso we have determined the zzso sequences of expressed V region genes selected from a panel of five human zzso cell lines derived from patient zzso Two of the lines zzso zzso that bound zzso and three of the lines zzso zzso that expressed zzso The H chain sequences of the zzso zzso and of one of the zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso The second zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso All have multiple zzso from previously published sequences giving these zzso the appearance of having been zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso in zzso arise from a zzso immune response inappropriately directed at zzso zzso Further, our results suggest that zzso gene segments may be recruited zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso
