zzso zzso participate in complex, interacting signaling pathways in zzso zzso and zzso While most organisms contain many different zzso the extreme zzso zzso zzso encodes a single hypothetical zzso zzso A gene zzso to zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso gene by a single base zzso The putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso coli, zzso to zzso and found to be zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that can use zzso zzso or zzso as zzso although zzso appears to be the preferred zzso zzso was zzso on a zzso zzso and was zzso by zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and was zzso by zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso also zzso one zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso had zzso zzso activity but zzso zzso by UMP and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso were both appreciably zzso These changes in zzso regulation would be expected to activate zzso zzso by releasing the constraints imposed on zzso zzso zzso activity by UMP and zzso the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also zzso by zzso zzso zzso occupies the lowest branch on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso its zzso zzso and a protein zzso may be elements of a simple signaling pathway, perhaps the most primitive example of this mode of regulation described thus zzso
