Previous analysis of the zzso gene of zzso zzso has shown that in addition to the zzso box and the zzso and zzso heat shock elements zzso zzso at zzso and zzso relative to the start site of zzso a segment of zzso repeats at zzso to zzso is required for full heat shock zzso zzso Glaser, zzso Thomas, zzso zzso zzso Elgin, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso element appears to contribute to formation of the zzso zzso structure of zzso an organized zzso array that leaves the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Glaser, zzso zzso and zzso Elgin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences upstream of zzso has revealed an additional zzso element at zzso to zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso We have analyzed the contribution of this zzso zzso element zzso to zzso the zzso zzso element zzso to zzso and the two zzso both to the formation of the zzso structure and to heat shock zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of these sequence elements have been fused in frame to the zzso coli zzso gene and reintroduced into the zzso zzso zzso by zzso germ line zzso zzso structure of the zzso was analyzed zzso to gene zzso by zzso I or restriction zzso treatment of isolated zzso and zzso expression was monitored by measuring zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso or zzso of either the zzso or the zzso zzso element affect the zzso structure and zzso expression of the zzso These zzso repeats are associated with a zzso zzso in zzso and are bound by a zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor, in zzso In contrast, the zzso are required for zzso expression but play only a minor role in establishing the zzso structure of the zzso Previous analysis indicates that prior to heat zzso these zzso appear to be free of zzso Our results suggest that zzso factor, an abundant protein factor required for normal expression of many zzso zzso and heat shock factor, a specific zzso factor activated upon heat zzso play distinct roles in gene zzso the zzso factor establishes and/or maintains the zzso sites prior to heat shock zzso while the activated heat shock factor recognizes and binds zzso located within the zzso sites to trigger zzso
