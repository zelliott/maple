Genome sequencing of zzso zzso zzso D has identified zzso membrane proteins zzso that are a newly recognized protein family unique to the zzso zzso zzso data suggest that these diverse proteins are expressed on the cell surface and might be zzso zzso We performed zzso analyses and statistical modeling with 18 reference zzso and 1 zzso of zzso zzso to examine the evolutionary characteristics and comparative zzso of zzso and zzso the gene that encodes this zzso We also examined 12 recently isolated zzso and zzso clinical samples, since reference zzso are laboratory adapted and may not represent strains that are presently responsible for human zzso zzso reconstructions revealed a clear distinction for disease groups, corresponding to levels of tissue specificity and zzso of the zzso Further, the most prevalent zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed a distinct zzso According to the results of comparative genetic zzso these three zzso zzso contained two putative zzso sequence zzso elements with zzso and zzso direct repeats, respectively, while all other zzso zzso contained one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also contained both zzso Previously, no zzso elements have been identified for zzso Surprisingly, 7 zzso of 12 clinical zzso revealed zzso sequences that were identical to the sequences of other zzso providing clear evidence for a high rate of zzso zzso zzso and the differential presence of zzso elements among distinct disease and prevalence groups may contribute to zzso zzso which may lead to zzso changes in tissue zzso and zzso over the course of the zzso zzso
