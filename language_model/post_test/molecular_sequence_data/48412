Although the majority of investigations concerned with zzso and its protein have focused on coding regions, recently a set of studies highlighted significant roles of regulatory elements located in zzso zzso especially 5 ? zzso The zzso transcript is one of those that acts as a natural zzso agent, forming zzso hybrids with zzso zzso and protecting it from zzso 

In this study, we focused on the zzso status of zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso to zzso 1 of zzso in 160 breast tumor tissue samples and conducted a zzso search for probable zzso binding site in the zzso overlapping zzso zzso were zzso using single stranded zzso zzso zzso and zzso We applied the zzso database for prediction of zzso which target overlapping region of zzso zzso 

Our results showed all samples to have wild type zzso in zzso 1 of zzso zzso We could detect a novel and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso outside overlapping regions of zzso genes in breast cancer zzso and also predict the presence of a binding site for zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

From our findings we propose designing further studies focused on zzso of zzso and introducing different zzso in the overlapping region of zzso and zzso genes in order to study their effects on zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso The results may provide new pieces in the zzso targeting puzzle for cancer zzso
