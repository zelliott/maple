zzso disease often occurs when certain crops are zzso in a soil that had previously supported the same or similar plant zzso This disease typically leads to reductions in plant growth, crop yields, and production zzso and its zzso remains zzso The objective of this study was to identify zzso associated with zzso zzso disease symptoms at a field location in California, zzso zzso samples were subjected to treatments to create various levels of zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso were grown in the treated zzso in greenhouse zzso After 6 weeks, plant growth parameters were measured, and both culture and zzso analyses were performed to identify zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso 

A total of zzso bacterial operational zzso units zzso were identified by an zzso high zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso Among the 60 most abundant zzso 27 showed significant zzso negative correlation with zzso shoot weights while 10 were positively zzso Most of these zzso belonged to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso including the classes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the orders zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The most abundant zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most abundant zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso quantitative zzso analyses identified negative and positive associations between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso shoot zzso zzso 

This study identified numerous zzso associated with zzso zzso symptoms, some of which have been previously identified while others represent new zzso zzso Koch's zzso investigations will assess their possible roles in this zzso zzso
