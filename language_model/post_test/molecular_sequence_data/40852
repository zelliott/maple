zzso zzso D zzso zzso to disease faster and has lower zzso than zzso A zzso We examined whether these differences could lead to a population level change in the distribution of these zzso over zzso zzso viral zzso was extracted from stored serum samples from zzso subjects participating in a zzso cohort study in zzso Uganda in 1994 and zzso zzso of the viral proteins gag and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso assignments were generated for zzso subjects in 1994 and zzso subjects in zzso The change in zzso distribution of the population as a whole as well as zzso age groups were examined for significant changes using a linear zzso There was a significant decrease in the proportion of subjects infected with zzso from zzso to zzso and a significant increase in subjects infected with zzso from zzso to zzso over the zzso period zzso The most marked changes in proportion of zzso and A were seen in the younger individuals zzso and zzso years; zzso The percentages of subjects infected with zzso and zzso zzso did not change zzso Over this zzso period, the overall viral population in this region evolved toward the less virulent zzso strain, most likely as a consequence of the faster disease progression and lower zzso of zzso
