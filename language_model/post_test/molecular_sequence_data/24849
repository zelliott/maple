We identified a zzso zzso of small zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso in a screen for zzso defective in zzso zzso We show that zzso is essential for the nuclear export of all zzso tested in a wide range of zzso and times in zzso High resolution and sensitive in zzso zzso detect the rapid zzso of individual zzso species in zzso zzso zzso in particles that are distinct from nascent transcript zzso and resemble zzso export zzso The particles become more numerous and intense with increasing time at the restrictive temperature and are exported very rapidly after shifting back to the zzso zzso The zzso export block is not due indirectly to a zzso in zzso nuclear protein import, or zzso nuclear zzso suggesting that in zzso zzso zzso is competent for export but fails to dock or zzso through zzso We conclude that zzso is an essential ubiquitous export factor for all zzso throughout development in higher zzso
