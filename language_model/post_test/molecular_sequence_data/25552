Some chronic zzso carriers have circulating zzso DNA despite the presence of zzso zzso This observation has recently been related to the presence, in the zzso zzso region, of a zzso stop zzso that prevents zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso at the zzso level, the zzso region of zzso isolated from the zzso of 11 zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso sequence analysis of 25 independent clones revealed that the zzso sequence is highly zzso even among clones derived from the same serum zzso Moreover, our data show that zzso synthesis can also be prevented by as yet zzso zzso substitution at position zzso that eliminates the start zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso contains segments of high zzso that have probably been selected during evolution to favor the segregation of functionally zzso zzso capable of avoiding host zzso
