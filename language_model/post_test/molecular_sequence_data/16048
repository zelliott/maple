zzso of the human zzso zzso gene is induced by a variety of agents such as zzso zzso and some zzso In this study, we describe a nuclear factor, termed zzso regulatory zzso zzso that is involved in the zzso of zzso and possibly other zzso We demonstrate that zzso functions in zzso zzso by interacting with previously identified, zzso regulatory DNA zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso in the transient formation of an zzso zzso with the regulatory zzso zzso may also be involved in zzso the function of the zzso zzso juxtaposed to the regulatory elements in zzso zzso
