zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso were observed in the absence and presence of E coli zzso zzso Upon complex formation of zzso with zzso zzso some zzso zzso zzso disappeared, and some others were significantly broadened and/or shifted in the zzso chemical shift, while the others were observed at the same zzso chemical zzso It was indicated that the binding of zzso with zzso affect the following four zzso the zzso zzso the junction of the zzso and T zzso the middle of the D zzso and the region where the zzso base pair connects the zzso D, and extra zzso This result is consistent with those of chemical zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these three independent results reveal the recognition mechanism of zzso by zzso zzso recognizes all the identity zzso distributed throughout the zzso zzso which zzso changes in the secondary and zzso structures of zzso
