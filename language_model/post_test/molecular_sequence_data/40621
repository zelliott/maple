zzso zzso are the largest group of proteins zzso by zzso bacteria and include many zzso factors from human zzso zzso are zzso as large precursors with a zzso domain that is inserted in the outer membrane zzso and is essential for the zzso of an zzso passenger domain to the zzso zzso Several mechanisms have been proposed for AT zzso zzso models suggest transport across a zzso channel formed by an internal pore of the zzso or by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso model suggests that transport employs a zzso machinery of the bacterial zzso such as the zzso zzso In this work we have investigated AT zzso by carrying out a comparative study to analyze the zzso zzso and functional features of different zzso zzso selected from zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso having an zzso zzso and a zzso constitute functional transport units for the zzso of peptides and zzso zzso with zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso analyses show that zzso is not a zzso feature in AT zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the deletion of the zzso zzso severely zzso zzso folding and zzso zzso and thereby blocks passenger domain zzso These observations suggest that the AT zzso without its zzso cannot form a stable zzso channel in the zzso for protein zzso The implications of our data for an understanding of AT zzso are zzso
