We used the zzso method to identify the zzso zzso in a region zzso near the putative zzso end of the zzso zzso segment of the rat zzso acid type A zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso The zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso were accessible to charged, zzso zzso applied zzso in both the open and closed zzso The accessibility of alpha zzso and alpha zzso in the closed state implies that the gate must be at least as close to the zzso end of the channel as alpha zzso Also, the positively charged zzso zzso zzso penetrated from the zzso end of the channel to alpha zzso with which it zzso indicating that the zzso filter is closer to the zzso end of the channel than this zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevented the zzso zzso from reacting with alpha zzso but did not prevent reaction with the more zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso protection of alpha zzso may be due to zzso block by zzso bound in the channel at the level of alpha zzso however, if this protection is zzso it is not due to the induction of the resting closed state in which alpha zzso was accessible to zzso zzso
