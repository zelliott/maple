An accurate mass and time zzso tag approach for zzso analyses has been developed over the past several years to facilitate comprehensive zzso zzso zzso An zzso tag database for an zzso zzso or cell line is established by initially performing standard shotgun zzso analysis and, most importantly, by zzso zzso identifications using the mass measurement accuracy of zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso zzso and liquid zzso zzso zzso time zzso zzso of an zzso tag database largely zzso the need for subsequent zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso The strength of this technology resides in the ability to achieve highly efficient and zzso one-dimensional zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with highly accurate mass zzso using zzso zzso Recent improvements allow for the analysis of as little as zzso amounts of zzso samples by minimizing sample handling and maximizing zzso zzso The zzso platform has also demonstrated the ability to detect zzso differences in protein zzso and identify more abundant proteins from zzso amounts of zzso The zzso tag approach is poised to become a new standard technique for the in-depth and zzso analysis of complex organisms and clinical samples, with the potential to extend the analysis to a single zzso zzso
