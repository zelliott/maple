zzso zzso has a zzso zzso cycle which is characterized by qualitative and quantitative changes in protein zzso The molecular mechanisms that mediate these changes are zzso Evidence for zzso regulation of the zzso major outer membrane protein gene zzso was found by Northern zzso of zzso isolated zzso during the zzso zzso zzso Early in the growth cycle a single transcript was zzso which was followed hours later in the cycle by an additional zzso zzso of the initiating zzso for each transcript suggested that this gene is regulated by differential zzso from tandem zzso
