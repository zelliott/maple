An zzso motor located underneath the plasma membrane drives zzso and zzso invasion of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso agents of zzso zzso connects the motor zzso filaments to zzso adhesive proteins of the zzso anonymous protein zzso family and zzso the motor force across the zzso zzso The zzso interaction is a distinctive and critical trait of host zzso invasion by zzso zzso with a likely similar interaction crucial for zzso invasion by zzso Here, we describe zzso and zzso structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso grown in the presence of the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso The zzso ring of the critical penultimate zzso of zzso fits zzso into a newly formed zzso pocket, which is exclusively zzso by zzso zzso two zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso with the zzso zzso structure shows that the two zzso adopt new zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso forming a zzso unit, shifts upon binding the zzso The structural data are in agreement with decreased zzso binding after zzso of zzso zzso in and near the induced zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso sites of zzso seem to zzso suggesting that both the plasticity of the zzso zzso region and the zzso nature of the zzso are crucial for its intriguing zzso function in the invasion machinery of the malaria zzso
