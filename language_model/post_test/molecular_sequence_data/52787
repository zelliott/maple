Large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels couple zzso zzso with cellular zzso They are composed of a zzso alpha zzso and zzso beta zzso The pore zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso have been invaluable in unraveling zzso channel zzso role in zzso However in zzso brain, zzso zzso channels have been described zzso zzso zzso Chung, zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso 2, zzso but their molecular basis is zzso Here we report a human zzso channel zzso zzso highly expressed in brain, which renders the zzso channel zzso resistant to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The resistance of zzso channel to toxin block, a zzso zzso by the zzso zzso loop, results from a dramatic ( approximately 1,000 zzso slowdown of the toxin zzso However once bound, the toxin block is apparently zzso Thus, unusually high toxin zzso and long exposure times are necessary to determine the role of zzso zzso channels formed by alpha + zzso zzso
