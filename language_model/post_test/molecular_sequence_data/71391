In zzso zzso recent studies have uncovered a set of putative zzso factors of the basic zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso which function downstream of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso cascade which is involved in zzso signal zzso zzso a delta zzso zzso is known to exhibit zzso for growth, since one of the targets of zzso is the zzso zzso which is responsible for the zzso zzso production zzso by the zzso zzso zzso During the course of our studies on the zzso response in zzso zzso we found that growth of a delta zzso zzso is highly sensitive to the level of zzso zzso in the medium (but less sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso This zzso seemed to be relevant to the zzso because an delta zzso zzso showed a similar zzso An attempt was therefore made to isolate zzso zzso of the calcium sensitivity exhibited by the delta zzso zzso Among such zzso were several zzso factors, including two known proteins zzso and zzso and two new ones (named zzso and zzso These factors were characterized further, in comparison to zzso with special reference to the zzso zzso signaling zzso
