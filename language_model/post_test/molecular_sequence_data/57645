zzso altered C2 zzso cells, generated by the stable zzso of human zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso Lloyd, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso exhibit a differential pattern of zzso cellular organization and zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso displaying a zzso increase in the cell surface area, showed no significant changes in the pattern of organization of the high zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, or the low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and beta zzso gene zzso exhibiting a twofold decrease in the cell surface area, had an altered organization of zzso 2 but not zzso zzso In these zzso zzso zzso 2 did not zzso segregate into stress zzso structures and the intensity of zzso was greatly zzso zzso a zzso stress zzso organization of zzso 5 was zzso The pattern of organization of these zzso zzso correlated with their expression such that a profound decrease in zzso 2 expression was observed both at the transcript and protein levels, whereas zzso 5 remained relatively zzso These results suggest that relative changes in zzso zzso gene expression can affect the organization and expression of zzso in an zzso specific zzso Furthermore, this apparent direct link observed between zzso and zzso expression suggests that zzso signals originating in the zzso can regulate zzso gene zzso
