zzso zzso 5 zzso fiber zzso was investigated using reverse zzso zzso of a zzso zzso library, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso raised against zzso zzso fiber zzso Both zzso inhibited attachment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed zzso with the zzso segment of the zzso domain of the heavy chain of human zzso class I molecules zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were consensus to human zzso type III zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso fibers in a zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso showed a net zzso effect on zzso in zzso cells, whereas the zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso cells, which lack surface expression of zzso class I zzso showed a weak capacity for zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso attachment and zzso were restored to zzso cell levels, with zzso receptors per cell and a binding constant of zzso The results suggested that the zzso region of zzso zzso including zzso represents a high affinity zzso for zzso fiber zzso whereas ubiquitous zzso zzso would serve as auxiliary zzso
