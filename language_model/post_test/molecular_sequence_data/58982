zzso zzso zzso have been identified in an zzso diverse range of organisms, including zzso zzso zzso plants and zzso They are activated by a multitude of zzso signals and implicated in zzso differentiation and cell survival, as well as in the control of the zzso and cell zzso Here we describe the molecular and functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso was isolated and found to zzso a protein zzso throughout its length to the class I zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in wing or eye zzso discs resulted in flies with enlarged wings or eyes zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso containing a zzso predicted to result in the loss of zzso activity resulted in smaller wings and zzso The zzso in wing size result from changes in both cell size and cell number, whereas in the eye only differences in cell size were zzso These data imply a role for zzso in growth control during zzso development and have implications for the function of class I zzso in other zzso
