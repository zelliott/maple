To facilitate our study of the molecular basis for the zzso zzso zzso zzso selectivity of novel zzso we used DNA zzso to construct zzso zzso having zzso binding zzso derived from both zzso alpha and zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso generation was low with traditional DNA zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso binding domain sequences lack convenient restriction sites for introducing zzso zzso binding domain sequences into expression zzso To overcome these problems, we developed a modified strategy zzso zzso sequences were exclusively amplified from among the zzso products from DNA zzso using a special pair of zzso zzso whose 3' ends specifically match the alpha and beta zzso respectively, and whose zzso ends match sequences outside the zzso beta zzso binding zzso When zzso zzso binding domain DNA zzso amplified with these zzso were zzso into a zzso strain with a zzso expression zzso for zzso zzso an active expression zzso was produced by zzso zzso Twenty-two different crossover sites were zzso most occurred when there was a stretch of eight or more identical base pairs in both zzso and many were concentrated in the regions important for studying zzso binding and zzso This method should prove to be useful for generating zzso gene products from parent templates that share relatively low sequence zzso
