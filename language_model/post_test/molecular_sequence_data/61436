The present paper describes cloning and sequencing of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso key zzso of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we localized zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso of mouse lens zzso cells zzso and determined their zzso zzso By zzso zzso mass zzso of mouse lens zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso including zzso zzso species as major zzso Our data demonstrate the capacity of zzso to zzso zzso and the high coincidence between zzso of PM and early manifestation of cataract in patients with zzso disorders suggests that zzso lipids may play an important role in maintaining lens zzso
