zzso zzso of zzso in cancer has been correlated with zzso zzso During zzso development, zzso activates zzso in partnership with zzso zzso factor 1 zzso We previously reported that targeted zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that depend on zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that these zzso have recurring zzso zzso that resulted from illegitimate zzso zzso events and resembled zzso zzso previously described in human zzso We therefore used the zzso animal model to obtain zzso insights into the transformation zzso zzso analysis uncovered a link between zzso and zzso showing that the two proteins shared binding sites marked by zzso zzso zzso zzso throughout the zzso including near the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had increased DNA damage at the zzso zzso and showed altered repair of zzso DNA double strand zzso These cells were able to survive despite DNA damage because activated zzso promoted an zzso gene expression zzso Thus, activated zzso promotes zzso instability that leads to zzso zzso as a consequence of altered double strand break repair and increased survival of zzso with damaged zzso
