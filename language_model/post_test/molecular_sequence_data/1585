zzso constitute a zzso of zzso zzso zzso A member of the type II zzso zzso family, zzso zzso has been identified through different gene array experiments to be specifically expressed in zzso cells as well as to be associated with several zzso tumors, suggesting a role in immunity or cancer zzso zzso F specificity as a zzso inhibitor is still zzso and understanding the cellular traffic of this zzso is therefore a major step in its zzso Although the zzso zzso of zzso F has been suggested, no conclusive zzso of its zzso targeting have been zzso Here we show using zzso cells that zzso F is zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and is not associated with zzso zzso Interestingly, although zzso F targeting to zzso or zzso is not observed in zzso modification of its zzso end by the addition of several zzso acids promotes its zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This observation suggests that zzso F can be targeted to the zzso zzso under specific conditions and its zzso domain might contribute to this zzso
