The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso accumulate during zzso In a step forward to discover the mechanisms involved in the production of mature transcripts of the zzso zzso we determined the 5 - and 3 zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts of zzso The zzso of the only zzso zzso detected zzso b) extends zzso b into zzso of zzso Several zzso zzso zzso were identified and most of them extend their zzso through the adjacent zzso 101 b region to around 105 b into zzso the neighboring gene in the zzso zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also identified with different zzso extending almost 200 b into zzso In contrast, all zzso transcripts showed the same zzso 65 b upstream of the zzso stop zzso zzso of all zzso and zzso transcripts seem produced by zzso zzso between the last AA of the consensus sequence zzso present 66 and 16 b upstream of the respective start zzso Secondary structure predictions suggest that zzso extensions provide zzso stabilizing elements to zzso zzso zzso the processing of the zzso zzso primary transcript frequently involves zzso zzso sacrificing downstream gene messages and decreasing the efficiency of the conversion to mature zzso zzso zzso the maturation of zzso zzso would not sacrifice the downstream zzso message, contributing to higher levels of zzso zzso than of zzso zzso
