The zzso rule zzso is a zzso zzso system whose targets include proteins bearing zzso zzso zzso We carried out a synthetic lethal screen for zzso zzso zzso that require the zzso rule zzso for cell zzso A zzso thus identified, termed zzso could not grow in the absence of zzso the recognition component of the zzso rule pathway, which was not essential for viability of the parental strain under the same zzso Further analysis showed that zzso of zzso cells could be rescued either by the zzso gene (which was absent from the parental zzso or by a high concentration of zzso in the zzso This zzso in zzso zzso exhibited by the zzso zzso in the absence but not in the presence of zzso was traced to the gene zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cells, in comparison to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Yet another property of the zzso zzso was its zzso at 37 degrees C, which could not be rescued by either zzso or zzso This feature of zzso allowed the cloning of zzso which was found to be a gene called zzso zzso a zzso zzso Thus, either the zzso rule zzso or zzso must be present for the zzso rate of zzso import in zzso zzso zzso for zzso We consider possible mechanisms of this previously zzso link between zzso zzso zzso and the import of zzso
