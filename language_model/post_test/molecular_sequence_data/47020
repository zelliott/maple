An zzso isolated from zzso bass zzso zzso following a zzso among adult fish and zzso designated zzso bass virus zzso was characterized by analysis of viral protein synthesis in infected cells, viral DNA restriction zzso length zzso zzso and sequence determination of the major zzso protein and viral DNA zzso zzso All 3 approaches yielded results consistent with the suggestion that zzso was a member of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was nearly identical to 2 zzso from Southeast Asia which had been previously detected in imported ornamental zzso It remains to be determined whether infection of zzso bass resulted from exposure to an imported virus, or whether the presence of similar viruses in southeast Asia and the zzso United States indicates that zzso species are not geographically limited as suggested earlier, but rather globally zzso
