zzso acids are zzso zzso naturally zzso by trees that are released from wood during zzso zzso Using a newly designed primer set, genes similar to that zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a key zzso in zzso zzso acid degradation by zzso zzso zzso could be amplified from different zzso zzso whereas zzso gene sequence types representing distinct branches in the evolutionary tree were amplified from zzso and zzso zzso All zzso zzso a zzso were capable of growth on zzso acid as the sole source of carbon and energy and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction analysis in three strains confirmed that zzso was expressed zzso or in response to zzso demonstrating its involvement in zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso (as a zzso zzso and zzso genes have zzso under zzso selection from their ancestral zzso present in the most recent common zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso method was established to monitor the diversity of zzso genes in environmental zzso The molecular fingerprints indicated the presence zzso zzso previously zzso diversity of zzso zzso genes in soils, and suggest that other bacterial zzso may also zzso the genetic potential for zzso
