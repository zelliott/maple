The zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso contains a zzso transport element zzso within its 3' zzso region zzso that mediates the nuclear export of zzso zzso zzso In a previous report zzso 264 (1999) zzso zzso zzso complexes were detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso To identify these zzso cellular zzso we zzso zzso zzso interaction approaches using the complete zzso as zzso modified to eliminate zzso termination signals recognized by zzso zzso III, and identified several interactive clones from a zzso cell zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes, using zzso cell extracts and the modified zzso zzso were conducted prior to library zzso to verify appropriate interaction of zzso zzso zzso Over one million zzso were screened, and our zzso hybrid results indicate that the zzso interacts with several molecules involved in cellular zzso and zzso machinery, including the zzso zzso protein and the zzso protein gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso have verified the interaction of the zzso region with molecules zzso zzso to zzso recognizing the zzso zzso zzso
