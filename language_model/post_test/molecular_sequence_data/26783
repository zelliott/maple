Our purpose was to identify the sequence of zzso which zzso the zzso group of zzso a product formed by zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso is flanked by a gene zzso a putative zzso zzso The closest zzso zzso of this putative bacterial zzso is zzso zzso whose size and zzso acid composition were in good agreement with those reported for zzso rat liver zzso Mouse zzso 2 was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and shown to zzso the zzso of zzso and other known zzso of zzso No such activity was observed with mouse zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso 2 is zzso
