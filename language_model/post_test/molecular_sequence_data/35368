The mechanism of zzso is well described in zzso where it plays a role in diverse cellular zzso However, although different classes of zzso small zzso zzso have been identified in zzso their biological roles are poorly described due, in part, to the lack of zzso of zzso affected in the zzso of these zzso zzso proteins are one of the key components of the zzso zzso in which different members of this protein family participate in the zzso of a wide repertoire of zzso zzso Here we identified three zzso genes of the fungus zzso zzso and investigated their participation in zzso and zzso zzso We found that only one of the ago zzso zzso is involved in zzso during zzso growth and is required for both zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of distinct classes of zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso I and II zzso bind to zzso to control zzso zzso of the target protein coding zzso Class III zzso do not specifically bind to zzso but requires this protein for their production, revealing the complexity of the zzso pathways of zzso We also show that zzso is involved in the response to environmental signals, since zzso development and zzso induced by nutritional stress are affected in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that a single zzso protein zzso in the production of different classes of zzso that are generated through different zzso They also highlight the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso genes in zzso and expand the range of biological functions modulated by zzso
