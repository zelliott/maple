Progressive familial zzso zzso type 2 zzso patients have a zzso in the zzso zzso salt zzso The disease is caused by zzso in the zzso salt export pump zzso Ten different zzso zzso have been zzso In this study, we zzso the effect of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso transport zzso were performed with full-length mouse zzso zzso with and without the zzso zzso The effect on expression and zzso sorting was studied in zzso cells, zzso expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso did not significantly affect the zzso transport activity of zzso even though the zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein was slightly zzso zzso expression and zzso sorting were strongly affected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was only partly zzso and detected in both the zzso membrane and the zzso At 30 degrees C, the zzso zzso and protein levels were strongly increased, and the protein was predominantly zzso and efficiently targeted to the zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso patients with the zzso zzso express a functional, but highly zzso zzso zzso salt export zzso
