We have designed a zzso which allows the synthesis in zzso coli of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso truncated heavy chain zzso or zzso of an zzso inserted between zzso zzso and zzso of bacterial alkaline zzso zzso and the light chain of the same zzso We demonstrate the utility of this approach with the heavy and light chain zzso of a snake zzso zzso zzso M alpha zzso We show that the zzso hybrid and zzso are zzso expressed and exported to the zzso of zzso coli where they form a zzso zzso zzso The hybrid has the same affinity as M alpha 2-3 for the snake toxin zzso and possesses zzso zzso zzso
