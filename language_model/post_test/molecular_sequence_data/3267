Early studies found zzso sites in the zzso knockout zzso mouse brain, suggesting a zzso zzso of zzso or another zzso The discovery of zzso suggested that binding was due to zzso although questions about an zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso mice were generated and crossed with zzso mice, and zzso animals were used for in zzso binding studies with zzso The results revealed nuclear binding sites in the zzso zzso and zzso As the binding resembled the distribution of zzso we evaluated the presence of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso was identified in zzso brain and zzso but was absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected in regions of zzso brain where residual binding was zzso To ascertain the functionality of the zzso the regulation of zzso was assessed in zzso The results revealed that zzso significantly increased zzso zzso an indication that the zzso can regulate gene zzso These data demonstrate the presence and functionality of an zzso zzso in zzso brain and suggest that the residual binding and regulation of zzso in zzso brain can be accounted for by the zzso
