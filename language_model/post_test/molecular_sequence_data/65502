zzso zzso is one of the most accumulated zzso in zzso and water deficit conditions in zzso In the present study, we measured the Pro content, the activity and the expression level of delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a key regulatory zzso involved in the zzso of zzso in cactus pear zzso zzso subjected to 6, 9 and 11 days of salt zzso Treatment with zzso of zzso zzso young plants resulted in a decrease in the zzso thickness and root zzso and in a significant and gradual zzso of Pro in young zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, studied as zzso zzso was reduced at all times as a consequence of salt treatment, except at the sixth day at 75 and zzso of zzso where a slight increase was zzso We isolated an open reading frame zzso zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein exhibited zzso of identity with the zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene of zzso zzso was induced by salt stress at 9 and 11 days of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso gene expression was observed in zzso of cactus pear young zzso We observed an evident correlation between the transcript zzso and the Pro zzso under salt zzso however, these results do not parallel with the changes in zzso zzso zzso This Pro zzso might function as an zzso for the zzso zzso adjustment and might be playing a critical role in protecting zzso activity in zzso zzso plants under salt zzso
