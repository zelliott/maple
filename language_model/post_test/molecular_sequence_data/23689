zzso zzso an zzso fungus originally isolated from zzso zzso produces a mixture of volatile organic compounds zzso in culture and its spectrum of zzso activity is zzso Using the original isolate of zzso zzso as a selection zzso it has been possible to find other culturally and zzso unique zzso zzso of this zzso existing as zzso in a variety of other plant species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso growing in the northern reaches of the Northern zzso of zzso Interestingly, none of the new zzso had a culture zzso that was identical to the original zzso nevertheless each possessed zzso characteristics that resembled that zzso Furthermore, their zzso zzso sequences were zzso % identical to that of zzso zzso and the zzso were considered zzso zzso on the basis of the DNA sequence zzso However, the zzso produced by these new zzso greatly differed in quality from the original strain by virtue of the production of zzso zzso zzso and one or more other zzso In zzso with a range of test zzso including zzso and bacteria, each isolate possessed biological activity but the range of activity was zzso zzso zzso of some of the zzso zzso the effects of the zzso of the zzso The value of these observations to the biology and practical uses of zzso zzso in agriculture and other applications is zzso
