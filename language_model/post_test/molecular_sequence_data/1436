Previously, we identified a gene for a zzso nuclear zzso termed zzso that is expressed zzso in a restricted set of zzso in the zzso zzso In the present study, we identified another novel zzso termed zzso whose transcripts were localized to zzso in the whole zzso region of the zzso brain, as a candidate novel zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso transcripts were located in a distinct portion of a single neural nucleus, suggesting that they have distinct functions in brain zzso zzso cloning revealed that the zzso transcripts were up to 7 zzso in size, had zzso structures, and were alternatively zzso The reporter zzso using zzso zzso cells demonstrated that a zzso zzso sequence located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso end of zzso zzso had promoter zzso None of the alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso contained significant open reading zzso strongly suggesting that zzso transcripts function as novel zzso nuclear zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso revealed that zzso was expressed not only in the brain but also in the sex zzso in the queen and zzso and in the zzso zzso and zzso of the worker zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in diverse organ zzso Some of the zzso transcripts enriched in the zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso indicating the presence of zzso zzso transcripts in the zzso
