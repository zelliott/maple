The zzso cassette zzso A1 zzso shows a zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso As part of an ongoing study, we investigated the zzso promoter regions that are highly zzso between the human and zzso zzso zzso Using reporter gene zzso we show here that a zzso box 24 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site is essential for promoter activity in zzso zzso and zzso cells, whereas further enhancement of zzso activity is zzso by the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso shift zzso revealed in zzso binding of zzso to a zzso zzso motif as well as binding of zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso promoter zzso In zzso experiments using zzso zzso cells, we demonstrate that zzso competes with zzso for binding to the zzso zzso motif and acts as a zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and enhanced cellular cholesterol and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also show here that the zzso zzso at position zzso binds upstream zzso factors 1 and 2 and zzso nuclear factor zzso and that zzso of the zzso enhanced zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells, zzso a role for this element in zzso zzso zzso Besides the functional importance for zzso gene zzso we have identified that the core promoter region zzso to zzso is also responsible for the induction of zzso by the zzso zzso M, resulting in a rapid increase in zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso expression is not dependent on the currently known sequence motifs in the zzso zzso In conclusion, a functional complex of zzso within the zzso human zzso promoter associated with the zzso factors zzso upstream zzso factors 1 and 2, and zzso nuclear factor zzso has been zzso which allows a subtle zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso
