Previously we reported the existence of two distinct zzso in rainbow trout that zzso for separate zzso zzso each containing zzso zzso In the present study, we used rainbow trout to further characterize the zzso origin of zzso zzso a zzso hormone important in the regulation of growth, development, and metabolism of zzso A zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso was used for the isolation of selected zzso We amplified and zzso a zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso Based upon this sequence we designed a second zzso primer for zzso zzso which yielded a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso containing the complete zzso region, a single initiation site 118 bases from the most zzso end, and a single putative zzso site 17 bases from the most 3' end that was terminated with a zzso zzso The deduced protein is a zzso acid zzso zzso that contains a number of putative processing sites, potentially yielding a zzso acid zzso that could be processed further to a zzso acid zzso identical in structure to zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed that zzso was expressed in the zzso stomach, zzso and brain of rainbow zzso These results suggest a zzso origin of zzso possibly resulting from gene zzso events prior to the divergence of zzso
