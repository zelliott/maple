zzso zzso zzso the zzso formation of zzso in the zzso precursor protein by transferring the zzso zzso of zzso This zzso has recently been shown to be essential for cell viability and growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 151 zzso We have zzso and characterized the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso had a specific activity of zzso to zzso zzso per zzso per zzso of zzso and recognized both the zzso precursor proteins almost equally as judged from their similar zzso and zzso zzso zzso exclusion zzso and zzso indicated that the active form of the zzso is a zzso consisting of zzso zzso The zzso showed a strict specificity for its zzso zzso zzso and zzso precursor zzso Among all the zzso tested, only zzso showed a protective effect against heat zzso of the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso some zzso change in the zzso zzso exhibited a strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a moderate competitive zzso The competitive zzso by zzso was zzso with compounds resembling zzso in carbon chain zzso zzso inhibited the zzso strongly in a competitive manner zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso did not inhibit the zzso or act as a zzso A zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso (by Western zzso of this zzso with the crude extracts varied depending on the source, indicating species zzso
