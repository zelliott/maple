We have recently reported on the design of a zzso zzso able to form a significant population of a zzso up-and-down zzso zzso in zzso zzso To improve our zzso model in terms of the folded population, we have modified the sequences of the two zzso turns by introducing the segment zzso a sequence shown to lead to more rigid type zzso zzso The analysis of several zzso zzso zzso data, as well as zzso zzso and zzso values, demonstrates that the new zzso forms a zzso structure in zzso solution more stable than the original one, whereas the substitution of the zzso zzso by zzso leads to a random zzso zzso This agrees with previous results on zzso peptides showing the essential role of the turn sequence for zzso zzso The zzso zzso motif calculated for the new designed zzso zzso zzso for backbone atoms is zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a high degree of zzso This twist likely contributes to stability, as a more zzso surface is buried in the twisted zzso than in a zzso zzso The twist observed in the up-and-down zzso zzso motifs of most proteins is less pronounced than in our designed zzso except for the WW zzso The additional zzso surface burial provided by zzso twisting relative to a zzso zzso is probably more important for structure stability in peptides and small proteins like the WW zzso than in larger proteins for which there exists a significant contribution to stability arising from their extensive zzso zzso
