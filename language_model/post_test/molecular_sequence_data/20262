Laboratory and field studies have indicated that zzso ammonium zzso zzso is an important process in the marine nitrogen zzso In this study 11 additional zzso marine zzso and water column samples were studied to substantiate this zzso In a combined approach using the molecular methods, zzso chain reaction zzso qualitative and quantitative zzso in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso stable isotope activity zzso it was shown that zzso bacteria were present and active in all samples zzso The zzso activity measured in the zzso samples ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Ocean, Costa zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso (North Sea, zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cell of the total population zzso with zzso as assessed by quantitative FISH was highest in the zzso Sea zzso zzso zzso and in most of the samples well over zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso products derived from the marine samples indicated the exclusive presence of members of the zzso zzso This study showed the ubiquitous presence of zzso bacteria in zzso marine zzso supporting previous observations on the importance of zzso for N cycling in marine zzso
