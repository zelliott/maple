The solution structures of three related peptides zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to the zzso region of the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso loop have been investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso the native zzso is less effective in zzso zzso zzso calcium release channels than zzso zzso to Ala zzso zzso A9, zzso does not activate zzso zzso A1 and zzso are zzso from their N zzso to zzso but are generally zzso from zzso to the C zzso The basic zzso zzso essential for A1 zzso of zzso zzso are located at the zzso end of the zzso zzso A9 was found to be zzso zzso between A1 and zzso were observed in the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso which was less ordered in zzso and in the zzso region of the zzso which exhibited greater flexibility in zzso zzso low energy models suggest that an zzso interaction between the zzso oxygen of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso is lost with the zzso zzso The results show that the more structured peptides are more effective in zzso zzso zzso
