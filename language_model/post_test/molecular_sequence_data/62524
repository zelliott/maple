We have isolated a zzso zzso from culture fluid of zzso zzso grown in a defined medium containing 150 zzso m zzso by zzso and gel zzso zzso zzso has a molecular mass of 58 zzso as determined by zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain were used to generate zzso fragments zzso a portion of the zzso protein and zzso was used to obtain full-length zzso zzso The zzso of zzso contained an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence from zzso to zzso corresponded to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso The first 24 zzso acids are presumed to be a signal zzso The expression of zzso is regulated at the zzso level by copper and various aromatic zzso zzso analysis of gene zzso in zzso zzso grown on zzso revealed that, apart from during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso was expressed at every stage of the mushroom zzso cycle defined in this study, although the levels of zzso varied considerably depending upon the zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased sharply during the latter phase of zzso colonization and reached maximum levels during the very early stages zzso formation, zzso zzso of fruit body zzso Gene expression then declined to approximately zzso of peak levels throughout the subsequent stages of zzso zzso
