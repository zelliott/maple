We successfully zzso zzso a zzso zzso binding protein zzso of the tiger zzso zzso zzso Tiger zzso was injected zzso with zzso zzso body zzso and zzso was zzso from serum by ammonium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso has a molecular mass of approximately zzso and contains at least zzso zzso The deduced 212 zzso acid sequence of the protein showed the highest identity zzso 212 zzso acid overlap and zzso zzso with zzso protein type 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the gene structure of zzso suggests that this protein belongs to the zzso zzso which may be important in the zzso and elimination of zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso of zzso has occurred during evolution, and that the functions of this group of proteins might be important for fish zzso
