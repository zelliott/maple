Previous observations have demonstrated that embryonic exposure to the zzso zzso zzso during zzso sex determination promotes zzso adult onset disease such as male infertility, kidney disease, prostate disease, immune abnormalities and tumor zzso The current study investigates zzso promoter DNA zzso zzso in the zzso of F3 generation rats whose zzso generation mother was exposed to zzso A zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso followed by a promoter tilling zzso zzso procedure was used to identify 52 different regions with statistically significant altered zzso in the zzso promoter zzso Mass zzso zzso analysis was used to map the zzso DNA zzso and 16 differential DNA zzso regions were confirmed, while the remainder could not be analyzed due to zzso technical zzso Analysis of these validated regions identified a consensus DNA sequence zzso that associated with zzso of the zzso Interestingly, only zzso of a random set of 125 promoters contained this zzso One candidate promoter zzso was found to be due to a copy number variation zzso and not a zzso change, suggesting initial zzso in the zzso zzso may promote genetic abnormalities such as induced zzso in later zzso This study identifies differential DNA zzso sites in promoter regions three generations after the initial exposure and identifies common zzso features present in these zzso In addition to primary zzso a potential indirect genetic zzso was identified, and both are zzso to be involved in the zzso zzso inheritance zzso This study confirms that an environmental agent has the ability to induce zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso
