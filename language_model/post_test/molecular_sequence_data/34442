zzso for electron transfer within microbial zzso derived from an zzso zzso sludge blanket reactor converting zzso waste to methane were investigated in order to better understand the function of zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso higher than the zzso previously reported for zzso zzso of zzso species in which the two species appeared to exchange electrons via zzso electron zzso The temperature dependence response of the zzso zzso was characteristic of the organic zzso zzso previously described for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and was inconsistent with electron zzso through zzso Studies in which zzso were incubated with high zzso of potential electron donors demonstrated that the zzso had no significant capacity for conversion of hydrogen to zzso The zzso converted zzso to methane but at rates too low to account for the rates at which that the zzso zzso zzso ethanol, an important component of the reactor zzso zzso species comprised zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences recovered from the zzso suggesting that zzso species may have contributed to some but probably not all of the zzso zzso zzso most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso accounted for more than zzso of the sequences that could be assigned to methane producers, consistent with the poor capacity for hydrogen and zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that zzso wastewater zzso can be zzso zzso and suggest that direct zzso electron transfer could be an important mechanism for electron exchange in some zzso zzso
