We analyzed the factor zzso zzso gene of a patient with zzso zzso zzso and identified a novel zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso was an zzso zzso Japanese female with abnormal zzso test, discovered by zzso The zzso activity and zzso level were both under zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene revealed a zzso zzso substitution G zzso C in zzso 12, resulting in the zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso zzso We constructed the zzso zzso zzso in an expression zzso zzso and zzso it into Chinese zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the culture medium by zzso zzso but the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso On the other hand, both the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso as estimated by western zzso and quantitative reverse zzso chain zzso These findings suggest that the zzso substitution of zzso zzso zzso processing of the protein and/or transport zzso
