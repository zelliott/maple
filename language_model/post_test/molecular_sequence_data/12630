We have studied the DNA sequence elements of the zzso zzso class II A beta gene involved in zzso regulation in zzso For this study, the A beta promoter was fused to the human growth hormone gene and zzso into bone zzso zzso These zzso were zzso by zzso zzso after which cellular zzso was zzso for the amount of human growth hormone zzso A zzso to zzso zzso of the A beta promoter was found to be sufficient to zzso positive regulation by zzso zzso was suppressed by bacterial zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso bovine serum zzso zzso zzso were made within each of the zzso sequence elements of the promoter as well as within the zzso regions between these zzso All four zzso sequences found in class II zzso the zzso zzso zzso and Y zzso were found to be essential for promoter zzso in zzso
