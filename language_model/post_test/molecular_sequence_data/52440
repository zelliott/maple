Although gamma delta T zzso were identified several years ago, the functional importance of these cells remains to be zzso gamma delta T cells of zzso are unique in two zzso First, they are present at much higher levels compared to man and zzso Second, zzso zzso gamma delta T cells uniquely express a 220 zzso surface zzso recognized by a panel of zzso recently clustered as zzso zzso has been most extensively studied in sheep with the use of the zzso zzso Here, we report on the isolation of a full length zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso from a zzso cell zzso expression library prepared from a bovine gamma delta T cell zzso The protein zzso by the zzso zzso clone was zzso with the bovine zzso zzso and zzso and with zzso The zzso clone consisted of zzso zzso and contained a single long open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone zzso a type 1 integral membrane protein with an zzso domain consisting of 11 scavenger zzso zzso with zzso to zzso and zzso Southern zzso suggested that the bovine zzso contained multiple sequences highly related to the isolated zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sequences were present in the zzso of all zzso tested including mouse and zzso The molecular characterization of the zzso zzso as reported here provides a starting point for the definition of its role in gamma delta T cell zzso
