The zzso protein zzso from zzso coli is involved in DNA zzso and in processes such as DNA repair and zzso Its participation in these events is reflected in its ability to bend DNA and in its preferred binding to DNA junctions and DNA with zzso zzso zzso zzso is unique in its ability to zzso its zzso from double strand breaks incurred after exposure to zzso zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso binds zzso only to DNA zzso with zzso zzso of 18 zzso In distinct contrast to zzso zzso zzso does not exhibit a marked preference for DNA with nicks or gaps compared to perfect duplex DNA, nor is it able to mediate zzso of linear duplex zzso These unexpected properties identify zzso as the first member of the zzso protein family not to serve an architectural role and point to its potential participation in DNA zzso zzso Our data also point to a mechanism zzso differential target site selection by zzso proteins is achieved and suggest that the zzso specificity of zzso proteins should be expected to vary as a consequence of their individual capacity for inducing the required DNA zzso
