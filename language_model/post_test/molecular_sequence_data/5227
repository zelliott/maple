Group II zzso use zzso reverse zzso zzso and DNA zzso activities for zzso zzso into zzso zzso the zzso are zzso complexes in which the excised zzso zzso zzso the sense strand of the recipient DNA by reverse zzso while the zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso Here, studies with the zzso group II zzso zzso indicate that both the zzso and protein components of the zzso contribute to recognition of an approximately 30 zzso DNA target zzso Our results lead to a model in which the protein component first recognizes specific zzso in the most zzso zzso zzso region of the DNA target site zzso to zzso zzso of the protein then leads to DNA zzso enabling the zzso zzso to base pair to a 13 zzso DNA sequence zzso to zzso for reverse zzso zzso zzso requires additional interactions of the protein with the 3' zzso DNA zzso to zzso Our results show how zzso can use zzso and protein zzso zzso to recognize specific sequences in zzso zzso
