High rates of zzso zzso by brown zzso tissue accompanied by additional shivering zzso in skeletal muscle provide the powerful zzso of body zzso that allows zzso zzso to return from their state of cold zzso back to zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that changes to brown zzso zzso occur during hibernation and are partially responsible for its capacity for zzso zzso The current study shows that selected zzso zzso activities are elevated and selected genes and proteins are induced during zzso in brown zzso tissue of the little brown bat, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in brown zzso tissue was more than zzso higher during zzso than in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso higher during zzso as evidenced by northern zzso By contrast, transcripts of these genes were unchanged in skeletal muscle during zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso an zzso embedded in the outer membrane of the zzso that is the zzso step zzso in zzso were also elevated by zzso during zzso in brown zzso but were unchanged in skeletal zzso Cloning and sequencing of a 624 zzso segment of zzso revealed a number of zzso acid zzso in the bat protein as compared to zzso from other zzso these may be beneficial for zzso function at low body temperatures during zzso This study provides further evidence for a key role of zzso in zzso
