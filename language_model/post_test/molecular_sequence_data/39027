Several highly zzso sequences are present in the beta block of the zzso especially zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is now apparent that the zzso of zzso is of the same order as that of zzso zzso and -C and it has been suggested that zzso could explain some of the disease associations previously attributed to zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequences demonstrates relationships with zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso do not appear to be associated with either zzso or zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso have evolved in concert from their common ancestors and that the zzso zzso have arisen independently and more zzso zzso disease associations will need to be reviewed in the light of mechanisms such as zzso binding and zzso
