In this work, we approach the impact of dynamic and zzso disorder on DNA charge transfer from a theoretical and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso are either realized via molecular dynamics simulations using a classical force field or by zzso determined DNA zzso zzso We apply a chemically specific, zzso resolved extended zzso model to zzso the energy parameters relevant to DNA charge zzso For both models studied here, the effective zzso zzso hence the charge transfer zzso depend upon the zzso Dynamic disorder leads to a correlation time in this quantity of the order of 30 zzso and the transfer rates universally exhibit a zzso yet zzso exponential zzso For DNA zzso the angle characterizing the zzso controls the charge transfer zzso The results are discussed and extensively compared to experimental findings and other zzso
