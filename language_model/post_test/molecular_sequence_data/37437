The zzso characteristics of rat and human zzso zzso zzso rat zzso and human zzso were investigated by measuring zzso values of 11 known zzso zzso using zzso zzso as zzso Like zzso all rat zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso values ranging between 78 and 145 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso To zzso observed differences in the zzso determined zzso values, zzso models of the zzso zzso were zzso A zzso model of zzso was generated on the basis of zzso rabbit zzso and was validated on its ability to reproduce binding zzso corresponding to zzso profiles of the zzso and to remain stable during unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations at 300 zzso Twenty-two active site zzso sharing up to 59% sequence identity, were identified in the zzso binding pockets and included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso potential calculations displayed large differences in the negative charge of the zzso active sites, which was consistent with observed differences in absolute zzso zzso MD studies on the binding mode of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso concurred well with zzso determined zzso values and zzso zzso The current study thus provides new insights into differences in the active site zzso of the investigated zzso zzso
