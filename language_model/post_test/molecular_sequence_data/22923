zzso family members mediate zzso zzso signaling in the common skin cancer, zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is rapidly induced by zzso in zzso and is zzso with zzso in human hair zzso and skin zzso In the current study, we generated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso composed of the zzso domain and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso blocked the activity of zzso Snail on the zzso zzso Snail zzso zzso by zzso or by one of several short hairpin zzso inhibited transformation of zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso enforced expression of Snail promoted transformation in zzso by zzso but not by other genes that were tested, including zzso zzso and zzso As observed for zzso zzso Snail zzso zzso in zzso cells and induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of a conditional zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of mouse skin led to rapid zzso of Snail transcripts and to cell proliferation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso skin zzso exhibited molecular similarities to zzso including loss of zzso The results identify Snail as a zzso zzso of transformation in zzso and an early zzso gene in the zzso
