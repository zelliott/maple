Four consecutive T zzso in the sense strand are sufficient to terminate zzso by zzso zzso III zzso zzso Previously we observed that compared with this minimally sufficient zzso five T zzso immediately preceded by a zzso sequence increases zzso expression both in zzso and in zzso raising the question of whether a zzso sequence has a role in pol III zzso Here we observe that zzso zzso which eliminate the zzso symmetry of the zzso sequence decrease zzso zzso Similar effects are observed whether zzso symmetry is eliminated in regions of the zzso which are zzso or zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso at either site to restore zzso symmetry rescue zzso zzso These observations suggest that a higher order structure, such as a zzso zzso immediately preceding the zzso increases pol III zzso zzso
