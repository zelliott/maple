zzso disease zzso one of the most common inherited zzso disorders, is an excellent candidate for gene therapy using zzso stem cells as zzso Animal models have demonstrated the feasibility of introducing the human zzso zzso gene into zzso zzso with long term expression using a variety of zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated the expression and integration of the human zzso gene in mouse zzso zzso and their progeny zzso months post transplant in primary recipients using the zzso zzso zzso We now demonstrate zzso expression in peripheral blood zzso of secondary recipients more than 12 months post zzso We also show a zzso efficiency of up to zzso in colony forming zzso zzso zzso colonies generated from zzso zzso cells from a variety of sources, using a zzso promoted infection zzso zzso has also been documented in long term culture initiating cells zzso from the same zzso zzso zzso These data indicate efficient zzso of mouse zzso zzso as well as human zzso cells using the zzso zzso zzso
