The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from tomato zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso The genes were organized in a tandem array with approximately 6 zzso separating their coding zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels in conjunction with nuclear zzso experiments indicated that zzso genes were primarily under zzso control after wounding and infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso genes were zzso after pathogen zzso The sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso regions were determined and several potential regulatory motifs were zzso zzso protection studies revealed that zzso and zzso had short zzso zzso regions zzso both genes were expressed after zzso and zzso zzso were zzso more abundant than zzso zzso While the region surrounding zzso was zzso the zzso and zzso regions of zzso had zzso in two zzso tomato zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were examined in two zzso and five zzso zzso The zzso and zzso and zzso zzso proteins were detected in healthy and wounded leaves of all plants zzso The zzso proteins were only detected in zzso and their zzso was distinct from that observed in zzso
