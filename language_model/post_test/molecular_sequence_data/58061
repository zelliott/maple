zzso zzso zzso functions as a second zzso for many zzso hormones and growth zzso It causes the release of zzso from zzso stores by binding to specific receptors that are coupled to zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that there is a family of zzso zzso and the complete sequences of two members of this family and partial sequences of two others have been zzso We have determined the complete sequence of a third zzso zzso designated zzso and characterized its pharmacological properties and sites of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso acids in size, has 62 and zzso identity with zzso and zzso and is predicted to have a similar structure including a region of eight potential zzso segments at its zzso zzso which presumably functions as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso rat zzso in zzso cells showed that it bound zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies of cells expressing zzso zzso indicated that it has a preferential cellular distribution in the zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso studies indicate that zzso is expressed in a number of different cultured cell lines including zzso zzso zzso The zzso is also expressed in adult pancreatic zzso zzso gastrointestinal zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in adult rat pancreatic zzso indicated that zzso was the zzso zzso expressed in this tissue and thus may be responsible for zzso the effects of zzso on insulin zzso
