The zzso gene sine zzso zzso a nuclear zzso that is required for eye development, has several zzso in zzso (the SIX gene zzso Among them, zzso is considered to be the functional zzso of so because it is strongly expressed in the developing zzso However, embryonic zzso expression is not limited to the eye field, and zzso has been found to be zzso in some patients with zzso type 2 zzso suggesting that zzso has wide implications in head zzso We report here the cloning and characterization of zzso a novel human SIX gene that is the zzso of the chick zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso and is expressed in the developing and adult human zzso Data from chick and mouse suggest that the human zzso gene is also expressed in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso spans zzso zzso of zzso DNA and is split in two zzso that are transcribed into a zzso zzso zzso mapping of zzso revealed that it is closely linked to zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso which provides clues about the origin and evolution of the zzso SIX zzso Recently three independent reports have associated zzso deletions at zzso with bilateral zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of one of these cases demonstrated zzso zzso strongly suggesting that zzso zzso is responsible for these zzso zzso
