zzso cell zzso involves a complex series of zzso events, including repeated invasion of basement zzso Studies from several laboratories have implicated tumor cell zzso and migration in response to zzso as a major contributing factor in tumor cell zzso The current studies address the direct role of type IV collagen in promoting tumor cell zzso zzso and zzso The observations of type IV zzso cellular behavior are contrasted with cellular behavior on type I zzso The highly zzso zzso zzso melanoma cell line zzso spread, and migrated in response to type IV collagen in a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso fragments of type IV collagen demonstrated that melanoma cells interact with multiple zzso of this zzso zzso zzso melanoma cells zzso spread, and exhibited zzso behavior in response to zzso to 200 zzso zzso of a zzso zzso triple zzso domain of type IV zzso In contrast, cells zzso and spread but were essentially zzso in response to a zzso major zzso domain of the zzso In addition, de zzso protein synthesis was required for cell zzso to the major zzso domain, whereas zzso to the zzso domain was less dependent upon de zzso protein zzso zzso zzso peptides were used to study the zzso and spreading of melanoma cells on type IV zzso The results demonstrated that a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso has virtually no effect on melanoma cell zzso on type IV zzso zzso whereas this zzso inhibited melanoma cell zzso to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso was zzso for zzso zzso cell zzso to type IV collagen was significantly zzso zzso The zzso zzso virtually eliminated cell zzso on zzso coated with type I zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso and migration of melanoma cells on type IV collagen have a complex molecular basis which is partially dependent on zzso zzso
