zzso fiber formation is associated with diseases ranging from Alzheimer's to type II zzso For many systems, including zzso zzso zzso zzso from type II diabetes, zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso Paradoxically, zzso fibers are beta sheet rich while zzso states are zzso Here, a small zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso is shown to inhibit zzso zzso of zzso and to rescue zzso toxicity in cell zzso zzso zzso interactions zzso to the putative zzso region of zzso revealing that zzso states are on zzso to fiber zzso zzso is not normally zzso as its zzso partner, insulin, prevents zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso is synergistic with zzso zzso therefore represents a new approach to zzso zzso as the target is an assembly intermediate that may additionally restore functional zzso zzso
