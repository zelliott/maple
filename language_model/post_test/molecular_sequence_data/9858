zzso zzso zzso lacking light chains occur naturally in zzso We now show the feasibility of zzso a zzso cloning the repertoire of the variable zzso of its zzso zzso and zzso leading to the successful identification of minimum sized zzso zzso The zzso zzso are expressed well in zzso coli, extremely stable, highly zzso and react specifically and with high affinity to the zzso This approach can be viewed as a general route to obtain small zzso with zzso characteristics and valuable perspectives as modular building blocks to manufacture zzso or zzso zzso zzso
