Among the zzso family of zzso zzso is a group of bacterial zzso that posses zzso extensions involved in outer membrane zzso or zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of this group, has been expressed in zzso coli and was resistant to zzso zzso when the zzso was added to whole cells, indicating a zzso zzso The five consensus blocks zzso within all zzso zzso were identified in zzso by multiple sequence alignment and separated from the zzso zzso The DNA sequence spanning the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and hence representing the zzso zzso of zzso was amplified by zzso and fused in frame to the transport zzso of the zzso zzso The resulting artificial zzso called zzso was zzso in the cell envelope of zzso coli and was shown to be active by the use of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso in an zzso activity stain after sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Surface exposure of zzso was indicated by its accessibility to zzso added to whole zzso The zzso activity of whole cells displaying zzso was determined by a pH zzso zzso and by the use of zzso with integrated zzso optical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as zzso and it turned out that the zzso preferences of artificial zzso were altered in comparison to original zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso in combination with pH sensor zzso can provide a new platform technology for the screening of zzso zzso zzso
