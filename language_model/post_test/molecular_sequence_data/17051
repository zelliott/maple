A zzso zzso containing two complete major zzso complex zzso class I alpha chain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was isolated, fully zzso and zzso This sequence represents the largest zzso zzso sequence reported for the zzso region of a zzso zzso Based on particular zzso zzso acid zzso and limited expression zzso the two zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso appear to zzso functional zzso zzso The two coding regions are zzso identical at the zzso zzso however, their promoter regions differ zzso Two zzso islands present in the zzso sequence zzso to the two coding zzso Twelve zzso and six zzso were also present in the zzso The zzso share highest sequence zzso to the zzso family of zzso Due to high sequence identity, it is very likely that zzso and zzso zzso are products of recent gene zzso that occurred less than 4 million years zzso
