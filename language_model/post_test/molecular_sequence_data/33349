zzso A virus zzso zzso and the influenza B virus zzso are both small integral membrane proteins that form zzso zzso zzso zzso A virus zzso channel is the target of the zzso drug zzso (and its zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso channel activity is not affected by the zzso The atomic structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso and of a larger zzso zzso by zzso methods zzso and zzso zzso Nature zzso The zzso data show electron density (at zzso A zzso in the channel zzso consistent with zzso blocking the pore of the zzso In contrast, the zzso data show 4 zzso molecules bound on the outside of the zzso toward the zzso side of the zzso Drug binding includes interactions with zzso zzso and a polar hydrogen bond between zzso and zzso acid zzso 44 zzso These 2 distinct zzso sites led to 2 incompatible drug zzso zzso We have generated zzso channels between zzso zzso and zzso zzso designed to define the zzso zzso Two zzso containing 5 zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso TM domain show zzso zzso sensitivity and specific activity comparable to that of zzso zzso These functional data suggest that the zzso binding site identified on the outside of the 4 zzso is not the primary site associated with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
