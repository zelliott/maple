Internal symmetry in proteins is likely to be the footprint of evolution by gene zzso and zzso Like other symmetrical zzso zzso which are made of zzso zzso units zzso zzso arranged around a central tunnel, have probably evolved by zzso and fusion of a zzso repetitive zzso However, zzso the evolution of functional zzso by zzso and fusion of repeated units remains a challenge, in particular, because the repeated units must jointly pack to form one zzso core while maintaining intact active zzso As model for generating repeat zzso we chose zzso highly symmetrical zzso zzso zzso with five zzso zzso We report the engineering of folded and functional zzso by zzso and fusion of repetitive sequence zzso taken from zzso The repeated zzso comprise three strands of one blade plus one strand of the next zzso thus enabling the closure of the zzso ring via zzso zzso zzso zzso and fusion of five zzso with the same sequence gave rise to a highly zzso zzso yet its soluble fraction exhibited zzso zzso zzso a library of diversified sequence zzso fused in tandem was selected by zzso display for zzso zzso A range of new zzso were isolated with binding and zzso properties that resemble those of zzso zzso These results demonstrate the ability to construct folded and functional zzso repeat zzso and support the role of zzso and fusion of elementary zzso in the evolutionary routes that led to the zzso zzso
