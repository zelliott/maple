zzso zzso factors belonging to the zzso family are essential zzso factors consisting of an zzso zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso They are believed to be involved in alternative zzso of numerous transcripts because their expression levels can influence zzso site zzso We have characterized the structure and zzso regulation of the gene for the smallest member of the zzso family, zzso zzso called zzso The mouse gene zzso zzso termed zzso consists of one alternative zzso and six zzso zzso and was mapped to a zzso zzso on zzso zzso When cells are zzso with zzso zzso DNA, both standard and alternatively spliced transcripts and corresponding proteins are zzso Interestingly, in starved zzso cells, the amount of zzso zzso containing the alternative zzso is large, whereas the amount of the standard zzso zzso without the alternative zzso is zzso When starved cells are zzso with serum, the alternative form is lost and the standard form is zzso These results suggest that zzso could be regulated during the cell cycle and that this could be, at least in part, due to regulated expression of zzso zzso zzso with this, experiments with synchronized cells showed an induction of zzso transcripts in late zzso or early zzso We have also characterized the promoter of zzso It lies within a zzso zzso island and contains two consensus binding sites for zzso a zzso factor thought to be involved in regulating the cell zzso These motifs may be functional since reporter zzso with the zzso promoter can be zzso by zzso with zzso expression zzso
