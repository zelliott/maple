To determine what effect maturation promoting factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has on zzso distribution during zzso zzso zzso and zzso we altered Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso (the N zzso such that it cannot be zzso by zzso As expected, the zzso expressed zzso N protein showed no apparent zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, even after zzso shock and recovery to quickly zzso and then reassemble zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, the N protein localized to the zzso sheath and the zzso as is typical for zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso the N protein also maintained its association with persistent zzso characteristic of zzso Chinese zzso lung zzso zzso In synchronized zzso cells, the N protein again localized to the zzso sheath and the zzso as zzso zzso during zzso In zzso cell zzso the N protein localized normally to zzso zzso within the zzso and zzso bodies within reforming zzso The observations indicate that zzso zzso is not essential for zzso zzso to the zzso sheath and the zzso during zzso and zzso and that functional zzso zzso sites are not essential for zzso zzso during zzso
