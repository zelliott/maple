zzso is a central zzso of zzso allergic inflammation and is critical for the induction of zzso zzso Common zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso in populations of distinct ethnic zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso expression by human zzso T cells is paralleled by extensive zzso locus zzso which results in the appearance of multiple zzso I hypersensitive zzso Among these, zzso in the zzso promoter is zzso in both zzso and polarized zzso and zzso cells, and spans a common single zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly associated with total serum zzso zzso We recently characterized zzso as a novel zzso element that zzso zzso zzso in activated human and zzso T zzso Here we show that zzso is a functional zzso that significantly enhances zzso zzso expression by creating a binding site for the zzso factor zzso Of note, zzso zzso was zzso recruited to the zzso risk zzso in primary zzso T cells from zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cells from zzso mice, but not from zzso mice, demonstrating that increased activity was exquisitely dependent on zzso levels of zzso Our results illustrate how a functional zzso in a regulatory element enhances zzso of an zzso zzso thereby modulating disease zzso
