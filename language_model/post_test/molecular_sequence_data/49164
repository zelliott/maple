The lineage leading to zzso is one of the few major zzso zzso groups in which zzso heavy chain zzso structure has not been investigated at the genetic zzso In this study, we have characterized three different zzso heavy chain zzso of the African zzso zzso zzso including an zzso heavy chain and short and long forms of zzso heavy zzso Northern zzso analysis as well as patterns of zzso zzso suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso are likely zzso in separate zzso The two zzso zzso identified in zzso share structural features with the short and long forms of zzso zzso to zzso as zzso which were previously considered to be restricted to the zzso zzso It seems that the zzso zzso has a far broader zzso distribution than considered originally and raises questions with regard to the origin and evolutionary divergence of zzso and zzso Moreover, its absence in other zzso lineages implies paradoxically that the zzso genes were lost from zzso and zzso zzso
