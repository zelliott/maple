Similar to zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso rich zzso cells in zzso skin and zzso are also responsible for zzso zzso and acid zzso zzso However, the zzso transport pathways in zzso cells are still zzso In the present study, we tested the hypothesis if there are specific zzso members involved in zzso zzso transport pathways in zzso zzso Fourteen zzso were identified in the zzso zzso family, and the full-length zzso of two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso signals of zzso and zzso were mainly detected in certain groups of zzso in zzso zzso Further double zzso or in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso but not zzso was localized to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso environments zzso the zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso with specific zzso caused significant decreases in both the whole body zzso content and the skin zzso activity in the zzso On the basis of these results, it was concluded that zzso but not zzso is involved in the zzso transport pathways in zzso zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso
