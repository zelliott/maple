Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of four zzso zzso DNA zzso and may be an important element in the cellular response to zzso aromatic zzso such as zzso which can lead to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we present a detailed analysis of the activity and specificity of zzso zzso bypass opposite the major zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso in an zzso fashion by inserting mainly zzso Analysis of zzso zzso shows diminished zzso for zzso and zzso zzso indicative of zzso complex formation, but zzso zzso events that do occur are zzso more efficient than zzso zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso DNA reveal zzso zzso and zzso alignments of incoming zzso and zzso zzso limitations placed upon the zzso zzso by interactions between the zzso and finger zzso combined with stabilization of the zzso template zzso through the side chain of zzso both appear to contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the little finger domain of zzso zzso to zzso zzso the zzso opposite zzso toward more accurate zzso similar to previous findings with zzso Our structural and activity data provide insight into important zzso aspects of zzso bypass of zzso by zzso zzso compared with accurate and efficient bypass of the zzso by zzso and zzso zzso
