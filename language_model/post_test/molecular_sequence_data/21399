zzso of unknown significance zzso complicate the assignment of risk to new DNA sequence zzso found in zzso zzso This study focused on the poorly studied zzso region of the zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso twelve through zzso of zzso To develop a new method to characterize zzso in this region of zzso we first chose to study 4 reported zzso occurring on zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso To determine if these zzso represent neutral changes or if they impact the function of the zzso zzso we zzso zzso expression plasmids zzso zzso or each zzso zzso into zzso breast cancer cells, which are zzso for zzso Four zzso zzso expressing cell lines and a zzso zzso region expressing cell line next were studied by challenging zzso cell lines with the DNA zzso compound zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region and certain zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso decreased zzso (as demonstrated by cell death detection zzso in zzso cell lines, indicating that the zzso region zzso directly or indirectly affects the DNA damage repair zzso By determining the cell survival and zzso the zzso index of treated cell lines, one could potentially use this screen to determine that a particular zzso has a functional impact on zzso function, and hence is of functional zzso We conclude that this method is useful for screening the effect of zzso region zzso on zzso function, and to identify zzso for further zzso We also conclude that zzso in the zzso region may have zzso unappreciated roles in zzso zzso
