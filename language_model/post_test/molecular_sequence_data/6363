zzso is an integral membrane protein of the zzso zzso zzso that binds zzso to a wide array of newly zzso membrane and zzso zzso It also exhibits prolonged binding to zzso or incompletely folded zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso functions as a molecular zzso to facilitate the folding and assembly of proteins in the zzso It is also a component of the quality control system that prevents proteins from progressing along the zzso zzso until they have acquired proper zzso or zzso zzso Most proteins that are zzso into the zzso are zzso at zzso zzso and zzso interactions are almost exclusively restricted to proteins that possess this zzso zzso The preference for zzso resides in zzso ability to function as a zzso with specificity for the zzso zzso an early intermediate in the processing of zzso zzso zzso also has the capacity to bind to zzso segments of unfolded zzso Available evidence suggests that zzso zzso its zzso property during initial capture of a newly zzso zzso and that subsequent association (and zzso zzso is zzso through zzso zzso Unlike other molecular zzso that are soluble zzso zzso is an intrinsic component of the zzso zzso Its unique ability to capture unfolded zzso through their large zzso zzso may have evolved as a means to overcome accessibility problems imposed by being constrained within a zzso zzso
