A new zzso sequence designated zzso was cloned using an zzso technique from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso previously reported to produce multiple zzso proteins zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence revealed an ORF, zzso zzso zzso peculiar for such zzso a translation initiation element and a putative zzso zzso Nevertheless, its product was not previously found in the zzso of the host strain zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shows its weak or absent natural zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso by the continuous reading frame of zzso is not identical but is essentially similar to the other zzso of the zzso zzso An zzso sequence was found 400 zzso downstream of the zzso stop zzso and a zzso of the zzso gene was located 3 zzso upstream of its zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso expression of the cloned gene in zzso coli under the control of the zzso promoter allowed us to obtain its hypothetical protein zzso
