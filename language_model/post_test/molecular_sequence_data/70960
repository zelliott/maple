The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a gene on zzso I that encodes a hypothetical zzso zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso has been cloned and the protein has been zzso from zzso coli with a yield of 10 zzso of zzso of zzso zzso composed of 210 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of 23 zzso zzso behaves as a zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso S as determined by zzso zzso The effective zzso radius is about 29 A as determined by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whose expression was detected in zzso zzso by Western zzso is an zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso being the preferred zzso The major reaction products are zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso and zzso from zzso zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso are 19 zzso and 22 zzso respectively, and the corresponding values of zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso has limited activity on zzso and negligible activity on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso with decreasing activity in order from zzso to zzso zzso activity with zzso as zzso is observed at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso and it is the first zzso identified with this specific zzso specificity and reaction zzso
