zzso is required for membrane zzso zzso zzso and the biological activity of key regulatory zzso such as Ras small zzso and protein zzso in a wide range of zzso In this report, we describe the molecular identification of a plant protein zzso zzso and evidence for its role in the control of the cell cycle in zzso A pea gene zzso a zzso of the zzso beta zzso was previously cloned using a zzso chain zzso zzso A similar approach was used to clone a pea gene zzso a zzso of the zzso alpha zzso The zzso function of the pea zzso zzso was demonstrated by the zzso of zzso zzso activity using zzso fusion proteins zzso in zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analyses showed that levels of zzso zzso are generally higher in zzso such as those of zzso that are active in cell zzso The relationship of zzso to cell division was further analyzed during the growth of zzso tobacco zzso zzso A zzso fluctuation of zzso zzso activity preceded corresponding changes in zzso activity at the early log phase of cell zzso Moreover, zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso was effective in zzso zzso and growth in these zzso Using synchronized zzso cells, zzso completely blocked zzso when added at the early S phase but not when added at the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is required for the plant cell cycle, perhaps by modulating the progression through the S phase and the transition from zzso to the S zzso
