Because certain regions of the gag zzso such as zzso are highly zzso among human zzso virus zzso zzso many therapeutic strategies have been directed at gag gene zzso Although zzso variation of segments of gag have been determined, little is known about the zzso of the full-length gag gene for zzso isolated from a single zzso To evaluate zzso full-length gag zzso we derived the zzso sequences of at least 10 zzso gag clones of zzso zzso isolated from plasma for each of four zzso zzso type zzso patients with relatively high zzso zzso counts zzso to 450 cells per zzso Mean values of zzso gag zzso variation obtained by zzso comparisons ranged from zzso to zzso For three subjects, this value was equivalent to that reported for zzso full-length zzso zzso The greatest range of zzso mean zzso variation for individual zzso regions was observed for zzso We did not detect any zzso zzso as zzso and zzso transitions occurred at similar zzso accounting for 29 and zzso respectively, of the zzso Mean variation values and zzso analysis suggested that the extent of zzso variation correlated with the length of viral zzso Furthermore, no distinct zzso of zzso were zzso within an zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences indicated that there were no regions within a gag protein that were comprised of clustered zzso
