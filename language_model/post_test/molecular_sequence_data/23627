The review presents three hypotheses concerning the zzso acid zzso 1) the zzso zzso zzso 2) the zzso approach based on zzso zzso of zzso acids and zzso acids coded by zzso read in parallel with the coding DNA zzso 3) zzso hypothesis resulting from the zzso of the genetic zzso The current state of knowledge as well as the results of the zzso of these hypotheses are zzso A special attention is given to zzso and zzso zzso which differ in only few points of the zzso zzso We describe methods of investigation of zzso zzso including circular zzso mass zzso affinity zzso and other zzso The biological applications of zzso principle are considered, such as search for zzso interaction systems, the influence of zzso pairing on the activity of zzso hormones, and the application of zzso in zzso The possible role of zzso zzso acid interactions in the formation of the spatial structures of zzso proteins and protein complexes is zzso Such problems as the pairing preferences of zzso zzso the role of the pairing in the creation of zzso bonds and the possible appearance of such interactions in zzso are also zzso The main intention of the paper is to bring the zzso problem to the attention of the scientific community, as a possible tool in zzso molecular design and molecular zzso
