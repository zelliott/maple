The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is essential for defense against green zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso resistance to virulent strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso functions together with its interacting partner zzso zzso zzso zzso to promote salicylic acid zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso forms of zzso and zzso signal zzso immunity to zzso strains of these zzso zzso defense against zzso requires neither zzso nor zzso Here, we show that resistance to zzso is zzso in an zzso salicylic acid induction zzso zzso double zzso indicating that zzso between zzso and zzso zzso previously reported for zzso immunity zzso by certain zzso repeat zzso does not explain the zzso of zzso and zzso in defense against zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the predicted zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso zzso and deterrence against zzso zzso but zzso was zzso for deterring zzso settling and promoting zzso in zzso plants as well as for pathogen zzso These results highlight distinct molecular activities of zzso determining particular aspects of defense against zzso and zzso
