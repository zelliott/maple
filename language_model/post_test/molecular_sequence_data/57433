Typically pancreatic zzso are characterized by the following zzso zzso they are activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso they are inhibited by zzso zzso but zzso by zzso (a small zzso zzso and zzso they do not zzso significantly zzso A zzso clone zzso a guinea pig pancreatic zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso The zzso zzso as well as zzso differs from other pancreatic zzso in that zzso it is not zzso zzso zzso its activity is unaffected by the presence of zzso zzso and/or zzso using zzso as zzso and zzso it exhibits equally zzso A1 and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is highly zzso to that of other known pancreatic zzso with the exception of a deletion in the so-called lid domain that regulates access to the active centers of other zzso We propose that this deletion is directly responsible for the anomalous behavior of this zzso Thus zzso challenges the classical distinction between zzso zzso and zzso
