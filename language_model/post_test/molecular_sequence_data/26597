To carry out the molecular zzso study of the zzso zzso virus isolated in zzso Province during zzso and provide a scientific basis for the zzso zzso 

zzso viruses were isolated using zzso cell line or zzso cell line from throat zzso collected from suspected zzso cases during zzso outbreak and sporadic in 6 zzso during zzso The zzso of zzso zzso of N gene zzso terminal was amplified by using zzso zzso The zzso products were zzso and zzso The zzso tree was conducted with the viruses isolated in viruses from other zzso 

Total 19 zzso viruses were isolated during zzso in zzso province and all belong to zzso zzso The results of zzso tree showed that viruses in zzso and in zzso were distributed in two different zzso and it revealed that these strains belonged to at least 2 viral transmission chains and the viruses circulated during zzso were not detected after zzso 

zzso zzso was the zzso zzso circulated in zzso province during zzso zzso zzso virus strains had not evolved zzso but zzso with the zzso virus strains in other provinces in mainland zzso The variation of important zzso acid sites of zzso virus should be continuous monitored and provide the scientific strategy for the zzso zzso
