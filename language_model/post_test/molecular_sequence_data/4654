The structure of the second zzso loop region zzso of the zzso zzso has been explored in an effort to understand the structural basis for zzso A binding and zzso Application of secondary structure prediction methods and zzso modeling resulted in a zzso motif for the zzso region of zzso A similar motif was not predicted for zzso of either delta or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was further shown to be zzso and complementary to the zzso component of zzso zzso Using a model of the zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 1996, 21, zzso including the newly predicted zzso zzso domain, a binding mode is proposed based on zzso interactions between zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso component of zzso zzso zzso simulations of the zzso complex yielded structures in which the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso is bound within a zzso aromatic pocket in the zzso domain while the zzso portion contacted zzso in zzso and in the zzso end of zzso zzso 6 and zzso The model is in general agreement with zzso zzso data and zzso studies that have identified binding zzso in both the zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso The results confirm the importance of the zzso zzso displayed by many zzso zzso but also suggest a potential mechanism of zzso zzso that may be zzso by zzso through interactions with the zzso component of zzso zzso
