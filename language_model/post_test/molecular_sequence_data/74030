The T cell response to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso arthritis zzso induced in the Lewis rat zzso by injection of zzso tuberculosis serves as an experimental model for human zzso arthritis zzso However, the zzso basis of regulation of acute zzso or of zzso to AA is not zzso We have defined the specificity of the zzso T cell responses to zzso during the course of AA in the Lewis zzso During the early phase of the disease zzso d after onset of zzso Lewis rats raised T cell responses to many zzso within zzso spread throughout the zzso zzso in the late phase of the disease zzso zzso after onset of zzso there was evidence for diversification of the T cell responses toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso rats in the late phase of AA also raised vigorous T cell responses to those zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso that zzso in position to the above zzso These results suggest that the observed diversification is possibly triggered in zzso by induction of zzso T zzso Interestingly, another strain of zzso the zzso zzso zzso rat zzso with the same major zzso complex class II molecules as the Lewis zzso was found to be resistant to zzso In zzso rats, vigorous responses to the zzso to which the Lewis rat responded only in the late phase of zzso were observed very early, 10 d after injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the peptides zzso the set of zzso but not its zzso zzso provided significant protection to zzso Lewis rats from subsequent induction of zzso Thus, T cell responses to the zzso are involved in regulating inflammatory arthritis in the Lewis rat and in zzso resistance to AA in the zzso zzso These results have important implications in understanding the zzso of zzso and in devising new zzso strategies for this zzso
