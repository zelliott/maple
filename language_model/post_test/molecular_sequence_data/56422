zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso and replacement of the zzso typical of zzso and earlier zzso cells by zzso in the zzso However, a zzso zzso zzso zzso that has an unusual zzso containing a region rich in zzso zzso acids is transcribed and translated in mouse round zzso The zzso of this region suggested that the protein may be localized at the nuclear zzso the initial site of zzso zzso during zzso To identify zzso in the zzso nucleus, an zzso zzso was generated against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the unique zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso frozen zzso sections at both the light and electron microscopic levels indicated that zzso is present in zzso of round zzso Moreover, the protein was not found to be zzso associated with the nuclear zzso indicating that it is not involved in zzso envelope interaction in the round zzso Rather, it appeared to be distributed zzso throughout the nucleus with the exception of its exclusion from the zzso In addition, the zzso protein was not found in mature zzso even when the zzso was partially zzso suggesting that it is present and functions only during a restricted period of zzso zzso
