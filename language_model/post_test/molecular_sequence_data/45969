zzso family zzso play a key role in zzso zzso Despite extensive zzso zzso and structural studies, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso DNA remains to be zzso Using a wide array of zzso and zzso approaches, we have previously shown that the zzso coli zzso zzso functions as a zzso In this study, we have further characterized the kinetic mechanism of the zzso unwinding of duplex DNA using the zzso zzso method based on zzso resonance energy zzso Our results show that zzso zzso binds zzso to zzso duplex zzso Under the zzso conditions, the burst zzso reveals a zzso ratio between zzso and DNA zzso suggesting that an active zzso form of zzso zzso is involved in the zzso Under the zzso conditions, the zzso unwinding is independent of the zzso zzso indicating that functional interactions between zzso molecules are not implicated in the DNA zzso It was further determined that zzso zzso DNA rapidly with a step size of 4 zzso and a rate of approximately 21 zzso These kinetic results not only further support our previous conclusion that zzso coli zzso functions as a zzso but also suggest that some of the zzso 2 zzso may function through an zzso zzso
