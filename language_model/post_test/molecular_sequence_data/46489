The zzso zzso zzso is a large predatory zzso found widely in the Americas that is susceptible to zzso zzso virus zzso a zzso zzso found in wild zzso species that is analogous to zzso zzso viruses in wild primates and belongs to the same family of viruses as human zzso zzso zzso infection in zzso can lead to a weakened immune system that creates opportunities for other infecting zzso zzso prevalence and lineages have been studied previously in several areas in the western United States, but typically without zzso explicit statistical zzso To describe the distribution of zzso in a sample of zzso located in the northern Rocky Mountain region of North America, we first used kernel density ratio zzso to map the log relative risk of zzso The risk surface showed a significant cluster of zzso in northwestern zzso We also used zzso cluster models for genetic data to investigate the spatial structure of the zzso zzso virus with virus genetic sequence zzso A result of the models was two zzso distinct zzso lineages that aligned considerably with an interstate highway in zzso Our results suggest that the use of spatial information and models adds novel insight when investigating an infectious animal zzso The results also suggest that the influence of landscape features likely plays an important role in the zzso spread of an infectious disease within wildlife zzso
