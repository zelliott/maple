The binding site of the zzso zzso zzso like that of other zzso zzso zzso is contained within a zzso zzso formed among its seven zzso zzso Using the zzso accessibility method, we previously mapped the zzso in the third zzso segment zzso that are exposed in the zzso site zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso We have now zzso one at a time, 24 consecutive zzso in and zzso the fifth zzso segment zzso to zzso and expressed the zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso Thirteen of these zzso reacted with charged, zzso zzso zzso zzso added zzso and were protected from reaction by another zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the side chains of these zzso are exposed in the zzso zzso Of the 13 exposed zzso 10 are zzso from zzso to zzso This pattern of exposure is inconsistent with the expectation that zzso like zzso forms a fixed zzso one side of which is exposed in the zzso zzso The exposed region of zzso which contains the zzso likely to bind zzso zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might loop out into the zzso of the zzso zzso and be completely accessible to water and thus to zzso zzso the exposed region of zzso might be embedded in the membrane and also in contact with other zzso zzso At any instant, only a limited set of zzso might be exposed in the zzso zzso however, zzso might move rapidly to expose different sets of zzso
