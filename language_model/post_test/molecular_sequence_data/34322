zzso gene 1 zzso is a zzso gene in zzso and encodes a novel zzso Our preliminary data suggested that zzso is probably involved in early liver zzso However, no detailed characterization of zzso has been reported thus zzso We undertook both zzso and experimental approaches to study zzso gene structure and its role in early liver zzso We found that zzso identifies a new zzso protein zzso featured by the presence of domain of unknown function zzso zzso There are two copies of zzso in zzso namely zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso are expressed in the larvae and adult liver with zzso being the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso by their respective zzso specifically targeting their zzso each resulted in a small liver zzso demonstrating that both zzso and zzso are important for early liver zzso Meanwhile, we found that injection of zzso a zzso which can simultaneously block the translation of zzso and zzso caused not only a small liver zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso tube as zzso Further examination of zzso zzso with early zzso markers and early zzso markers revealed that although depletion of total zzso does not alter the zzso and pancreatic fate of the zzso cells, it leads to cell cycle arrest that results in growth zzso of liver, zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we proved that zzso is a zzso zzso This intrigued us to propose that zzso might act as a novel zzso regulator that is essential for liver and other zzso organ development in zzso
