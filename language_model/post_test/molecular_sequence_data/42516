Human zzso omega 1 zzso 1) gene was isolated and cloned from zzso DNA derived from a Chinese fetal liver via zzso chain reaction zzso By determining its zzso sequence we proved that the 88th zzso should be zzso coding for zzso After engineering the original zzso 1 gene clone to a form that may be expressed as a zzso zzso we also took the zzso 1 gene under the control of the zzso promoter with an expression zzso zzso in zzso zzso The antivirus activity of the zzso zzso 1 is about zzso zzso zzso zzso CULTURE zzso zzso zzso Since zzso 1 not only has antivirus activity but also shows considerably high zzso with animal zzso proteins which have been proved zzso as a maternal recognition signal for pregnancy, we believe that study on it will be practically and theoretically zzso
