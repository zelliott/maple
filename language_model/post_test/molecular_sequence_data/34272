zzso zzso comprised of zzso zzso and zzso proteins are important signal zzso in all zzso The zzso protein of the zzso zzso is crucial for its proper targeting at the plasma membrane and correct zzso zzso proteins are significantly smaller and more diverse than the zzso and zzso zzso In model plants zzso and rice that have a single zzso and zzso zzso the presence of two zzso zzso proteins provide some diversity to the possible zzso zzso Our recent analysis of the latest version of the soybean zzso has identified ten zzso proteins which belong to three distinct families based on their zzso We amplified the full length zzso analyzed their detailed expression profile by quantitative zzso assessed their zzso and performed zzso interaction analysis to evaluate interaction specificity with different zzso zzso Our results show that ten zzso genes are retained in the soybean zzso and have interesting expression profiles across different zzso zzso Six of the newly identified proteins belong to two zzso zzso protein zzso zzso interaction analyses predict some degree of interaction specificity between different zzso and zzso zzso This research thus identifies a highly diverse zzso network from a plant zzso zzso of these novel proteins have been previously identified as zzso for grain size and yield in zzso
