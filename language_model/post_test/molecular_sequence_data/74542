zzso zzso clinically the most important human zzso zzso rapidly develops resistance to zzso zzso The acquisition of resistance has been linked to various types of zzso zzso As part of an ongoing study of this problem, we investigated zzso zzso stability and drug resistance acquisition in zzso zzso strains with deletions in the base zzso repair zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso and in the zzso zzso repair zzso genes zzso and zzso The zzso zzso did not exhibit any change in their zzso to zzso agents, but the zzso zzso were extremely sensitive to zzso DNA zzso We did not observe any significant change in zzso zzso stability and zzso drug sensitivity in the zzso strains we zzso However, we detected a number of intriguing zzso differences between strains bearing deletions in equivalent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which may be related to differences in the life cycles of these two zzso
