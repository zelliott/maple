The isolation and characterization of single gene zzso affecting the zzso biological clocks of several organisms has left little doubt that zzso rhythms can be subjected to classical zzso zzso Many of these zzso occur at the same few genetic zzso zzso zzso in the fungus zzso and period zzso in fruit fly zzso these zzso represent the best studied zzso genes zzso zzso strains are usually affected in more than one basic clock property, suggesting an zzso at the molecular level among these basic properties that would not have been predicted a zzso The extensive background information available concerning the zzso locus provides a basis for the molecular dissection of the zzso zzso zzso most minimal zzso system thus far zzso We report here the cloning and analysis of the zzso locus and show it to be larger and more complex than would have been predicted from the available genetic zzso Complete rescue of all of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso requires transformation with a zzso zzso region of DNA zzso at least two zzso zzso analysis of this region has allowed the identification of a common element between zzso and per which, given the background similarities in their classical genetic zzso suggests the possibility of a common element in the clock mechanisms of these two zzso
