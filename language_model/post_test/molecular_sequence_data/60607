The regulation of the zzso gene zzso the zzso G zzso of zzso coli W zzso zzso has been investigated by a molecular approach using zzso as a reporter zzso This analysis revealed that a region of 170 zzso located upstream of the zzso structural gene contains the regulatory sequences that control its zzso The zzso zzso protein is involved not only in the zzso repression of zzso G zzso production caused by zzso but also in the induction of zzso gene expression by zzso zzso zzso extension analyses have demonstrated that the zzso of the zzso gene can be initiated from at least three different zzso Although all these promoters are functional, their relative activity depends on the transcribed zzso the zzso and zzso promoters being more active in the presence of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso promoter was stronger when the upstream region of the zzso gene was fused to the zzso zzso A deletion of the region surrounding the zzso box of the zzso promoter produced a zzso expression of the fused gene indicating that this sequence is required for zzso acid induction and suggesting that the expression of the zzso gene is regulated by a repression zzso This work reveals that the regulation of the zzso gene is more complex than previously envisioned and provides new clues to investigate further this interesting regulatory zzso
