Identification of proteins that zzso bind zzso zzso is essential for a clearer understanding of the zzso that results after an zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) have reported that in our mouse model system a zzso zzso zzso protein is the earliest target detected zzso following administration of an zzso dose of zzso To identify this zzso zzso liver zzso from mice administered 600 zzso zzso were extracted with zzso zzso and the resulting zzso fraction was zzso to zzso Further zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso indicated that four proteins of approximately 44 zzso with zzso ranging from zzso were targeted by zzso The most highly zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso was excised from zzso gels, zzso with zzso and the resulting peptides were separated by zzso zzso The two best resolved peptides were zzso and 14 of the 15 zzso acids detected were found to be identical to zzso of mouse liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso mice confirmed that the zzso is indeed targeted by zzso in zzso Since the zzso activity of zzso zzso is significantly decreased after the administration of zzso to zzso in culture, it is likely that the zzso of this zzso may be involved in the ensuing zzso
