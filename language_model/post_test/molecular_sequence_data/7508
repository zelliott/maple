zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso forming zzso a key intermediate in the zzso of fatty acids and a variety of secondary zzso Based upon zzso acid sequences zzso among zzso chicken, and zzso coli zzso zzso were used to amplify a zzso zzso which codes for an zzso of zzso The resulting zzso was used for isolation of zzso and zzso zzso We have determined the complete zzso sequence coding for an zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acids with the molecular mass of 251 zzso This zzso contains no recognizable zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso is presumably the zzso zzso Southern analysis indicates that there are two zzso genes in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the results of zzso analysis and physical mapping of the isolated zzso clones demonstrate that these two zzso zzso and zzso are zzso located within a zzso zzso region near the middle of zzso zzso Both genes are zzso active, as transcripts from each gene were detected by reverse zzso analysis using zzso zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts accumulate in leaves and zzso but only the zzso transcript accumulates in developing zzso zzso The differences in the expression patterns may be indicative of the differential role of the two zzso
