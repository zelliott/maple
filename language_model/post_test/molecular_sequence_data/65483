zzso and invasive zzso zzso coli have been implicated in the zzso of colon cancer and inflammatory zzso zzso It has been reported that such zzso share features of zzso zzso coli zzso and particularly zzso zzso coli zzso We used suppression zzso zzso zzso to subtract the zzso of zzso coli K-12 from that of a colon cancer zzso zzso coli zzso Of the zzso zzso 53 % were present in the zzso of one or more of three zzso zzso strains but absent from the zzso of an zzso zzso coli zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso 80 % matched at least one zzso zzso whereas only 4 % were absent from the zzso zzso but present in the zzso of the zzso zzso A further zzso zzso against the zzso strain 536 enriched for sequences matching mobile genetic zzso other zzso zzso and other zzso strains or zzso rather than strains associated with gastrointestinal zzso We zzso the distribution of selected zzso sequences and zzso zzso islands zzso amongst a panel of zzso zzso coli isolated from zzso zzso of patients with colon cancer, patients with Crohn's disease and zzso This enabled us to identify a group of zzso from colon cancer zzso zzso carrying multiple genes previously zzso as zzso and implicated in zzso
