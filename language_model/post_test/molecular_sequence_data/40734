In this study, we determined the association of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso zzso A total of zzso subjects were taken from two community-based zzso zzso and zzso zzso South zzso had been established for zzso association studies zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly associated zzso zzso not corrected for zzso zzso with zzso in both zzso Of these zzso zzso and zzso correlated with risk for zzso The zzso zzso replaces zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso replaces zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso A comparison of zzso sequences between zzso zzso revealed that the zzso identified occur at zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the protein structure showed that the substitution of a polar zzso zzso for a zzso zzso at zzso zzso 288 affects a zzso change in zzso and that zzso in zzso resides in the zzso domain, which is important for membrane zzso These results provide insights into the function of these zzso zzso in the development of zzso The study investigating zzso zzso from zzso not only by statistical association analysis but also by biological relevance through the protein structure might be a good approach for identifying genetic risk factors for hypertension, in addition to discovering zzso zzso
