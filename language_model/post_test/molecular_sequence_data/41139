The zzso stage of zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso a lethal zzso with very limited treatment zzso zzso of zzso currently employs zzso zzso however, these exert only a zzso action in zzso and have to be given zzso In the search for novel drug targets, we have concentrated on zzso zzso zzso Here we report significant zzso effects of zzso an zzso zzso inhibitor that is in clinical use to treat certain zzso At zzso of 25 zzso zzso was highly effective in killing zzso stem cells, zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Moreover, already at zzso as low as 10 zzso zzso significantly inhibited the formation of zzso zzso from zzso stem cells, zzso 50% of zzso after 7 days, and induced zzso zzso in the zzso upon short-term zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso larvae express zzso with high zzso to previously identified zzso zzso that act as zzso targets in zzso zzso In particular, zzso acids known to mediate the binding of zzso to target zzso are well zzso between human and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate effective zzso of zzso larvae using zzso zzso that do not significantly affect cultivated human cells, indicating that zzso might be a promising alternative to zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso can also act as a lead substance for the identification of related compounds with higher zzso activity, the identification of which will be facilitated by the zzso zzso zzso sequences determined in this zzso
