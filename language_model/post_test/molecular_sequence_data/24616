zzso protein 2 zzso a member of the newly defined family of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to remove zzso and protect proteins and DNA from zzso zzso Here we report that zzso is one of the regulatory factors for the zzso zzso We found that zzso bound to the heat shock element and to stress-related elements in the zzso zzso It zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells and lens zzso cells zzso zzso zzso in the heat shock element and stress-related elements of the zzso promoter reduced zzso zzso Lens zzso cells showed a higher level of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a higher level of zzso zzso the level of which was directly related to the increase in cellular zzso Thus, zzso by zzso the zzso zzso protected and enhanced the survival of cells under zzso zzso
