We have cloned a zzso zzso a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso which is expressed at high levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso transition, and declines to low levels by late zzso zzso In early zzso zzso zzso transcripts are enriched zzso in the most zzso versus anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene is cell zzso the gene is activated in zzso zzso stage zzso as well as in animal cap zzso zzso communication is needed for proper zzso zzso of zzso expression in late zzso zzso cell zzso during zzso stages or removal of zzso from the zzso prevents normal zzso shunt zzso zzso treated with zzso growth factors zzso mimic the normal zzso and spatial shut down in whole zzso This negative regulatory zzso may be important for determining cell fate or maintaining an zzso state in the zzso region of the zzso
