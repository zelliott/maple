To demonstrate the correlation of zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso resistance of zzso zzso in the local zzso 

Clinical strains of zzso were isolated from gastric biopsy of zzso Resistance to zzso of the zzso was determined by using diffusion test and two fold dilution zzso Genome zzso of the zzso were prepared for zzso to detect zzso zzso The target amplification products were zzso after zzso zzso The sequences were compared with the reported sequences from zzso and zzso other strains of zzso 

zzso resistance rate was zzso in 21 clinical zzso The target zzso zzso zzso in length containing zzso gene could be successfully zzso In comparison with the reported corresponding sequence of zzso stain zzso zzso of the zzso sequences from the amplification products were zzso zzso equals zzso zzso caused by base zzso and substitution in the zzso resistance zzso were zzso Among these zzso two types of zzso zzso have not been reported in zzso No same zzso were present in the zzso sensitive zzso 

The zzso gene zzso may play an important role in zzso resistance of zzso
