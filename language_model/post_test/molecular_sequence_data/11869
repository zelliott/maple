zzso syndrome patients with Y zzso face a high risk of developing zzso zzso analysis can fail to detect rare cells bearing a normal or structurally abnormal Y zzso zzso level Y zzso We screened 53 individuals with zzso syndrome for presence of zzso region Y zzso the zzso zzso Y zzso zzso and the Y zzso zzso repeat using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Thirty girls zzso had the zzso zzso determined through standard analysis of blood zzso The remaining 23 girls zzso were mosaics and/or had structural abnormalities in 1 zzso zzso DNA from blood zzso was amplified using 2 rounds of zzso This method was sensitive enough to detect zzso male DNA on a female zzso None of 53 zzso syndrome cases was positive for zzso zzso after the first round of zzso After the second round, 2 of 53 zzso syndrome cases were positive for zzso mapping to the zzso short arm of zzso zzso In 1 zzso subject, the zzso was zzso and in the other, it was zzso None of 53 zzso syndrome individuals, including the 2 zzso subjects, were positive for the zzso zzso Y zzso gene on the zzso short arm of zzso Y or the zzso zzso zzso These data exclude low level Y zzso in almost all zzso syndrome cases zzso
