The zzso include the cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso slime zzso However, available molecular data are in disagreement on both the zzso and zzso position of the zzso zzso zzso trees show the zzso and zzso slime zzso as unrelated early branching zzso but zzso and zzso trees place them together as a single coherent zzso group, closely related to the zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso genes from one member of each division of the zzso including zzso zzso for which zzso sequences were previously zzso zzso analyses of these sequences strongly support a zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso slime zzso most closely related to each zzso All zzso methods used also place this coherent zzso zzso as emerging among the zzso zzso tentatively supported as more closely related to animals + zzso than are green zzso With our data there are now three proteins that consistently support a zzso zzso and at least four that place these zzso within the zzso of the zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso data should be more closely examined with regard to these questions, and we emphasize the importance of developing multiple sequence data zzso
