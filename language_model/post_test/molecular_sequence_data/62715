zzso in the zzso gene cause a severe zzso mental zzso syndrome that is frequently associated with alpha zzso zzso zzso The previously characterized zzso protein zzso 280 zzso contains both a Plant zzso zzso zinc finger motif as well as an zzso domain of the zzso zzso These motifs suggest that zzso may function as a regulator of gene zzso probably by exerting an effect on zzso structure, although the exact cellular role of zzso has not yet been fully zzso Here we characterize a truncated zzso 200 zzso zzso of zzso (called here zzso that has been highly zzso between mouse and zzso In both species, zzso arises due to the failure to zzso zzso 11 from the primary transcript, and the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the relative expression of the full length and zzso zzso is subject to zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains the zzso domain but not the zzso motifs and is therefore unlikely to be functionally equivalent to the full length zzso We used indirect zzso to demonstrate that the full length and zzso zzso are zzso at blocks of zzso zzso but unlike full length zzso the truncated zzso does not associate with zzso leukemia zzso nuclear zzso The high degree of conservation of zzso and the tight regulation of its expression relative to the full length protein suggest that this truncated zzso fulfills an important biological zzso
