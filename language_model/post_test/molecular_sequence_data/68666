zzso analysis of the rat zzso promoter demonstrated that the segment from zzso to zzso bases of zzso was efficient as a promoter in zzso by transient zzso We developed transgenic mice carrying a fusion gene of this promoter segment and a zzso reporter zzso This short zzso promoter zzso the zzso expression in zzso cells of the cerebral zzso the zzso and the zzso regions zzso to zzso in zzso cells of the zzso zzso in zzso cells of the zzso and in zzso of the lateral zzso nucleus of zzso and the spinal zzso of adult transgenic zzso The expression of zzso zzso was precisely analyzed by in zzso zzso in the nervous zzso The zzso of zzso expression was consistent with those of the zzso zzso in the adult transgenic zzso In the zzso at zzso days of zzso the zzso was expressed in various zzso similarly to the zzso zzso but certain subtle differences were observed in the zzso of zzso This short promoter of rat zzso carried two sequence stretches highly zzso in the zzso dog, chicken and zzso zzso zzso These zzso stretches may be involved in the observed zzso expression of rat zzso zzso
