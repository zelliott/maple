The zzso of Madagascar exhibit extreme diversity in zzso and zzso Recent studies have shown that several other zzso species also are part of this endemic radiation, even as the zzso of the zzso remains in zzso Using DNA sequences from 13 genes and representatives of all 15 zzso zzso we find strong support for the zzso of the zzso zzso and their inclusion in a family along with six zzso zzso of zzso zzso distributed in Asia and zzso zzso reconstructions of these lineages include both Asia and Africa as possible zzso routes to zzso To study patterns of zzso through time, we introduce a method that can accommodate zzso zzso patterns of incomplete zzso sampling in diversification zzso We demonstrate that zzso rates in zzso decreased dramatically through time following the colonization of zzso zzso strategies of these birds show remarkable zzso with zzso zzso indicating that adaptations to feeding zzso played a role in the diversification of these zzso zzso fit the model of an zzso zzso in that they show an explosive burst of zzso soon after zzso increased diversification into novel niches and extraordinary zzso zzso
