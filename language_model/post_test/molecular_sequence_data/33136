zzso zzso a zzso causing zzso outbreaks, is one of the main pathogens monitored in developed zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression library using the zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso identified a subset of zzso proteins in this zzso which are proteins belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to map the zzso region of zzso the corresponding open reading frame was dissected into three parts and expressed as zzso proteins with zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of these zzso proteins with zzso reacting with zzso indicated that one-third of the zzso of zzso showed zzso with the zzso zzso location of zzso was examined both in zzso and zzso cells of zzso zzso by an zzso zzso indicating that location of zzso varies during zzso These results suggest that zzso is an abundant and zzso zzso which is zzso localized during life cycle of zzso zzso
