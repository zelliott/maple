zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contain zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso which presumably assists the fly in obtaining a blood zzso zzso has now been isolated, and its zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso was zzso to zzso using zzso exchange and zzso interaction zzso and found to be a protein with a molecular mass of 65 zzso as determined by gel zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing allowed for the synthesis of zzso zzso that led to zzso from zzso zzso specific zzso of the zzso zzso this zzso zzso No zzso sites are present in the predicted zzso A search of zzso did not reveal significant sequence zzso between zzso and other zzso The molecular mass predicted from the zzso was 59 zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites may account for this difference in molecular mass, as zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells had a molecular mass of 65 zzso matching that of the natural zzso zzso functions by zzso the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso on zzso with an zzso of 95 zzso These results reveal that insect zzso zzso are a source of zzso zzso zzso
