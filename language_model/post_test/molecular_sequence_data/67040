We describe the first genetic linkage map for zzso zzso using 185 zzso zzso including 115 new markers reported in this zzso Our approach was to study the segregation of zzso in 129 zzso progeny of one F1 hybrid obtained by crossing two genetically divergent lineages of zzso isolated from two Oregon zzso The map spanned zzso zzso zzso and had an average zzso distance of 7 zzso zzso groups ranged in size from 7 to 185 zzso and contained 4 to 27 zzso The map revealed 12 linkage groups corresponding to the expected number of zzso and covers approximately zzso of the zzso Tests for random segregation of zzso at individual zzso revealed that zzso of the markers showed significant transmission ratio distortion zzso zzso zzso likely due to markers being linked to deleterious zzso zzso This map will become the anchor for the physical map of the zzso zzso and will serve as a starting point for mapping single and quantitative trait zzso affecting ecologically important zzso By mapping zzso tentative zzso gene pairs zzso into the zzso linkage map, we facilitate future comparative zzso
