Twenty strains of zzso zzso isolated in Brazil were zzso ten from persistent zzso zzso cases, three from suspected polio cases with transient paralysis, and seven from healthy zzso The zzso of the viral zzso were identified by the zzso test with zzso zzso zzso The relationship of the zzso to the zzso strain was demonstrated by molecular zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso sequencing demonstrated zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region and at zzso acid 143 of the zzso protein zzso in most of these zzso from zzso cases in zzso These data support previous studies on the importance of zzso at these attenuated zzso in the establishment of the zzso However, the existence of zzso without zzso at these positions suggests that they are not zzso The results also strengthen the possibility of the participation of a zzso at zzso 398 in the establishment of the disease, and suggest that a zzso at zzso zzso or 500 may also be involved in this zzso The zzso from healthy contacts presented the same zzso as the zzso from zzso cases with which they were in zzso This strengthens the observation that, although zzso in the zzso of the zzso strain are important for the establishment of the disease, host factors are also zzso
