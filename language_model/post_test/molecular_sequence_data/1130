A zzso of the zzso zzso membrane anchor present on the cell surface of the malaria pathogen zzso zzso has been zzso This zzso is an example of a small number of such membrane anchors that carry a fatty zzso group at zzso of the zzso Although the zzso group plays crucial roles in zzso zzso it rarely zzso in mature zzso Other notable examples are the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The presence of bulky zzso at three zzso positions of the zzso zzso creates a very crowded environment that poses difficulties for carrying out selective chemical zzso Thus installations of the zzso zzso zzso group and neighboring zzso complex were fraught with zzso The key solution to these obstacles in the successful synthesis of the zzso candidate and zzso structures involved zzso controlled opening of a zzso zzso zzso The reaction proceeds in very good yields, the desired zzso zzso being formed zzso even more so in the case of zzso zzso zzso The zzso precursor was prepared from zzso zzso by the zzso procedure of zzso and zzso For the zzso zzso advantage was taken of the fact that zzso zzso zzso zzso donors are rapidly and zzso activated upon treatment with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso product zzso A strategy for obtaining the zzso zzso component from the corresponding zzso employed zzso novel zzso displacement zzso Thus all units of the zzso array were obtained from a zzso zzso zzso this being readily prepared from zzso in three easy, high-yielding zzso The zzso zzso at positions 1 and 2, noted above, could conceivably be relieved by migration of the zzso group to the neighboring zzso in the natural zzso However, study of our synthetic zzso and prototypes indicate that the zzso zzso group is quite stable, and that such migration does not occur zzso
