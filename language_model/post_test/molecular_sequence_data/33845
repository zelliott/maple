zzso Na channels in many zzso including several in the zzso and zzso are specialized to allow rapid firing of action zzso zzso firing is facilitated by resurgent Na zzso which flows upon zzso as Na channels recover through open states from block by an zzso zzso The best candidate blocking protein to date is zzso The sequence of this protein zzso among species, however, while zzso firing is zzso raising the question of whether the proposed blocking action of the zzso zzso tail has been zzso Here, we find that, despite differences in the zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from embryonic chick have resurgent currents with zzso and zzso indistinguishable from those in mouse zzso zzso Furthermore, synthetic peptides derived from the divergent zzso zzso tails from five species have the capacity to induce resurgent current in mouse zzso zzso which lack a functional zzso blocking zzso These data further support a blocking role for zzso and also indicate the relative importance of different zzso in inducing zzso zzso To investigate the contribution of the few highly zzso zzso to zzso block, we zzso several zzso peptides in which the identities and relative zzso of a zzso and two zzso were zzso These zzso peptides produced currents with vastly different zzso than did the zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso are required for an zzso block that zzso zzso resurgent Na zzso Thus, if other blocking proteins exist, they may share these structural elements with the zzso zzso zzso
