A novel zzso zzso zzso and strictly zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso sample from the Mid-Atlantic zzso The cells were short, straight rods (4 zzso m long and zzso zzso m zzso and were zzso with zzso zzso They grew between 35 and 55 degrees C zzso 45 degrees zzso between pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso and at zzso g sea zzso zzso zzso sea zzso zzso 30 g zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The main zzso products from zzso were (in decreasing zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was 29 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene located the strain within cluster zzso of the lineage that encompasses the zzso zzso and related zzso in the bacterial zzso On the basis of zzso zzso sequence comparison and zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that the isolate should be described as a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
