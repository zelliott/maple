In an exploration of the molecular basis of zzso zzso stabilization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanying cell differentiation in the pig kidney cell line zzso we have identified a zzso zzso protein factor, designated zzso which specifically binds a zzso sequence within the zzso region of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso element within this region appears necessary for specific zzso and the presence of the zzso region is necessary for message stabilization by zzso zzso The binding activity of zzso is zzso after zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso A zzso whereas protein zzso either in zzso or in zzso is associated with loss of binding zzso The increase in zzso binding activity zzso with an increase in the zzso of the zzso message, suggesting a cause and effect zzso
