It is widely accepted that there is a family of gap junction zzso zzso their distribution appearing to vary with tissue type and zzso In cardiac zzso the major zzso channel component identified is a zzso (K zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a gap junction isolation protocol in which low temperatures are zzso and which is zzso we have identified a second gap zzso protein in cardiac zzso with an apparent relative molecular mass of zzso zzso raised to three synthetic peptides matching portions of the zzso gap junction protein zzso sequence zzso with the zzso zzso but zzso studies indicate that these proteins are distinct from one zzso The structures that contain the zzso protein are susceptible to fragmentation at warm temperatures, and by electron zzso this can be correlated with loss of zzso within the zzso zzso Using a gap junction zzso prepared from zzso isolated adult zzso we show that both the zzso and zzso gap junction proteins are present in zzso cardiac zzso In such zzso and those from whole heart, the zzso protein appears to be the major gap zzso protein zzso
