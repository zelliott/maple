We succeeded in rescuing infectious influenza virus by zzso cells with zzso derived from specific zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso gene of influenza zzso zzso virus was transcribed in zzso from zzso DNA and, following the addition of zzso influenza virus zzso zzso complex, was zzso into zzso zzso zzso with helper virus lacking the zzso zzso gene resulted in the release of virus containing the zzso zzso zzso We then introduced five point zzso into the zzso zzso gene by cassette zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the rescued virus revealed that the zzso contained all five zzso present in the zzso zzso The ability to create viruses with zzso zzso will allow the engineering of influenza viruses with defined biological zzso
