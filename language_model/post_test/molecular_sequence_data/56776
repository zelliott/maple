The effect of the zzso region zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso on the translation of zzso zzso was studied in a rabbit zzso zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso zzso possessing different sizes of zzso it was shown that zzso in the zzso of zzso were responsible for zzso zzso at high zzso zzso of the zzso zzso decreased zzso synthesis and slightly increased the degree of zzso stimulation of the synthesis at low zzso When zzso zzso from mouse zzso cells was used as zzso the degree of zzso zzso at high zzso was nearly the same, but that of zzso stimulation at low zzso was greater than with synthetic zzso zzso The reason for this difference is zzso
