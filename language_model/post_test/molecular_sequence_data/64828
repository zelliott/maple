zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso of human bacterial zzso They are associated with chronic persistent infections, and their zzso identification and zzso treatment are impaired by altered zzso zzso To contribute to the understanding of zzso infections, we analyzed a clinical zzso isolate derived from a chronic prosthetic hip zzso A sequence analysis of zzso genes identified an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso with growth as zzso was caused by a block within the zzso zzso zzso through deletion of the zzso zzso as shown by zzso and zzso zzso At a low frequency, zzso zzso zzso arose that were dependent on zzso zzso To investigate this phenomenon, we cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso system, zzso zzso Gene expression analysis indicated regulation of this locus in zzso bacteria by the global iron regulator zzso zzso of zzso in zzso caused the zzso of zzso expression and facilitated bacterial zzso zzso zzso of the fur locus in zzso were identified as insertions of zzso elements and point zzso In contrast, zzso could zzso zzso zzso only in the absence of zzso Thus, we provide the first molecular characterization of the growth properties of a clinical zzso zzso which may help to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with chronic persistent zzso
