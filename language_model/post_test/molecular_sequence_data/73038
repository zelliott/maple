zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that appears to function in zzso control in zzso zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso zzso expression is low at the zzso transition, increases during S phase, and is zzso expressed during zzso In the present study, we have cloned the human zzso gene and analyzed the structure and function of 2 zzso of its zzso zzso Using synchronized cultures of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso we show that the promoter of zzso is activated at S phase and is zzso at zzso zzso Using various zzso zzso zzso we show that three zzso regions are located between 35 and 93 base pairs upstream of the zzso initiation zzso We identified a zzso element zzso in the region of the zzso start site, and zzso within this element diminished cell cycle regulation of zzso
