zzso sequencing of zzso clones is now an established approach to gain insight into the expressed zzso zzso sequences in a given zzso We zzso 100 randomly picked zzso clones of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso sequencing, with a view to obtain novel gene sequences not detected so far by zzso and genetic zzso About zzso of the zzso clones showed significant zzso with other genes in the database, including a number of genes whose presence may not be suspected in zzso zzso zzso to its unusual zzso zzso The results suggest that this approach can provide important clues to understand unique zzso mechanisms in this zzso
