The microbial community dynamics of a functionally stable, zzso zzso reactor fed with zzso were analyzed over a zzso zzso The reactor maintained constant pH and chemical oxygen demand removal during this zzso zzso zzso clones from each of seven sampling events were analyzed by amplified zzso DNA restriction analysis zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso and by sequence analysis of dominant members of the zzso zzso zzso units zzso distinguished as unique zzso patterns, showed zzso distribution for three sample zzso The highest diversity was observed in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso clone library contained 75 zzso with the dominant zzso accounting for zzso of the total zzso but just 21 zzso zzso were found, and the most prominent zzso represented 50% of the clones from the respective zzso zzso in zzso populations was observed, and two periods were zzso in the first, zzso zzso was dominant, and in the second, zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso Higher zzso in zzso populations was zzso and the zzso zzso distribution suggested a chaotic zzso Although dominant zzso were constantly replaced from one sampling point to the next, zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso changes in the community were not as dramatic as were genetic zzso Seven of eight dominant zzso during the first period clustered with the zzso group, although a zzso pattern of substitution occurred among members within this zzso A more flexible community structure characterized the second period, since a sequential replacement of a zzso zzso by an unrelated zzso zzso and finally by a zzso species was zzso zzso differences among the dominant zzso detected suggest that changes in carbon and electron flow occurred during the stable performance and indicate that an extremely dynamic community can maintain a stable zzso zzso
