Introduction of the zzso function via a zzso into zzso peptides was found to produce ring closure by zzso addition of the zzso function of the zzso zzso to the activated double bond of the zzso As an zzso zzso reaction it proceeds at remarkably higher rates than the zzso zzso of zzso derivatives with zzso zzso in the case of the zzso examined only zzso of the zzso zzso compounds were isolated and structurally characterized by zzso zzso As expected, prevention of this reaction in zzso zzso can be achieved by zzso of the zzso zzso However, upon removal of this protection, the reaction takes place again, thus remarkably zzso the usefulness of the zzso addition principle in zzso chemistry for zzso On the other hand this reaction could represent an interesting new approach for the design of zzso zzso zzso
