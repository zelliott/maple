A gene zzso zzso mapped at zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso codes for a protein of 713 zzso acids zzso that shows strong similarities in both size and zzso sequence zzso identical zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or from zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene zzso high zzso activities on an zzso coli strain devoid of the functional zzso zzso even when the bacteria were grown under zzso conditions at zzso zzso Thus, the gene encodes another zzso zzso probably a zzso expressed zzso the presence of which was suggested from the previous observations that low zzso activities were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
