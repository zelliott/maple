zzso guidance cues act to direct growth cones to their correct targets in the nervous zzso Recent experiments also demonstrate that zzso cues are expressed in the adult zzso nervous system, although their function in the brain is not yet zzso The zzso gene family has been implicated in the growth of zzso and zzso in a number of different zzso While the expression of zzso and its influence on zzso pioneer zzso in the developing limb bud have been well characterized in the zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso has not been explored in the adult zzso In this study we used zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso and zzso zzso to clone part of the zzso form of zzso from zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso and zzso we confirmed that zzso zzso and protein expression patterns in the embryonic cricket were similar to that seen in the zzso We also showed that zzso zzso development in zzso was comparable to that described in zzso An examination of both developing and adult cricket brains showed that zzso zzso and protein were expressed in the Kenyon cells in mushroom bodies, an area involved in learning and zzso zzso expression was most obvious near the zzso of the mushroom body in a region surrounding the zzso tip, which produces zzso throughout the life of the zzso We discuss the role of zzso in learning and memory and the potential involvement of zzso in this zzso
