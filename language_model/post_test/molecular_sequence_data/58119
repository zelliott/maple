zzso of the zzso gene are the most common genetic zzso described in human zzso zzso zzso have recently been reported in more than half of the cases of zzso cell zzso of the zzso We have previously reported positive zzso zzso in zzso disease and zzso zzso To determine if this abnormal zzso reflects zzso zzso or alternative pathways of zzso protein zzso we have performed direct sequencing of zzso in 20 further cases of zzso zzso We found eight zzso in 20 cases, seven of which would produce zzso in the zzso protein zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is an early event in zzso conversion, frequently preceding invasion in zzso cell zzso of the zzso The type and site of the observed zzso reflect known zzso hotspots and support the role of ultraviolet radiation in the zzso of these zzso
