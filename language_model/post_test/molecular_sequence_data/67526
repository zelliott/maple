zzso represent the zzso 2 of the zzso zzso and are closely related to zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso They are zzso proteins containing a zzso zzso domain with high zzso to human zzso that mediates one- and zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso are type zzso zzso zzso typical zzso repeats, as well as a von zzso factor C zzso These are typical motifs of zzso proteins that mediate zzso zzso We have reconstructed the zzso of this new family of zzso and show the presence of four zzso zzso as well as one zzso zzso that includes also two different human zzso The zzso of domain assembly in the various zzso was zzso as was the occurrence of relevant zzso zzso in the zzso domain based on the knowledge of zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, the few reports on zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso roles in the model organisms zzso zzso zzso zzso and Homo sapiens are critically zzso zzso attributed to zzso include zzso defense, zzso zzso formation, and consolidation at various zzso zzso Many research questions need to be solved in future, including detailed zzso studies and zzso of the three zzso structure of a model zzso as well as the relation and interplay of the zzso and the in zzso functions in various organisms including zzso
