zzso L zzso which complexes with zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is essential for zzso virus zzso entry into host zzso The zzso complex has a zzso role in entry among zzso yet the mechanism is not zzso To gain a better understanding of the role of zzso in zzso fusion, zzso proteins were made using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares a high sequence zzso with zzso zzso but does not complement zzso zzso in zzso fusion with B zzso A reduction in fusion activity was observed with zzso zzso proteins that contained the zzso zzso of zzso zzso although they retained their ability to process and transport zzso to the cell zzso zzso acids not zzso within this region in zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso were further zzso with the results mapping zzso 54 and 94 as being functionally important for zzso zzso All zzso and zzso displayed levels of cell surface expression similar to that of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso Our data also suggest that the role of zzso involves the zzso or recruitment of zzso with the zzso complex, as we found that reduced fusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso point zzso could be restored by replacing zzso zzso with zzso zzso These observations demonstrate a distinction between the role of zzso in the processing and trafficking of zzso to the cell surface and a zzso role in zzso zzso
