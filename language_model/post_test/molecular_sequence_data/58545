zzso zzso is frequently deleted in various zzso including examples in the zzso A novel zzso termed zzso was recently isolated from the fragile site at zzso with zzso transcripts being reported in lung cancer tumor zzso To avoid overlooking zzso altered transcripts due to zzso normal cells in primary tumors, zzso zzso were examined in 41 lung cancer cell lines in the present zzso Lack of zzso expression or exclusive expression of zzso spliced zzso often accompanied by zzso zzso zzso were observed in 7 of 24 zzso cell lung zzso zzso but in 0 of 17 small cell lung zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso and alternative zzso but failed to identify point zzso These results suggest distinct mechanisms for zzso zzso in lung zzso and that further studies of this interesting gene are zzso
