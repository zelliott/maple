The structure of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso with zzso zzso generated locally from zzso zzso to the zzso ends of zzso zzso zzso zzso of transfer zzso The zzso ranging in length from 4 to 33 base pairs, bound to the zzso in a zzso zzso manner and directed zzso to specific regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The positions and zzso of zzso depended on whether the zzso were bound to the zzso A or P site, and on the lengths of their zzso These data predict the three-dimensional locations of the zzso targets relative to the positions of A- and zzso site transfer zzso inside the zzso
