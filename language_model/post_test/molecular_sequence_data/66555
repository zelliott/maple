The zzso zzso zzso program generated a large number of gene sequences that belong to zzso zzso and adaptation categories from this important plant zzso One of these genes zzso encodes a protein similar to a zzso of zzso zzso together with a number of structurally and functionally related zzso zzso In this work, the similar sequence zzso from zzso zzso was cloned onto the zzso zzso in order to zzso a zzso zzso fusion protein in zzso coli zzso The expressed protein in the soluble fraction was zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure contents were verified by circular zzso zzso Small angle X-ray scattering zzso zzso furnish general structural parameters and provide a strong indication that the protein has a zzso form in zzso Also, zzso zzso calculations show that the protein has some similarities with a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso showed the highest identity zzso or zzso with several functional unknown zzso Among the identified zzso we found approximately zzso of identity with zzso zzso 30 and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The results establish zzso as the new member of zzso family, zzso Finally, the first characterization by gel zzso zzso zzso indicates that the protein has an zzso shape, which generates an apparent higher molecular zzso The study of this protein is an effort to fight zzso zzso which causes tremendous losses in many economically important zzso
