zzso proteins are attractive targets for the development of novel zzso as they are more accessible to drugs than are zzso zzso By using a zzso biology approach, we identified 180 potential zzso proteins in zzso zzso including the known zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Six proteins (named zzso for zzso zzso were selected for further biological zzso First, we verified that the selected zzso genes are expressed in the zzso and/or zzso form and then we investigated the effect of the loss of each zzso gene on zzso integrity, zzso zzso to zzso cells and zzso As a result, we identified zzso a putative zzso with an apparent zzso in zzso zzso zzso as an important factor for zzso integrity and zzso Interestingly, deletion of zzso also resulted in a zzso in zzso a reduction in adherence to zzso cells in an in zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of survival in an zzso mouse model of zzso zzso A delay in colonization of key zzso zzso zzso was also observed, which is consistent with a reduction in zzso of the zzso zzso These data indicate a key role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and represent a new site for therapeutic intervention to cure and prevent zzso zzso
