A hybrid tandem mass zzso is constructed by zzso a zzso mass filter zzso to a zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso and is evaluated for the analysis of zzso The mass filter is set to selectively inject zzso of a particular zzso or, in scanning mode, to zzso inject zzso into the zzso for subsequent manipulation and zzso Performance of the instrument is demonstrated using a mixture of zzso created by electron impact zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso data are compared to those obtained by utilizing only the zzso zzso zzso weight, zzso and high-resolution analyses for the zzso injected zzso peptides show improved performance over similar zzso employing only the zzso trap mass zzso Performance is zzso when zzso are not zzso in the zzso Using the hybrid, a resolution of zzso is achieved for zzso zzso zzso reduction of space zzso signal suppression is demonstrated for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is performed for zzso 502 from zzso where fragmentation is induced by increasing the zzso injection zzso zzso zzso efficiencies for fragmentation of zzso I by resonance zzso are investigated as a function of cooling time for different modes of operation of the zzso A current limitation of the instrument is the time required to port the data for zzso
