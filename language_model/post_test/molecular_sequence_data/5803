The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was functionally expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cell zzso Two zzso zzso zzso cell lines were zzso one expressing an zzso zzso zzso and another expressing the zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells produced a zzso of approximately 150 zzso that was absent from zzso control zzso The zzso influx in both cell lines was significantly greater than zzso control zzso zzso The zzso cells displayed a zzso active zzso influx that could be increased further by 1 zzso zzso zzso but not by cell zzso Both zzso zzso constant zzso approximately 25 zzso and zzso zzso approximately 55 zzso inhibited the zzso zzso influx in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso influx in the zzso cells, zzso defined as zzso zzso required external zzso but not external zzso and exhibited a high apparent affinity for external zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but a low apparent affinity for external zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso On the basis of zzso considerations as well as the unique kinetic properties of the zzso zzso it is hypothesized that zzso may serve a dual function in zzso 1) the maintenance of low zzso zzso concentration so as to allow zzso influx via zzso zzso channels and 2) the zzso of external zzso concentration zzso in the zzso
