zzso zzso of transplant zzso occurs frequently even in the presence of high doses of zzso zzso We zzso zzso whether and which type of zzso zzso were selected by long-term zzso zzso zzso treatment leading to zzso of patients transplanted because of chronic zzso zzso liver zzso 

The zzso gene of the viral zzso obtained from zzso before transplantation and during zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and directly zzso 

According to zzso and zzso DNA zzso analysis, zzso zzso liver transplant patients had zzso and zzso recurrence during zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing a G to A zzso zzso at position zzso converting zzso to zzso zzso was identified in all three patients as the dominant population at zzso but not zzso zzso to the zzso no consistent zzso changes were found in the zzso region of zzso zzso when comparing the zzso and zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate that long-term zzso zzso zzso selected the most commonly described zzso zzso escape zzso zzso which became the dominant virus population and was responsible for graft zzso zzso zzso with high affinity for the zzso zzso zzso should be included in zzso to prevent zzso zzso infection in transplant zzso
