Five different chicken zzso genes were cloned and zzso The comparison of these sequences shows that they can be classified as members of two different families, the zzso family zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso family zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The extent of zzso within each of these families was assessed by in zzso amplification of DNA fragments encompassing zzso 2 in several zzso The zzso sequences were determined, and zzso relationships were zzso In the course of this work, a sixth gene termed zzso was identified, defining a third family zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso families is far less extensive than that of the zzso zzso In this latter, the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso is similar to what has been described in zzso These families seem to have been generated by gene zzso events giving rise to several zzso as observed in zzso However, zzso analyses indicate that these families are not zzso to their zzso zzso zzso of the level of zzso of these different genes showed that genes from the zzso family are predominantly transcribed over those of the other zzso
