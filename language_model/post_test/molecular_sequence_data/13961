The cloning and characterization of DNA zzso genes from zzso zzso is zzso The DNA sequence of zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso genes was zzso The gene zzso precedes zzso with a short zzso region of 29 zzso The proteins zzso zzso and zzso exhibit zzso identity to zzso zzso from other zzso The genes were further engineered for zzso in zzso zzso Both genes were individually cloned into a zzso zzso expression system and zzso The expressed zzso and zzso proteins had molecular masses of 75 and 95 zzso respectively, in agreement with that calculated from the zzso The extracts from the zzso clones were zzso to enrich the zzso and zzso for zzso zzso While the individual extracts showed no zzso activity, the combined extract exhibited a strong DNA zzso zzso This activity was zzso and zzso The identity of the genes was also confirmed by zzso zzso
