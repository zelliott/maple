zzso of zzso was investigated by zzso a rat zzso cell line with various zzso protein and zzso zzso The following zzso and distinct zzso were isolated and zzso a pool of zzso core zzso two pools of zzso with incomplete zzso one with three zzso zzso repeats and another with five or more zzso zzso repeats, as well as zzso with mature zzso zzso of zzso experiments indicated that these pools represented discrete stages in chain zzso Treatment with zzso A, which blocks transport from the zzso zzso to the zzso resulted in zzso of zzso with an incomplete chain containing six or seven largely zzso zzso zzso During recovery from drug treatment, zzso zzso earlier than zzso The results suggest that the zzso assembly-line consists of separate zzso complexes that build only a limited section of the zzso Furthermore, zzso A causes segregation of compartments involved in separate stages of the assembly zzso In an earlier report zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we took advantage of such segregation to identify and characterize a transient zzso of zzso in the linkage zzso
