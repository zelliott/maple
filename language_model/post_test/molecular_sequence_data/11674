The zzso gene on mouse zzso 1 regulates zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso A candidate gene expressed in zzso has been identified by zzso cloning and full-length sequence analysis, and encodes the Natural zzso zzso protein zzso In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the zzso gene zzso to zzso 

In zzso zzso was used to introduce the resistant zzso into the zzso cell line zzso zzso derived from the zzso susceptible zzso mouse zzso zzso of the zzso was monitored on the background of the zzso susceptible zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso correlated with three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respiratory burst, zzso release, and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso with the radical zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso electron transport zzso zzso and zzso inhibited respiratory burst, and zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso that zzso oxygen zzso are important zzso in zzso signal zzso zzso 

These data provide the first direct evidence that zzso is the product of the zzso zzso and are consistent with the hypothesis that the many zzso effects of this gene on zzso zzso may all derive from the requirement for zzso generation of oxygen zzso for zzso zzso
