The zzso sequence is a major recognition element for most zzso zzso We investigated the in zzso effects of changing the zzso on the zzso specificity in the example of zzso coli zzso zzso different zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso by zzso zzso we isolated 22 zzso zzso zzso the zzso corresponded to 16 zzso acids and an zzso stop zzso To examine whether the zzso zzso had changed their zzso acid zzso specificity in zzso we tested the viability of zzso coli strains containing these zzso genes in a medium which permitted zzso zzso Fourteen zzso zzso genes did not affect host zzso However, eight zzso zzso genes were toxic to the host and prevented growth, presumably because the zzso zzso led to zzso zzso Many zzso zzso which did not affect host viability were not zzso in zzso Three zzso zzso containing zzso sequences corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were charged with the zzso acid corresponding to their zzso but not with zzso These three zzso and zzso are located in the same cluster in a sequence similarity zzso of total zzso coli zzso The results support the idea that such zzso arising from in zzso evolution are derived by zzso change from the same zzso zzso
