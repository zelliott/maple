zzso pigmentation changes resulting from the development of a purple color in zzso zzso waste lagoons were investigated during a zzso zzso The major purple zzso zzso responsible for these color changes and the corresponding reductions in odor was isolated from nine zzso zzso By using zzso zzso and zzso characterization methods we identified the zzso zzso zzso as a new strain of zzso designated zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strain zzso is capable of zzso growth on a variety of organic compounds, including all of the characteristic volatile organic compounds zzso responsible for the odor associated with zzso production facilities zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brooks, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The seasonal variations in airborne zzso zzso from waste lagoons showed that there was a 80 to zzso decrease in the concentration of zzso during a zzso zzso During the height of a zzso the zzso zzso strain zzso population accounted for zzso of the total community and up to zzso of the zzso community based on zzso zzso DNA zzso Additional observations based on seasonal variations in zzso zzso and chemical parameters suggested that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso were correlated with zzso water temperature and with the zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso correlated with the zzso of protein and zzso
