We previously identified two zzso zzso and zzso zzso about 120 zzso apart from zzso and zzso on human zzso zzso Here we report the frequent amplification and zzso of these genes in surgically zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in 8 out of 22 zzso In the tumors with the amplification, these genes were zzso while in the tumors without the amplification, expression levels of these genes were almost the same as those with normal zzso These results suggest that zzso and/or zzso D1 may play an important role in the progression of human zzso zzso
