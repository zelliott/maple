The gene zzso the human tumor marker zzso zzso zzso belongs to a gene family which can be subdivided into the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The corresponding proteins are members of the zzso zzso characterized through the presence of one zzso domain and a varying number of zzso zzso Since the function of the zzso family is not well zzso we decided to establish an animal model in the rat to study its zzso and zzso zzso zzso To this end, we have screened an zzso rat zzso zzso library with a recently isolated zzso of a rat zzso zzso Two overlapping clones containing the complete coding region for a putative zzso zzso acid protein zzso Mr zzso zzso have been zzso In contrast to all members of the human zzso family, this rat zzso protein consists of five zzso zzso and only one zzso zzso This novel structure, which has been confirmed at the zzso level might have important functional zzso Due to the rapid evolutionary divergence of the rat and human zzso gene families it is not possible to assign zzso to its human zzso However, the zzso expression of the zzso gene in the zzso suggests that it could be analogous to one of the human zzso zzso zzso
