The synthesis of zzso zzso acids from zzso requires an zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso As expected, mice deficient in this zzso have elevated plasma and tissue levels of zzso and zzso however, levels of another major zzso zzso are not increased in these mice, suggesting the presence of another zzso zzso Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of zzso and human zzso and genes that zzso a second zzso zzso The genes contain 12 zzso and are located on zzso 6 in the human zzso zzso and in a zzso position on zzso 17 in the mouse zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that has preference for zzso and is expressed in the zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso do not change in response to dietary cholesterol, zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso unlike those zzso other zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is sexually zzso zzso zzso zzso which is opposite that of zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso with different zzso zzso exist in mice and humans and that sexually zzso expression patterns of these zzso in the mouse may zzso differences in zzso acid metabolism between the zzso
