We have shown that zzso a protein required for initiation of DNA replication in zzso coli, binds to three of four zzso binding sequences in the zzso origin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA interactions in zzso carried by zzso and zzso zzso strains were demonstrated by in zzso zzso using zzso treatment of intact zzso The same characteristic zzso pattern was seen in zzso zzso or zzso defective in zzso function but carrying the four zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed no protein binding at zzso temperatures and reduced binding even at zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso strain were identical to those obtained in zzso using zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso into zzso affected the binding of zzso protein to the zzso zzso These findings suggest that the protein causing the in zzso zzso at zzso is zzso
