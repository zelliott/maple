zzso zzso C zzso was found to function as the principal zzso for zzso zzso zzso major zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is enriched in zzso zzso but was also detected in other zzso zzso The zzso belongs to the family of zzso zzso zzso and consists of an zzso zzso domain, a single zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso is modified by zzso zzso and, at least in the small zzso by zzso resulting in a zzso zzso that is coupled zzso to the zzso zzso So far two zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been identified zzso the small zzso peptides zzso and zzso The zzso are released in an zzso or zzso fashion into the zzso zzso but may also function as zzso hormones in zzso communication and as regulators of zzso transport in zzso zzso They are thought to activate zzso by inducing a zzso change in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso complex, which allows two of the three zzso zzso zzso to zzso and form two active zzso zzso In the zzso zzso of zzso results in a dual zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso through the opening of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of Na zzso through blockade of an zzso zzso zzso The principal zzso of the zzso effect on zzso transport is zzso dependent protein zzso type II, which together with zzso and the zzso zzso may form a zzso complex at the zzso border of zzso zzso
