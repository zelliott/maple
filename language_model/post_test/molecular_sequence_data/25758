zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso coli zzso zzso from a zzso 82 promoter are zzso at the zzso zzso We show that this zzso results from variable addition of extra zzso zzso allowed by zzso of the initial zzso zzso against its DNA template sequence zzso zzso backward by one base allows another A to be added, giving zzso and this cycle can continue more than 20 times before it is ended by incorporation of UMP zzso by the fourth template base zzso zzso is abolished by zzso of the zzso template sequence to zzso and is sensitive to the zzso of zzso and zzso in the reaction zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and point zzso implies that the zzso reaction requires only the existence of zzso at the initiation site of the template zzso although changes in neighboring zzso slightly affect its zzso
