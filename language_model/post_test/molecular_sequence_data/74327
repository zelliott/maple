zzso are held in zzso arrest in zzso I until zzso when zzso trigger a zzso of zzso to resume zzso in a process termed zzso zzso arrest is maintained through a mechanism zzso zzso zzso production exceeds zzso degradation, leading to elevated zzso zzso Studies have implicated a zzso activated zzso zzso G zzso zzso 3 zzso as one of the molecules responsible for maintaining zzso arrest in mouse zzso Here we characterized the signaling and functional properties of zzso using the more amenable model system of zzso zzso zzso We cloned the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso and showed that zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso in large part via zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and maturation of isolated zzso as well as zzso maturation of zzso zzso In contrast, depletion of zzso using zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso levels and enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell surface zzso which enhanced zzso zzso maturation and zzso of zzso In addition, human zzso zzso of zzso zzso triggered zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso cell zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso moderates the zzso response to zzso signals, and that zzso zzso of zzso may play a partial role in zzso zzso for maturation by zzso zzso zzso zzso
