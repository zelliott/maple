We have zzso an zzso compound, consisting of the zzso of bovine insulin and an zzso corresponding to the zzso of human zzso growth zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso normally present in position 2 of the zzso of zzso has been replaced with zzso Biological evaluation of the compound indicated that its zzso activity zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso was zzso and its zzso activity zzso of zzso zzso was less than zzso both relative to natural zzso We conclude that interactions between zzso and zzso which are crucial to high biological activity in insulin, are also present in zzso and are equally critical for its biological zzso
