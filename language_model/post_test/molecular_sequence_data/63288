zzso zzso zzso were known previously to share extensive sequence zzso in their two largest zzso with the corresponding zzso of cellular zzso zzso and a modest alignment between the smallest zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The remaining zzso had no apparent cellular zzso In this study, the zzso program that combines zzso acid sequence alignments with secondary structure predictions was used to search for zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso matches of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso II zzso zzso 6, and 7, respectively, were zzso These results strengthen the concept that zzso zzso zzso likely evolved from cellular zzso zzso
