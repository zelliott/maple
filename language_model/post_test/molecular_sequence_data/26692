zzso species identification is essential for cost-effective zzso control zzso We tested the utility of zzso zzso for identifying members of the black fly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our efforts focus on four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peterson & zzso and zzso zzso zzso latter two being current or potential targets of biological control zzso We also analyzed one zzso species, zzso zzso zzso Although zzso adults can be identified zzso to species, control programs target the zzso stage, which is difficult or impossible to distinguish zzso By using zzso maximum zzso and zzso methods, we found that zzso zzso successfully identified three zzso zzso species, but not zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was also successfully zzso Despite zzso of zzso zzso we show that data from zzso zzso in combination with geographical and ecological information, can be used to distinguish all four zzso zzso Finally, we discussed 1) possible reasons for zzso in zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso to previously reported zzso zzso and 3) evolution of diverse feeding strategies within the zzso zzso
