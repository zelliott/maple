zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers the global shutdown of host zzso gene expression and protein synthesis approximately zzso h zzso Genome sequence analysis suggests that zzso zzso could be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso essential for zzso assembly and virus zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso resembles that of the zzso zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso is further zzso by its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the unique zzso structural arrangement, the zzso pocket and the characteristic zzso motif from each zzso is 35 zzso zzso zzso away from that of its corresponding zzso which suggests that zzso zzso might adopt a zzso mechanism from that of zzso to zzso zzso bond zzso Our zzso zzso activity zzso on the point zzso of the zzso zzso participating in zzso recognition reveals an aromatic cage next to the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso could be critical to zzso the formation of the zzso bonds of certain zzso proteins essential for zzso zzso zzso
