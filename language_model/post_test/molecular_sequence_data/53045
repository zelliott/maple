A zzso zzso mass zzso has been used to identify proteins separated by one-dimensional or two-dimensional gel zzso at the zzso zzso The high mass resolution and the high mass accuracy of this instrument in both zzso and zzso modes allow identification of a protein either by zzso mass zzso of the protein digest or from tandem mass zzso acquired by zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso A zzso mass map of the digest and tandem mass zzso of multiple zzso precursor zzso can be acquired from the same sample in the course of a single zzso Database searching and acquisition of zzso and zzso zzso can be combined in an interactive fashion, increasing the information value of the zzso zzso The approach has demonstrated its usefulness in the comprehensive characterization of protein zzso zzso in the dissection of complex protein zzso and in sequencing of a low molecular weight integral membrane zzso zzso can be identified in all types of sequence databases, including an zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso mass zzso promises to have remarkable potential for advancing zzso zzso
