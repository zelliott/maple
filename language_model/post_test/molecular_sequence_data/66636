Our understanding of how complex carbohydrates function during embryonic development is still very zzso primarily due to the large number of zzso now known to be involved in their zzso To overcome these limitations, we have taken advantage of the zzso system to analyze the function of complex carbohydrates during development by zzso the expression of specific zzso zzso we report the identification of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso I, zzso and its requirement for proper zzso extension movements during zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso and throughout the zzso during the first 24 h of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by two independent zzso zzso results in zzso with a truncated zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and moderate defects in the patterning of the head zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso returns zzso activity to control levels and zzso the defects produced by zzso zzso In zzso zzso of various molecular markers reveal that the zzso zzso of zzso stage zzso is zzso widened in zzso zzso indicative of abnormal zzso zzso zzso with this, the rate of zzso axis zzso is reduced relative to zzso zzso similar to that seen in known zzso extension zzso Among the many potential zzso for zzso is zzso a principle component of the zzso zzso that supports cell movements such as those that occur during zzso zzso Previous in zzso studies have shown that the zzso status of zzso directly influences its ability to support cell spreading and zzso In this regard, zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso is poorly zzso which may contribute to defective cell migration during zzso extension zzso This work demonstrates that zzso can be used to identify critical zzso roles for specific zzso that would not be obvious otherwise, such as an absolute requirement for zzso during zzso extension zzso
