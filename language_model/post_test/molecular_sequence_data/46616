zzso of zzso sequence diversity in zzso are a key step in exploring the linkage between zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso This paper reports a directional cloning procedure enabling the isolation of multiple copies of the zzso region of the zzso zzso from the fish zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso molecules revealed eight zzso an average zzso zzso frequency of zzso Three different types of zzso were detected but each derived from a single zzso zzso By contrasting the spectrum of zzso variation at multiple biological levels, one can investigate the effects of spontaneous zzso on zzso zzso Such zzso analysis suggested shifts in the type and distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso at different biological levels, indicating the need to recognize three different rates of zzso sequence change from the cellular to population zzso
