When zzso to zzso DNA both zzso and zzso can activate zzso from the zzso zzso To determine if they act by similar mechanisms, we constructed several hybrid zzso between zzso or zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso We tested these zzso on zzso reporter targets, which contained one to six zzso or zzso zzso sites placed upstream of the zzso zzso Whereas zzso acted very zzso via DNA even with five zzso sites, effects of zzso were observed with a single zzso site and increased with increasing number of zzso More importantly, effects of zzso via DNA were synergistic with those of zzso via zzso zzso when both proteins were expressed zzso We next created a zzso fusion zzso which contained the zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso which could be targeted to the zzso zzso either via DNA or zzso By introducing individual deleterious zzso into either zzso or zzso we confirmed that effects of zzso predominated via DNA whereas zzso but not zzso acted via zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso act at different steps of the zzso process and increase expression from the zzso zzso by different zzso
