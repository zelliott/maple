zzso is a soluble zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso copper resistance zzso of zzso zzso Like zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the same locus and its zzso zzso zzso zzso contains unusual zzso rich zzso Although essential for copper resistance, the functions of zzso zzso and their zzso zzso sequences are not zzso Similar zzso motifs observed in zzso copper zzso have been proposed to bind copper, but there are no zzso for such metal binding sites in structurally characterized zzso The high-resolution structures of zzso zzso determined for both the native and zzso zzso reveal a zzso beta barrel with the zzso unexpectedly housed on a zzso zzso Several potential zzso sites can be discerned by comparing the structures to zzso data reported for zzso zzso In the native structure, the zzso loop interacts with the same loop on a second zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso structure, the zzso zzso are more exposed, forming zzso patches on the protein zzso These two arrangements suggest that the zzso motifs might function in zzso interactions between zzso molecules or with other zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso data indicate that a weak zzso equilibrium exists in solution for the zzso zzso zzso is significantly enhanced upon binding zzso with a measured zzso degrees zzso zzso suggesting that copper might bind at the zzso zzso
