We have zzso zzso clones zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a protein that may be the species specific zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence deduced from the longest zzso frame reveals a zzso zzso which has basic and zzso regions that are similar in organization to zzso zzso Using truncated forms of the zzso zzso a zzso acid region could be defined that is necessary for zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this region shares no similarity with the binding motif of zzso or zzso We also analyzed several embryonic zzso zzso which show the existence of zzso spliced zzso Finally, we identified several potential protein zzso target zzso One of these is zzso to the zzso site and fits the zzso consensus sequence of proteins zzso by the zzso specific protein zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso uses a zzso motif unlike that found in other zzso and also raise the possibility that the activities of the zzso zzso may be regulated by alternative zzso and zzso
