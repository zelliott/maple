zzso cells express zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso In the present work, we show that three zzso cell zzso lines, zzso zzso and zzso representative of immature zzso express the zzso (formerly zzso zzso as judged from zzso amplification, zzso to a specific zzso and pharmacological and functional zzso zzso expression is higher in zzso cells, a cell line that is functionally more mature than zzso and zzso From the zzso DC population, we selected cell clones lacking the zzso zzso We also used a zzso blocker, oxidized zzso to zzso inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or of oxidized zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso was severely decreased although zzso zzso was minimally zzso During zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso large amounts of zzso zzso of this zzso was reduced in zzso zzso These data show that zzso express the zzso zzso and suggest a correlation between zzso expression and zzso zzso
