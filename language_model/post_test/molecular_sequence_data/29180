Closed circular zzso forms of zzso zzso DNA are detected in patients with high viral zzso however, it is unclear whether these forms remain if virus replication is suppressed to zzso levels by combination zzso zzso A zzso primer zzso chain reaction amplification zzso was used to detect the presence of zzso containing two long terminal repeat sequences zzso in zzso of patients with low or zzso plasma zzso zzso Fifty percent of patients with plasma zzso levels zzso zzso of blood had zzso zzso zzso zzso of the products identified normal zzso junctions in the minority of cases with the majority containing anomalies including deletions and zzso The persistence of zzso zzso in patients with no zzso plasma zzso could be consistent with ongoing de zzso infection of dividing cells or with stability of this form of DNA in zzso zzso
