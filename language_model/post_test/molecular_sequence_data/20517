The zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin of zzso zzso causes destruction of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso responsible for these activities are here shown to be independent proteins released from the large toxin by zzso zzso by an embedded zzso zzso domain zzso The zzso is activated upon binding zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso is not simply an zzso zzso but rather binding of zzso stabilized the zzso structure, zzso formation of the zzso zzso The zzso crystal structure of this zzso zzso form of zzso was determined and revealed the zzso bond zzso captured in the zzso zzso Upon processing at this site, zzso was converted to a form with zzso reduced affinity for zzso but was zzso for high affinity binding of zzso by cooperative binding of both a new zzso and zzso zzso of zzso allowed zzso of the zzso toxin at other sites, specifically at zzso zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso other proteins in zzso including the zzso protein zzso demonstrating that it is a zzso zzso zzso
