zzso is an zzso zzso which is abundantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and believed to be involved in zzso iron zzso In the present study, zzso has been cloned and functionally expressed using zzso insect host cells zzso zzso The work also addresses the possible role of zzso zzso to facilitate the release of zzso zzso The zzso zzso in culture medium exhibits a molecular mass and zzso properties similar to native zzso zzso The specific activity was estimated at 233 zzso using zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso enhancement in specific activity and a zzso zzso as observed in preparations of most zzso purple acid zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso correlated with the appearance of low molecular weight zzso fragments and the release of zzso zzso
