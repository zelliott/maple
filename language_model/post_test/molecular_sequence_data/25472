Universal zzso zzso designed for amplifying and sequencing genes zzso the rearranged human zzso zzso variable region, were validated by amplification of the zzso light chain genes from four human zzso cell lines and in the generation of a zzso library of human V zzso sequences from zzso zzso human peripheral blood zzso This technique allows rapid cloning and sequencing of human zzso zzso and has potential applications in the rescue of unstable human zzso cell lines and in the production of human zzso zzso
