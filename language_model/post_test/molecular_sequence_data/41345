The zzso proteins are involved in various processes of plant growth, development, and stress zzso In a previous work, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso protein was identified in zzso In this study, the isolation and functional characterization of the zzso gene are zzso Three zzso sequences of zzso were isolated from zzso wheat and designated as zzso zzso and zzso genes based on the zzso of these three sequences to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression levels of these three genes were similar under zzso stress conditions, and zzso was selected for further zzso The zzso protein was localized to the nucleus where it activated zzso The detailed characterization of zzso transgenic plants that zzso the zzso gene revealed that the zzso protein can improve drought stress tolerance during the zzso and the zzso zzso It was also found that zzso of zzso resulted in altered expression levels of some drought zzso genes and changes in several zzso zzso which allow plants to overcome adverse zzso These results indicate that the zzso protein plays important roles in plant stress zzso and modification of its expression may improve drought stress tolerance in crop zzso
