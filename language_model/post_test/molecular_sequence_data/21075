The human zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the so-called zzso zzso because of its unknown zzso zzso However, recent studies showed that the zzso zzso exhibited broad zzso activity towards several zzso Furthermore, this zzso was selectively expressed in some forms of zzso whereas a very low expression was found in human normal zzso These render zzso as a potential drug target for cancer zzso At present, however, little information is available on the active site zzso and the zzso binding modes of zzso In this study, the three-dimensional model of zzso was constructed using the zzso modeling zzso Two known zzso zzso and zzso were then zzso into the active site, and refined by molecular dynamics zzso The interaction energy between the zzso and the zzso was calculated and analyzed by using the zzso zzso The results indicated that the constructed zzso model can account for the zzso of this zzso towards the known zzso and van der zzso interactions were the driving force for the zzso zzso Several key zzso were identified to be responsible for the binding of zzso and zzso with zzso These findings provide useful information for the detailed characterization of the biological roles of zzso and zzso drug design of this zzso
