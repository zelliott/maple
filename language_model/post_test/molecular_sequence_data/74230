A zzso fungus zzso zzso produces zzso acid, which is predicted to be derived from zzso acid via zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso in the carbon metabolism of the zzso To clarify the zzso function and a zzso for zzso acid zzso we cloned a novel gene zzso the zzso The open reading frame of this gene zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids and is interrupted by a single zzso Among the identified proteins in the database, the primary structure of the protein zzso by zzso shared high identity with the zzso family of zzso including a number of zzso zzso of zzso The cloned gene excluding an zzso was introduced into the expression zzso zzso controlled by the zzso zzso The zzso activity in zzso zzso was confirmed by directly detecting zzso acid as a product from zzso acid as a zzso This result reveals for the first time that this gene encodes zzso which is essential for zzso acid production in zzso zzso
