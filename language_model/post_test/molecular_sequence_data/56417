A fraction of a zzso digest of wheat zzso zzso zzso known to be toxic to individuals with zzso disease, together with synthetic peptides containing key zzso zzso were tested for their effects on zzso chick zzso and on rat liver zzso zzso 9 and a zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso were the only peptides to display appreciable activity in both zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso was only zzso toxic to zzso and zzso to chick zzso A zzso corresponding to zzso zzso was zzso in both zzso Two zzso peptides containing the key sequence zzso were also tested but were found to be zzso as was the zzso zzso The results suggest that the key sequences zzso and zzso are not sufficient by themselves to cause zzso Further tests on synthetic peptides will be necessary to define the sequences of highest zzso
