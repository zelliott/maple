A unique zzso domain extension is required by most zzso zzso zzso for zzso In one exception, the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso is actually zzso by its own zzso zzso It was proposed that the zzso zzso zzso has compromised its zzso activity to some extent and adapted its C zzso for a second role in zzso zzso which is also zzso X-ray crystal structures of the zzso complex show that the 60 zzso zzso domain is zzso to the main body of the zzso via a flexible zzso zzso and allows interactions with the zzso zzso We hypothesized that this short zzso zzso would facilitate rigid body movement of the zzso domain as zzso transitions between an zzso and editing complex or, in the case of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso The roles of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso were investigated via deletion zzso as well as by introducing zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso determined that its zzso rather than its zzso was critical to zzso and editing zzso Although deletions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the protein in general, more stable zzso zzso that contained an zzso coli zzso zzso domain showed that zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggested that limiting zzso domain accessibility to zzso zzso its role in protein synthesis and may be a unique adaptation of zzso zzso zzso that zzso its second function in zzso zzso
