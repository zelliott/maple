The sorting of integral membrane proteins such as zzso S zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso bodies zzso in zzso zzso requires zzso of their zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso An exception is zzso which does not require zzso for entry into zzso The mechanism underlying this zzso zzso sorting zzso has not yet been zzso Here, we show that zzso sorting into the zzso zzso depends on a direct interaction between a zzso motif within its zzso zzso tail and the WW zzso of zzso zzso of this interaction zzso zzso targeting of zzso and causes its zzso in a compartment that zzso only partially with zzso Surprisingly, zzso does require a functional zzso zzso domain within zzso however, the dependence of zzso on zzso domain activity is distinct from that of zzso zzso we show that zzso requires neither zzso nor the zzso zzso protein zzso for its zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso follows a novel zzso but zzso sorting zzso to the zzso
