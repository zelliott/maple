In case of zzso zzso of B cell origin and zzso zzso zzso transformed B cells, it is invariably found that these cells zzso in the apparent absence of signals from T zzso Many of transformed B cells tested appear to be zzso to the zzso effects of a number of defined zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have recently reported on the molecular cloning of a T cell derived human B cell growth factor, zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso zzso proliferation in zzso negative zzso zzso B cell line, zzso and zzso zzso B cell line, zzso A mouse zzso zzso produced against a zzso synthetic zzso zzso the zzso activity present in the zzso zzso media as well as zzso the in zzso growth of zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso gene zzso provides further evidence that zzso cells express the zzso zzso whereas this gene is silent in resting and zzso activated normal human B zzso These data clearly suggest an zzso role of zzso in transformed human B zzso
