zzso diabetes occurs when invading zzso destroy zzso beta cells in pancreatic zzso The role of zzso zzso at this inflammatory site is not zzso We find that B and T zzso attacking zzso in zzso mice organize into zzso structures with zzso zzso Analysis of zzso L chain genes was used to investigate selection of B zzso in these zzso zzso structures and in draining pancreatic zzso zzso The pancreatic repertoire as a whole was found to be highly diverse, with the profile of L chain genes isolated from whole zzso differing from that observed in regional zzso zzso A zzso L chain predominated within the complex pancreatic repertoire of zzso zzso Skewing toward zzso genes was observed in the zzso when the repertoire of zzso mice was restricted using a fixed zzso H chain zzso zzso sequencing of expressed zzso identified shared zzso in some sequences consistent with zzso selection and zzso expansion at the site of zzso zzso zzso contained zzso B zzso enriched for the zzso center marker zzso and for sequences containing multiple zzso within zzso suggesting local zzso zzso Together, these findings identify a process that selects B zzso zzso within the zzso with further evolution of the selected repertoire at the inflamed zzso This interpretation is reinforced by zzso studies showing a large population of zzso B zzso in the zzso compared with draining zzso zzso
