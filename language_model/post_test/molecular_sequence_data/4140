Two genes zzso and zzso with strong sequence zzso zzso identity at the protein zzso zzso involved in the formation of aroma volatile zzso have been isolated from zzso melon zzso They belong to a large and highly divergent family of zzso plant zzso and show at most zzso identity to the only other fruit zzso characterized so far in zzso zzso studies indicated that both genes were specifically expressed in fruit at increasing rates in the early and mid zzso of zzso zzso was severely reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fruit and in zzso zzso fruit treated with the zzso zzso zzso Cloning of the two genes in zzso revealed that the zzso protein exhibited alcohol zzso activity while no such activity could be detected for zzso despite the strong zzso between the two zzso zzso was capable of producing zzso from a wide range of combinations of alcohols and zzso The higher the carbon chain of zzso zzso the higher the zzso zzso alcohols were zzso at differential rates depending on the position of the zzso group and the nature of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso alcohols were also good zzso but activity varied with the position and size of the aromatic zzso The zzso zzso influenced activity either positively zzso or zzso zzso Because zzso zzso evolve the whole range of zzso generated by the zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso plays a major role in aroma zzso formation in the zzso
