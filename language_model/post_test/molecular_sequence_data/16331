The tom element, zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso The tom element was found to terminate with 475 (or zzso base pair direct repeats which are identical in sequence to each zzso Southern zzso and zzso analyses showed the tom element to have high zzso to 297 and zzso two zzso found in zzso zzso As in the cases of 297 and zzso tom includes zzso sequences coding for a zzso zzso and reverse zzso similar in zzso acid sequence to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso At the tom zzso site of the zzso zzso a host DNA sequence zzso was found to be duplicated on each side of the tom zzso and all other tom elements examined were also flanked by zzso In each of six cases, the zzso zzso host sequence was zzso These results indicate that the target sequence of the tom element may be zzso and that the entire region or a part of this sequence was duplicated on zzso of the tom zzso
