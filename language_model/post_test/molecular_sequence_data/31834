In search for yet zzso proteins involved in zzso metabolism of the chicken, we have isolated a zzso unknown protein from the serum zzso fraction with a buoyant density of zzso zzso Data obtained by protein zzso and molecular cloning of zzso defined a zzso zzso zzso zzso a precursor zzso of 178 zzso As determined by zzso the major circulating form of the zzso which we designate zzso zzso has an apparent Mr of approximately 17 zzso Northern zzso analysis of different zzso of laying zzso revealed zzso expression mainly in the liver and small zzso compatible with an involvement of the protein in zzso zzso To further investigate the biology of zzso we raised an zzso against a zzso fusion zzso which allowed the detection of the zzso protein in zzso zzso whereas in laying zzso it was zzso only in the isolated zzso zzso density zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment of zzso caused a reduction of zzso in the liver and in the circulation to levels similar to those in mature zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso with a zzso protein in quail zzso indicating conservation of zzso in avian zzso In search for zzso counterparts of zzso alignment of the sequence of the novel chicken protein with those of different zzso zzso revealed stretches with limited similarity to regions of zzso and possibly with zzso from various zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is a newly identified avian zzso
