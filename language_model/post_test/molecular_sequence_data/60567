zzso factors localized in the zzso zzso of an zzso egg are essential for cell zzso and pattern formation of the zzso The molecular identification of the localized factors and the zzso of the machinery associated with the zzso are therefore key research zzso I report here the isolation and characterization of a novel zzso expressed zzso zzso end mark 3 zzso The zzso zzso was obtained from a zzso library of zzso egg zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso As in the case of zzso zzso et zzso 1996, Development zzso zzso the zzso maternal transcript was gradually concentrated after zzso in the zzso zzso of the egg, and it later marked the zzso end of developing zzso The zzso protein was also detected in the zzso end of early zzso The zzso sequence predicted that zzso encodes a probable zzso protein with two zzso zzso that have an extensive similarity with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso is also localized in zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1996, Cell 87, zzso suggesting that zzso is a candidate zzso of zzso In addition to maternal zzso a zzso transcript of zzso and its gene product were detected in cells of the neural plate, zzso and zzso of zzso after the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression using an zzso zzso resulted in the development of abnormal larvae without sensory zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso zzso plays a role in the differentiation of the brain of the zzso zzso
