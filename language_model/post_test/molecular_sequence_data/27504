zzso insight into the mechanisms of zzso in zzso is of primary importance for both zzso studies on the evolution of host plant specialization and applied research in zzso control management because zzso rely on their sense of smell and taste to locate and assess their host zzso We made use of the recent zzso sequence of the pea zzso zzso zzso to address the molecular characterization and evolution of key molecular components of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified 79 Or and 77 zzso genes in the pea zzso zzso and showed that most of them are zzso genes that have undergone recent and rapid expansion in the zzso By addressing selection within sets of zzso Or and zzso expansions, for the first time in an insect species, we show that the most recently duplicated zzso have evolved under positive selection, which might be related to the high degree of ecological specialization of this zzso Although more functional studies are still needed for insect zzso we provide evidence that zzso and zzso have different sets of positively selected sites, suggesting the possibility that these two gene families might have different binding pockets and bind structurally distinct classes of zzso The pea zzso is the most zzso insect species with a completely zzso zzso to zzso The identification of zzso genes in this species is a key step toward further exploring insect comparative zzso the zzso of ecological specialization and zzso and new zzso control zzso
