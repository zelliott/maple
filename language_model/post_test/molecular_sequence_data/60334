We cloned a zzso zzso of 280 zzso from the zzso zzso which has an zzso similar to that of a zzso zzso and a zzso with a zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso signature sequence motifs are zzso in both zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso segments of the zzso are zzso Genes coding for zzso identical proteins with substantial sequence similarities have been cloned from zzso and were detected in sequences from zzso deposited by the zzso Genome zzso After 99 point zzso to convert the zzso zzso triplets to zzso together with partial gene zzso the gene from zzso was zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso is zzso processed into the two zzso zzso demonstrates expression of the protein in zzso and zzso it to cell surface zzso The data provide a novel structural link between class III zzso and zzso zzso and imply that the zzso zzso zzso evolved from an ancestral zzso zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, signal transmission in zzso zzso zzso and in the most important zzso zzso zzso zzso is, quite unexpectedly, closely zzso
