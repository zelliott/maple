The Mediterranean fruit fly, zzso zzso zzso is an extremely invasive agricultural zzso due to its extremely wide host range and its ability to adapt to a broad range of zzso conditions and zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in many crucial stages in the life of this zzso such as the detection of zzso cues during mate pursuit and zzso during host plant zzso Thus, the analysis of the zzso gene repertoire is an important step for the interpretation of the biology of this species and consequently its invasive zzso Moreover, these genes may represent ideal targets for the development of novel, effective control methods and zzso population monitoring zzso zzso sequence tag libraries from zzso zzso adult heads, zzso male accessory zzso and zzso were screened for sequences zzso putative zzso binding proteins zzso A total of zzso putative zzso transcripts were identified, corresponding to 13 Classic, three zzso and one zzso zzso zzso The tissue zzso of the zzso transcripts were assessed by zzso and a subset of five genes with predicted proteins sharing high sequence similarities and close zzso affinities to zzso zzso zzso binding protein related proteins zzso were zzso in greater zzso Real Time quantitative zzso was used to assess the effects of zzso mating and time of day on the transcript zzso of the putative zzso genes in the principal zzso zzso the zzso in males and zzso The results of the present study have facilitated the zzso of zzso genes in the recently released zzso zzso sequence and represent a significant contribution to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The identification of these zzso zzso permitted evolutionary and functional comparisons with zzso sequences from other zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso
