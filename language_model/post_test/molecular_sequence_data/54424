We previously identified zzso in the zzso initiation factor 2 zzso located outside its zzso domain, zzso strongly zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that rapid zzso of zzso with zzso zzso in initiation of translation depends on switching zzso zzso zzso from its inactive to active zzso zzso of zzso zzso requires zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, extensive zzso of zzso zzso occurs with only zzso or with zzso and zzso zzso a passive role for zzso zzso as zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The theory of conditional switching of zzso zzso accounts for all our experimental zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increase the equilibrium ratio, K, between active and inactive forms of zzso from a value of 4 zzso zzso for zzso zzso by factors of zzso 8, 80 and 20, zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso provides keys to structural interpretation of conditional switching of zzso and other zzso zzso
