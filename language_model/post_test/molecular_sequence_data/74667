The zzso of flu zzso of the strain zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of various classes was studied to develop an approach to the study of the structural organization and interaction of the basic protein components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso forming a layer under the zzso zzso Among the tested zzso zzso and zzso preparations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso preparation zzso efficiently deleted zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted only a part of zzso An analysis by zzso zzso mass zzso allowed us to locate the sites of zzso zzso by various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso split the zzso chain after the zzso zzso located before the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso bond at other neighboring zzso after zzso (a basic zzso or zzso The zzso activity of zzso measured by a highly specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was almost three times higher in the presence of 5 zzso zzso than in the presence of 50 zzso However, the complete removal of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso required identical time zzso In the absence of the reducing zzso the removal of zzso by zzso proceeded a little more slowly and was accompanied by significant fragmentation of protein zzso The action of zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso of proteins zzso and zzso by zzso was zzso
