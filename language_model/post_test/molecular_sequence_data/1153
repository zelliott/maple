zzso model organisms that are amenable to comprehensive experimental analysis can be used to zzso the molecular genetic architecture of complex zzso They can thereby enhance our understanding of these traits in other organisms, including zzso Here, we describe the use of the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso model system to study innate zzso We detail our current understanding of the zzso immune system, which seems to be characterized by four main signaling zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso a transforming growth zzso a zzso cell death, and an zzso zzso zzso Many details, especially regarding pathogen recognition and immune zzso are only poorly characterized and clearly warrant further zzso We additionally speculate on the evolution of the zzso zzso immune system, taking into special consideration the relationship between zzso stress responses and zzso the diversification of the different parts of the immune system in response to multiple and/or zzso zzso and the zzso between immunity and host life history zzso Using zzso zzso to address these different zzso of zzso interactions provides a fresh perspective on our understanding of the structure and complexity of innate immune systems in animals and zzso
