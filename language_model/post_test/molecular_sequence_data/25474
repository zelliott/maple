The zzso protein of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso is prominent in the immune response to this zzso and individual T cell zzso from this protein sequence have been zzso We have tested the zzso activity of extended zzso of the minimal zzso representing one such zzso zzso with a variety of zzso extensions added to enhance or destabilize alpha zzso zzso The zzso potential of the peptides was measured by circular zzso using zzso zzso as a secondary structure zzso Although zzso with high zzso potential activated T cells at low zzso a less zzso zzso was similarly zzso zzso also did not correlate with predicted overall alpha zzso zzso One analog was found which zzso T cell proliferation in the 50 zzso zzso The effect of zzso extensions on zzso activity is not consistent with the importance in activity of only a single stable secondary structure such as an alpha zzso
