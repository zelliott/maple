Patients with advanced zzso participating in our ongoing phase I zzso zzso gene therapy protocol at the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, were vaccinated with zzso zzso tumor cells together with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of expression of the zzso gene in cultured zzso and selected zzso and in zzso obtained from vaccination sites was evaluated using quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The number of copies of zzso zzso of total cellular zzso was determined in the zzso zzso Good agreement was observed between zzso message zzso as determined by zzso and zzso production, as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of multiple vaccination sites were obtained from the patients to determine the level of gene expression in zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso gene was used as a marker for zzso zzso Two weeks after the first zzso zzso for the zzso gene was still zzso in all tissue zzso The zzso gene was also zzso indicating the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso After the second zzso expression of the zzso and zzso genes was generally the highest on day 1 after vaccine administration and was considerably lower but still zzso on day 14 in all zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso genes and used as a source of zzso in tumor vaccine are able to express the zzso gene in zzso
