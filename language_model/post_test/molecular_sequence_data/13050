zzso belonging to the Ras small zzso protein zzso has been implicated in regulation of various cell functions such as gene zzso cell zzso and zzso cell zzso In the present study, we zzso an zzso protein with molecular mass of about 98 zzso zzso from bovine brain zzso by zzso zzso zzso affinity column zzso This protein bound to zzso gamma S zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso gamma zzso with a zzso in the zzso domain zzso zzso gamma zzso or zzso gamma zzso We obtained a zzso zzso zzso on the basis of its partial zzso acid zzso The predicted protein consists of zzso zzso acids whose calculated mass, zzso zzso is close to the apparent molecular mass of zzso The zzso acid sequence shows a high degree of sequence similarity to the entire sequence of zzso one of the zzso proteins zzso for zzso A zzso protein consisting of the zzso domain of zzso fused to zzso protein zzso zzso activity of zzso and showed a weak effect on that of zzso but not that of zzso or zzso These results clearly indicate that zzso is a novel GAP for zzso Thus, we designated this protein as zzso zzso
