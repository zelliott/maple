zzso of the zzso gene are linked to zzso zzso disease, and type 1 diabetes, but the underlying zzso mechanisms are zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso plays crucial roles in maintaining T cell zzso and governing the zzso zzso and survival of zzso regulatory T zzso zzso zzso T cells display spontaneous zzso and produce elevated levels of zzso zzso Without zzso zzso cells exhibit diminished zzso zzso depleted numbers, zzso enhanced zzso and profound loss of competitive fitness in zzso zzso reduced survival of zzso zzso cells was associated with reduced zzso and zzso levels and elevated zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso induced selective loss of zzso zzso cells and a zzso cell zzso skewed toward the zzso zzso program at the expense of the zzso zzso In zzso experiments confirmed that zzso 1) is indispensable for zzso zzso zzso and 2) zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells by repression of the competing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the differentiation of induced zzso cells was linked to a fatal zzso chronic inflammatory lung disease in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso T cell zzso promotes the development and survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, and protects against zzso zzso
