zzso were prepared from three zzso cell lines from patients with high percentage copy numbers of the human zzso zzso zzso and compared to those prepared from related and zzso control cell zzso Rates of zzso synthesis with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were reduced to zzso zzso and zzso of the control rates, zzso The backward reaction measured as zzso sensitive zzso was reduced to an average of zzso of that in zzso This zzso which changes a zzso zzso to an zzso in the putative membrane zzso channel of zzso zzso effectively reduces the overall rate of zzso zzso
