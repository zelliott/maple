The zzso chain reaction was used to identify novel zzso zzso zzso in zzso preparations from the zzso green algae zzso zzso and zzso zzso These experiments along with sequence analysis disclosed the presence, in both green algae, of a single zzso zzso in the zzso gene and of two group I zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, two group I zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso region of the zzso large zzso zzso gene at the same positions as previously reported zzso zzso zzso The 188 zzso segment preceding the first zzso zzso revealed extensive sequence similarity to the zzso spaced zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso DNA, indicating that these two zzso have undergone zzso in zzso The zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were found to be related in sequence to the first zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The similarity between the former zzso extends to the immediate zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that group I zzso zzso occurred from one of the two genes to the other through reverse zzso
