Cell death plays important roles in the development and defense of plants as in other zzso zzso Rapid production of zzso oxygen species often is associated with plant defense against zzso but their molecular mechanisms are not zzso We introduced the zzso active and the dominant negative forms of the small zzso protein zzso a rice zzso of human zzso into the wild type and a zzso mimic zzso of rice and analyzed zzso production and cell death in transformed cell cultures and zzso The results indicate that zzso is a regulator of zzso oxygen species production as well as cell death in zzso
