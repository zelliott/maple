Two near full-length zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a library of zzso zzso cell suspension cultures by the use of zzso probe of potato zzso These zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso encodes 636 zzso zzso whose zzso to the zzso protein sequences known to zzso parsley, pine and rice, were found to be zzso zzso zzso and 50% zzso on zzso acid zzso respectively, whereas those of the predicted translation product of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the above zzso proteins were 49 approximately zzso The similarity of the deduced zzso acid sequences between the two zzso from zzso cell cultures was zzso in zzso Northern analyses showed that the zzso levels of both zzso and zzso were much higher under zzso than in the dark, as reported for the zzso genes of such plants as zzso In comparison of zzso levels of zzso and zzso the former was demonstrated to be generally higher than the latter by means of an application of zzso The zzso southern zzso experiments suggested that there are probably three copies of zzso in the zzso zzso DNA, whereas only one copy was detected for zzso
