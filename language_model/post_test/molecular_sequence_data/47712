It is now becoming clear that additional zzso components can modify zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso whose external zzso chains can bind zzso zzso zzso and whose core protein zzso domain can signal during zzso Two papers in this issue of zzso zzso through zzso studies, that zzso plays roles in the formation of focal zzso and stress zzso zzso of zzso increases focal zzso formation, whereas a partially truncated core protein that lacks the binding site for protein zzso zzso and zzso 4, zzso acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso induction does not require interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso but can occur when zzso core protein is zzso this suggests that zzso of zzso plays a major role in signaling from the zzso zzso in zzso
