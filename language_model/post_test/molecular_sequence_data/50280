A sensitive and simple method for the zzso of human DNA is zzso This method is based on probe zzso to a human alpha satellite zzso zzso The zzso probe is zzso to sample DNA immobilized on nylon zzso The subsequent binding of zzso zzso to the bound probe allows for zzso detection using a zzso zzso and X-ray zzso Less than 150 zzso of human DNA can easily be detected with a 15 minute zzso The entire procedure can be performed in zzso zzso zzso quantities of nonhuman DNA have been tested and the results indicate very high specificity for human zzso The data on film can be scanned into a computer and a commercially available program can be used to create a standard curve where DNA quantity is plotted against the mean density of each slot zzso zzso The methods described can also be applied to the very sensitive determination of quantity and quality zzso of DNA on Southern zzso The high sensitivity of this zzso method requires the consumption of only a fraction of sample for zzso zzso of DNA quantity is necessary for zzso and many zzso tests where optimal results are obtained only with a relatively narrow range of DNA zzso The specificity of this zzso method for human DNA will be useful for the analysis of samples that may also contain bacterial or other zzso DNA, for example forensic evidence samples, ancient DNA samples, or clinical zzso
