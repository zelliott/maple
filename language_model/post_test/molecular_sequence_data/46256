zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key repair zzso that helps to protect the cell against zzso on DNA by removing a zzso group from the zzso of zzso Here, we cloned and zzso the full-length zzso zzso from the zzso fish, zzso zzso Complete zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso and the open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 188 zzso acid zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was clustered with those of other fish zzso zzso zzso and aged secondary fish had low levels of zzso zzso than adults, indicating more zzso to DNA damage by zzso agent exposure during these zzso zzso zzso zzso levels differed according to tissue type and was highest in the zzso Exposure to an zzso agent, zzso zzso exposure increased the zzso expression of tumor zzso gene such as zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso in a zzso zzso On the contrary, several zzso compounds zzso 100 zzso tamoxifen 10 zzso zzso A 600 zzso and zzso 300 zzso suppressed zzso expression of zzso in most zzso especially the zzso In juvenile fish, zzso zzso A, and zzso also decreased the expression of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Overall, our finding shows that zzso zzso levels can be modulated by environmental zzso compounds as well as zzso zzso This finding will be helpful to improve our knowledge of the effects of zzso compounds that contain the zzso ability to inhibit the DNA repair process in aquatic zzso
