The outer membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a central zzso factor in zzso The primary structure of the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are associated with zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of the ancestral zzso zzso lineages zzso and Angola carries the single zzso acid change zzso located in surface loop 5 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso KIM zzso or zzso coli zzso expressing zzso zzso was impaired in zzso and in zzso zzso Lack of zzso generation of the zzso light chain of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity by the zzso zzso construct indicated that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso more zzso than did common zzso The zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso was different from that of the common zzso zzso zzso zzso was more efficient than zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso have evolved from the same zzso zzso and their comparison showed that zzso was poor in zzso zzso but exhibited efficient zzso zzso The substitution zzso in zzso constructed to mimic the zzso region in zzso altered zzso in favor of zzso formation, whereas the reverse substitution zzso in zzso altered zzso in favor of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso represents an ancestral form of zzso that has evolved into a more efficient zzso zzso in the pandemic zzso zzso zzso
