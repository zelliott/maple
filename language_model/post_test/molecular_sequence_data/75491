zzso is an early growth response gene that displays zzso induction zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso following zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso predicts a protein with three DNA binding zinc zzso The human zzso gene maps to zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso increases dramatically during cardiac and neural cell zzso and following membrane zzso both in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are often zzso with zzso similar zzso These results, in conjunction with the zzso primary structure, suggest that zzso may function as a zzso regulator in diverse biological zzso
