The rejoining by human cell extracts of a zzso break induced by zzso treatment at one of several sites within a small DNA zzso was zzso zzso was found at each of 8 sites tested, but the rejoin efficiency varied with the nature of the break zzso breaks with cohesive ends were rejoined more efficiently than zzso zzso zzso from primary and immortalized cell lines, as well as those from individuals with zzso zzso zzso showed the same pattern of relative rejoin zzso However, zzso varied with the cell extract used, and was particularly elevated with two immortalized zzso cell zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso property of extracts could act in a zzso fashion, depending on the individual efficiencies of the component zzso The zzso mechanism involved deletion at sites of short direct repeats at various distances from the initial break zzso A model of deletion formation (the zzso and repair zzso is restated to explain the sequence repeat dependence found, and is compared to models of zzso DNA zzso
