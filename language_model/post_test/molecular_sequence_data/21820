zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are heavily zzso The most prevalent editing event is the zzso of single zzso with Us and zzso also added at specific zzso The existence of zzso editing makes gene identification difficult and zzso of editing sites has relied upon characterization of individual zzso We have now determined the complete zzso zzso of zzso using zzso deep sequencing of zzso zzso zzso We report the first instances of A and G insertions and sites of partial and zzso editing in zzso zzso zzso as well as an additional zzso C, U and zzso zzso The notable lack of zzso zzso in our zzso selected, directional library argues strongly against an zzso editing zzso Also of interest are our findings that sites of C to U changes are zzso at a significantly higher frequency than zzso editing sites and that zzso editing of neighboring sites appears to be zzso Finally, in addition to the characterization of zzso from 17 predicted zzso our data identified nine new zzso zzso four of which zzso proteins that do not resemble other proteins in the zzso zzso one of the latter zzso contains no editing zzso
