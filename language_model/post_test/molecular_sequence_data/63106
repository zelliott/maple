Development of the zzso zzso is a critical feature of zzso formation and actively involves pulmonary zzso zzso The elastic fiber network is an interconnected system of zzso fibers that also influences the behavior of adjacent cells, particularly the zzso lung zzso zzso We hypothesized that discrete zzso of zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso and direct their migration in the presence of zzso growth factor zzso zzso coated with zzso peptides lacking or including an zzso acid zzso motif were used to study zzso migration across porous filters and on zzso zzso zzso 24 of zzso zzso 24), which encodes for an zzso transforming growth zzso zzso domain, zzso migration with greater directional persistence and more effectively zzso zzso migration at low zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which include zzso growth zzso zzso and an zzso zzso domain, induce more zzso and more widespread zzso of the leading edge, resulting in greater migration zzso than did zzso zzso zzso structural features in regions that surround the zzso motifs may zzso regulate how the zzso zzso promotes zzso distribution and zzso filament zzso at the cell's leading zzso zzso how zzso regulate zzso migration may help zzso how the elastic fiber system could be restored as an interconnected unit, which fails to occur in zzso zzso
