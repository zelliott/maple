Type IV zzso have been zzso from strains of most of the zzso species associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso They appear to be a related family zzso mass of zzso 19 to 23 zzso with a tendency to zzso zzso we have designated them zzso zzso zzso A type IV zzso zzso gene cluster zzso recently cloned from a strain of zzso zzso however, zzso a 17 zzso zzso which differed significantly in its zzso zzso acid sequence from the zzso zzso This paper describes the cloning of part zzso and approximately zzso of zzso of a zzso zzso gene cluster from a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and presents evidence that the entire zzso gene cluster zzso is present in this zzso The predicted zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differed markedly from the corresponding sequence of its zzso zzso and those of the zzso zzso from other zzso strains and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso genes showed that these zzso zzso strains also possessed the Tap gene zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso shared zzso identity and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso species are potentially able to express at least two distinct families of type IV zzso zzso and zzso
