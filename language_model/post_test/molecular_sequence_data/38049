We previously reported a zzso strategy for designing zzso proteins by assigning only the zzso patterning of polar or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Xiong, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso Here we describe the finding that approximately half of the proteins in the original collection display some level of zzso in their zzso zzso zzso Many are zzso in solution, demonstrating that the observed zzso is not merely a consequence of zzso These findings demonstrate that although the zzso nature of the design strategy zzso explicit design of zzso zzso zzso patterning incorporates sufficient sequence information to generate de zzso proteins with zzso folded zzso As zzso zzso of polar and zzso zzso acids is an intrinsic part of the genetic code, these findings may bear on the early evolution of native zzso
