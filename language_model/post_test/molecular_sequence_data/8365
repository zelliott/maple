The zzso zzso gene cluster of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso as well as by DNA sequencing, and compared with the respective zzso segments of other zzso zzso The zzso gene cluster is composed of 27 open reading frames with putative zzso or regulatory functions zzso zzso and three resistance zzso zzso two of which, zzso and zzso flank the zzso A very similar overall organization of the zzso cluster seems to be zzso in four other zzso producers, although the clusters are embedded in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso the zzso apparently is present only in single zzso However, in the industrial strain zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene clusters for the production of zzso and zzso zzso both are duplicated on a large zzso zzso fragment, accompanied by deletion zzso This indicates that enhanced gene dosage is one of the factors for the overproduction of zzso and demonstrates that large-scale zzso zzso can be a result of classical strain improvement by zzso Only a minority of the putative zzso proteins belong to known protein zzso These include members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso In contrast to earlier proposals on the zzso zzso of the zzso sugar zzso zzso this branch of the zzso zzso actually seems to be based on zzso zzso as zzso
