Two zzso genes zzso as zzso and zzso zzso were cloned by zzso screening of a zzso library constructed with zzso zzso sample of the zzso The sequence analysis of the genes revealed that these zzso genes zzso proteins of zzso and 312 zzso zzso respectively, and showed zzso identities to members of the zzso zzso zzso family retaining a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso sequence and an zzso hole zzso The zzso genes were zzso in zzso coli by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were active in a broad range of temperature from 20 to 40 degrees C with an optimum temperature at 30 degrees zzso The zzso energies of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, indicating that they are zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso could zzso zzso zzso zzso and further zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso excess zzso value of zzso This work represents an example that develops zzso from the Arctic using zzso approach, potentially zzso to zzso resolution of zzso zzso
