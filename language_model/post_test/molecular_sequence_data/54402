zzso zzso is an essential zzso in bacteria, in contrast to animals, which obtain zzso from their zzso zzso the zzso involved in the zzso zzso are potential targets for the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that is involved in the penultimate step of zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso and was zzso in three forms, each with different crystal zzso The crystal structure of zzso in the zzso space group zzso has been determined with 60 zzso per zzso unit, packed as an zzso at zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso zzso which had previously been suggested to disrupt the formation of the zzso zzso In addition, comparison of the structure of zzso with known zzso zzso zzso structures allowed identification of the zzso zzso involved in zzso binding and zzso The zzso structure reported here could serve as a starting point for the development of zzso zzso zzso
