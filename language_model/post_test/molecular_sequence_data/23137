zzso have been implicated in the development of zzso zzso zzso These tumors are derived from zzso surface zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of these hormones on DNA synthesis and spontaneous cell death in primary cultures of zzso and three immortalized zzso zzso zzso cultures of zzso cells were generated from the zzso of women with benign zzso The effects of zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso on DNA synthesis and cell death were determined using zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA synthesis were demonstrated with zzso in zzso zzso primary cultures of zzso and 2/3 zzso cell lines and with zzso in zzso zzso primary cultures of zzso and 2/3 zzso cell zzso A significant protection from cell death was also observed in the presence of zzso in zzso primary cultures of zzso and 1/3 zzso cell lines and in the presence of zzso in 1/4 primary cultures of zzso and 2/3 zzso cell zzso The results indicate that while zzso have the potential to induce cell proliferation and protect from cell death in zzso cells in zzso their effects are variable in zzso cells from different zzso
