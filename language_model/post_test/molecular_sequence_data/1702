zzso zzso a major zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions such as zzso storage, signaling and zzso activity within the zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the biological role of zzso in rice, 21 partial zzso zzso proteins that zzso with rice zzso in a zzso zzso zzso system, were characterized and the zzso sequences were found to be identical to each zzso A full-length zzso of zzso zzso obtained from rice zzso sequence data and zzso zzso codes for a novel protein of zzso zzso acid zzso and was designated as zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso showed no sequence zzso with the known functional zzso however, a potential zzso domain at the zzso together with a putative zzso zzso a nuclear zzso signal and several sites for zzso zzso were zzso Cellular zzso of zzso demonstrated its role in directing green fluorescent protein to the nucleus in onion zzso zzso Northern and zzso analysis showed increased expression of zzso and zzso in response to cold zzso zzso using zzso zzso confirmed the existence of the zzso complex in zzso in the stressed leaf zzso suggesting their potential role in regulating stress zzso
