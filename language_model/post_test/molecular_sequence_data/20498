An in-depth analysis was carried out with expressed sequence tags zzso for genes in and near the zzso zzso zzso for using zzso are discussed, including the occurrence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Complete gene sequences demonstrated the feasibility of constructing accurate full-length coding regions from zzso zzso and found, or supported, errors in several previously reported zzso gene zzso New complete zzso gene sequences are reported for the zzso Chinese Spring and zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is considered zzso in cultivated zzso was shown to transcribe in at least two zzso zzso support the conclusion that of the five known genes within this zzso region, the two zzso genes and the zzso gene are highly zzso The other two zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a protein zzso have one and no identifiable wheat zzso respectively, although zzso are found for the zzso genes in zzso The zzso of all five genes within the zzso region are either definitely associated with the zzso or possibly originate from zzso seed, suggesting the four distinct gene classes in this region are part of a seed or zzso zzso zzso zzso resources were also used to determine relative abundance of zzso for all classes of wheat zzso and indicated differential levels of expression both among zzso and among the three zzso of zzso zzso
