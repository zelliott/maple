zzso zzso a small basic zzso isolated from the zzso of prairie zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso The attachment of zzso a to zzso is believed to cause zzso of the calcium zzso In order to further zzso which portion of zzso a is important for the zzso action, five peptides were zzso and two zzso fragments were obtained by chemical zzso These peptides zzso to discrete portions of the primary sequence of zzso zzso The peptides are equivalent to the primary sequence of zzso a from 1 to 16 zzso 7 to 22 zzso 13 to 28 zzso 19 to 34 zzso and 25 to 42 zzso zzso produced fragments are equivalent to 1 to 28 zzso and 29 to 42 zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the sequences zzso and zzso of zzso a inhibited zzso zzso into isolated zzso and bound to zzso The same peptides caused weak skeletal muscle zzso similar to that caused by native zzso a and increased serum zzso zzso zzso The active peptides zzso to the zzso and zzso portions of zzso zzso The inactive or less active peptides have sequences which zzso to the middle sequence of zzso zzso From this study, both the zzso and the zzso regions of primary sequence of zzso a are required to express zzso zzso biological zzso
