We analyzed the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso using in zzso zzso and zzso analysis with zzso zzso Three and five zzso sites were identified at zzso acids near the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso lacking all zzso sites on zzso have normal zzso whereas similar sites on zzso are zzso A viable zzso with three zzso sites in zzso showed reduced zzso zzso slow growth and zzso and defects in zzso zzso in which all five zzso sites on zzso were zzso were viable if they were zzso with an zzso gene whose zzso zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso In this double zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso was zzso compared with zzso in zzso zzso Thus, the essential function of zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso can be transferred to zzso indicating it is the total amount of zzso on both zzso and zzso that is essential for zzso
