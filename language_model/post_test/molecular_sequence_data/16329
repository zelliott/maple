The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso element of zzso zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso insect cells using plasmids which carry the strong zzso promoter of the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso zzso zzso with the zzso integrated and under the control of the viral zzso promoter have been isolated and their zzso have been partly characterized as to the location of the foreign DNA zzso Upon infection of zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso element specific zzso zzso as well as a newly zzso zzso with an apparent molecular weight of about 116 zzso have been detected in extracts of zzso infected zzso This zzso is absent from extracts of zzso infected cells expressing the zzso zzso which can be recognized by the presence of nuclear inclusion zzso zzso infected cells lack this zzso The zzso specific zzso is detected by zzso which have been raised against fusion proteins containing zzso sequences zzso in zzso coli, both in zzso and in Western zzso zzso The zzso specific protein is a nuclear zzso and represents about zzso of the newly zzso zzso
