zzso of cellular zzso signaling molecules appears to be a fundamental step in the progression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso causes severe zzso marked by left zzso zzso dysfunction, zzso and increased mortality rate, but CAN zzso drugs primarily reduce zzso without improving zzso function or risk of zzso 

We found that activity and expression of a second zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso II zzso were increased in hearts from CAN transgenic mice and that zzso drugs improved zzso function and suppressed zzso We devised a genetic approach to zzso zzso activity in CAN mice to control levels by zzso CAN transgenic mice with mice expressing a specific zzso inhibitor in zzso We developed transgenic control mice by zzso CAN transgenic mice with mice expressing an inactive version of the zzso zzso CAN mice with zzso zzso had reduced risk of death and increased zzso and zzso zzso function and were less susceptible to zzso zzso zzso did not reduce transgenic zzso of CAN or expression of zzso zzso protein or significantly reduce most measures of cardiac zzso 

zzso is a downstream signal in CAN zzso and increased zzso activity contributes to cardiac dysfunction, zzso zzso and longevity during CAN zzso
