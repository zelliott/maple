Two zzso but apparently complete zzso were identified in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent distinct lineages of zzso zzso zzso unrelated at the DNA sequence zzso The deduced structural proteins from zzso demonstrated zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso shared sequence links with zzso zzso zzso zzso With the exception of zzso zzso inserted between DNA replication and DNA packaging zzso the zzso of the zzso was restricted to the zzso segments near both attachment zzso zzso genes unrelated to zzso functions were inserted between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso one group of genes shared sequence zzso with a mobile DNA element in zzso zzso A short, but highly transcribed region was located between the zzso zzso and right attachment zzso it lacked a zzso function in one zzso
