The protein zzso is an important zzso of the zzso zzso apparatus, since it provides a bridge of sorts between zzso zzso other zzso of the zzso apparatus, and the zzso zzso In this study, a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The gene for this protein resides on zzso V and encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso indicate that the zzso 137 zzso acids of the zzso zzso protein interact with zzso zzso zzso This domain also stimulates the activity of the zzso Interestingly, this part of the zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The interactions with zzso zzso and zzso are reminiscent in various respects of similar interactions seen in zzso and zzso although the part of the zzso zzso protein that zzso in these interactions has no apparent counterpart in other zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso have not been reported in other zzso this may represent zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso protein were found to contain an zzso zzso this domain correlated with an intact zzso region and had a marked preference for zzso among the four zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso like its human counterpart, is an zzso zzso Moreover, they provide conceptual links between zzso and several other zzso zzso factor zzso zzso
