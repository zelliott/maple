Bid, a zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso exposing the zzso domain, which then zzso zzso by interacting with zzso zzso family proteins zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso The arrangement of zzso within Bid suggested that Bid function might be regulated in part by alternative zzso We have determined the gene structure of human Bid and identified a number of novel zzso We have also demonstrated zzso zzso and protein expression for three novel zzso of Bid, generated using these zzso zzso contains the zzso regulatory zzso of Bid without the zzso zzso zzso zzso to full-length Bid with additional zzso zzso and zzso contains only the Bid sequence downstream of the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso is regulated during zzso zzso In functional studies zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso abrogates the zzso effects of truncated Bid and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but is also able to partially inhibit the zzso effects of truncated zzso These three novel zzso expressed zzso of Bid are distinct in their zzso their cellular zzso and their effects upon cellular zzso zzso expression of these novel Bid zzso may regulate the function of Bid following zzso and thus influence the fate of cells exposed to a range of zzso zzso
