A full-length zzso clone for a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library of immature corn kernels by screening with a mixture of zzso zzso for zzso I and zzso The zzso clone spans 960 base pairs, zzso a zzso protein containing a signal zzso zzso The zzso named corn zzso I, is considered to be a member of the zzso zzso since it contains the commonly zzso zzso region that exists in most known zzso as a probable binding site and is significantly similar to other zzso in its overall zzso acid zzso Corn zzso I expressed in zzso coli showed a strong zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the amount of zzso for corn zzso I reaches a maximum 2 weeks after flowering and then decreases zzso
