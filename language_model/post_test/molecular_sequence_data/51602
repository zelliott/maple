This study characterizes the zzso and spatial expression during early zzso development of zzso a member of the zzso gene zzso The zzso protein contains all of the sequence motifs that are hallmarks of the zzso gene family and is zzso identical to the mouse zzso zzso The highest level of zzso expression occurs during the early zzso stage of development although its expression persists throughout zzso and can be found in the adult zzso brain and zzso zzso with its zzso to head and zzso regions of zzso zzso the expression of zzso is enhanced in zzso zzso resulting from treatment with zzso and the expression of zzso is suppressed in zzso zzso that lack anterior neural zzso These results suggested that expression of zzso is dependent on the induction of neural zzso This idea was tested using induction experiments with zzso or zzso zzso from a stage 10 zzso zzso with zzso marginal zone zzso from the same zzso zzso tissue and zzso alone were cultured until stage 14, when zzso expression was zzso using Northern zzso In the zzso zzso zzso expression does not occur in the zzso zzso but is expressed in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in neural zzso was confirmed in isolated, induced neural zzso dissected away from the zzso zzso in a stage zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso confirmed the dissection studies and demonstrated that zzso transcripts are expressed in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the floor plate of the neural zzso zzso the data indicate that zzso is a unique member of the zzso family whose expression is dependent on neural zzso The specific pattern of expression following neural induction suggests that zzso plays a role in the early patterning events responsible in the formation of the nervous system in zzso
