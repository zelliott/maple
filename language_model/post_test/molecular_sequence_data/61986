An important role for zzso and zzso has recently been discovered in the zzso effect of bone zzso protein 2 zzso on zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which zzso activates zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso was blocked by the protein zzso zzso zzso D zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the related compound, zzso a selective inhibitor of conventional zzso Associated with this zzso effect of zzso zzso induced a selective and a zzso zzso zzso of zzso which was also blocked by zzso In contrast to the recently described zzso molecular mechanism involved in zzso of zzso by G zzso zzso zzso zzso did not induce a zzso of zzso on zzso To further document an implication of zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso we constructed zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso clones having low zzso levels, zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso but not of zzso was markedly impaired compared with empty zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso cell differentiation in zzso compared with zzso cells showed that zzso and protein expressions of alkaline zzso and zzso induced by zzso were markedly reduced in zzso In conclusion, results presented in this study indicate that zzso can induce zzso of zzso in zzso cells by a zzso mechanism and that this zzso is involved in zzso of zzso and zzso induced by zzso Thus, this pathway, in addition to zzso appears to be essential for the effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso
