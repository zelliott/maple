We have characterized the zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso a coronavirus closely related to mouse zzso virus zzso Analysis of the cloned gene revealed approximately zzso sequence identity to HE proteins of zzso and approximately zzso identity to the corresponding zzso of bovine zzso The HE protein exhibited zzso activity with synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to other viral zzso no activity was zzso with natural zzso containing zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was unable to remove influenza C virus receptors from human zzso indicating a zzso specificity different from zzso of influenza C virus and bovine zzso zzso binding zzso revealed that zzso zzso was unable to bind to zzso zzso zzso like bovine zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso or bovine brain zzso Because of the close relationship to zzso possible implications on the zzso specificity of zzso zzso are zzso
