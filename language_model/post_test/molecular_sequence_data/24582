Two full-length zzso zzso and zzso were cloned and zzso Their open reading frames respectively zzso 96 zzso acids which are most closely zzso to zzso one member of an ancient zzso light chain protein family, zzso in zzso fruit fly, mouse and zzso The zzso was expressed in 12 of 16 human zzso zzso with especially strong expression in heart, liver and brain, whereas there was weak expression in zzso zzso zzso small zzso and zzso The expression of zzso was generally high compared with that of zzso except in zzso Northern zzso and/or zzso zzso analysis examined the expression changes of zzso and zzso in 68 zzso zzso tissue zzso It was revealed that zzso was zzso zzso out of the 68 zzso while zzso was zzso (44 out of 68 zzso compared with their adjacent zzso liver zzso Interestingly, among the total 68 liver cancer samples tested, zzso was zzso while zzso was zzso in 28 zzso zzso was zzso while no obvious change was observed for zzso in 10 zzso no obvious change was observed for zzso while zzso was zzso in 14 zzso Although the underlying mechanism is not clear to date, the apparent zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso suggest that these genes might be involved in tumor zzso On the other hand, the different expression changes of the two zzso genes indicate that zzso zzso are caused by different pathological zzso In addition, zzso was assigned to human zzso zzso near the marker zzso by radiation hybrid zzso
