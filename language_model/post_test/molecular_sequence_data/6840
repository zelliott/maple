zzso anemia zzso is an zzso zzso inherited form of bone zzso zzso zzso cells are characterized by their extreme sensitivity to DNA zzso agents that cause DNA instability and cell zzso Four genetic zzso groups for zzso have been identified and the gene for the zzso C group zzso has been zzso zzso transfer of the zzso gene should provide a growth advantage in zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated efficient zzso gene zzso and correction of zzso cell lines and peripheral zzso zzso zzso from patients carrying zzso zzso zzso In this report we sought to define the optimal conditions for zzso of zzso zzso from mobilized peripheral blood and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso blood zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso followed by zzso Human fetal zzso blood cells were obtained from zzso gestation zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso expression and then incubated with zzso zzso containing a zzso marker gene zzso zzso colony stimulating factors were added to facilitate viral zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and resulting zzso colonies were isolated and analyzed by zzso 

zzso efficiency of peripheral blood zzso (from normal zzso using a zzso zzso the zzso zzso was comparable to that of the zzso producer zzso currently being used in clinical gene therapy marking zzso We extended our standard zzso protocol to analyze zzso and zzso zzso of zzso derived from zzso zzso blood (from normal zzso In addition, we tested whether zzso zzso zzso could be improved by zzso infection supported by zzso zzso For zzso zzso cell infection, zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso human zzso zzso and zzso was found to be superior to zzso supported by zzso zzso patient zzso 

We documented efficient zzso zzso of zzso zzso blood and peripheral blood enriched for zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the feasibility of a clinical gene therapy protocol utilizing zzso cells from both peripheral blood and zzso zzso zzso
