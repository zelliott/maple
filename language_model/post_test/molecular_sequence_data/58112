zzso of susceptible zzso mice with zzso major leads to progressive infection with the failure to expand and activate zzso zzso T cells that elaborate zzso a critically implicated zzso for control of zzso We used the recently described capacity to express foreign genes in zzso to introduce into zzso the zzso zzso gene on a zzso zzso under the zzso control of zzso zzso zzso Several clones of zzso major were established and demonstrated to contain zzso DNA and zzso zzso that was appropriately zzso with the zzso leader zzso and to zzso zzso into the zzso The zzso zzso was biologically active as assessed by zzso of class II zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso oxide zzso activity in a zzso cell zzso zzso of nude mice with zzso organisms resulted in significantly slower progression of disease as compared to infection with organisms containing the empty zzso suggesting that biologically important zzso of infected zzso might be occurring in zzso zzso of genetically susceptible zzso mice, however, did not impede the expansion of zzso cells and the zzso progression of zzso Despite the demonstration of increased levels of zzso zzso in zzso induction of zzso oxide zzso in zzso and expression of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso could not be zzso In all cases, organisms recovered from tissue zzso contained the zzso zzso and zzso active zzso The data confirm earlier studies that zzso alone is not sufficient to impede zzso and maturation of zzso cells in susceptible mice, even when targeted directly to the infected zzso
