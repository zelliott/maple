zzso of zzso with zzso cells stimulates zzso tube formation thus promoting zzso This interaction occurs via zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso beta chain zzso regions zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To clarify the mechanism of this interaction, we expressed in zzso coli a number of zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso region or the zzso and zzso fragments encompassing two and four zzso zzso zzso of zzso respectively, and tested interaction between them by surface zzso resonance and zzso Neither the zzso zzso or zzso fragments, nor zzso or zzso prepared from the latter fragments by zzso treatment to remove zzso B, bound the zzso zzso zzso At the same time, a zzso zzso zzso zzso fragment, which had been zzso via zzso to mimic the zzso arrangement of the beta chains in zzso bound zzso well, but not zzso no binding was observed with the zzso zzso zzso We next zzso several zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and tested the interaction of the zzso zzso with zzso by zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso No binding was observed with the zzso and zzso single zzso and the zzso zzso double zzso while the zzso and zzso single zzso bound zzso with the same affinity as the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso binding site in zzso includes zzso regions of both zzso zzso that zzso and zzso are critical for the zzso and that the third and/or fourth zzso zzso of zzso are required for the binding to zzso
