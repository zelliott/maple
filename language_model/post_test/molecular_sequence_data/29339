The zzso gene in the zzso from zzso has zzso activity in plant cells, inducing tumor formation, the zzso division of cells, and zzso in leaf zzso The product of the zzso gene appears to promote some aspects of the proliferation of plant cells, but the molecular mechanism of its action remains zzso We report here that the zzso protein associates with a nuclear protein in tobacco that we have designated zzso (for zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso appears to be a zzso factor because its predicted zzso acid sequence includes two regions that resemble a nuclear zzso signal and a putative DNA binding zzso which is similar in terms of zzso acid sequence to the triple zzso motif of rice zzso factor zzso zzso in tobacco cells of a fusion protein composed of the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso protein and the zzso protein activated the zzso of a reporter gene that was under the control of a zzso promoter that included the zzso upstream zzso sequence and the zzso minimal promoter of zzso mosaic zzso Furthermore, nuclear zzso of green fluorescent zzso zzso protein was enhanced by zzso A cluster of zzso zzso in the zzso protein appeared to be essential for nuclear zzso and for zzso as well as for the zzso growth of tobacco zzso Thus, it seems possible that the zzso protein might function in the proliferation of plant cells, at least in part, through an association with zzso
