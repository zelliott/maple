zzso interacts with numerous plant species overtly as symptomatic pathogens and zzso as zzso zzso It is not known whether these contrasting ecological modes are optional strategies expressed by individual zzso species or whether a zzso ecology is explicitly zzso or zzso We explored this question by zzso relationships among 77 zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso leaves and from zzso zzso on leaves and fruits of zzso cacao zzso and other plants from zzso ITS and zzso were used to assess diversity and to delineate operational zzso units for zzso zzso zzso The ITS and zzso screens zzso resolved four strongly supported zzso zzso zzso zzso A includes the ex type of zzso zzso zzso B includes the ex type ITS sequence of zzso zzso and zzso C and D are zzso The ITS yielded limited resolution and support within all zzso in particular the zzso zzso zzso zzso the focal lineage dealt with in this zzso In contrast the zzso screen differentiated nine distinctive zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso that were zzso with zzso terminals resolved in a zzso nuclear zzso Among these were two zzso species associated with symptomatic infections specific to either cacao or mango and five zzso species isolated principally as zzso infections from cacao and other plant zzso We formally describe two new species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are frequent zzso associates of cacao and other zzso plant species, and zzso zzso zzso which is associated with zzso and fruit zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from cacao plants grown in China included six distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso only one of which is known to occur in the zzso
