Adult T cell zzso zzso is a mature T cell zzso especially derived from the zzso positive T zzso To characterize the T cell, we examined the representation of T cell zzso zzso variable region, using the zzso zzso zzso V 5 zzso beta V 5 zzso beta V 6 zzso beta V 8 zzso beta V 12 zzso alpha V 2 zzso zzso V zzso zzso we classified the zzso zzso of patients with zzso into three states zzso human T cell leukemia virus type I zzso associated zzso zzso state; zzso zzso zzso early or zzso state; and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of all three states were composed of zzso zzso positive T zzso Most of the zzso zzso with zzso consistently presented alpha V 2 zzso but no zzso In zzso associated zzso only a few cells reacted for alpha V 2, as in zzso zzso without zzso zzso One of three cases with zzso zzso presented alpha V zzso The selected expression of T cell zzso zzso V region might be associated with the presence of zzso zzso zzso similar to human zzso virus zzso
