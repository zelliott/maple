zzso analysis of the zzso identified from various zzso zzso indicates that over zzso zzso zzso exhibit a 1-3 zzso zzso only at their ends, suggesting that this sequence zzso is not a random event, but might mainly derive from divergence of zzso With advantages of zzso technology in determining precise sequences of potential zzso from zzso zzso the precise sequences of zzso predicted zzso can be verified with zzso in a different zzso zzso This presents itself as a new approach for large scale discovery of precise zzso in different zzso zzso 

Among 88 unique sequences of zzso from zzso zzso 83 zzso were successfully validated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso All the validated sequences were identical to their corresponding ones obtained from deep sequencing of the small zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the expressions levels of 10 zzso gene pairs in zzso zzso showed some negative correlation zzso Finally, comparison of zzso sequences with their zzso in zzso and study on the influence of divergent bases of the zzso zzso on their targeting patterns in zzso were also zzso 

The validation of precise sequences of potential zzso from zzso prediction in a different zzso zzso can be a new way to identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from different zzso zzso normally does not change their target zzso However, sequence variations of some zzso zzso in zzso and zzso can change their targeting zzso These precise zzso sequences validated in our study could benefit some further study on zzso functional zzso
