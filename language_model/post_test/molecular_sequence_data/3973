We analyzed the role of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso that are central components of zzso protein import zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso were present in most zzso in zzso suggesting that these factors play a role in the main protein import pathways for plant zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso with zzso but not with zzso In addition, zzso was bound to zzso indicating that the zzso zzso depends on the zzso zzso in zzso Further analysis showed that the nine zzso repeats in the zzso acids zzso and zzso of zzso are bound to two zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso Since the binding zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso do not zzso zzso zzso and zzso might form their complex and function zzso in zzso protein zzso
