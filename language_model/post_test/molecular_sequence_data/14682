A new method to improve the efficiency of zzso sequence identification by zzso walking was developed based on an expanded, sequential list of criteria for selecting candidate zzso plus several other zzso zzso These criteria include: step zzso initially choosing the most appropriate restriction zzso according to the average zzso size produced by each zzso determined using in zzso zzso of zzso DNA, step zzso evaluating the in zzso frequency of zzso size distribution between individual zzso step zzso selecting those zzso that generate fragments with the majority between 100 zzso and 3,000 zzso step zzso weighing the advantages and disadvantages of zzso sites zzso zzso sites, step zzso elimination of zzso sensitive zzso with zzso zzso and step zzso elimination of zzso with recognition sites within the zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso Step zzso includes the selection of a second restriction zzso with highest number of recognition sites within regions not covered by the first restriction zzso Step zzso considers primer and adapter sequence zzso selecting the best zzso pairs according to their zzso and secondary zzso In step zzso the efficiency of zzso library development was improved by zzso of zzso DNA to remove restriction zzso and zzso zzso and most important, to remove small zzso fragments zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso hence improving the chance of zzso between adapters and fragments zzso a zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso fit these criteria for the zzso zzso zzso Their efficiency was assessed using 54 zzso lines from an zzso SK zzso zzso Over zzso success rate was achieved in amplifying the zzso sequences of these zzso This strategy was also tested with zzso zzso to demonstrate its zzso to other larger zzso
