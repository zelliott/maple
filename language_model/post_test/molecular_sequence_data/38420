The pocket domain of zzso is required for zzso to arrest the cell zzso This domain was originally defined as the region of the protein that is necessary and sufficient for zzso interaction with zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso large T zzso These zzso and other zzso proteins that are zzso by a variety of plant and animal zzso use a zzso zzso motif to interact with zzso Similar sequences have been identified in multiple cellular zzso zzso suggesting that the viruses have evolved to target a highly zzso binding site of zzso that is critical for its zzso Here we have constructed a panel of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso acids that are predicted to make close contacts with an zzso zzso were zzso Despite the conservation of the zzso binding site throughout evolution, zzso zzso that lack this site are able to induce a cell cycle arrest in a zzso tumor cell zzso This zzso arrest is overcome by zzso zzso complexes but is resistant to zzso by zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso binding site were able to induce a zzso arrest in zzso cells despite the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso binding site are defective in binding to zzso zzso and human zzso type 16 zzso protein but exhibit zzso binding to zzso or zzso and they retain the ability to interact with zzso and zzso two zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso with these zzso the zzso zzso are able to actively repress zzso These observations suggest that viral zzso depend on the zzso site of zzso for interaction to a far greater extent than cellular proteins that are critical for cell cycle arrest or zzso zzso zzso of this binding site allows zzso to function as a cell cycle regulator while being resistant to zzso by viral zzso
