The zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to be necessary for normal mouse zzso As a first step in identifying target proteins or proteins involved in the specificity of zzso zzso we have isolated seven zzso zzso proteins that specifically interact with zzso but with none of the other zzso zzso This interaction was observed in zzso as well as in zzso zzso With one exception, all zzso proteins zzso belong to a family of proteins that contain a zzso finger zzso As they are structurally related to zzso finger proteins that have recently been shown to play an essential role in protein zzso and degradation, the possibility is discussed that zzso are involved in the specific recognition of zzso proteins of zzso
