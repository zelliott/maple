zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso is a zzso strain with zzso zzso The zzso zzso was shown by sequencing to comprise a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and two smaller zzso zzso previously have not been characterized in zzso acid bacteria or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence indicated an intermediate level of zzso compared with other zzso zzso No zzso essential genes were located on the zzso However, contingency zzso acid metabolism genes and zzso zzso zzso including two genes for completion of the zzso zzso pathway, were zzso zzso The zzso also zzso genes for the zzso zzso a zzso salt zzso a zzso zzso zzso and other genes potentially relevant for zzso zzso Two subspecies of zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso and we detected zzso in both subspecies by zzso gel zzso of sizes ranging from 100 zzso to 380 zzso The discovery of zzso of widely varying size in zzso zzso suggests a possible mechanism for zzso expansion or contraction to adapt to different zzso
