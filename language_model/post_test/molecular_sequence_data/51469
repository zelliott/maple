zzso The skeletal muscle zzso zzso comprises several zzso whose coordinated expression during zzso is probably controlled by zzso elements in the individual zzso zzso We have previously analyzed promoter regions of the alpha and delta genes zzso et zzso 1988, zzso to gain further insight into zzso regulation, we have now studied the promoter of the chick muscle zzso zzso zzso This analysis was zzso by the close upstream proximity of the coding region of the zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the untranslated zzso connecting the two genes zzso et zzso zzso zzso protection and primer extension analysis revealed that zzso of the zzso gene starts at position 56 upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso deletions of the promoter region were employed to identify functionally important zzso A zzso sequence zzso to zzso was found to activate transcription, in a zzso and zzso manner, during zzso zzso This sequence comprises 5 zzso zzso et zzso zzso similarities and zzso at positions zzso and zzso two zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed by means of gel zzso gel shift competition, and footprint zzso The zzso motifs were found to bind zzso and zzso fusion proteins and to interact with proteins in nuclear extracts from cultured zzso zzso Point zzso in the zzso motifs revealed that these elements are crucial for full promoter activity in zzso and essential in zzso zzso with a zzso expression zzso zzso We conclude that the activity of the zzso gene is determined largely by E boxes, which in zzso are likely to be activated by zzso family zzso in addition, other zzso such as the zzso binding protein presumably play a zzso Both zzso elements and zzso motifs are also present in the zzso and zzso zzso and may therefore account for the coordinate expression of the three zzso during muscle zzso
