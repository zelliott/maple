The zzso of zzso virus zzso consists of two zzso zzso long zzso and an zzso short zzso zzso The S component is bracketed by zzso zzso In some zzso strains of zzso (which have a selective growth advantage in certain cell zzso a sequence normally present at the left end of the L component has been zzso to the right end of the L component next to the zzso zzso zzso these strains have acquired a zzso with an L component that is bracketed by zzso repeats and that also zzso We have determined the restriction maps and have analyzed the zzso sequences of those parts of the zzso of three strains with zzso L components that contain the zzso segment of zzso The results were as zzso The zzso fragments were derived in all cases from the extreme left end of the L component zzso The sizes of the zzso fragments were similar, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The junction between the L and S components in these strains was the same as that in standard viral zzso zzso The zzso of sequences from the left end of the zzso next to the zzso repeats was always accompanied by a deletion of sequences from the right end of the L zzso The sizes of the deleted fragments varied zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the points of zzso zzso at the junction between the right end and the left end of the L zzso existed sometimes but not zzso A model depicting how a virus with a class 2 zzso (such as zzso may acquire a zzso with characteristics of a class 3 zzso (such as zzso zzso zzso is zzso
