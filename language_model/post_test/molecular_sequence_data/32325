We have zzso zzso isolated and characterized a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso and zzso activity and has a high zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso at zzso 495, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Upon reduction zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso wavelength are zzso The crystal structure of zzso reveals a zzso zzso arrangement of six zzso Each zzso binds a zzso accessible zzso group, which is stabilized by the interaction of three neighboring zzso The pocket around the zzso zzso side is positively charged due to three zzso zzso zzso in direct zzso The zzso iron is zzso with a zzso zzso as zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso interacts with the zzso group of a nearby zzso zzso an arrangement closely resembling the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and coral zzso oxide zzso which are zzso zzso with zzso coordination trans to an empty coordination zzso Despite the similarity in zzso coordination zzso is functionally and structurally unrelated to zzso and other zzso zzso Its zzso arrangement, zzso accessible zzso binding pocket and zzso coordination by zzso render zzso a unique protein with unusual zzso A database search against complete and incomplete zzso shows that the 76 zzso acid zzso sequence of zzso is unrelated to characterized zzso but is zzso to zzso found in a zzso diverse set of bacteria with sequence identities of zzso We therefore propose that zzso is the zzso of a new class of zzso zzso
