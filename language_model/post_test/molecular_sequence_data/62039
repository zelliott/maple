zzso of several zzso have been demonstrated to express zzso however, their function is zzso Previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed on zzso sea zzso eggs and zzso removed at zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso is zzso on the egg surface immediately after zzso Using zzso zzso zzso to block translation, we show that without zzso zzso eggs undergo zzso resulting in loosely adherent cells that fail to develop beyond a zzso Without zzso containing zzso the cortical zzso network of the egg does not form, yet zzso rings zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso or chicken zzso zzso but lacking the zzso target zzso zzso the cortical zzso network and normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain fails to zzso These studies demonstrate that the cortical zzso zzso is anchored by zzso zzso and zzso ring zzso is zzso We suggest that one important function of egg zzso is to organize the zzso zzso
