zzso (or zzso is a highly zzso active G zzso zzso zzso by zzso that is regulated both positively and zzso by zzso zzso When expressed in transgenic mice, this zzso zzso zzso an zzso disease closely resembling zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that several lines of mice carrying zzso receptors deficient in either zzso activity or zzso regulation fail to develop zzso zzso In addition, animals expressing a zzso that preserves zzso binding and zzso activity but that does not respond to zzso stimulation have a much lower zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that induction of the zzso disease in transgenic mice by zzso requires not only high zzso signaling activity but also zzso of this activity by zzso zzso
