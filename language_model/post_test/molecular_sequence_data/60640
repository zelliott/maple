A zzso zzso a novel zzso was identified based on zzso analysis of expressed sequence zzso and the zzso clones were isolated from a human melanoma line zzso The new zzso sequence zzso a type II membrane protein with zzso zzso acid sequence and showed 38% zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gene involved in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from L cells zzso with the zzso zzso in an expression zzso and a fusion protein with protein A exhibited marked zzso activity specific for zzso Moreover, zzso with the cloned zzso restored zzso synthesis of zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso product by zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the reaction product was formed via zzso linkage, indicating that the zzso is zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the synthesis of the zzso linkage region of zzso
