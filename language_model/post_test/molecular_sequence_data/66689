zzso of DNA double strand breaks zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso requires at least seven proteins involved in a simplified zzso process: zzso recognition and zzso of the DNA ends dependent on the zzso protein zzso zzso formed by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso zzso dependent on the DNA zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibits zzso and zzso activities that are believed to be involved in the processing of a zzso of zzso Here, we have analyzed the interactions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins both in a context of human nuclear cell extracts and in zzso zzso agents specifically elicit the zzso of zzso to damaged zzso together with zzso and zzso IV zzso zzso is necessary for the loading of zzso on damaged DNA and is the main zzso that zzso zzso in cells damaged with highly efficient zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, both in zzso and in cells, zzso assembly of zzso on DNA ends is responsible for a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity prevents zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Altogether, our data allow us to propose a model in which a zzso zzso is necessary both to activate zzso zzso activity and to maintain its association with the DNA end zzso This tight functional zzso between the zzso of both zzso and zzso may avoid improper processing of zzso
