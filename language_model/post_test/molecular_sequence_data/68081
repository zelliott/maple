Upon incubation of bovine zzso with zzso at high zzso ratio, some fragments with apparent masses between 18 and 31 zzso resisted prolonged zzso Their zzso sequences were zzso All fragments overlapped with some of the zzso repeats that compose a large part of zzso and are predicted to have a rigid zzso Among the zzso that interrupt the zzso repeats, for which several data indicate a location at the surface of zzso the insert of repeat zzso was unique because of its resistance to zzso This zzso although exposed at the surface of the zzso may be hidden in a region of contact between zzso zzso
