The coding information for three putative chicken zzso virus proteins zzso zzso zzso was inserted into a zzso zzso and expressed in insect zzso The zzso properties of the chicken zzso virus zzso proteins produced separately or together in zzso cultures were zzso by zzso them into zzso Only zzso of insect cells which have zzso equivalent amounts of all three zzso zzso proteins or cells which zzso mainly zzso plus zzso induced zzso zzso directed against zzso in zzso zzso zzso of those chickens were protected against clinical disease after zzso zzso zzso of a mixture of zzso of cells that were separately infected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not induce significant levels of zzso zzso directed against zzso and their progeny were not protected against zzso zzso Our results indicate that expression in the same cell of at least two zzso zzso zzso plus zzso is required to obtain sufficient protection in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins produced by zzso zzso can be used as a zzso vaccine against zzso zzso
