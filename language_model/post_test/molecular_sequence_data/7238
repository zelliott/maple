A zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso was used to analyze zzso induced by zzso radiation in the two related mouse zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso These well-studied cell lines differ in sensitivity to zzso radiation, apparently due to differences in DNA repair zzso zzso with these differences, we found that replication of zzso zzso is inhibited to a greater extent in the zzso sensitive zzso cells than in the zzso zzso zzso were induced in the zzso zzso target gene at a higher frequency in the zzso cells than in the zzso cells, but the sequence characteristics of the base substitution zzso were similar in the two cell zzso The pattern of zzso zzso in the zzso target gene of this zzso zzso zzso in the mouse cells, was very similar to the pattern observed in the same target gene in the analogous zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso in monkey and human zzso
