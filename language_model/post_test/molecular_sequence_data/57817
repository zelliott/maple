The partial zzso sequence zzso the rod portion of the entire zzso acid sequence of human smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso which zzso to zzso according to Human Gene zzso zzso has been determined by cloning a complementary DNA zzso and sequencing the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis with the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the smooth muscle zzso of the human zzso artery is expressed in the human zzso artery, zzso esophagus and zzso Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA from zzso or zzso zzso zzso cell hybrids demonstrated that the human smooth muscle zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso Regional mapping of zzso was performed using human cell lines with partial deletion and zzso of zzso zzso As a result, the human smooth muscle zzso gene zzso with zzso In zzso zzso of zzso human smooth muscle zzso probe zzso zzso to normal human zzso zzso independently showed that the human smooth muscle zzso gene zzso is assigned to zzso region zzso Analysis of early zzso zzso showed that zzso signals were in zzso In the human, although zzso zzso smooth muscle, and zzso zzso genes are mapped to zzso 17, 14, 16, and 22, respectively, structural similarities of these zzso genes strongly suggest the common origin of these zzso
