Four zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from zzso samples collected on the Pacific coast of Japan near the cities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that these strains form a distinct lineage within the family zzso The four zzso shared zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with each other and showed zzso % similarity with their zzso in the family zzso The four strains also shared high zzso zzso values of zzso % with each zzso All the strains grew at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C, and zzso zzso starch and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, two common fatty acids of members of the zzso zzso and zzso were absent in these zzso The DNA zzso contents of the four strains were in the range zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso evidence, it was concluded that these strains should be classified as a novel zzso and a novel species in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
