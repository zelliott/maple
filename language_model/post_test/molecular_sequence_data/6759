Recently, point zzso in zzso zzso 1 zzso have been shown to lead to a subset of zzso zzso inherited familial zzso lateral sclerosis zzso These findings have led to the hypothesis that defects in oxygen radical metabolism may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso we decided to analyze other zzso involved in oxygen radical metabolism for possible involvement in other forms of zzso We report here analysis of two genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for involvement in zzso Of particular interest, one gene identified as zzso zzso zzso is shown to map to zzso a region recently shown to contain a gene responsible for a familial form of ALS with zzso zzso inheritance zzso The zzso gene appears to be located within zzso zzso of simple sequence repeat marker zzso which shows no zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso cells of human spinal zzso In addition, we mapped a gene for zzso to zzso a region previously shown to contain a highly zzso but different form of zzso Neither of these zzso genes appears to be highly expressed in human spinal zzso This evidence suggests that zzso may be a candidate gene for zzso
