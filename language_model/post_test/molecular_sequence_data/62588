The zzso zzso sorting motif in the zzso domain of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso is important for zzso from the plasma zzso zzso targeting of viral budding in polarized zzso cells, and polarized budding from a localized region of the zzso plasma zzso To study the role of the zzso sorting motif zzso in zzso the incorporation of zzso into zzso and viral entry, we disrupted the motif with a zzso zzso To investigate the relationship between the zzso sorting motif and the enhancement of zzso by zzso the zzso substitution was made in both zzso and zzso zzso In spreading infections, including those using primary zzso the growth of the zzso zzso was as impaired as zzso virus, and the zzso combination zzso was almost completely zzso In zzso infections using zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso impaired zzso and zzso retained the ability to enhance the zzso in the context of zzso zzso and zzso were required for the optimal zzso of zzso produced from either zzso or zzso cells, but these sequences were required for the optimal incorporation of zzso only when zzso were produced from zzso zzso Despite the zzso levels of zzso in viruses produced from zzso cells, the entry of the zzso and zzso zzso into target cells was zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso sorting motif of zzso zzso is, like zzso important for optimal viral zzso and, in the case of zzso T cells, zzso incorporation of zzso zzso does not require the zzso motif to enhance viral zzso The finding that zzso and zzso each affect the efficiency of viral entry independently of the zzso content of zzso suggests that both viral proteins are involved in trafficking events that influence zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso
