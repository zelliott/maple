A study was made of the interaction between restriction zzso recognizing zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso DNA sequences and a set of synthetic zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso replacing either one of the central zzso or zzso zzso in the recognition zzso The zzso zzso (except for zzso introduced into the recognition site both increase the efficiency of zzso and change its zzso A zzso at the zzso position takes place, in some cases in addition to the correct zzso zzso zzso by zzso occurs at the zzso bond adjacent to the point of modification towards the zzso With the zzso base returned (the zzso with zzso the correct zzso position is zzso zzso specifically zzso all the modified zzso DNA duplexes with zzso zzso (except for the zzso zzso are resistant to zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by the data obtained we discuss the peculiarities of recognition by restriction zzso of zzso DNA sequences which have completely or partially zzso central base zzso It is suggested that zzso forms a complex with DNA in an zzso zzso
