A zzso library was constructed in zzso 19, using zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the site of zzso zzso in zzso The library was screened with an zzso probe derived from a portion of the partially known sequence of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso The clone with the longest zzso zzso zzso and used as a probe for Northern zzso It zzso to a zzso zzso species, which was also visible as a band after zzso zzso zzso The zzso insert zzso 1200 zzso of zzso contained an open reading frame of 1071 zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso In this zzso a region coding for 42 zzso acids from the zzso end of the zzso domain is zzso These were obtained by sequencing a cloned primer extension zzso By comparing our sequence with zzso zzso beta zzso unit D, we found zzso identical and zzso similar zzso One putative copper binding site zzso zzso was identified by zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The location of a second possible site was zzso
