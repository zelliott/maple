The V region genes zzso and zzso used in the immune response of zzso mice to zzso a synthetic zzso zzso were examined by Southern zzso and zzso sequence zzso Fourteen zzso zzso zzso 10 different combinations of six zzso one V zzso eight zzso three zzso one J zzso and three zzso zzso In addition to the zzso association, zzso zzso and zzso variation of assembled genes further contribute to diversity of the zzso zzso Although differing both in length and structure, the five zzso third zzso region analyzed contain several zzso zzso Neither V gene zzso nor zzso third zzso structure can be simply correlated with affinity of the zzso for the zzso The zzso V genes were compared with the corresponding sequences of unrelated zzso zzso zzso shares a zzso gene with zzso random zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso gene with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso use the same zzso zzso and zzso genes as do zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These data demonstrate the genetic diversity of the zzso response to zzso and illustrate the extensive flexibility of the immune zzso
