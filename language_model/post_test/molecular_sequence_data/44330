zzso zzso zzso is an unusual zzso zzso because it varies in its zzso structure between zzso zzso coli zzso is an zzso zzso whereas those of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso sequence is virtually identical in zzso coli and zzso zzso but very different in zzso In this study, we examined the molecular recognition of zzso by three widely zzso zzso using in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso base at position 73, the second zzso C2 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the specific zzso of all three zzso the zzso base differing between zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, we found differences between zzso and two bacteria around the second zzso in the zzso zzso The first zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso whereas the third zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for zzso in zzso These findings indicate that despite such large differences of the two zzso zzso zzso identity has been essentially zzso in zzso and that there are also differences in the zzso stem recognition between zzso and zzso The clear separation between zzso and zzso is retained in the identity element location, whereas the apparent diversity of the two zzso zzso does not reflect on the zzso zzso
