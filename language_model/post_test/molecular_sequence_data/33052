The zzso among human clinical cases, of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso but lacking zzso zzso zzso has increased considerably over the last 10 zzso To probe the evolution and ecology of this emerging zzso we characterized 190 zzso zzso initially classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and obtained from various sources in the United States and zzso These zzso were characterized into six sequence types zzso by zzso sequence typing zzso and 79 zzso gel zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (85 and 84 zzso zzso represented a single zzso zzso zzso zzso information revealed different zzso deletions (which included genes responsible for phase 2 zzso zzso in four Spanish zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso representing different sources and geographical locations as well as different molecular zzso were thus screened for the presence of six genes and one specific region, all of which were previously found to show variable presence among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso lacked the phase 2 zzso genes zzso and zzso which were present in all zzso zzso zzso zzso While all Spanish zzso zzso zzso zzso carried the same deletion surrounding zzso all but two zzso zzso showed a different zzso zzso the two zzso zzso zzso represented the zzso deletion zzso and a unique deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso thus appears to represent at least two common zzso which cannot easily be differentiated with standard diagnostic zzso
