zzso requires the coordination of cell growth, division, and cell zzso Female zzso in flowering plants, where a single zzso spore zzso continuous growth and nuclear division without zzso to form an zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso provides a good system to study the genetic control of such processes in zzso zzso Here, we report the characterization of an zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso slow zzso zzso in which the progression of the zzso cycles and the zzso of female zzso development were impaired, causing an arrest of female zzso at the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Delayed zzso test showed that a portion of the zzso zzso were able to develop into functional zzso zzso and could be zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso OF zzso that, together with zzso is involved in zzso export from the nucleus to the zzso Similarly, zzso can physically interact with a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso throughout the plant, at high levels in actively dividing zzso and zzso zzso we conclude that zzso most likely plays a role in zzso zzso that is essential for the coordinated zzso progression of the female zzso
