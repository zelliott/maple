For the second time this year random zzso sequencing, in combination with data from zzso zzso has made a significant contribution to the analysis of human zzso Two groups have reported zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in both cases the key breakthrough being zzso zzso clones with database matches to zzso zzso This has now been joined by the sequence of a candidate for the human zzso zzso zzso The discovery that its message abundance closely follows zzso activity could make a major impact on the utility of zzso as a diagnostic marker for human zzso In addition, zzso et al zzso report the zzso of a transgenic mouse deleted for the zzso zzso which encodes the essential zzso component of zzso Interestingly zzso formation is unaffected in these mice, strengthening the argument that zzso expression in mouse zzso is an innocent bystander rather than a necessary zzso However, fundamental differences between the zzso zzso of mouse and human zzso mean that the mouse is not a straightforward model to critically test the role of zzso loss and zzso in human zzso
