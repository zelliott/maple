In zzso reproduction is thought to be controlled by a single zzso zzso hormone zzso which regulates the synthesis and zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso However, another form of this zzso zzso of unknown function, also exists in the brain of many zzso species, including zzso it is zzso by a different gene and its zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to that of zzso Here we report the cloning of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and show for the first time by in zzso zzso that zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and discrete zzso of the zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because the regional distribution pattern of cells containing zzso zzso is largely dissimilar to that of cells containing zzso zzso it is likely that these two cell populations receive distinct neuroendocrine zzso and thus regulate zzso synthesis and release zzso
