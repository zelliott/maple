zzso are widespread zzso interaction motifs typified by the zzso repeat zzso in which zzso and zzso positions are zzso zzso Although identification of likely zzso sequences is zzso prediction of strand order remains zzso We present the X-ray crystal structure of a short form zzso zzso zzso of the zzso assembly specificity domain from the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso determined at zzso A zzso zzso lacks one and half zzso present in a previously studied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso as a zzso In solution, zzso zzso more poorly than zzso and depends on an zzso motif common to zzso zzso zzso of native sequences that include zzso and zzso positions zzso to zzso zzso the zzso motif influence and changes assembly state from a zzso associated zzso to a strongly associated zzso These data provide a striking example of a naturally occurring zzso sequence that exhibits zzso folding into different zzso states, a zzso versus a zzso zzso The results emphasize the zzso nature of zzso energy landscapes in which small changes can have drastic effects on zzso Discovery of these properties in an zzso channel assembly domain and prevalence of the zzso motif in zzso assembly zzso of a number of different channels that are thought to function as zzso zzso raises the possibility that such sequence features may be important for zzso the assembly of zzso en route to the final native zzso
