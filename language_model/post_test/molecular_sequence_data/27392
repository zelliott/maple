For three decades the zzso system was thought to be exclusive of plants, until the first zzso representatives were characterized in zzso and in zzso zzso earlier in this zzso 

Here, we describe and characterize four families of zzso elements in a new zzso group, the zzso These zzso zzso zzso like zzso or zzso are active in zzso zzso and zzso distributed among 12 zzso species and zzso Despite their relatively distinctive zzso acid zzso the inclusion of the repeats zzso zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso is justified by zzso structural and zzso zzso In addition, we identified three new zzso sequences in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso While zzso is a member of the zzso zzso predominantly from plants, the other three zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso represent a new and quite distinct zzso zzso which we named zzso The finding of zzso sequence inserted into other putative repeat suggests the occurrence a novel TE family not yet zzso 

These findings expand the zzso distribution and the range of functional motif of zzso among zzso The characterization of the dynamics of zzso and other zzso in this zzso is of particular interest because it is zzso for an asexual species to have such an extreme level of TE zzso this genetic landscape makes an interesting case study for causes and consequences of such zzso Finally, the extreme zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the remarkable degree of sequence identity within its repeat families highlights this species as an ideal system to characterize new zzso zzso
