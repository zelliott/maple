The temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso harbors zzso and zzso zzso genes similar to those of zzso zzso Using extremely pure zzso zzso (the product of the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that this protein possesses a single domain structure, forms zzso in solution at zzso zzso and maintains a largely zzso structure even at 45 degrees zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso at temperatures ranging from zzso degrees C and began to zzso at zzso degrees C, suggesting that the protein is moderately zzso Of the three zzso zzso operators zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso region, zzso zzso only binds efficiently to zzso which is located upstream of the zzso zzso Our comparative analyses indicate that the DNA binding capacity, secondary structure and zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso are distinct from those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the best characterized representatives of the two structurally different zzso zzso
