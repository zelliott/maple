The plasma of the zzso zzso zzso contains a protein which is able to bind to zzso (a soluble zzso and which has been isolated by two independent methods, affinity zzso with a zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding protein was zzso as judged by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso It is a zzso zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 100,000 Da and an zzso point of approximately zzso zzso acid analysis showed a very high similarity with the zzso acid composition of zzso binding proteins recently zzso from two insects, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was determined to be: zzso zzso Using zzso rabbit zzso zzso the presence of this protein has also been shown within the blood zzso The zzso zzso binding protein did not show any zzso or zzso activity but was able to enhance the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso only in the presence of the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso or cellulose zzso incubated with the zzso binding protein had no effect on these zzso zzso The zzso binding protein could only be zzso from zzso plasma by the zzso zzso or zzso (an zzso zzso while zzso or zzso did not bind to the zzso binding zzso No zzso activity of the zzso zzso binding protein could be zzso
