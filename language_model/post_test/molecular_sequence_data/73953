zzso zzso zzso normally express zzso D1 and zzso but not zzso When zzso D1 expression was extinguished in these cells by gene zzso specific zzso in their ability to transit the cell cycle were zzso These changes are exemplified by a delay of approximately 2 h in their progression through a normal zzso cell zzso This delay results in an increase in the number of cells in the zzso phase population, most likely due to triggering of checkpoints in zzso inability to enter zzso zzso and/or zzso of crucial zzso in early zzso The zzso in the cell cycle of these D1 zzso cells can be rescued by zzso of any normal mouse zzso zzso but not by a zzso mouse zzso D1 protein that lacks the zzso motif at its zzso zzso These data suggest that the cell cycle zzso observed in the zzso cells are a direct effect of the absence of the zzso D1 protein and support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso have separate, but zzso zzso zzso of zzso D1 also resulted in enhanced sensitivity to radiation, resulting in a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso of any normal zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells reversed this zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso D1 in the D1 zzso cells partially restored resistance to zzso zzso Thus, there may be distinct differences in zzso D1 complexes and/or its zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
