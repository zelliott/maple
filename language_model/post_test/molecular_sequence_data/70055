We report on the molecular characterization of the zzso zzso heavy chain zzso beta gene and the isolation of its zzso end zzso In zzso expression study, by in zzso zzso and zzso revealed a highly regular zzso pattern of fiber arrangement, with a slow fiber occupying the central core, in all the skeletal muscles zzso This feature can be advantageous in the distinction of primary and secondary fibers in zzso lineage zzso In the zzso heart, beta zzso expression is zzso with higher expression occurring in the zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso promoter functions in a zzso and differentiation zzso zzso In the zzso regulatory region are several putative positive and negative regulatory zzso including a positive and a negative element in close proximity to each other in zzso zzso
