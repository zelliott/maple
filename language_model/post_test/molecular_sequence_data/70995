The zzso zzso from zzso an analogue of the zzso for activated protein zzso C zzso zzso high levels of protection against zzso infection in the zzso mouse zzso This protection is more than twice as high as that zzso by major zzso zzso such as soluble zzso zzso or the main surface zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso zzso from zzso zzso the zzso agent of visceral zzso in zzso This protein belongs to the large family of zzso 40 repeat proteins confined to zzso and involved in numerous regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicate that zzso is present close to the zzso disc in the cell zzso probably bound to zzso complexes but not to membrane zzso These complexes probably also include zzso zzso zzso The use of a zzso zzso library indicates that zzso binds sequences present in several proteins involved in DNA replication and zzso zzso The recognition and binding sequences present in zzso proteins and at the zzso of major zzso complex zzso class II suggest the involvement of this regulatory protein in the early mechanisms triggering the protective immune response of the host against the zzso zzso
