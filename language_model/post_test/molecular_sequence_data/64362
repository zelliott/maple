The zzso elements necessary for the activity of DNA replication origins in zzso cells are still poorly zzso Here we report a thorough characterization of the DNA sequence requirements of the origin associated with the human zzso B2 zzso A zzso DNA segment, zzso the start site of DNA replication and located within a large zzso region, as well as a zzso island, displays origin activity when moved to different zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of both the zzso and the zzso origins indicates that the large protein complex is assembled in both cases around the replication start zzso Replacement of this zzso region with an unrelated zzso maintaining the zzso island intact, zzso origin activity and the interaction with zzso a zzso of the origin recognition zzso zzso the replacement of 17 zzso within the protected region reduces the extension of the protection without affecting the interaction with zzso This substitution does not abolish the origin activity but makes it more sensitive to the integration zzso Finally, the nearby zzso island positively affects the efficiency of zzso This analysis reveals the modular structure of the zzso B2 origin and supports the idea that sequence elements close to the replication start site play an important role in origin zzso
