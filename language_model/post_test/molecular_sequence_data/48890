zzso quality control and zzso zzso are integral to maintaining cardiac function during zzso however, little is known about if or how these systems zzso Here we demonstrate that C zzso of zzso protein zzso a regulator of protein quality control, influences the zzso response to pressure overload by direct regulation of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of cardiac pressure overload in zzso mice resulted in robust zzso and decreased cardiac function and energy generation stemming from a failure to activate zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso of zzso increased the specific activity of zzso and was necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso zzso effects on zzso activity were accompanied by zzso changes specific to the zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso identifying zzso as the first zzso zzso for zzso zzso activity and establishing a link between cardiac zzso and zzso zzso
