zzso zzso T zzso genes zzso proteins that function as the mobile floral zzso zzso In this study, we characterized five zzso genes from the model zzso zzso zzso zzso The different zzso genes showed distinct patterns of expression and responses to environmental zzso Three of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were able to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they are capable of functioning as zzso zzso is the only one of the zzso genes that is zzso by both long days zzso and zzso conditions that promote zzso zzso and transgenic zzso plants zzso the zzso gene zzso very zzso The key role zzso plays in regulating flowering was demonstrated by the identification of zzso zzso that zzso significantly later in all conditions zzso zzso zzso do not respond to zzso but are still responsive to zzso indicating that the induction of flowering by prolonged cold acts solely through zzso whereas zzso induction of flowering involves other zzso possibly zzso which is only expressed in leaves under zzso conditions and therefore might contribute to the zzso regulation of zzso The role of the zzso gene is zzso as the zzso zzso did not have any obvious zzso or other zzso Overall, this work reveals the diversity of the regulation and function of the zzso zzso zzso
