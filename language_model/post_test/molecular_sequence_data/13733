In the air zzso allergic inflammation model in rats, when the infiltrated zzso in the zzso fluid collected 4 h after zzso challenge were zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso medium increased zzso They produced zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a major zzso and zzso a minor zzso When the infiltrated zzso were incubated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso medium decreased in a zzso manner, and production of zzso and zzso was zzso Because zzso zzso had been found to be identical with rat zzso inflammatory protein 2 zzso effects of zzso on the level of zzso zzso in the zzso were zzso Using the reverse zzso chain reaction technique, it was demonstrated that zzso suppressed the level of zzso zzso in the zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso production at the zzso zzso
