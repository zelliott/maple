zzso in the zzso crooked neck zzso gene show an embryonic lethal zzso with severe zzso zzso The unusual zzso protein consists of zzso tandem repeats of the 34 zzso acid zzso zzso protein recognition zzso zzso zzso elements are found in several zzso processing zzso although it is unknown how the zzso repeats or the zzso protein contribute to zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a crooked zzso zzso zzso is an essential gene but the lethal zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso can be rescued by zzso expression of zzso or the zzso zzso open reading zzso zzso is required in zzso and in zzso for zzso zzso zzso site zzso zzso depleted of zzso arrest zzso assembly after U2 zzso addition but prior to productive zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses and in zzso binding studies show that zzso interacts specifically and zzso with the zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also bind the zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso Our results indicate that zzso acts as a scaffolding protein in zzso assembly and suggest that zzso may support the zzso bridge during the zzso zzso
