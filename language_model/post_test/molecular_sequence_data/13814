Forward zzso induced by zzso zzso in the zzso gene of zzso coli were recovered from bacteria zzso zzso zzso and deficient zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A zzso dose of 1 zzso was selected for DNA sequence zzso A total of 245 induced zzso were zzso The zzso were almost exclusively zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso arose in bacteria primarily from zzso of zzso in total agreement with results obtained for zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso was significantly altered by the presence of DNA zzso activity zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso spectrum, zzso flanked on both sides by zzso zzso were on average zzso times more likely to mutate than those flanked by zzso zzso on at least one zzso This bias disappeared in the zzso zzso genetic background, thereby providing evidence that zzso zzso adjacent to zzso zzso are better targets for bacterial zzso than those not adjacent to zzso zzso We recently reported a similar bias for zzso zzso strengthening the idea that zzso is acting as a simple zzso zzso In zzso this paper presents for the first time evidence that DNA repair by zzso zzso plays a major role in removing zzso responsible for zzso transitions induced by zzso influencing their ultimate distribution with respect to sequence zzso
