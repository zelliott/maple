In zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammation surrounding zzso eggs is zzso by zzso T helper zzso cells zzso to zzso egg zzso zzso We previously showed that a prominent zzso response of zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso mice was directed against a zzso component of zzso A partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso component was found to be identical with one present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on this zzso a zzso clone containing the entire coding region of zzso was identified, and the full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids was zzso from a zzso expression zzso zzso strongly zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso mice and from infected zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the infected mice, zzso zzso significant gamma zzso production as well as, to a lesser extent, production of zzso and zzso In zzso and zzso mice, the zzso zzso cell response to zzso was greater than that directed against the egg zzso zzso conversely, zzso mice responded better to zzso than to zzso A zzso region zzso 398 to zzso zzso was demonstrated to contain a zzso zzso synthetic peptides containing this zzso significantly zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The identification and characterization of zzso egg components will contribute to the understanding and possible control of zzso zzso zzso
