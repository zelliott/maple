zzso of the zzso zzso one of a family of zzso zzso proteins known to zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso have been identified in patients with a mild zzso type 1 zzso zzso with zzso changes but no zzso zzso zzso ascertain the frequency of zzso zzso as a cause of this zzso and to investigate whether other zzso genes may be zzso a panel of unrelated mild zzso patients were screened for zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso 

85 patients with a mild zzso zzso were screened for zzso zzso 44 patients negative for both zzso and zzso zzso were then screened for zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was applied to zzso the zzso sequences surrounding the identified zzso zzso for the presence of direct and zzso repeats or zzso sequence elements in order to zzso probable zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were identified in 6 zzso 5 were novel and included 3 nonsense zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso Short direct or zzso repeats detected immediately adjacent to some zzso zzso may have led to the formation of the zzso and base pair zzso 

The identification of zzso gene zzso in zzso patients has major implications for zzso zzso zzso
