Avian cells express three heat shock zzso factor zzso genes corresponding to a novel factor, zzso and zzso of mouse and human zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso and cell biological properties of these zzso reveals that zzso has properties in common with both zzso and zzso and yet has features which are distinct from zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso cell line zzso the zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso and yet its zzso activity is induced only upon exposure of zzso cells to heat zzso Acquisition of zzso zzso activity in zzso cells is accompanied by zzso from a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso whereas the effect of heat shock on zzso is zzso of an zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity is delayed compared with that of zzso As occurs for zzso heat shock leads to the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso exhibits the properties of a zzso zzso as judged from the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso measured by using a heat shock zzso reporter construct and as independently zzso by the activity of a zzso zzso protein on a zzso reporter zzso These results reveal that zzso is zzso regulated in avian cells and acquires zzso activity in certain cells upon heat zzso
