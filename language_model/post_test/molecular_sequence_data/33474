The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels has a prominent role in zzso zzso These receptors are zzso each zzso containing ten zzso in the zzso domain and four zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of each zzso lines the intrinsic zzso channel pore and zzso within the zzso domain form zzso binding zzso zzso binding zzso a zzso change that opens the zzso zzso The zzso between zzso binding in the zzso domain and opening of the intrinsic zzso channel pore located in the membrane is not fully zzso Several loop structures, such as loop 2, the zzso the zzso region and the zzso loop have been implicated in zzso zzso The current zzso change zzso hypothesis suggests that binding of a zzso zzso a rotation of the zzso around an axis that passes through the zzso Due to this zzso the zzso and loop 2 are zzso Movement of the zzso loop then twists the zzso domain leading to a separation of the zzso and opening of the zzso The publication of a crystal structure of an zzso binding protein and the refined structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have improved the understanding of the mechanisms and structures involved in zzso zzso binding to channel zzso In this review, the most recent findings on some of these loop structures will be reported and discussed in view of their role in the gating zzso
