Previous studies of zzso zzso have suggested that zzso is an zzso for zzso cells and that zzso is a zzso factor of this zzso The role of zzso in the interactions of zzso zzso with zzso and polarized zzso cells was examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were constructed by in zzso zzso zzso and gene replacement zzso Both classes of zzso were found to adhere to cells of human zzso origin zzso zzso equally well; however, on the basis of the percentage of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased by factors ranging from approximately 30 to 40 compared with the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso 407 cells at levels zzso to zzso higher than the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both classes of zzso unlike the parent, were unable to zzso across polarized zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso are not involved in zzso zzso adherence to zzso cells but that they do play a role in zzso Furthermore, the results suggest that either the zzso of zzso zzso or the product of zzso is essential for the zzso to cross polarized zzso cell zzso
