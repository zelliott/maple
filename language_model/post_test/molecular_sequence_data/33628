The bitter taste perception zzso with the ability or inability to taste zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso Most of the variation in this gene is explained by three common zzso zzso at positions 49 zzso zzso or zzso 262 zzso or zzso and 296 zzso or zzso that determine two common zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso is the major zzso zzso zzso zzso acid 49 has the major effect on the distinction between tasters and zzso of all three zzso The sense of bitter taste protects us from ingesting toxic zzso present in some vegetables, that can affect the zzso when zzso in large zzso Balancing selection has been used to explain the current high zzso frequency, by maintaining divergent zzso zzso in zzso We have amplified and zzso the zzso zzso acid 49 in the virtually zzso zzso sample of El zzso zzso and have determined that it was zzso Thus, this zzso was a zzso individual, although probably slightly less than a zzso zzso This indicates that variation in bitter taste perception zzso the divergence of the lineages leading to zzso and modern zzso
