zzso zzso 2 zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso involved in zzso maturation in the zzso of the regulated zzso zzso zzso It has been suggested that targeting of this zzso to the zzso is dependent on its association with zzso zzso in zzso at the zzso zzso Here, we investigate the orientation of zzso in zzso zzso and the role of the zzso in sorting of the zzso to the zzso zzso modeling and circular zzso showed that this domain of zzso forms an zzso and zzso into artificial zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso of zzso can be zzso at the zzso in intact zzso zzso indicating that it is a zzso zzso To determine if the zzso zzso is necessary for raft association and zzso we zzso a zzso of zzso zzso E without the last 15 zzso and the last 25 zzso of zzso zzso and a truncated zzso zzso with the last 6 zzso deleted zzso into zzso zzso Whereas zzso was not zzso or sorted to the zzso addition of the 25 zzso of zzso zzso to zzso restored raft association and zzso to the zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso of the last 6 zzso of zzso eliminated zzso raft association and sorting of zzso to the zzso These results showed that the zzso zzso zzso raft association and is sufficient and necessary for sorting zzso to the zzso
