The zzso zzso hypothesis proposes that early in the evolution of life, zzso was responsible both for the storage and transfer of genetic information and for the zzso of zzso zzso One of the problems of the hypothesis is that zzso is known to be temperature zzso Nevertheless, different types of sequences with a zzso zzso may zzso In order to test this possibility, we applied an in zzso evolution method zzso to isolate zzso molecules that are resistant at high temperatures zzso degrees C for 65 zzso and high salt zzso (2 M zzso The sequences of the resulting cloned zzso zzso can be grouped in two families (I and zzso possessing very different zzso and chemical zzso and very different secondary zzso The selected zzso molecules illustrate two different possibilities leading to zzso resistance which may be related to primitive zzso We propose that members of family I constitute a good means of storing sequence information while members of family II are less efficient but replicate faster in early steps of the zzso These selected zzso behaviors may be related to primitive conditions and could allow to define limits for survival, and demonstrate that what is at stake for zzso zzso as for living organisms, is survival and zzso
