Acute zzso leukemia blasts express dual affinity zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and the high affinity zzso binding is zzso by excess zzso zzso zzso express a single class of zzso with intermediate affinity that lack zzso zzso Here we demonstrate the differentiation associated changes of zzso binding characteristics in three models representative of different stages of zzso zzso We find that high affinity zzso binding is converted into intermediate affinity zzso which still zzso with zzso beyond the stage of zzso During terminal maturation towards zzso zzso zzso is gradually zzso We sought to determine the mechanism underlying the affinity conversion of the zzso Northern and reverse zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso alpha and zzso c zzso transcripts did not provide indications for the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the formation of the intermediate affinity zzso zzso In zzso zzso with increasing amounts of beta c in the presence of a fixed number of zzso alpha zzso the high affinity zzso binding converted into intermediate affinity zzso zzso These results are discussed in view of the concept that increasing expression of beta c zzso may cause alternative zzso of the zzso alpha and zzso c zzso resulting in the formation of intermediate rather than high affinity zzso zzso c zzso
