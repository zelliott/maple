Analysis of a DNA beta satellite associated with a recently identified cotton leaf zzso disease zzso strain indicated it to be zzso with most of the zzso originating from zzso DNA beta but with some sequence from a satellite isolated from zzso Analysis of both archival zzso 2001) and recent cotton samples, shows the zzso satellite is confined to a small area but was not present in cotton prior to zzso This indicates that the zzso DNA beta was recently mobilized into cotton, likely from tomato, and that zzso plays a role in the evolution of these zzso
