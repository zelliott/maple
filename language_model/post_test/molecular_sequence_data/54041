The zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot mate and undergo zzso but shows no zzso in zzso zzso We cloned and characterized the zzso zzso The deduced zzso gene product zzso was a protein of zzso zzso acids with no significant similarity to other zzso zzso of zzso was induced by zzso zzso via the function of the zzso factor zzso zzso of the zzso gene blocked both zzso and zzso showing that zzso plays a positive role in these two zzso probably zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso but inhibited zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso at the zzso temperature when its genetic background was zzso whereas the same zzso initiated zzso zzso when its genetic background was zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso interacts physically with both zzso and zzso which together constitute the major switch to initiate zzso zzso zzso with green fluorescent protein accumulated in zzso cells under zzso zzso until they completed zzso but this protein disappeared when they were to enter zzso These observations suggest that zzso may have a function to suppress the onset of zzso until the zzso process has been duly zzso
