zzso zzso has focused primarily on sequences of the zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso and zzso that enable amplification of these regions from all zzso by zzso are well zzso In this study, zzso based on the zzso gene have been developed into a zzso zzso zzso that results in a sequence of the expected size (about zzso zzso from all 34 zzso zzso including strains representative of 12 zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene sequences showed similar zzso of zzso when compared with clusters resolved by similar sequence analyses of a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso or of the zzso zzso gene zzso The main differences between trees were in the branch zzso which were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene tree when compared with the zzso zzso gene tree and zzso still further in the zzso gene tree, despite this being a shorter zzso The improved resolution in the zzso zzso zzso tree resulted in the zzso group splitting into two distinct zzso while zzso associated with coconut lethal zzso diseases split into three distinct groups, thereby supporting past proposals that they represent different candidate species within zzso zzso The ability to differentiate zzso groups and zzso by virtual zzso analysis of zzso gene sequences suggests that this gene may provide an zzso alternative molecular marker for pathogen identification and diagnosis of zzso zzso
