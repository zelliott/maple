A new zzso strain designated zzso was isolated from the soil of a zzso using a zzso acid zzso zzso The newly isolated strain was able to produce a large amount of zzso zzso even under zzso growing conditions and serves as a promising source of this zzso zzso zzso has higher zzso toward cultured human leukemia zzso cells than does zzso D, and it zzso cell death via zzso A nearly complete zzso zzso DNA zzso sequence from the isolate was determined and found to have high identity zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso The isolate clustered with species belonging to the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso tree and showed zzso overall zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although the growth of the isolate was somewhat different from the three species mentioned, the strain zzso most closely resembles zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso As such, this is the first report of a strain of zzso zzso capable of producing zzso
