The formation of a zzso membrane within specialized areas of the zzso is the first visible step in zzso zzso The zzso viral zzso an essential zzso membrane zzso was predicted to have four centrally located zzso zzso zzso The gene was expressed as a zzso protein in a zzso zzso system containing canine pancreatic zzso The zzso and zzso ends of the zzso protein were susceptible to zzso zzso whereas the central region was zzso consistent with a model in which the first and fourth zzso zzso are membrane zzso This zzso was supported by the sizes of the major zzso zzso products of genes containing one or more deleted zzso zzso and by evidence that the zzso was zzso and zzso on deletion of the second, third, and fourth zzso the third and fourth zzso or just the fourth zzso Moreover, zzso also occurred when an zzso site was introduced into the second zzso domain of the full-length zzso zzso The data indicated a zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso are zzso the first and fourth zzso zzso span the zzso zzso and the second and third zzso zzso are zzso This arrangement has important implications for interactions of the zzso protein with other membrane zzso
