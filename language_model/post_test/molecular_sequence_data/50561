The zzso action of the highly effective synthetic zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was studied in various models of experimental zzso The compound administered to rats and rabbits by zzso zzso injections, continuous zzso zzso zzso and orally, respectively, induced significant decrease in zzso weight zzso in a quantitative zzso zzso model with stasis based on vascular zzso in rats, zzso in an zzso zzso shunt model in zzso and zzso prevented the zzso of the vessel in zzso zzso induced by mechanical damage in zzso By using the zzso shunt model in rabbits the zzso effect on zzso growth could be demonstrated as a function of dose and time in zzso zzso Blood level of the inhibitor determined by a zzso varied between zzso zzso whole blood when doses of 15 and 20 zzso were administered zzso A correlation was found between zzso time, zzso zzso induced by zzso ex zzso and the weight of zzso zzso
