We obtained transgenic zzso plants by using high-velocity zzso to transfer genes into zzso zzso Two zzso genes were used to zzso resistance to either zzso or zzso and genes zzso either zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso were used as markers to provide convenient zzso for zzso When zzso without selection, only two of the eight transformed zzso zzso obtained produced transgenic zzso zzso With selection, transgenic plants were obtained from three of the other eight zzso One of the two initial lines produced 15 fertile transgenic zzso The progeny of these plants contained and expressed the foreign zzso zzso expression could be zzso in the presence of added zzso by zzso leaf sections with color zzso
