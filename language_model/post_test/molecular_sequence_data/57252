The zzso half zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso was isolated by mild zzso zzso of zzso followed by gel zzso and zzso zzso The identity of the zzso was established by determining its zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences and comparing them with the zzso acid sequence of intact zzso The zzso point of the C lobe ranged between pH zzso and zzso as measured by zzso focusing on zzso zzso The circular zzso spectrum in the range of 250 to 350 zzso of the C lobe differed slightly from that of intact zzso The pattern of zzso zzso was similar for both the C lobe and intact zzso The C lobe showed partial zzso identity with intact zzso as demonstrated by the double zzso method, and pH dependence of iron binding of C lobe is the same as that of intact zzso zzso
