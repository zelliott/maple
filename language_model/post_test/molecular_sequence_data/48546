zzso zzso zzso expresses a zzso zzso zzso that protects against host immunity and is zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso 11 has six members zzso to zzso and the zzso structure of all members has been zzso except for zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso differ by one zzso zzso in zzso which zzso encodes a zzso that adds the fourth sugar of the zzso repeating unit zzso Gas zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that zzso and zzso zzso contain identical zzso zzso that contain zzso as the fourth zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso zzso contain instead zzso as the fourth sugar, suggesting that zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso 112 of zzso determines zzso zzso and therefore the fourth sugar in the zzso we generated three zzso zzso strains with zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso has a unique zzso zzso has as much zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and may represent a new zzso These findings demonstrate how zzso alter their zzso structure and their zzso properties with a minimal genetic zzso
