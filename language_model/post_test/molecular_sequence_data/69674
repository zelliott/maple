zzso zzso were isolated from the brain tissue of two individuals who died with familial Alzheimer's disease, one with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso precursor protein zzso and one with the zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso in zzso zzso and zzso by sieve zzso low molecular weight zzso were treated with zzso zzso to generate the zzso zzso starting after the zzso at position zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of all zzso peptides identified the zzso zzso which represents zzso zzso of the zzso zzso No sequence beyond position 42 was zzso These findings show that the zzso acid substitution at position zzso is not incorporated into the zzso deposits and suggests that the zzso may have zzso affects which determine zzso
