The unique ability of the zzso A zzso zzso to zzso in zzso has previously been exploited in studies of the sequence specificity of zzso packing in a zzso zzso Here, we have made different zzso zzso in the critical zzso interface segment, and find that efficient zzso can be zzso by a wider range of sequence motifs than suggested by the earlier zzso We also show that certain zzso that are unable to zzso can nevertheless form relatively high amounts of zzso and that specific zzso can be induced by zzso of the critical interface motif on the zzso side of the zzso zzso
