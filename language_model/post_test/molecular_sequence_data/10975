zzso zzso scanning transmission electron zzso zzso of zzso zzso specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso gave a molecular mass of 400 zzso for the zzso of zzso and of 345 zzso for the zzso of zzso which confirms our published values from zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso we identified, by limited zzso isolation of fragments and zzso sequencing, eight distinct zzso zzso functional zzso zzso zzso through zzso and determined their sequential zzso The zzso zzso differ zzso and zzso from each other and from the previously characterized seven zzso of zzso zzso zzso through zzso Our partial zzso acid sequences suggest that a domain, equivalent to the zzso domain zzso is missing in zzso This zzso is believed to be genuine and not an artifact of the zzso preparation zzso since zzso zzso of the native zzso yielded a mass difference of about 800 zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso with 20 copies of a functional zzso zzso It was also shown that the zzso zzso can be rapidly split zzso into an almost homogeneous population of stable zzso by increasing the pH of the zzso stabilizing buffer zzso pH zzso which contains 5 zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso to pH zzso zzso of the zzso occurred more slowly zzso upon dialysis against the pH zzso stabilizing zzso zzso of 100 zzso calcium and 100 zzso zzso zzso to the pH zzso stabilizing buffer leads to the more rapid zzso formation of zzso together with a significant number of previously zzso zzso zzso which could be structurally distinguished from the established zzso of zzso
