The zzso and zzso zzso contain a number of zzso zzso that are restricted to particular zzso of zzso A one zzso insert in the zzso coli zzso and a zzso insert in the zzso proteins are specific for most zzso zzso Two other zzso in zzso are limited to certain groups of zzso The requirement of these zzso for cellular growth was examined by carrying out zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso or zzso Our results demonstrate that deletion or most changes in these zzso completely abolished the zzso ability of the zzso zzso Studies with zzso and zzso from some other species that either lacked or contained these zzso also indicated that these zzso are essential for growth of zzso zzso The zzso from some bacteria contains a two zzso insert that is not found in zzso zzso Introduction of this insert into the zzso coli zzso also led to its zzso indicating that these zzso are specific for different zzso We zzso that these zzso zzso that are localized in loop regions on protein surfaces, are involved in some ancillary functions that are essential for the groups of bacteria where they are zzso
