The development of genetic competence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a complex zzso zzso Here we describe a new zzso zzso zzso required for competence development, which was identified by the zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso Analysis zzso zzso of either the zzso or zzso genes of this zzso results in the loss of zzso without affecting zzso or the synthesis of zzso the competence zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso known to be involved in zzso zzso bond zzso zzso with this, zzso and zzso are needed for the zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso by zzso zzso Similarly, the amount of the zzso zzso competence protein zzso is severely reduced in zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, the amounts of the competence proteins zzso and zzso remain unaffected by zzso zzso Taken together, these observations imply that in the absence of either zzso or zzso zzso is unstable and that zzso and zzso catalyze the formation of zzso bonds that are essential for the DNA binding and zzso zzso
