The zzso 4 zzso zzso contains many important zzso zzso surface proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and a newly identified zzso zzso gene zzso Relatively little is known, however, about the structure and zzso state of these four zzso zzso The zzso unit membrane zzso believed to play a major role in stabilizing the zzso surface of zzso zzso thus preventing it from zzso during zzso zzso contains two zzso members, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In association with two other zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso form zzso particles that naturally form two-dimensional zzso zzso thus providing unique opportunities for studying membrane structure and zzso To better understand how these proteins interact to form the zzso zzso we analyzed their nearest neighbor relationship by chemical zzso We show here that zzso and zzso which share zzso of their zzso acid zzso are zzso to zzso and zzso zzso We also show that zzso has a propensity to zzso forming complexes that are stable in zzso and that zzso can be readily zzso to form zzso The formation of zzso zzso is sensitive, however, to zzso zzso that can zzso the zzso These data suggest that there exist two types of zzso zzso particles that contain zzso or zzso and support a model in which the zzso and zzso occupy the inner and outer zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso This model can account for the apparent zzso of the zzso as the structurally related zzso and zzso by interacting with different partners, may play different roles in zzso zzso The model also suggests that zzso plaques with different zzso compositions may differ in their zzso and in their abilities to interact with an underlying zzso Our data indicate that two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be present in the same cell, interacting with distinct zzso zzso thus provides an excellent model system for studying the zzso processing, and assembly of zzso zzso
