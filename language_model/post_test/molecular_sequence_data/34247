The tail fiber zzso are the primary zzso of host range in the zzso zzso Among the indispensable zzso zzso the sequences of the long tail fiber genes and their associated zzso are among the most zzso The zzso form of the zzso in the zzso zzso is not even the version of the gene zzso by zzso the archetype of the zzso but rather a small unrelated protein zzso zzso by closely related zzso such as zzso and zzso This zzso zzso has a modular zzso its zzso attachment domain binds at the tip of the tail zzso whereas the zzso specificity domain determines its host zzso zzso This specificity domain has a series of four zzso segments zzso that are separated by a set of highly zzso zzso motifs zzso that apparently form the zzso zzso structural zzso The role of zzso various components was examined by a comparative analysis of a large series of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso with differing host zzso A deletion analysis revealed that the individual zzso and zzso are essential to the zzso zzso function and suggests that these different components all act in zzso to mediate zzso The evolutionary advantages of the modular design of the zzso involving both zzso structural elements and multiple independent and easily zzso specificity zzso are zzso
