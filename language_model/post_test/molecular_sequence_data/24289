The crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 98 (2001) zzso provides a template for analysis of zzso zzso which constitute the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition sites zzso were identified in zzso based on the X-ray structures and have been compared with zzso predicted based on zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso 267 (1992) zzso While zzso zzso 5, and 6 contribute in formation of the putative zzso zzso binding site, zzso and 3 likely do not exist in zzso zzso as part of the open BC loop, in the zzso found in the crystal can provide only limited contacts with the zzso However, its role in zzso binding might dramatically increase if the loop closes in response to zzso zzso Thus, while the notion of zzso has been very useful in leading to our current understanding of zzso structure and function, their identification by sequence alignment between distant zzso families will not necessarily be a good predictor of zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso hotspots in zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso was analyzed with respect to zzso These zzso are found to be outside of the putative zzso interacting sites indicating the preservation of the protein active site under the pressure of zzso zzso Since the zzso residing outside the putative zzso active side can profoundly influence zzso binding within the active site, perhaps they provide insight into the basis of evolutionary changes which have occurred leading to different zzso
