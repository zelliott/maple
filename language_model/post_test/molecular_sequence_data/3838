A new zzso of moderately zzso moderately zzso and moderately zzso zzso with very thin zzso is zzso The four strains included in this zzso were isolated from zzso microbial mats in a man-made zzso zzso zzso were around 1 zzso thick, with small zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were parallel to the cell wall, but zzso and zzso were often zzso arranged within the zzso with respect to the main zzso zzso zzso grew at between zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso between zzso and zzso They showed lower temperature limits around 20 degrees C and upper limits between 45 and 50 degrees C, with zzso between 28 and zzso degrees zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identical among zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequence showed that all strains were closely related zzso or higher zzso and zzso related to other zzso zzso or lower zzso We propose the new zzso and species zzso zzso for these zzso The type strain is zzso
