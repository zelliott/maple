zzso zzso a gastric zzso is believed to be transmitted via the zzso route as well as the zzso zzso Its presence and viability in environmental waters is not well zzso The goals of this study were to test zzso zzso presence via molecular methods in zzso zzso and beach sites in Delaware over both short and long time scales and to establish whether zzso indicator bacteria, including total zzso and zzso zzso species, are zzso of the pathogen in these zzso The presence of zzso zzso was initially tested by zzso with newly designed zzso zzso gene zzso against zzso zzso and confirmed by zzso Two coastal beach sites were repeatedly positive in zzso zzso library analysis indicated the persistence of one operational zzso unit zzso over time at one zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also determined by zzso zzso from DNA and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso as well as DNA for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the samples were positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso of those were also positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that this potential pathogen is not only present in natural waters, but also probably zzso There was no correlation between the occurrence of zzso zzso and zzso indicator bacteria, suggesting that standard water quality tests are ineffective in predicting the presence of this pathogen in natural zzso These results demonstrate the widespread presence of potentially viable zzso zzso in coastal marine and zzso zzso Additionally, the repeatedly positive samples indicate either a continual contamination source or persistence of zzso zzso in marine zzso
