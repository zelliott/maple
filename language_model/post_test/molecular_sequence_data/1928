Changes in gene expression are produced in cells as a consequence of virus zzso In the present work, we used zzso technology to globally examine African zzso fever virus zzso zzso cells searching for zzso proteins in order to determine target proteins for zzso zzso We studied the zzso in cellular protein profile after zzso infection by two-dimensional zzso identifying the modified cellular proteins by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso A total of twelve different zzso cellular proteins were zzso zzso The most significant changes were in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heat shock zzso members of the zzso complex and zzso These cellular protein modifications could represent distinct roles during infection related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso The present study constitutes the first attempt to understand the dynamics of zzso cell interactions by zzso
