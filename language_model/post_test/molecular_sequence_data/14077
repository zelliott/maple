Crow et zzso zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have reported excess sharing of zzso by male sibling pairs with zzso at a zzso repeat marker within the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso at or near this gene may be a risk factor for zzso In this report, we describe a pair of male siblings zzso for both schizophrenia and zzso syndrome, which is caused by a zzso in this zzso This provides support for the hypothesis that the zzso zzso may contribute to liability to develop zzso Because of this, we have examined a collection of 23 zzso multiply affected by schizophrenia for linkage to the zzso zzso We have found no evidence for linkage by both the zzso score and affected zzso methods, under a range of genetic models with a broad and narrow definition of zzso and when families with zzso transmission are zzso However, because of the small number of zzso zzso pairs in our sample, we cannot confirm or zzso the excess zzso sharing for males reported by zzso
