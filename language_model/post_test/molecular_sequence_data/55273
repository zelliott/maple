Cloning and zzso expressing the zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso isolated from feces of zzso crane zzso zzso 

The full-length zzso was cloned based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso by zzso metal zzso affinity zzso and then the zzso zzso were zzso zzso acids sequences of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso and gastrointestinal zzso were aligned and used for constructing a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest identity of zzso with zzso in public databases, and zzso zzso identities with zzso from gastrointestinal zzso zzso was put in a zzso branch sharing the zzso motifs zzso and zzso and close to zzso from soil zzso and far from zzso from gastrointestinal zzso The zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso meal and zzso zzso showed apparent optimal at pH zzso and 45 degrees C, stability and activity zzso zzso at pH zzso and activities of zzso zzso and zzso at 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C, zzso exhibited zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, using zzso as the zzso at 45 degrees C and pH zzso strongly inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso partial inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and little influenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso strain isolated from feces of zzso zzso and the sequence analysis, zzso analysis, zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso from zzso strain were first zzso zzso was a novel zzso
