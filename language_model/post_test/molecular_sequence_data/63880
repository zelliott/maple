By rapidly depleting each of the essential budding zzso proteins of unknown function, we identified a novel factor that we call zzso which associates with the zzso zzso ring at the end of zzso and is needed for zzso We show that zzso has a C2 domain at the zzso zzso of the protein that is required for zzso of the plasma zzso whereas the remainder of the protein recruits zzso to the zzso zzso The lethal effects of deleting the zzso gene can be suppressed by artificial fusion of the C2 domain to other components of the zzso ring, restoring membrane zzso on contraction of the zzso zzso Our data indicate that recruitment of the C2 domain of zzso to the zzso zzso ring is crucial for zzso of the plasma membrane during zzso in budding zzso
