Human zzso B virus zzso zzso containing zzso core internal deletion zzso have been demonstrated to contain all the functional features of defective interfering zzso particles zzso zzso zzso zzso Lin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1998, zzso zzso 72, zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit defective interfering property similar to zzso zzso zzso characterized zzso This result raises the possibility that it may be the deleted zzso zzso product, rather than the deleted core protein product, that is responsible for zzso Furthermore, a zzso deletion elsewhere does not cause interference since zzso deletion zzso exhibit no influence on zzso zzso zzso zzso with the natural occurrence of zzso zzso zzso we recently identified zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso in natural zzso However, unlike zzso zzso zzso functional characterization of zzso zzso zzso using a human zzso cell line has not revealed any interference in tissue zzso In zzso defective interference is a general phenomenon for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
