The human zzso zzso Arrest and DNA zzso 34) is the product of an zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the African zzso fever virus zzso factor zzso Among these viral zzso zzso gamma zzso protein is known to prevent zzso of zzso zzso Because of the difficulty in expressing zzso protein or any of its fragments, including the zzso zzso acids zzso in zzso coli, partially due to zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli, we used a zzso cloning scheme to construct the zzso gene that codes for zzso We derived a novel zzso protocol to assemble 20 zzso into the synthetic zzso zzso The clear advantage of using this protocol is that the assembled gene is without the zzso and deletion that are usually of a major problem in constructing synthetic zzso The synthetic zzso gene was zzso zzso and zzso in large zzso We obtained approximately 50 zzso of zzso protein per liter zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a large-scale production of the zzso of zzso The production and zzso of zzso in large quantity are essential for structure determination as well as for understanding its interactions with other proteins such as zzso zzso using zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
