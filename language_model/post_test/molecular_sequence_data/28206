The zzso class I zzso and zzso genes are silent in zzso zzso zzso cells but are induced upon differentiation of these zzso We have previously shown that zzso sequences located in the promoter of the zzso gene are zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We have previously zzso a 48 zzso protein zzso from a mouse T cell line which binds to a zzso sequence located in this zzso and to a similar sequence in the promoter of the zzso zzso We describe here the zzso of a second protein zzso 58 zzso which also binds to this zzso While both activities are present in differentiated cells, zzso binding activity is absent in zzso zzso cells, where the zzso sequence shows no zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso binding activity is induced and the zzso sequence becomes active as an zzso Thus, the absence of zzso activity in zzso zzso cells is at least in part responsible for the lack of expression of zzso class I and zzso genes in these cells and suggests that zzso activity is regulated during zzso
