The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a conservation concern largely due to zzso zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso the common domestic zzso Because of a recent divergence and entirely overlapping zzso zzso is common and pervasive between these zzso threatening the genetic integrity of remaining zzso zzso zzso pure zzso for inclusion in conservation programs using current zzso zzso is difficult because of gross similarity between them and the zzso critically zzso conservation zzso Here, we present a vetted panel of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for each of the 5 naturally evolved zzso subspecies and the derived domestic zzso We also present reference zzso for each assignment zzso Together, these marker sets and corresponding reference zzso allow for the development of a genetic rational for defining zzso of zzso within a zzso based zzso of the entire zzso zzso species zzso We anticipate this marker panel will allow zzso to assess genetic integrity and zzso zzso in managed zzso populations and to be a starting point for more in-depth analysis of zzso
