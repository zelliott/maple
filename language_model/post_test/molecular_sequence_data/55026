DNA damage detection and repair take place in the context of zzso and zzso proteins play important roles in these zzso zzso modifications of zzso proteins are involved in repair and DNA damage zzso processes in response to zzso zzso In particular, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso plays an important role in the zzso and zzso DNA damage response and survival under zzso zzso However, the role of zzso modifications to zzso during the plant DNA damage response is currently poorly zzso Several different zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides following X-ray treatment were identified using zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealing previously unseen patterns of zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed an increase in the relative abundance of the zzso zzso zzso and a global decrease in zzso of zzso in response to DNA damage induced by zzso zzso zzso in the key DNA damage zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso display increased zzso zzso upon zzso linking the DNA damage response with dynamic changes in zzso modification in zzso
