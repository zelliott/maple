zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso the number reveals the identification zzso has been implicated in many critical zzso such like zzso zzso cell proliferation and regulation of some zzso factor, but the expression profile during mouse zzso development remains zzso zzso during zzso embryonic stage, the expression patterns of zzso were examined using in zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso The signals were significantly intense in central nervous system and skeletal system, weak in zzso heart, zzso liver, and zzso In the central nervous system, zzso was principally expressed in thalamus, external zzso layer of zzso zzso zzso cell layer of zzso bulb, zzso marginal zone and zzso zone of cerebral cortex, and spinal zzso In the skeletal system, zzso was primarily expressed in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis displayed that the expression of zzso was ubiquitous at zzso most prominent in brain, weaker in lung liver and zzso accompanied by the lowest level in tongue and zzso During brain development, the expression level of zzso first ascended and then decreased from zzso to zzso the peak of which sustained starting at zzso until zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso may play potential roles in the development of mouse diverse zzso and zzso particularly in the development of brain and zzso
