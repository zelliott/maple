zzso proteins form a family of sequence specific DNA binding proteins which bind DNA through a 85 zzso zzso domain, the zzso domain, whose sequence is unrelated to any other characterized DNA binding zzso Unlike all other known zzso zzso which bind specific DNA sequences centered over either zzso or zzso core zzso zzso and zzso selectively bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ from other zzso proteins in three zzso located in an otherwise highly zzso region of the zzso domain, referred to as zzso region III zzso We show that a restricted selectivity for zzso zzso sites could be zzso to zzso upon changing a single zzso zzso within zzso to the zzso found in zzso and zzso at this zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso to this protein the ability to bind to zzso core containing zzso This, together with the fact that zzso of two zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso DNA zzso indicates that zzso plays a key role in zzso domain recognition of the zzso core motif and lead us to discuss a model of zzso zzso motif zzso
