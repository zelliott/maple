Combining zzso zzso with analysis of the zzso zzso of bovine cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the roles of zzso zzso 93 and 94 on zzso zzso Four single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one double zzso zzso were zzso The largest increase in zzso was observed for binding of cholesterol and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a smaller increase zzso zzso for binding of zzso zzso of zzso thus appears to influence the interaction with cholesterol, zzso and possibly zzso zzso is not involved in binding of zzso and zzso but may interact with zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso were zzso by reaction with three zzso The zzso IX zzso patterns obtained with zzso and zzso indicate that the active site is primarily open above zzso ring A and suggest that a region some distance above zzso ring D is also zzso The single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not zzso alter the zzso patterns obtained with the zzso and zzso zzso but a small, zzso change is observed with the zzso probe for the zzso double zzso The zzso zzso implied by this change could not be detected by zzso with zzso and zzso but is zzso by zzso with zzso The results indicate that cholesterol binds over zzso ring D of the zzso in bovine zzso strongly suggest that zzso interacts with the side chain of cholesterol, and provide evidence that the side chains of zzso and zzso bind to a different region of the active site than the side chain of zzso
