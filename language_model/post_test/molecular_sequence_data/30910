The zzso active zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and from a strain in which the zzso expressing gene had been cloned were studied by using zzso focusing zzso in immobilized and in conventional pH zzso Even with high protein loads the best resolution was achieved in immobilized pH zzso zzso Native zzso focused on zzso zzso was resolved into more than 6 zzso a major one with zzso zzso and the others between pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso focused on the same zzso gel was resolved into more than 7 zzso over the pH range zzso with one major component of zzso zzso A sensitive zzso for the detection of zzso on zzso gel slices was zzso The different zzso between native and cloned zzso was most probably a consequence of the zzso the zzso four extra zzso acids at the zzso A study of the reaction products by the zzso zzso confirmed that they are zzso zzso hence small differences outside the active site are responsible for the presence zzso of the zzso
