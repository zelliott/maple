It is difficult to obtain large amounts of zzso zzso heat shock proteins zzso zzso which are unique to plants, for zzso and zzso zzso zzso an attempt was made to produce such a zzso by applying zzso DNA zzso We fused the zzso for a rice class I zzso zzso zzso to the gene for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and we obtained large amounts of the fusion protein from transformed zzso coli zzso In addition, we found that the zzso zzso obtained by zzso of the zzso protein could also form a protein complex of approximately 310 zzso under zzso conditions as can the small, native, class I zzso from zzso rice zzso An zzso in zzso to examine the zzso of rice soluble proteins from heat zzso revealed the strong stabilizing effect of the zzso zzso
