The zzso gene is frequently rearranged in mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso tumors of the zzso mouse zzso We have completed the zzso sequence of the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and defined the zzso boundaries of the zzso The open reading frame of zzso zzso should zzso a 200 zzso protein which shares zzso zzso with the mouse zzso of zzso zzso zzso is unique among other members of the zzso family by containing 29 instead of 36 zzso repeats in the zzso domain of the gene zzso Five novel zzso repeats have been created as consequence of apparent small deletions which have occurred within the coding region for the zzso domain during zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso junction fragments from nine independent zzso zzso tumors containing a rearranged zzso gene reveals that all of the integration events occur within a 174 zzso region 3' of the sequences zzso the zzso repeats in the zzso zzso domain and zzso of the sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso the only zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso insertions are those which results in the expression of the zzso zzso This strongly suggests that zzso zzso of zzso is manifest in the absence of the regulatory action of the zzso domain, including the zzso repeat zzso leaving the expressed zzso domain zzso free to function in its role in zzso zzso
