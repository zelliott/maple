We have identified new members zzso of the zzso family of protein zzso in zzso and investigated their role in the process that maintains zzso arrested in the cell zzso zzso of a zzso inactive zzso of zzso with a zzso substitution in the zzso binding site, also deleted of its zzso that contains the zzso zzso responsible for binding of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso greatly zzso zzso release from zzso arrest by zzso and zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso to cell cycle extracts from zzso eggs induced zzso as shown by zzso of zzso and zzso changes in in zzso zzso This was suppressed by adding zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso and rescued by competing the zzso zzso with its zzso active zzso zzso Such results indicate that zzso (or another member of the zzso zzso family of protein zzso is involved in arrest of zzso at zzso and prevention of zzso thus death by zzso and release of healthy zzso from cell cycle arrest may be zzso That cell cycle arrest protects zzso from zzso is consistent with the finding that extracts from zzso zzso zzso are less sensitive to zzso signals than those from activated zzso
