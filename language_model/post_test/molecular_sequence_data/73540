A quick in zzso zzso method for the construction of zzso deletion libraries was zzso Many deletions can be obtained in a single inverse zzso zzso by replacing one of the two zzso with a mixture of zzso zzso Since chemical DNA synthesis proceeds from the zzso the zzso such a mixture of zzso zzso can easily be obtained in a single automated DNA synthesis under reduced zzso zzso This deletion zzso method yields many different deletions in a defined short DNA segment and is, therefore, best suited for a deletion analysis at base pair zzso zzso might include functional analysis of regulatory DNA segments and protein engineering work that requires libraries for the expression of zzso zzso or internal truncated proteins as well as fusion proteins having different zzso zzso
