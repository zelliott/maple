zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and directs zzso of short zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that once newly zzso zzso form a sufficiently stable duplex with zzso zzso a structural zzso is induced in zzso which involves zzso between sequences in the zzso of the central zzso and zzso that become available as a result of zzso zzso The zzso decreases zzso zzso affinity for zzso Among the zzso length zzso zzso by zzso (up to zzso zzso only the longer ones, such as zzso form a duplex with zzso zzso that is sufficiently zzso to induce the zzso Yet, an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce the same zzso due to zzso increased duplex zzso We propose that an interplay of rate zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso hybrid duplex zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso determines whether zzso zzso or rearrange zzso structure to trigger zzso zzso release from zzso A zzso screen suggests that essentially all bacterial zzso zzso have the potential to undergo a zzso structural zzso
