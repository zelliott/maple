zzso is found in the usual zzso form in most zzso but a small zzso has an unusual zzso form, resulting from processing of a zzso zzso precursor zzso Here, the secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso is established by zzso sequence zzso it deviates from most zzso in having an extra zzso zzso and a zzso structure at the end of the tag reading zzso zzso of sequence conservation between the two zzso zzso types suggest particular events in the evolution of the zzso zzso A simple gene zzso model of tandem zzso followed by loss of the zzso segments appears zzso An additional zzso is proposed, in which a structure impaired by deletion was zzso at the expense of a neighboring zzso
