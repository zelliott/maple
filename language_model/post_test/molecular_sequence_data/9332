In this study, 16 human clinical zzso of zzso species previously misidentified as zzso zzso were evaluated using zzso methods, including traditional and commercial zzso zzso zzso tests, zzso zzso testing, and zzso zzso gene and zzso gene zzso Positive results for both the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso reaction allowed for differentiation between the zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso however, traditional and commercial zzso profiles could not be used to reliably identify zzso zzso The analysis of zzso zzso gene and zzso gene sequences could discriminate all zzso strains from the type strain of zzso zzso Most zzso species had distinct zzso zzso gene and zzso gene zzso however, the zzso zzso gene sequences of the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identical to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on comparative sequence analysis, five clinical zzso clustered with zzso zzso zzso and nine with zzso zzso zzso The two remaining zzso were found to be most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Even though molecular analyses were not sufficiently zzso to accurately identify all zzso species, the method was able to reliably identify zzso that were previously misidentified by zzso methods to the zzso zzso
