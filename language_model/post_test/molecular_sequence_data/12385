We attempted to predict through computer modeling the structure of the zzso complex II zzso of zzso zzso before the impending publication of the structure of a zzso protein solved by means of X-ray zzso The protein studied is an integral membrane protein of 16 independent zzso 8 zzso and 8 zzso which zzso and bind to 24 zzso and 12 zzso Available zzso data of a crystal of the zzso which could not be phased due to a lack of heavy metal zzso served to test the predicted structure, guiding the zzso In order to determine the secondary structure, zzso analysis was performed to identify the putative zzso segments and multiple sequence alignment propensity analyses were used to pinpoint the exact sites of the zzso zzso segment and the zzso terminal sequence at both ends, which were independently verified and improved by zzso zzso A consensus assignment for the secondary structure was derived from a combination of all the prediction methods zzso zzso structures for the zzso and the zzso were built by comparative zzso The resulting zzso structures are combined, using zzso into an alpha beta zzso pair with zzso attached under constraints provided by zzso zzso and spectral zzso The alpha beta zzso pairs were then zzso into a zzso structure through further molecular dynamics simulations and energy zzso The structure of zzso so determined is an zzso of alpha beta zzso forming a ring with a diameter of 70 zzso
