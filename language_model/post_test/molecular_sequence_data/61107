zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso We identified a zzso containing an open reading frame of 828 zzso acids that had an zzso zzso with the coding region of the previously characterized mouse zzso zzso and a predicted zzso acid sequence that was zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso was only 159 zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso and had an internal deletion of 167 zzso zzso was expressed in zzso insect cells, and specific zzso strongly suggest that, like the zzso coli zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in rat liver contain critical zzso zzso and zzso zzso
