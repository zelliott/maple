zzso of many components of the zzso zzso in zzso neuroendocrine cells is precisely controlled in response to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was identified as a zzso intermediate zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequence of zzso initially suggested that it might be a novel zzso its widespread expression in zzso zzso and zzso cells and its zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso suggested that it zzso a unique zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso cell line engineered for zzso zzso expression demonstrated a zzso induction of several zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso and in zzso was accompanied by changes in the same zzso Several zzso zzso transcripts zzso by zzso were analyzed by DNA sequencing, searching the zzso databases for zzso zzso and Northern zzso One novel clone showed a tissue distribution nearly identical to that of zzso One clone was identical to rat zzso a protein zzso containing modular zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Another clone was similar to zzso bacterial zzso zzso Like the unfolded protein response, these data demonstrate a novel signaling zzso from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso (an zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing this zzso
