In zzso zzso and zzso functionally cooperate to mediate zzso zzso and the repair of damaged zzso by zzso zzso the zzso counterpart of the bacterial zzso zzso forms filaments on zzso DNA that are capable of pairing the bound DNA with a zzso zzso donor to yield joint zzso zzso enhances the zzso DNA pairing reaction, and this zzso effect involves a physical interaction with zzso zzso the ability of zzso to zzso zzso and introduce zzso tension into zzso closed circular zzso DNA is zzso by zzso By controlled zzso we show that the zzso region of zzso zzso is rather zzso zzso zzso that delete the zzso 113 or 129 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso or zzso physical and functional interactions with zzso under zzso zzso strength, zzso Surprisingly, under less stringent conditions, the zzso zzso protein can interact with zzso in affinity pull-down and functional zzso These results highlight the functional importance of the zzso zzso interaction domain of zzso and reveal that zzso contacts zzso through zzso zzso
