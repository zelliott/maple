Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were collected from a hospital in China and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were genetically unrelated and showed resistance to zzso and reduced zzso to zzso and zzso Analysis of their zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso produced zzso and zzso zzso whilst zzso produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso proteins zzso revealed that both zzso lacked an zzso of approximately 39 zzso zzso whilst zzso had an additional protein with an approximate molecular mass of 26 zzso Analysis of the zzso genes demonstrated that the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained a number of silent zzso In zzso several insertions and deletions of short DNA fragments zzso zzso were detected in both zzso The zzso sequence of the approximately 26 zzso protein band identified in zzso had no similarity to the sequence of zzso Instead, it shared high similarity with hypothetical protein zzso originating from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso production combined with zzso zzso results in zzso resistance, and reduced zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may play an important role in the resistance or reduced zzso to zzso in zzso zzso producing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
