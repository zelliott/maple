The zzso protein zzso is an zzso zzso of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso found in the zzso and exhibits potent zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of this zzso corresponding to zzso contains five zzso bonds and exhibits zzso binding affinity and antagonism equivalent to that of the full-length zzso The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been determined by zzso zzso at 800 zzso The first 34 zzso of zzso are zzso and contain a zzso zzso beta sheet, where the last two strands form a beta zzso The relative spatial positioning of the zzso zzso demonstrates that the ordered region of zzso adopts the inhibitor zzso knot zzso fold previously identified for numerous zzso zzso Interestingly, this may be the first example of a zzso protein assigned to the zzso zzso The zzso turn region presents a zzso of zzso zzso known to be essential for zzso zzso zzso The structure also suggests that zzso possesses an additional zzso contact region within a loop formed by the first 16 zzso of its zzso zzso This specific region shows little sequence zzso to the corresponding region of the zzso zzso which is an zzso zzso involved in zzso Consideration of these sequence differences, along with recent experiments on zzso and zzso zzso zzso allows us to zzso that this loop in the first 16 zzso of its zzso domain zzso zzso distinct selectivity for zzso and zzso
