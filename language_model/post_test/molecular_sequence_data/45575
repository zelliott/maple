Members of the metabolically diverse zzso zzso were isolated from various zzso including pristine and zzso sites around zzso zzso comparison and diversity assessment based on the zzso gene were carried out using a newly developed primer pair for zzso The zzso zzso gene was also zzso for zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso gene of 17 zzso strains including type strains was determined by direct sequencing of zzso amplified zzso A total of 25 strains (8 of which were retrieved from a public zzso of the zzso zzso form a distinct zzso line in the zzso tree and are separated from other closely related species of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso similarity of the zzso sequence from twelve zzso type strains ranged from zzso to zzso corresponding to between zzso and 41 zzso differences, while there was only a zzso difference in zzso zzso gene sequence similarity at the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso sequence deduced from the zzso gene is consistent with that of zzso zzso results and provides a better discrimination within the species of zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso gene analysis will aid in describing novel species belonging to the zzso zzso
