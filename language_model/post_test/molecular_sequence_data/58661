An interference zzso has been devised in zzso zzso to rapidly identify and clone genes involved in zzso zzso Random zzso zzso were zzso from an zzso promoter in a strain carrying an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso derived from four zzso two known zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unknown, named zzso and zzso zzso & lethal when over zzso caused zzso consistent with a failure to segregate zzso Full zzso of all four zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso arrested with condensed zzso zzso and cells zzso zzso displayed an zzso distribution of nuclear zzso zzso levels of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused elevated rates of zzso zzso A third zzso zzso displayed no increase in the frequency of zzso loss at zzso levels of zzso but full zzso caused a complete failure to segregate zzso Our results confirm the assumption that zzso zzso is lethal in zzso zzso zzso in the control of zzso transition in zzso zzso and finally identify two new zzso zzso zzso likely to play an important role for zzso transmission zzso in zzso
