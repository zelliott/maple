zzso zzso is a zzso fungus that causes a human systemic zzso with high zzso in Latin zzso zzso to their participation in the control of pathogen zzso differentiation and zzso it was decided to characterize zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified to be coding for two different proteins with high zzso The zzso zzso pattern was investigated by reverse zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso transition, heat shock at 42 degrees C and after zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso Both genes were zzso inside zzso and zzso at 42 degrees zzso In contrast, zzso genes did not show any zzso variation during the zzso zzso The fact that Ras proteins are attached to the membrane via zzso prompted the use of a zzso inhibitor to investigate the importance of this process for zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso growth of zzso cells and zzso zzso tube production even at 37 degrees zzso During zzso transition, the inhibitor increased zzso in a zzso manner, indicating that impaired zzso zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso genes might have a role in zzso heat shock response and in zzso zzso
