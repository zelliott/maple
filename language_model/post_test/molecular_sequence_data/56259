The distribution of the zzso drug zzso is determined to a significant extent by a zzso pH zzso in zzso zzso A zzso pump similar to the zzso zzso found in many cell types has been suggested to maintain a pH zzso across the zzso of zzso compartments in the zzso In order to understand and define the components involved in the mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized a zzso designated zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso of 611 zzso acids which shows between 56 to zzso zzso acid identity over its entire length with the sequences of zzso zzso A zzso from several zzso The zzso gene exists as a single copy gene on zzso zzso zzso 13 and gives rise to a transcript of zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso gene segment expressed in zzso coli react specifically with a zzso zzso consistent with the size predicted from the sequence and with the size of the corresponding zzso in other zzso The zzso protein is present throughout the asexual zzso cycle and is expressed at similar levels in 5 zzso zzso zzso of differing zzso zzso zzso analysis of the coding region of the zzso gene from 2 zzso and 3 zzso zzso has shown no changes that are linked to zzso zzso zzso a proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not involve zzso in the zzso gene in the zzso we have zzso
