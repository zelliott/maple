Based on early pharmacological work, the zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso is believed to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso The goal of the following study was to characterize the zzso zzso zzso at a molecular level, to determine the zzso in which this zzso is predominantly expressed and to further investigate the pharmacological specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso by examining the effect of zzso a zzso zzso zzso on resting rates of zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid sequence and shares zzso sequence identity to zzso receptors of other organisms, with zzso conservation among important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was highest in the swim zzso and zzso followed by the whole zzso All other zzso tested zzso stomach, anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso heart, muscle and zzso had zzso expression levels that were significantly less than whole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression within the brain was highest in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in the zzso component of spontaneous zzso zzso due to a reduction in zzso pulse size with no significant change in pulse zzso These results lend further support for the zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
