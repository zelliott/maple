zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso accumulate large amounts of an zzso zzso molecular zzso termed zzso a zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso 22, 61, zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso with zzso respectively yielding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and modified zzso were zzso in transformed bacteria and zzso As measured by zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso each substitution reduced zzso activity, with zzso the least zzso zzso modeling indicated that zzso is close to a region of surface zzso also present in zzso suggesting that this site contributes to zzso zzso Only slight differences in zzso molecular mass were apparent between zzso zzso but zzso and zzso displayed significantly reduced zzso perhaps due to the disruption of an zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso reflecting the location of zzso on the zzso surface and that it contributes minimally to zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the initial study of zzso relationships within a zzso zzso of importance in zzso and the first to indicate that a defined region of zzso contributes to zzso and zzso zzso
