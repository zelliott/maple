A symbiotic zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from hay zzso zzso in zzso The new isolate exhibited an zzso zzso interaction with a zzso zzso strain and required crude extracts and/or culture zzso from zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The growth factors from zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso by zzso or zzso treatment, suggesting that they might be zzso The cells of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso rods that were stained zzso The isolate was a zzso zzso Growth was observed between 45 degrees and 70 degrees C zzso 60 degrees zzso zzso doubling zzso and pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was 65 zzso and the major zzso were zzso and zzso A zzso analysis of its zzso zzso sequence indicated that strain zzso is closely related to zzso zzso and so was named zzso zzso on the basis of its zzso and molecular zzso
