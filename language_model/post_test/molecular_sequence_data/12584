An intact zzso domain (the zzso is necessary, but not zzso for the zzso protein zzso to bind to zzso complexes containing zzso and for RB to induce a zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the binding of RB to zzso may, in addition to zzso zzso zzso function, generate a complex capable of functioning as a zzso Here we show that a zzso in which the zzso zzso domain was replaced with the RB pocket could, in a zzso and zzso manner, mimic the ability of RB to repress zzso and induce a cell cycle zzso In contrast, a zzso negative zzso zzso that is capable of blocking zzso zzso did zzso Fusion of the RB pocket to a zzso zzso domain unrelated to zzso likewise generated a zzso protein when scored against a suitable zzso These results suggest that growth suppression by RB is due, at least in part, to zzso zzso by the pocket domain bound to certain promoters via zzso
