zzso zzso is a zzso zzso component of the zzso membrane skeleton that enhances zzso interaction via its internal zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that protein zzso zzso is expressed as multiple alternatively spliced zzso resulting from the inclusion or exclusion of small cassette sequences called zzso By tissue screening for protein zzso zzso we have observed new features of an already complex pattern of alternative zzso within the zzso binding zzso In particular, we found a new zzso zzso that is present almost exclusively in muscle zzso In addition, we have isolated multiple zzso clones spanning over 200 zzso containing the entire zzso and zzso coding sequence of the human zzso The zzso structure has now been zzso with the exception of a zzso zzso all of the alternatively spliced motifs zzso to individual zzso The zzso region zzso has also been completely zzso using various zzso and zzso zzso The 3' zzso over 3 zzso accounts for one-half of the mature zzso
