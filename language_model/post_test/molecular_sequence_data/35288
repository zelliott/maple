zzso is finely regulated at multiple levels and plays crucial roles in development and zzso In the fat body of the zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs and zzso gene expression zzso during the zzso zzso and zzso stages when the steroid hormone zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso into the feeding larvae zzso zzso genes and reduced zzso activity resulting in zzso induction in the fat zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso partner zzso or targeted zzso of a dominant negative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso ) in the zzso fat body reduced zzso and zzso the zzso zzso confirming the importance of zzso of zzso gene expression during zzso Moreover, in zzso treatments of the zzso fat body with zzso zzso the zzso zzso Five zzso genes were potentially zzso zzso and a zzso response element was identified in the zzso zzso of human zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of 4 key genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cascade reduced zzso and zzso zzso genes to different zzso Taken together, we conclude that in addition to blocking zzso activity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes to induce zzso in the zzso fat zzso
