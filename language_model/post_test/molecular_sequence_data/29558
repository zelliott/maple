The presence of a zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso activity in the presence of various zzso of carbon monoxide zzso Since the zzso zzso activity can be inhibited nearly completely by low zzso of zzso it is likely that the zzso is responsible for at least zzso of the hydrogen production in isolated zzso Most zzso this zzso is zzso by the gene zzso that exhibits all the motifs that are characteristic of zzso The open reading frame starts with an zzso extension of 38 zzso acids that has the potential to function as a zzso targeting zzso The downstream sequences zzso an zzso of a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso that perfectly matches the molecular mass of the mature zzso in the zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso clusters together with similar zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso - the only module of zzso that is shared by all types of zzso and zzso proteins - revealed a zzso of all zzso proteins of the zzso zzso Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the various zzso and zzso proteins occurred by a differential loss of zzso clusters in the zzso part of the zzso
