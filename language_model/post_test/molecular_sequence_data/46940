In zzso zzso two zzso factors, zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso promote the induction of gene expression at the zzso transition of the zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso are the DNA binding components of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein is a common zzso of both zzso factors and is presumed to play a regulatory zzso zzso binding to its target zzso the zzso is a highly regulated event and requires the association of zzso with zzso through their zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso is restricted to the late M and zzso zzso when zzso is localized to the zzso We show that in contrast to zzso zzso remains nuclear throughout the cell zzso This finding suggests that the DNA binding domain of zzso is zzso in the full-length protein when not zzso with zzso To explore this hypothesis, we expressed zzso and zzso in insect cells by using the zzso zzso We determined that partially zzso zzso cannot bind zzso in the absence of zzso However, zzso derivatives carrying point zzso or zzso in the extreme C zzso were able to bind DNA or activate zzso in the absence of zzso and the C zzso of zzso inhibited zzso derivatives from binding DNA in zzso zzso zzso was determined to be zzso in solution, suggesting an zzso mechanism for zzso of binding to DNA by zzso We detected a direct in zzso interaction between a zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso 197 zzso acids of zzso which contain the DNA binding zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso interactions involving the zzso region of zzso physically prevent the DNA binding domain from binding zzso The interaction of the zzso region of zzso with zzso zzso this zzso allowing zzso to bind zzso
