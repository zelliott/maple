The zzso sequence of the designated zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been determined, and the zzso zzso acid sequence is zzso The zzso protein has a calculated zzso of zzso and comprises 248 zzso acid zzso The zzso gene is identified as the zzso gene by significant similarity of the zzso protein with the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso there the zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso gene encodes the putative zzso regulator protein zzso It suggests that the zzso gene of zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso The function of the protein zzso by the zzso gene from zzso zzso is not really defined yet, it is likely to be the zzso protein related to the zzso and zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes form the zzso zzso which linked to the zzso zzso but run in the opposite zzso The gene order of the zzso and the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the regulatory region zzso includes two promoter systems, zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
