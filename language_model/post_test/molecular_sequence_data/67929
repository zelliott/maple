After screening a large number of clinical samples of zzso zzso C in India, a subset of viral strains containing sequence insertions upstream of the viral zzso has been zzso The sequence insertions contained binding sites for at least two different zzso factors zzso and zzso importantly, in a mutually exclusive zzso Furthermore, while some of the viral strains contained insertions of zzso sites, a few others contained dual insertions of the zzso and zzso sites together but only one of the two was zzso zzso acquisition appears to be the most common zzso unique for zzso C with nearly half of the zzso strains containing such zzso Given that zzso C already contains three functional zzso sites in the viral zzso acquisition of a fourth zzso motif in some zzso viral strains is zzso Further investigation is warranted to examine the significance of the sequence insertions for the zzso fitness of the zzso viral zzso
