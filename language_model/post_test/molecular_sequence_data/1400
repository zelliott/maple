zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso The latter are weaker zzso of zzso than the former and are also zzso for the transport of zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso apparatus zzso zzso Here we describe the presence of two zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso of zzso zzso one, zzso is a zzso zzso by the gene zzso whereas the other is an zzso zzso by the gene zzso zzso shares significant zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and has a zzso active site in zzso displaying an intermediate density between those of the zzso and zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells appeared to zzso to the zzso The transcript of zzso but not those of two other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was induced up to zzso by high temperature, zzso and zzso The same zzso triggered the unfolded protein response as shown by the induction of expression of green fluorescent protein under the control of the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not occur in zzso zzso demonstrating the role of this zzso stress sensor in this zzso We zzso that zzso of zzso favors zzso of the zzso zzso product zzso to zzso and that the latter product then exits the zzso of the zzso or zzso compartment in a coupled exchange with the entry of zzso thereby further zzso zzso stress by favoring protein zzso
