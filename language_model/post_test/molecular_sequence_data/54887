The fish pathogen zzso zzso zzso factors and regulation mechanism are barely known except the zzso sensing regulated zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso affinity tags zzso were used to analyze the zzso expressed zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso was zzso zzso real-time reverse zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso of pep was zzso by zzso Furthermore, western zzso demonstrated that the expression of zzso was zzso dependent and zzso sensing regulated in zzso zzso The pep zzso zzso abolished the swimming and swarming zzso suggesting that it was involved in zzso regulation in zzso zzso In liquid zzso the polar zzso was observed intact in zzso zzso while the zzso related gene zzso which is a response regulator causing change in direction of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso When zzso zzso was grown on hard zzso plate, the lateral zzso disappeared and the transcriptions of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso was a zzso zzso protein and involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
