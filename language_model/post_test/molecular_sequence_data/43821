zzso zzso zzso the last step zzso of zzso zzso is transcribed from a single zzso The zzso is zzso expressed in all cells, while the zzso is induced during zzso zzso In a transient zzso zzso we identified two zzso elements involved in regulating the human zzso gene in mouse zzso zzso zzso one is the zzso region zzso to zzso for the basic expression in zzso and zzso cells, and the other is the zzso region zzso to zzso corresponding to the induced expression during differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and gel mobility shift analyses revealed the presence of nuclear protein binding to the zzso and the zzso regions, in both induced and zzso zzso zzso These mean that two promoter regions play an important role in regulating the induced expression of zzso
