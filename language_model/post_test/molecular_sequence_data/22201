How do proteins evolve while maintaining their zzso Previous studies find a highly stringent zzso relationship between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso such that small changes in the zzso protein render it unable to generate a zzso zzso This raises the question, how does zzso evolve while maintaining its zzso To address this question we cloned zzso and zzso zzso sequences from 17 species of zzso and zzso flies spanning 60 zzso of zzso Not a single zzso acid difference is coded among zzso maintains its function by not zzso We also performed gene zzso analyses to determine zzso relationships among insect zzso We find that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are likely zzso and surprisingly, despite functioning in the same structure, the zzso zzso are evolving zzso We argue that differences in zzso zzso use in the zzso cause the zzso zzso to be less zzso than the zzso zzso which has facilitated the evolution of a unique zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso that is resistant to change, contributing to its evolutionary zzso
