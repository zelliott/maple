Gene expression profiles of zzso zzso may provide valuable data for biomedical and evolutionary zzso However, due to lack of sequence information of other species, DNA zzso are currently restricted to humans and a few model zzso This limitation may be overcome by using zzso developed for a given species to zzso gene expression in a related one, an approach known as zzso zzso In spite of its potential zzso the accuracy and zzso of the gene expression measures obtained in this way are still open to zzso The present study examines whether or not zzso values from zzso analyses are as zzso as those from zzso analyses when using zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of the probe data obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso samples to zzso human zzso zzso Plus zzso was zzso The results show that zzso zzso affected neither the distribution of the zzso zzso among different categories, nor the zzso values of the individual zzso Our analyses also show that a zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso plus zzso zzso are significantly associated to zzso zzso Such zzso in the text zzso probe zzso do not increase in number in zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrates that zzso analyses do not significantly affect zzso zzso of zzso at least within the range of the zzso species zzso zzso The differences in zzso between zzso and zzso analyses observed in previous studies were probably caused by the zzso methods used to calculate the gene expression zzso Together with previous observations on the accuracy of zzso for zzso analysis, our analyses demonstrate that zzso zzso may provide useful gene expression zzso However, the zzso and accuracy of these measures largely depends on the use of appropriated zzso to derive the gene expression data from the probe zzso Also, the identification of zzso associated to zzso zzso for gene expression zzso in the studied zzso stress the need of a zzso of the zzso zzso
