The red blood cells of the zzso zzso have weak expression of zzso System zzso due to no expression of zzso zzso 

One blood donor reacted as zzso zzso during a screening zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated weak expression of zzso and all other zzso zzso system zzso zzso however, no expression of zzso zzso was zzso 

One apparently healthy blood donor demonstrated low expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and no zzso zzso in his red blood zzso His brother and mother showed the same weak zzso and his father showed normal expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed the mother's status as a zzso carrier zzso zzso determined the presence of zzso and zzso zzso in mother and zzso Southern zzso with an zzso probe showed fragments shorter than predicted for the siblings and the mother, suggesting a zzso zzso chain reaction with zzso spanning zzso 1 and zzso regions displayed a similar zzso zzso acid sequence allowed the precise characterization of a deletion of zzso zzso beginning at the zzso of the coding region up to zzso 201 of zzso 1, which zzso abrogates the production of zzso zzso 

Two brothers with zzso zzso in a Brazilian zzso population were zzso The molecular basis for this zzso is a zzso deletion spanning from zzso of the coding region to zzso 1 of the zzso zzso never described zzso
