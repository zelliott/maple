zzso zzso was used to amplify major cold shock protein zzso gene families from a diverse range of bacteria, including the zzso zzso zzso which was found to have two almost identical zzso coding regions zzso and zzso located approximately 300 zzso zzso This tandem gene zzso was also found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in other zzso Analysis of the zzso regulation of this zzso gene in zzso zzso performed by using both reverse zzso and Northern zzso zzso showed there to be two zzso zzso templates arising from this zzso a zzso template of approximately 450 zzso zzso and a zzso template of approximately 900 zzso zzso The former may be due to a secondary structure between zzso and zzso causing either 3' degradation protection of zzso or, more probably, partial termination after zzso zzso extension experiments identified a putative zzso start site zzso which is flanked by a zzso motif and promoter elements zzso and zzso similar to those found in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso At 30 degrees C, the level of both zzso molecules was zzso however, upon a temperature zzso to 10 degrees C, zzso of the zzso zzso was both substantial zzso zzso and immediate, with zzso of the zzso zzso being approximately zzso less zzso zzso and significantly zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso zzso changed with time after cold shock and was higher when cells were shocked to a lower zzso zzso two-dimensional protein gel zzso showed that synthesis of the corresponding zzso both zzso and zzso was apparent after only 10 zzso of cold shock from 30 degrees C to 10 degrees zzso The data demonstrate an extraordinary capacity of the zzso zzso zzso to produce major cold shock proteins upon cold zzso
