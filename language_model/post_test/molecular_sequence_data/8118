zzso is the fourth member of the zzso gene family to exhibit zzso zzso in human tumor zzso To assess the prevalence of activated zzso zzso in human tumors, we have developed sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso conditions and zzso zzso for the detection of both single base zzso and/or overt zzso in a wide spectrum of human tumor cell lines and surgical zzso In an initial examination of 33 human tumor zzso we observed a novel nine zzso three zzso acids zzso at zzso zzso 24 in one human zzso zzso cell line, zzso This zzso zzso when zzso into zzso cells, displayed high transforming activity comparable to that of the zzso zzso zzso identified by expression zzso cloning from a human zzso zzso cell zzso Comparing the level of zzso by the zzso and normal zzso products revealed that this novel zzso increases the zzso form of the zzso zzso These findings imply that the mechanism by which zzso activate the zzso properties of this zzso zzso is analogous to that of previously known zzso family zzso
