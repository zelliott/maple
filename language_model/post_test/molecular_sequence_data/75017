The base analogue zzso zzso zzso has been introduced at selected positions into synthetic zzso and DNA by the combined use of chemical and zzso zzso zzso substitution for zzso introduces changes in the minor groove of DNA and creates an additional hydrogen bond in the zzso base pair with zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso showed increased selectivity and zzso strength during zzso zzso to zzso or zzso target zzso Properties of the base analogue with respect to DNA zzso zzso were zzso zzso was used to probe minor groove zzso during the treatment of DNA by 12 restriction zzso zzso of zzso was found for several restriction zzso
