The mast cell zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that, upon being zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso mast cell zzso zzso We here report that zzso is zzso by a zzso gene that spans 13 zzso in the rat zzso and is composed of five zzso Three separate zzso zzso the zzso recognition domain of the zzso defining its close zzso to the genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso region of the gene reveals that a cell zzso promoter is located within the first zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The promoter lacks any obvious zzso box and drives gene zzso originating from multiple start zzso zzso for possible zzso of the zzso transcripts revealed two novel zzso generated by alternative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in one of them does not result in a zzso and would, upon translation, give rise to a soluble zzso zzso zzso of two zzso in a second transcript results in a new reading frame zzso a putative protein containing zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene was detected in normal rat zzso where both zzso and soluble zzso appear to be zzso Lung zzso analysis further suggests that zzso expression is restricted to mast zzso
