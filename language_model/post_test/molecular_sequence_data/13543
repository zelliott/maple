The zzso chain reaction zzso technique was applied to meat species identification in marinated and heat-treated or fermented products and to the differentiation of closely related zzso DNA was isolated from meat samples by using a zzso zzso and was subjected to zzso zzso zzso used were complementary to zzso areas of the zzso zzso zzso b zzso gene and yielded a zzso zzso zzso fragment, including a variable 307 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on sequence data of those fragments was used for differentiation among zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso were detected when zzso zzso wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken, and turkey zzso were cut with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of sausages indicates the zzso of this approach to food products containing meat from 3 different zzso The zzso zzso method detected pork in heated meat zzso with beef at levels below zzso and the method was confirmed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso by amplifying fragments of their growth hormone zzso zzso and zzso differences of more than 22 animal species with nearly unknown zzso DNA zzso including zzso zzso zzso and poultry were determined with zzso typing by using 20 different zzso This typing method allowed the discrimination of game zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso in marinated and heat-treated zzso
