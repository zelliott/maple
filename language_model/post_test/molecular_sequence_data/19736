In this study the potential of using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a rational target for vaccine development was zzso zzso zzso with zzso containing the full gene sequence for zzso zzso or zzso alone zzso zzso were challenged with a high dose of zzso zzso zzso to give a stringent test of the ability of the vaccine to protect against zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the production of specific zzso and zzso zzso and resulted in significantly lower liver zzso burdens compared to zzso Protection was also associated with a significant increase in zzso zzso demonstrated as an increase in zzso production by zzso zzso zzso an increase in the percentage of zzso zzso cells, and enhanced zzso zzso compared to control zzso
