zzso are zzso zzso zzso viruses whose zzso serve as zzso A study of the structure and function of these viral zzso has revealed differences among them in events leading to the initiation of protein zzso A large segment of the zzso zzso region, approximately 400 zzso in zzso promotes zzso entry of zzso independent of the zzso zzso end of the zzso This segment, which we have called the internal zzso entry site zzso maps approximately 200 zzso zzso from the zzso end and is highly zzso zzso elements of different zzso although functionally similar in zzso and in zzso are not identical in sequence or zzso However, zzso elements of the zzso zzso and zzso on the one hand, and zzso and zzso on the other hand, reveal similarities corresponding to zzso zzso All zzso elements contain a zzso zzso unit zzso zzso X, zzso which appears essential for zzso zzso The zzso elements of zzso zzso and zzso bind a cellular zzso zzso In the case of zzso the interaction between a specific zzso of the zzso is essential for translation in zzso The zzso elements of zzso and zzso also bind the cellular zzso zzso but the significance of this interaction remains to be zzso The function of zzso or zzso in cellular metabolism is zzso Since zzso zzso elements function in zzso in the absence of any viral gene products, we speculate that zzso elements may also occur in specific cellular zzso releasing them from zzso zzso zzso elements are useful tools in the construction of high yield expression zzso or for tagging cellular genetic zzso
