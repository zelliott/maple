Resistance Gene zzso zzso genes belong to a large, highly duplicated family of zzso binding zzso rich repeat zzso zzso disease resistance genes located at a single locus in lettuce zzso zzso To investigate the genetic events occurring during the evolution of this zzso approximately zzso to zzso 3' fragments of 126 zzso genes from seven zzso were zzso from three species of zzso and 107 additional zzso sequences were obtained from 40 wild zzso of zzso zzso The copy number of zzso genes varied from 12 to 32 per zzso in the seven zzso studied zzso zzso number varied from 40 to zzso most of this variation had resulted from 13 events zzso two to five zzso because of unequal zzso within or between zzso genes at one of two zzso hot zzso Two types of zzso genes zzso I and Type zzso were initially distinguished based on the pattern of sequence identities between their 3' zzso The existence of two types of zzso genes was further supported by zzso similarities, the frequency of sequence exchange, and their prevalence in natural zzso Type I genes are extensive zzso caused by frequent sequence zzso zzso sequence exchanges between Type I genes zzso zzso zzso but not coding zzso and obscured zzso zzso zzso of Type I genes from additional wild zzso confirmed the high frequency of sequence exchange and the presence of numerous zzso zzso genes in zzso Unlike Type I zzso Type II genes exhibited zzso sequence exchange between zzso zzso Type II genes from different zzso within the zzso zzso showed obvious zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed for different groups of zzso suggesting balancing zzso zzso zzso zzso and point zzso events were distributed zzso through the zzso Different evolutionary forces have impacted different parts of the zzso
