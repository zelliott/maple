We have cloned and zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso zzso The region cloned consisted of the zzso alpha promoter, a 65 zzso zzso containing most of the zzso region and 307 zzso of the first zzso A zzso zzso zzso at the zzso end of this sequence was able to drive the expression of a reporter zzso zzso zzso gene in both vascular zzso cells and zzso zzso This promoter region did not contain a consensus zzso box but contained the sequence zzso 25 zzso from the major start site identified by primer zzso zzso analysis showed that a zzso of the promoter from zzso to zzso was more active in both cell types than the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that there are zzso sequences in the region zzso to the core zzso zzso activity was also observed with fragments containing bases zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso zzso In contrast with the zzso cells, no zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso with the smallest two zzso The residual promoter activity in the smallest zzso of the zzso alpha promoter tested suggested that, unlike the zzso zzso promoter, zzso from the zzso alpha promoter can occur in zzso cells in the absence of factors binding to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso
