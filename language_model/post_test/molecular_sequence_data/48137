In previous studies the authors cloned and characterized the DNA sequence of the regions at both ends of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster of zzso coli zzso zzso and identified the zzso genes for zzso and zzso as well as one of the candidate zzso In this work the complete DNA sequence of a zzso zzso intervening region is zzso Seven new zzso were zzso All the functions required for the synthesis and transfer of the zzso zzso were assigned on the basis of zzso experiments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso to proteins involved in zzso synthesis of other zzso Of the seven zzso two zzso membrane proteins that were zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two were involved in the zzso of zzso and the remaining three showed zzso to sugar zzso The O zzso chain length regulator gene zzso was also identified in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso were designed and tested for zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso
