Fetal rat zzso cells zzso at very low density generate discrete zzso some of which are bone colonies zzso from individual zzso that divide and zzso We have analyzed the relationship between cell proliferation and acquisition of zzso differentiation markers in bone colonies followed individually from the original single cell to the fully zzso zzso The size distribution of fully formed zzso is zzso suggesting that the zzso between proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells is governed by a zzso element, but distributed around an zzso corresponding to the peak colony zzso zzso zzso analysis of colony growth showed that zzso undergo zzso population zzso before the appearance of the first zzso differentiated zzso in the developing zzso Double zzso showed that these zzso cells express a zzso of bone zzso from zzso alkaline zzso cells at the periphery of zzso to zzso zzso zzso at the zzso An inverse relationship exists between cell division and expression of zzso the latter being restricted to zzso zzso zzso while the expression of all other markers is acquired before the zzso of zzso but not zzso Bone zzso expression is zzso zzso in some of the early, alkaline zzso cells, and again later in both late zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso heavily zzso zzso zzso for zzso and bone zzso is not zzso in the zzso mature zzso Our observations support the view that the bone zzso zzso structure, originating from a single zzso and finally encompassing zzso zzso production, zzso successive stages of the zzso differentiation pathway, in a zzso zzso zzso the complexity of the zzso zzso that occurs within bone zzso will aid in the qualitative and/or quantitative interpretation of zzso marker expression during zzso zzso
