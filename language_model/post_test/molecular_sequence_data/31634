zzso of the human respiratory zzso virus zzso season at the local level has important implications for appropriate decisions on the time period for administration of specific zzso 

zzso To describe five consecutive epidemic periods of zzso in an equatorial city of Brazil and zzso to show preliminary data on zzso diversity of circulating zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso children attending the emergency room and zzso of a public hospital were collected and screened by indirect zzso for zzso infections during five consecutive years (from January 2004 to December zzso In addition, the genetic and zzso zzso of the zzso strains isolated was evaluated by partial zzso sequencing of the protein G zzso 

zzso was detected in zzso of the analyzed zzso zzso seasons occurred in a restricted period of each zzso The onset of each zzso season was variable zzso to zzso but the end always occurred in zzso From the 456 zzso infections found, 86 cases with zzso were zzso Both zzso zzso (A and zzso zzso during the five epidemic zzso The 58 zzso strains grouped into two zzso zzso and zzso In respect of the zzso zzso the 28 samples grouped into two zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso accounts for a substantial proportion of zzso in the study zzso As in temperate countries, zzso infections in this equatorial area of Brazil also cause seasonal yearly epidemics, and this has implications for prophylaxis zzso The city of zzso follows the same worldwide trend of circulation of zzso of zzso
