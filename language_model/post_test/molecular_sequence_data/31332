zzso zzso acids from 24 zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and oral group were zzso The zzso zzso structure was proved by analysis of zzso and zzso after acid and alkaline zzso Using the zzso ratios of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso after zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso or zzso zzso we show that all zzso acids contain a single zzso zzso chain and that the chain is zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso On some chains minor zzso zzso were detected whose structure remains to be zzso The zzso acids of zzso and zzso strains were separated by zzso interaction zzso into zzso and zzso molecular zzso The zzso zzso were structurally characterized after liberation from zzso acids with moist zzso zzso After zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso released both zzso acid and the zzso zzso This indicates together with the sequence analysis of the released zzso that the zzso zzso is located at zzso of the reducing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso chain at zzso of the zzso zzso Together with earlier observations these results complete the evidence for the structural and possibly zzso relationship between zzso acids and zzso
