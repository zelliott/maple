zzso zzso represents an interesting example of zzso secondary structure zzso In fact, secondary structure predictions indicated that this zzso protein has a surprisingly high zzso zzso which was retained for short zzso Cooperative transitions from the native zzso to zzso structures were additionally induced by organic zzso in particular zzso As a result of this high zzso zzso it has been proposed that non-native zzso zzso could be formed in the unfolding zzso of this zzso In order to provide a better understanding of the processes that zzso zzso plasticity in this zzso CD zzso in the presence of increasing amounts of zzso and in the presence of organic zzso were zzso zzso unfolding studies, performed at pH zzso and 37 degrees C, revealed an apparent two-state transition, and afforded no evidence of non native zzso zzso The protein treated with up to zzso zzso zzso to the native structure, while treatment with higher zzso concentration zzso lead to partial zzso A zzso zzso covering the region of strands a and b of the intact zzso characterized by the presence of zzso zzso repeats, was zzso and studied by CD in the presence of different zzso On the basis of the obtained results, a mechanism was proposed to explain the structural transition from the beta to alpha structure, provoked by organic zzso in the intact zzso
