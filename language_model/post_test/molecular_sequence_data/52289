We report the expression cloning of zzso a zzso that zzso cellular zzso of zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso clone of Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, which were selected for growth in low zzso of zzso when synthesis is blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is predicted to have 12 zzso regions, consistent with a membrane zzso Surprisingly, levels of zzso zzso and protein are similar in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene differs from the zzso gene by a single base change that zzso a zzso for zzso in the 10th zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso for this dominant zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso a marked increase in zzso zzso and incorporation into cellular lipids in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The availability of zzso will facilitate studies of zzso incorporation into trace products, including zzso and other zzso zzso
