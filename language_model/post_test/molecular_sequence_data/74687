zzso stress is known to trigger the loss of zzso algae from a number of symbiotic zzso a phenomenon commonly referred to as zzso zzso and zzso stress have been suggested to play a major role during the process of zzso however the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly zzso In animals, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso defense, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a model for symbiotic zzso results in increased levels of zzso zzso We report the zzso sequence and functional analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso step in zzso zzso In a zzso experiment, both zzso gene expression and total zzso levels increased zzso and zzso respectively, in response to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso stress triggers zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso in zzso as a protective response to zzso zzso Our results show the zzso function of zzso and zzso across animals while placing a new perspective on the role of zzso in zzso signaling during zzso zzso
