zzso coli strains are among the major bacterial causes of zzso zzso At least 5 categories of zzso zzso coli zzso are zzso namely zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso Due to the need for costly and zzso diagnostic procedures, identification of zzso is difficult at standard zzso zzso the epidemiology of zzso infections remains obscure in zzso Recently, zzso chain reaction zzso or dot zzso has been used for genetic detection of zzso In this study, we analyzed 150 zzso coli zzso from zzso stools of children under 5 years zzso The zzso tests detected 5 zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso zzso No zzso was zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis were used to confirm the results of zzso The cellular fatty acid zzso profiles from zzso coli zzso were also zzso zzso of zzso composition revealed minor variation in the percentage of each fatty acid detected among zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but did not provide enough evidence for zzso between categories of zzso by zzso profiles zzso
