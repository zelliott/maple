zzso syndrome zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso represent different zzso of the same zzso To demonstrate a zzso zzso we determined zzso gene zzso in 48 unrelated zzso zzso zzso included zzso (20 zzso and nonsense zzso zzso located mostly in zzso 1 to 4, and zzso zzso zzso and deletions and insertions zzso located zzso in zzso 7 to zzso Both zzso DNA and zzso were zzso and zzso expression was measured in cell zzso using zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cell lines including bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located in zzso 1 to 3 caused mild disease in all but one family and permitted zzso zzso although frequently at decreased zzso zzso zzso affecting zzso 4 were associated with classic zzso and, with one exception, barely zzso zzso zzso zzso caused classic zzso and lack of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in classic zzso and zzso zzso zzso or multiply spliced zzso Using affinity zzso zzso was found to bind to zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso if zzso was able to bind to zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso We conclude that zzso zzso affecting the zzso domain zzso 1 to 3) of zzso inhibit less important functions of the protein and result in a mild zzso and that zzso zzso affecting zzso 4 and complex zzso affecting the 3' portion of zzso interfere with crucial functions of the protein and cause classic zzso
