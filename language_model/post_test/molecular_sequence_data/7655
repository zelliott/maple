We report the zzso cloning and sequence analysis of a novel and (so far) smallest coding zzso of the human zzso zzso coli zzso zzso This additional zzso of 54 zzso in zzso designated zzso zzso zzso is located zzso zzso downstream from zzso zzso It resides on a zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso is alternatively spliced and inserted zzso into mature zzso it gives an zzso protein with an additional 18 zzso zzso This highly zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences are presented so that this novel zzso can be included in future zzso screening zzso
