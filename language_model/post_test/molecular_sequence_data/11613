An important aspect of the regulation of gene expression is the zzso of translation rates in response to growth factors, hormones and zzso Most of this control is at the level of translation zzso Recent studies have implicated the zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of translation by insulin and growth zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of translation initiation zzso protein zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso cap binding protein zzso initiation factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso decreases its affinity for zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a complex with two other zzso zzso and zzso that promote zzso zzso binding to zzso Here, we have studied the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso competes with zzso for binding to zzso zzso of zzso that are deficient in their binding to zzso do not inhibit the interaction between zzso and zzso and do not repress zzso Thus, zzso control by growth factors, insulin and zzso is affected by changes in the relative affinities of zzso and zzso for zzso
