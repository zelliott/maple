A zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso stationary phase culture medium zzso yield zzso and characterized at the zzso zzso The zzso has a native molecular mass of 130 zzso has zzso activity, is stable and active in a broad pH range zzso is rather zzso zzso activity at 60 degrees C in 1-2 M zzso and is dependent on high salt zzso for activity and stability zzso M zzso or zzso zzso zzso were raised against the zzso zzso In Western zzso they presented no zzso with culture medium from other zzso nor with commercial zzso except zzso The zzso acid sequences of three zzso peptides obtained from zzso zzso zzso did not show significant similarity to other known zzso zzso This fact, in addition to its high molecular mass suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a novel zzso
