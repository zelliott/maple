Transfer of passive immunity from the mother to the fetus or newborn involves the transport of zzso across several zzso Depending on the species, zzso is transported zzso across the zzso and zzso zzso or is absorbed from zzso and milk by the small zzso of the zzso zzso In both cases zzso to zzso zzso transport of zzso is thought to be zzso by zzso an zzso zzso zzso with zzso to major zzso class I zzso Here, we analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the rat zzso tail fused to the zzso and zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were delivered in a zzso manner to the zzso and zzso cell surface, from where the zzso were able to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso were differently zzso This zzso zzso of the zzso is similar to that of the native zzso indicating that the zzso tail of the zzso is necessary and sufficient to zzso an unrelated zzso with the zzso transport behavior of zzso Furthermore, the zzso motif in the zzso domain of zzso was required for rapid and efficient zzso but not for zzso sorting of the zzso
