zzso zzso bacteria and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are able to zzso vitamin B6 de zzso whereas zzso depend upon the zzso of this essential zzso from their zzso The active form of vitamin B6 is zzso zzso zzso For its synthesis two zzso zzso and zzso act together, forming a zzso complex consisting of 12 zzso and 12 zzso zzso 

Here we report zzso acid zzso responsible for stabilization of the structural and zzso integrity of the zzso zzso zzso identified by using distinct zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are located at the zzso interface and play an important role in zzso complex zzso zzso of these zzso to zzso zzso both zzso activity and zzso zzso Furthermore, changing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acids from the active site of zzso to zzso zzso not only zzso activity but also formation of the zzso In contrast to the zzso appearance of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso and does not affect zzso binding or its zzso While the zzso position of zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso it affects the assembly of zzso zzso into a functional zzso which is crucial for zzso zzso 

Taken together, our data suggest that the assembly of a functional zzso complex follows a defined zzso and that zzso of this assembly results in an inactive zzso
