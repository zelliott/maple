Little is known about the zzso of zzso zzso which comprise a number of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso library of zzso zzso led to identification of a zzso zzso gene zzso On sequencing upstream of it in the same zzso we found a 2000 zzso long zzso that proved to contain a hypothetical gene with high zzso with zzso zzso carriers from human and bovine heart, and from zzso zzso The sequence contains two putative zzso and its open reading frame encodes for a protein zzso zzso acids zzso A primary sequence analysis revealed 6 zzso segments and a signature pattern, similar to that of other zzso zzso
