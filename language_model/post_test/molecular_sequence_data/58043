zzso zzso containing a central zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso were constructed for use in repair and replication studies by zzso of shorter zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was prepared in zzso yield by 254 zzso zzso of zzso and converted in nearly quantitative yield to the zzso zzso by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso mercury arc zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso or zzso zzso was prepared via automated zzso DNA synthesis utilizing zzso building zzso The zzso zzso were characterized by their zzso to base zzso and a number of zzso routinely used to map the sites of DNA zzso zzso 1 M zzso at 90 degrees C zzso the zzso product faster than the zzso product, but did not cleave the zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity of T4 DNA zzso was completely blocked by all the zzso except the zzso product, which it slowly zzso T4 zzso V did not cleave the zzso or zzso zzso but unexpectedly zzso the zzso zzso at most zzso the rate of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso at a zzso higher rate in double- than in zzso zzso zzso coli zzso was found to be specific for the zzso zzso at low zzso zzso of this work to methodology for mapping and zzso DNA zzso are also zzso
