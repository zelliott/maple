Divergent zzso are often detected in zzso plants despite the existence of zzso zzso in their wild zzso One such example in rice is the occurrence of varying degrees of zzso zzso due to zzso zzso which was previously reported to be caused by a series of zzso at the C zzso The present study zzso on the basis of comparison of its zzso that the C gene appears to be the rice zzso zzso of zzso zzso which belongs to the group of zzso zzso Two different types of deletions causing a zzso were detected in the third zzso and both of the deleted zzso corresponded to the positions of putative zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso types carry zzso zzso with independent zzso In addition, replacement zzso were frequently detected in zzso of strains carrying the previously defined C zzso zzso population analysis revealed that 17 zzso were found in 39 wild and cultivated zzso and the zzso of most cultivated forms could be classified into one of three distinct groups, with few shared zzso among zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene suggests that zzso diversification causing zzso change might have resulted from zzso in the coding region rather than from zzso between zzso zzso The McDonald and zzso test revealed that the changes in zzso acids might be associated with selective forces acting on the lineage of group A whose zzso were carried by most Asian cultivated zzso The results regarding a significant implication for genetic diversity in zzso of rice are also zzso
