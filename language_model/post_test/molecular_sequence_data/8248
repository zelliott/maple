The zzso of the zzso zzso analog zzso zzso was zzso and a series of experiments was initiated to assess the potential of the compound to serve as a zzso for DNA zzso We show here that zzso can be incorporated into DNA by zzso The resulting zzso extension products are resistant to zzso by treatment with either zzso and heat or a number of restriction zzso Further, in the zzso chain reaction, zzso can be zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso Finally, by kinetic analysis, we have found that zzso is a more efficient zzso for zzso zzso than normal zzso Thus, the introduction of a zzso zzso to the zzso position of zzso results in a zzso that is accepted in lieu of normal zzso by a number of DNA zzso
