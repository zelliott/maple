In addition to the viruses belonging to the nine proposed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two new members of this family have recently been zzso Three strains of zzso virus zzso were isolated from bank zzso zzso zzso and zzso plaque virus zzso was isolated from human zzso To study the genetic relationship between these recently discovered viruses and the members of the family zzso an evolutionary analysis has been carried out using the zzso acid sequences of the two zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso analysis using prime members of the nine zzso support the division of zzso into the proposed zzso The study also supports a previous suggestion based on analysis of partial sequences of the structural proteins that zzso is more related to the zzso of zzso than to other zzso but also shows that the three zzso strains used in the comparison constitute a distinct zzso group, clearly separated from the zzso The analyses using the zzso and zzso sequences clearly showed that zzso was related to the zzso of zzso and zzso but it was not possible to group the zzso with high confidence into one of the zzso zzso using the zzso protein sequences of zzso and zzso showed that although the zzso virus is positioned between the two zzso the virus is more related to the zzso of zzso than to zzso Our analysis of the three zzso strains based on the zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso proteins suggests that the strains used in this study constitute a zzso group clearly related to zzso of zzso The zzso position of the zzso virus is presently uncertain but available data indicate that this virus may be classified as a member of the zzso of zzso
