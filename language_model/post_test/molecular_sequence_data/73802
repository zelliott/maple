As a step toward understanding the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined the full length zzso sequence of the mouse zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends, and the organization of the zzso Mouse zzso zzso consists of 374 zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso zzso in the coding zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso being fairly compatible with the zzso adrenal zzso detected by Northern zzso The mouse zzso gene consists of at least four zzso the first three zzso zzso zzso and the fourth zzso encodes part of zzso the entire coding region, and the whole of zzso We also defined two zzso species, one with and one without the zzso zzso 2, produced by alternative zzso
