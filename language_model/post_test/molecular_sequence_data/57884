zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation and zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso promoter contains a zzso consensus recognition sequence for the zzso zzso identical to the specific binding site for zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that this element, which is required for full promoter activity, is bound by in zzso translated zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter as well as a hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter containing multiple copies of a synthetic zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso promoter deleted of the zzso consensus recognition sequence is not zzso by zzso thus suggesting that zzso zzso the zzso promoter through the zzso recognition zzso These findings raise the possibility that the zzso gene may be a potential target for zzso by zzso in zzso
