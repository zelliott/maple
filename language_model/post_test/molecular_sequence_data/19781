In this study, we examine the fate of the nuclear pool of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso in response to variations in copper zzso A nuclear pool of zzso fluorescent protein zzso was generated by expressing a functional zzso zzso in the presence of a copper zzso We then extinguished zzso expression and tracked the changes in the zzso of the nuclear pool of zzso in the presence of low or high copper zzso Treating cells with copper as well as silver zzso resulted in the nuclear export of zzso We identified a zzso nuclear export signal zzso zzso within the zzso region of zzso zzso in this sequence zzso zzso export from the zzso Furthermore, zzso acid zzso that impair zzso zzso function resulted in increased target gene expression and a zzso cellular hypersensitivity to zzso Export of the zzso zzso protein was inhibited by zzso B zzso a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export protein zzso We further show that cells expressing a zzso zzso in zzso exhibit increased nuclear zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is localized in the nucleus in both conditions, we observed that the protein can still be zzso by copper, resulting in the repression of zzso gene expression in the presence of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that nuclear zzso of zzso per zzso is not sufficient to cause the zzso expression of the copper transport genes like zzso In addition to nuclear zzso a functional zzso domain or zzso element in zzso is required to appropriately regulate copper transport gene expression in response to changes in zzso copper zzso
