We have determined the zzso of the zzso high mobility group zzso zzso proteins necessary and sufficient for binding to the narrow minor groove of stretches of zzso zzso Three highly zzso regions within each of the known zzso proteins is closely related to the consensus sequence zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to this consensus zzso zzso zzso sequence specifically binds to zzso DNA in a manner similar to the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso model building and computer simulations employing energy zzso programs to predict structure suggest that the consensus BD zzso has a secondary structure similar to the zzso and zzso drugs zzso and zzso and to the dye zzso zzso In zzso these zzso which also zzso bind to zzso DNA, have been demonstrated to effectively compete with both the BD zzso and the zzso proteins for DNA zzso The BD zzso also contains novel structural features such as a predicted zzso bend or zzso at its zzso end and zzso projecting zzso zzso side chains or zzso which may contribute to the binding properties of the zzso zzso The predicted BD zzso structure, which we refer to as the zzso represents a previously zzso zzso motif capable of binding to the minor groove of stretches of zzso base zzso
