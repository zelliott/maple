zzso zzso zzso is a zzso consisting of repeating zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso units zzso zzso zzso type A zzso contains zzso acid, and zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso at the zzso with zzso at the zzso zzso zzso type C zzso contains zzso acid, and zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso at the zzso with zzso zzso at the zzso These molecules are fragile due to their high degree of zzso and are challenging to analyze as a zzso This work presents the first evidence that tandem mass zzso can be used for the determination of a zzso zzso sequence with respect to the positions of zzso zzso Using this technique, it is possible to analyze individual components from zzso saving much zzso zzso zzso produced from zzso and zzso are used in this work to demonstrate that zzso zzso can be used to distinguish zzso zzso zzso For charge states where charge equals the number of zzso abundant zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The percent total zzso zzso of these zzso indicate the position of zzso
