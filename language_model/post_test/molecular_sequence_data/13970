A zzso detection system was developed for zzso zzso a pathogen of zzso and other related zzso using the zzso sequence of two adjacent zzso genes and the variable length and sequence of the zzso region between zzso An appropriate region was identified as zzso zzso genes with the same zzso from a wide variety of bacteria were aligned and the most frequent base at each position was chosen to derive zzso that would zzso to the gene in either zzso zzso of such zzso were screened against various zzso species and members of related zzso using zzso at low to moderate zzso zzso A subset of these pairs of zzso consensus zzso gave one or more zzso products which generally displayed zzso length zzso The primer pair zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso length zzso between zzso zzso and all other zzso species zzso These zzso products were cloned and zzso from four zzso of zzso zzso and four zzso from different zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso length variation zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were derived from the zzso gene zzso These zzso yielded a zzso product of a characteristic length within most zzso species and zzso zzso When a primer that projected from zzso into the 3' end of the variable zzso zzso was used with a zzso zzso zzso was a very sensitive diagnostic test for zzso zzso zzso and gave no product or only a faint product with other species of zzso The specificity of this zzso detection system was further enhanced by a zzso zzso reaction that took advantage of the fact that the zzso region was found to be embedded in a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso By amplifying the region between the zzso zzso gene and zzso or between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the subsequent zzso zzso product was shown to be zzso zzso
