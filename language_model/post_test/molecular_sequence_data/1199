Muscle differentiation is inhibited by members of the Id family that block the zzso effect of zzso zzso regulators by forming inactive zzso with zzso Also, Id proteins promote cell proliferation by interacting with key regulators of the cell zzso In order to determine the role of zzso genes during fish development and especially in early zzso we examined the expression patterns of zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in developing trout zzso These four Id zzso were found to exhibit discrete expression in the developing nervous system and in the eye zzso During the zzso process, zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in the tail zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso As the zzso matured in a zzso zzso the zzso for zzso transcripts rapidly faded whereas zzso for zzso transcripts was found to persist until at least the completion of zzso By contrast, zzso transcripts were zzso zzso only in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and strongly accumulated in the zzso The preferential zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts within zzso and/or zzso extremes of the developing zzso suggests that these areas, which were the last ones to express zzso zzso contain dividing cells involved in zzso zzso
