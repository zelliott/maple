The interaction of complement with an zzso zzso zzso zzso system as a model for the zzso zzso of the outer membrane of zzso bacteria has been zzso The addition of whole human serum to the zzso solution at the zzso side of the zzso membrane resulted in a rapid increase of the zzso zzso in discrete steps, indicating the formation of zzso zzso which were not observed in the case of pure zzso zzso The zzso of the discrete zzso steps varied over a range of more than one order of zzso The mean single step zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for a zzso containing (in zzso 100 zzso 5 zzso and 5 zzso zzso The steps were grouped into bursts of typically 9 zzso 3 events per burst and the zzso change within one burst was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of serum at the zzso membrane system was independent of the presence of specific zzso against the zzso but was dependent on calcium zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity required complement component zzso A model for the mode of pore formation by complement is zzso The complement pore is generated in discrete steps by zzso of zzso zzso into the membrane and their irreversible zzso to zzso channels with a diameter of approximately 7 zzso assuming a circular zzso
