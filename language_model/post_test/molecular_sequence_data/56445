The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method for analyzing the zzso acid sequences of proteins using the hidden zzso model zzso which is a type of zzso zzso Secondary structures such as zzso sheet and turn are learned by zzso and these zzso are applied to new sequences whose structures are zzso The output probabilities from the zzso are used to predict the secondary structures of the zzso The authors tested this prediction system on approximately 100 sequences from a public database zzso zzso Although the zzso is zzso zzso (no rule for the appearance patterns of secondary zzso the result was zzso
