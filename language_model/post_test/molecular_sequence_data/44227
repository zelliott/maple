The synthesis of protein A in zzso zzso is regulated by global regulatory zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso data indicate that both zzso and zzso suppress protein A zzso like zzso zzso also regulates protein A production at the zzso zzso To determine the genetic requirement of zzso in protein A suppression, we transformed shuttle plasmids containing various zzso fragments into a zzso zzso Our results indicated that the zzso zzso transcript, or, more probably, the zzso protein zzso zzso is sufficient for suppressing protein A gene zzso when introduced on a zzso zzso or as a single copy in the zzso zzso analysis with a chicken zzso A zzso also confirmed the reduction in protein A expression in these zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso of the protein A gene can be suppressed in a zzso zzso background by a zzso containing zzso Surprisingly, in zzso deletion zzso clones and in clones derived from the zzso double zzso protein A gene zzso can also be suppressed by plasmids containing the zzso transcript plus additional upstream sequence but not the zzso transcript zzso These data suggest that the zzso locus can zzso protein A gene zzso via both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the hypothesis of an zzso zzso is an additional genetic requirement for protein A suppression in the zzso deletion zzso zzso as well as the zzso double zzso zzso whereas in the zzso zzso background, the zzso transcript zzso the zzso protein alone is zzso These data suggested that both zzso and zzso are zzso of protein A synthesis in zzso zzso
