Human T zzso virus type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an inflammatory neurological zzso Patients with zzso show high zzso load despite increased zzso zzso zzso It is still unknown whether the zzso efficiently eliminate the virus in zzso and/or whether a naturally occurring zzso virus becomes zzso by escaping from the zzso To address these issues, we zzso a large number of zzso tax genes from zzso zzso patients and estimated synonymous and zzso changes of the genes to detect positive selection pressure on the zzso We found the pressures in three of six zzso zzso in zzso Tax, where zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Although some of zzso viruses were not recognized by the zzso no zzso viruses accumulated within zzso years, indicating genetic stability of zzso tax zzso These results suggest that zzso eliminate the infected cells in zzso and naturally occurring zzso viruses do not zzso As Tax is a regulatory protein which controls viral zzso the zzso acid zzso in Tax may reduce viral fitness for zzso zzso fitness and host immune response may contribute to the viral evolution within the infected zzso Furthermore, the genetic stability in the zzso despite the zzso pressures suggests that the three zzso can be the candidate targets for zzso vaccine zzso
