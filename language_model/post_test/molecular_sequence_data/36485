zzso zzso cells produce a zzso factor, zzso under zzso control that zzso zzso cell functions that are essential for the process of zzso zzso has a more dramatic effect on zzso cell differentiated functions in zzso than any regulatory agent previously shown to influence the cell, including zzso Investigation of the actions of zzso on a molecular level have used zzso expression as a marker of zzso cell zzso zzso was found to stimulate zzso gene expression while having no effect on zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to elevate zzso zzso levels was inhibited by zzso zzso the actions of zzso require ongoing protein synthesis and appear to be indirectly zzso through zzso early event zzso zzso was found to dramatically increase zzso levels for zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso levels increased zzso within a few minutes to a zzso level of stimulation at 1 h and returned to zzso levels within 6 zzso The rise in zzso zzso preceded the zzso in zzso zzso which started to increase at 2 h to a maximum level between zzso h that was maintained at high levels for several days in cell zzso Treatment of zzso cells with an zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit the actions of zzso on zzso zzso Combined results support the hypothesis that zzso acts indirectly through zzso factors zzso zzso to induce zzso cell differentiated functions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to act as a zzso factor to promote and maintain optimal zzso cell zzso
