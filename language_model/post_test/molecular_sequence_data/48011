The suppression zzso zzso zzso method was used to isolate zzso expressed genes during zzso flower zzso Five zzso zzso designated as zzso flower zzso zzso were verified as flower zzso zzso zzso analysis of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones revealed that one of the zzso zzso showed high sequence similarity to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso predicted to be involved in flower zzso The full length zzso clone zzso was 531 zzso zzso long and consisted of an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a 98 zzso acid zzso 12 zzso of zzso region and zzso region zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso acid sequence had a zzso sequence zzso which zzso to the active site of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed zzso expression of zzso zzso as the transcripts were expressed zzso in petals and zzso A zzso zzso zzso method, termed suppression zzso zzso was identified as a rapid method to screen zzso expressed genes in a short zzso
