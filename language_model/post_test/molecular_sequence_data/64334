zzso bacteria were observed in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and electron microscopic observations were used to determine the zzso position of these zzso zzso zzso analysis and a complex zzso cycle affiliate these bacteria to the order zzso within which they form a distinctive zzso close to the family zzso They share zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with their closest relative and zzso % similarity with other members of the order zzso A specific signature zzso sequence was identified and used as a probe, enabling the identification of zzso bacteria in infected zzso zzso According to the distinctive zzso of their elementary bodies, which are zzso rather than zzso and contain translucent oblong structures, their zzso properties and their zzso host, the name zzso zzso zzso is proposed for zzso bacteria in the zzso of zzso zzso
