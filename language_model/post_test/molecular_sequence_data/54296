A human zzso of the zzso membrane zzso proteins zzso zzso causes zzso lateral sclerosis eight due to the zzso zzso of zzso whereas human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso proteins are not significantly affected by similar zzso We have found that zzso and zzso have three zzso present in a zzso region however zzso has only two zzso in this zzso zzso this zzso in zzso zzso leaves a single zzso in this region whereas other zzso can retain two zzso zzso even if the zzso equivalent to the zzso is zzso When zzso and zzso were zzso to be equivalent to zzso in terms of the distribution of zzso zzso in this region, zzso became inactive and zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso indistinguishable from those induced by zzso This suggests that the appropriate distribution of three zzso zzso not the existence of a particular zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance to the zzso zzso and, therefore, is critical for zzso zzso
