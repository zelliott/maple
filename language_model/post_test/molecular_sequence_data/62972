Several zzso were introduced into the zzso toxin zzso resulting in four zzso with altered sequences that were responsible for low expression of the toxin in transgenic zzso These zzso were as zzso zzso with modified three zzso regions, including the first signal of zzso zzso zzso with modified five putative zzso signals zzso signals zzso and the second signal of zzso zzso zzso with four initial zzso zzso zzso with modification of six zzso four zzso zzso as well as the first and the second signals of zzso zzso The modified zzso and the initial zzso gene were cloned into the zzso zzso zzso and introduced into tobacco plants zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the tobacco plants was confirmed by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The expression of particular zzso of the zzso gene in tobacco was zzso using Western zzso with zzso against the domain II of the zzso zzso The average expression of zzso was estimated to be zzso of soluble zzso and the expression levels of modified zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this article we described the construction of a zzso of the zzso gene zzso with 12 point zzso leading to an average level of expression in transgenic plants five times higher than that observed in the case of the zzso zzso Our results have shown for the first time that the modification of zzso sequences has a significant effect on the expression of the zzso gene in transgenic zzso
