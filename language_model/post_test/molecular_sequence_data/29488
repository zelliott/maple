zzso is a zzso zzso zzso by sly in zzso zzso DNA sequence determination of the sly locus in a strain lacking sly revealed the presence of another zzso designated zzso in the place of zzso No zzso element or zzso sequence was found in the close zzso Except for six strains whose corresponding zzso have been zzso all of the remaining 62 strains examined had either sly or zzso at the same locus and their zzso regions were zzso The genetic organizations having either sly or zzso were found in the strains whose zzso zzso sequences were zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso acquired sly or zzso from a foreign source and that these genes subsequently spread among zzso zzso strains by zzso zzso
