The aim of zzso is to identify and characterize putative zzso proteins and zzso zzso In this study, we performed a zzso zzso analysis on zzso zzso through the combined use of efficient immobilized metal affinity zzso enrichment and zzso linear zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso proteins and zzso zzso In total, 232 and 166 putative zzso proteins were respectively isolated by zzso and zzso metal affinity zzso zzso in which 133 proteins were present in both zzso The putative zzso are mainly involved in zzso zzso and carbon zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso Based on the sequence of the putative zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso motifs were zzso zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso while putative zzso motifs were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso 2, 7, 10 and zzso zzso dialysis and zzso coupled zzso experiments confirmed that the artificially zzso peptides harboring differential identified zzso motifs zzso directly with the metal zzso The zzso study presented here suggests that the comparably large size and diverse functions of the zzso zzso zzso may play important roles in various biological processes and thus contribute to the bacterial zzso
