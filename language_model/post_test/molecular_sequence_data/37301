In the present work we investigated the zzso levels of zzso gene zzso promoter region in normal gastric zzso and zzso gastric zzso in order to access if the observed de zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso gastric zzso is associated with changes in zzso promoter zzso zzso The results obtained by zzso single zzso primer extension suggest that zzso expression in gastric cells is regulated by promoter zzso and further indicate that two specific zzso zzso zzso zzso sites may play a particularly important regulatory zzso
