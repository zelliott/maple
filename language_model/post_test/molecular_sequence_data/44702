To zzso the detailed gene organization of the human zzso zzso zzso class I region on zzso 6, seven zzso zzso zzso clones covering the zzso segment around the zzso and -C zzso were subjected to DNA sequencing by the shotgun strategy to give a single zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso This region was confirmed to contain four known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso Further, a new member of the zzso zzso genes was found to be about zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene and designated zzso Five novel genes designated zzso were identified by zzso and Northern zzso zzso In addition, two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso gene zzso were also found in the vicinity of the zzso and -C zzso zzso The two segments (about 40 zzso downstream of the zzso and zzso genes showed high sequence zzso to each other, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso including the major zzso complex zzso class I gene must have occurred during the evolution of the zzso
