zzso are widely viewed as integral components of the zzso machinery by which membrane proteins are targeted to compartments of the zzso system and to the surface zzso of polarized zzso The zzso zzso zzso creates zzso by transferring zzso to the head group of zzso zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso zzso of an extra zzso group onto zzso generates zzso zzso the final and most abundant zzso in zzso zzso of zzso is partially dependent on zzso a gene zzso a putative zzso Here we show that open reading frame zzso renamed zzso is functionally zzso to zzso and that deletion of both genes zzso zzso and zzso synthesis without affecting protein zzso zzso and zzso are closely related zzso membrane proteins that zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso Loss of zzso and zzso has no effect on zzso or zzso zzso protein transport from the zzso to the zzso Moreover, segregation of the zzso zzso zzso the plasma membrane zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso into distinct classes of zzso zzso occurs independently of zzso and zzso Our results indicate that protein sorting in the late zzso of zzso does not require production of zzso zzso
