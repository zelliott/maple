zzso regulators containing a zzso zzso and a zzso basic domain belong to a recently identified class of zzso zzso We have mapped the essential DNA contacts of one member of this group, the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso interference experiments detected major groove contacts over a full turn of the DNA zzso on both an zzso and a zzso zzso binding zzso The contacts essential for zzso binding have zzso symmetry yet differ significantly from the contacts of other zzso zzso zzso including those bearing zzso motifs and the type I restriction zzso zzso
