The zzso acid sequences of the zzso portion of the zzso of two zzso zzso influenza viruses isolated in France in 1993 and 1998 were zzso to determine their evolutionary relationship with 51 other zzso zzso acid sequences available in zzso Our data show that the French strain isolated in 1993 belongs to a group of zzso related viruses zzso on the main zzso illustrating the main lineage of evolution of the zzso zzso sequences before its split into two distinct lineages in the late zzso By contrast, the 1998 French isolate appears to belong to the more recent zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso strains zzso related to old zzso viruses may zzso with the more recent zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, it may be necessary to include both strains representative of recent zzso influenza zzso and an older zzso strain in the current zzso influenza zzso
