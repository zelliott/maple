A unique zzso zzso termed zzso coding for zzso novel rat zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The restriction zzso map of the zzso was slightly different from the reported two zzso zzso and several zzso zzso were zzso Compared to the zzso sequence reported as zzso by zzso Gonzalez et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1985, zzso zzso there were 26 zzso of zzso leading to 11 zzso acid changes and a zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion in the open reading zzso zzso with the sequence of zzso reported by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992, zzso zzso showed 18 zzso changes resulting in eight zzso acid zzso and the zzso deletion in the coding zzso zzso and these clones shared zzso and zzso similarity in deduced zzso acid zzso respectively, while only zzso similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso corresponding to zzso was mainly induced in rat liver by the administration of zzso zzso
