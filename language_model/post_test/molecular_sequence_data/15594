For the entry of zzso into target cells, fusion between its viral membrane and cellular membrane is zzso The present study was conducted to examine the zzso effect of modified peptides corresponding to zzso repeats zzso 1 and 2 of zzso zzso virus zzso envelope zzso on the fusion between the viral and cellular zzso zzso and zzso were zzso as authentic peptides of the zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were peptides zzso by zzso zzso as the zzso concept to increase their zzso in water and the stability of their zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the cell membrane fusion zzso by zzso cells and the replication of zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show any apparent zzso zzso These results indicated that the newly developed membrane fusion zzso could facilitate the development of novel zzso zzso
