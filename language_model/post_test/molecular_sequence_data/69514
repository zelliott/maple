A novel method that allows direct analysis of single base zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso is zzso The method zzso the finding that zzso zzso zzso zzso recognize and bind to their complementary zzso acid sequences with higher zzso stability and specificity than the corresponding zzso and that they cannot function as zzso for DNA zzso We show that a zzso complex can effectively block the formation of a zzso product when the zzso is targeted against one of the zzso primer zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that this zzso allows selective zzso of target sequences that differ by only one base zzso Finally we show that zzso can be designed in such a way that zzso can be accomplished when the zzso target sequence is located between the zzso zzso
