Human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso is a complex zzso associated with the zzso disease adult zzso zzso zzso and the neurodegenerative disorder tropical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is under the control of two major zzso zzso Tax and zzso Previous studies suggested that Tax activates zzso from the viral long terminal repeat zzso through recruitment of cellular zzso and zzso zzso Other studies reported that Rex acts zzso and allows the zzso export of zzso or incompletely spliced viral zzso carrying zzso and zzso zzso As opposed to zzso zzso element zzso the zzso element zzso is present in all viral zzso in zzso However, based on indirect zzso it is believed that nuclear export and expression of the doubly spliced zzso zzso are Rex zzso In this study, we demonstrate that Rex does stimulate Tax zzso through zzso export of the zzso zzso even though a zzso zzso export mechanism zzso This effect was dependent upon the zzso element and the zzso activity of zzso In addition, zzso export of zzso zzso was zzso dependent and inhibited by zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed Rex binding to the zzso zzso in both zzso cells with zzso molecular clones and zzso T zzso Since both Rex and zzso interact with the zzso zzso and with one another, this may offer a zzso and dynamic regulation of zzso zzso Our results shed light on zzso replication and reveal a more complex regulatory network than previously zzso
