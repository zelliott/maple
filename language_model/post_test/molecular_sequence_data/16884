Excess zzso zzso zzso entry into S phase of the cell cycle and promotes zzso which may contribute to zzso instability in cancer zzso We identified 20 zzso acids in zzso E as a zzso zzso signal zzso essential for both zzso targeting and promoting DNA zzso zzso zzso but not zzso CLS peptides localized on the zzso prevented zzso zzso E and zzso A from zzso to the zzso and inhibited DNA zzso zzso zzso E localized to the zzso and accelerated S phase entry even with zzso that abolish zzso zzso but not with a zzso in the zzso These results suggest that zzso E has a modular zzso domain essential for promoting S phase entry in a zzso zzso
