The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the clearance of zzso zzso were studied in both intact and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to verify that the zzso material isolated by solid phase extraction of rat plasma was intact zzso In intact animals, clearance of zzso was zzso with a zzso alpha of 17 zzso and zzso beta of 95 zzso Volume of distribution zzso was zzso zzso and plasma clearance zzso 248 zzso zzso over the dose range zzso zzso zzso increased zzso beta (by a maximum of zzso and decreased zzso (by up to zzso with no effect on zzso alpha or zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso (by zzso and zzso (by zzso with no effect on zzso zzso whilst abolishing the zzso alpha phase in over 50% of zzso zzso the dose of zzso did not increase the effect on any of these zzso apart from a small increase in zzso zzso Combining the two agents resulted in a substantial decrease in zzso zzso whilst the reduction in zzso and increase in zzso beta were comparable to those seen with zzso and zzso alone, zzso In zzso rats, the zzso of zzso and the changes induced by zzso were similar to those observed in intact animals, whilst the effects of zzso alone were greater than in intact zzso The combination of zzso and zzso again produced a substantial increase in zzso beta zzso and decreases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso animals, although these changes could not be distinguished from those seen in intact animals treated with the same zzso Our studies indicate that neutral zzso and zzso receptors are both major, and approximately equal, clearance mechanisms for zzso together accounting for at least zzso of the total clearance of this zzso in the zzso
