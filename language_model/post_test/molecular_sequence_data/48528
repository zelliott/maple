The zzso zzso is the most widespread zzso among the Kingdom zzso This genetic element occurs within the zzso zzso and is transcribed and translated simultaneously with the zzso After translation, the zzso zzso itself from the zzso protein by an zzso zzso reaction, subsequently joining the N and C terminals of the host zzso which retains its functional zzso Besides the zzso domain, some zzso zzso also have a zzso zzso zzso domain which, if functional, makes the zzso a mobile element capable of becoming fixed in a zzso This work aimed to study zzso The occurrence of this zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to different cryptic species collected in diverse geographical locations, and zzso The functionality of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso relationship among the cryptic zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso is fixed in zzso zzso populations and that an zzso or a probable ancestral zzso of the zzso zzso sequences is responsible for the apparent zzso pattern of the zzso zzso which, in the zzso zzso also encompasses sequences from zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequences clearly separate the different cryptic species, and may serve as an additional molecular typing zzso as previously proposed for other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso
