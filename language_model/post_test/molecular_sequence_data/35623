zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso regulated zzso that links zzso the primary energy zzso to cellular zzso zzso acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on zzso for their energy production under zzso conditions, which reinforces the key role of zzso in their zzso These organisms are closely zzso but have adapted to a huge variety of native zzso They include zzso organisms, important zzso in the human gut, and zzso zzso In contrast to the rather zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of zzso shows high zzso in the type of zzso compound between different zzso acid zzso zzso comparative studies of the metabolism of zzso acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related zzso These require knowledge of the identities of the zzso zzso Here, we predict potential zzso zzso of zzso from three zzso acid bacteria which are adapted to different native zzso We used protein zzso molecular modeling and zzso kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential zzso of zzso Specifically, we compared the zzso potential and the binding of zzso zzso at the zzso binding sites, and predicted potential zzso zzso by zzso We then made a kinetic model of zzso zzso zzso to relate the zzso predictions to the zzso zzso conditions in zzso acid zzso This strategy enabled us to predict zzso zzso as the sole zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and to predict that the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso show weaker specificity for their zzso zzso while still having zzso zzso play the main zzso role in zzso These differences in the specificity of zzso zzso may reflect adaptation to different environments with different zzso of zzso zzso The combined zzso approach employed can readily be applied to other zzso
