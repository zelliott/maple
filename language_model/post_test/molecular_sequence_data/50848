A single zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso of the zzso membrane zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We have proposed that the zzso is zzso as a precursor of 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso and then converted to the zzso form by an unusual processing reaction, which removes the internal domain of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and joins the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso the zzso that zzso the internal domain, were introduced into the zzso gene by zzso zzso and the zzso genes were expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring either of the zzso zzso genes accumulate zzso fragments of the zzso The zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso of the zzso junction zzso zzso zzso appeared to block the processing at both junction sites although the zzso gene yielded a small fraction of the functional zzso zzso
