The zzso gene of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, is expressed at low levels under optimal growth conditions and is dramatically induced in response to heat zzso zzso coinciding with two overlapping heat shock zzso located 156 base pairs upstream of the transcribed region, were necessary and sufficient for regulation of heat zzso The zzso promoter was also activated in an zzso zzso zzso This increase in the expression of zzso was zzso via the same upstream zzso sequences that activated zzso in response to heat zzso
