Increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso is highly correlated with tumor cell migration, invasion, zzso zzso and zzso Thus zzso of zzso activity represents a promising target for zzso zzso So far, only the zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso by zzso has been reported, thus limited data are available for a rational zzso design of zzso zzso Taking into account the zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso was selected as a potential zzso zzso and zzso zzso of its zzso group with various zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in terms of hydrogen bond zzso properties led to zzso as a highly selective zzso zzso zzso The zzso crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso with this inhibitor revealed a surprising binding mode consisting of the expected zzso of the zzso zzso into the zzso pocket, but with the zzso zzso protruding toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso thus exposing the zzso group to zzso zzso Although in this zzso state the inhibitor is crossing the active site, interactions with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not observed, but their side chains are zzso displaced for zzso zzso Compared with other zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso pockets of zzso are reduced in size because of the zzso zzso zzso the peculiar binding mode of the new type of zzso zzso offers the possibility of exploiting zzso interactions at the zzso zzso to further enhance selectivity and zzso Because zzso of the zzso complex allow inhibitor exchange by soaking procedures, the zzso design of new generations of zzso zzso can rely on the assistance of zzso zzso
