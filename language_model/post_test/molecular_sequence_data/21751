Plant root development is zzso by the concerted action of the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso serving as an zzso of zzso zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its potential zzso zzso as important positive zzso of root zzso that zzso zzso movements to zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso level in roots is strongly zzso by zzso but not by other zzso Whereas the zzso single and zzso zzso double zzso roots grow normally without zzso zzso and respond similarly to the wild type upon zzso application, their growth is hypersensitive to zzso transport zzso with the zzso roots also having reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso movements may be zzso in part by the zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which for zzso reduces its abundance on the plasma membrane of root zzso zzso roots are also hypersensitive to zzso and have increased expression of several components of zzso zzso zzso analyses of root growth and zzso of the zzso B zzso marker showed that zzso does not affect root cell division but promotes zzso cell expansion in the zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso the zzso regulator zzso or its zzso as the target of the zzso Box zzso zzso zzso assembled with zzso Given the wide distribution of zzso proteins among land plants, we propose that zzso provides additional cross talk between zzso and zzso which zzso zzso distribution and ultimately root zzso
