We have recently reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso II, which is zzso expressed in zzso cells, has been zzso and shown to be a zzso zzso We have now zzso and characterized zzso zzso I from zzso cells and shown that it is a zzso zzso The zzso zzso with a specific activity of 27 zzso zzso was found to be composed of three zzso of apparent molecular mass 64 zzso 51 zzso and 31 zzso and to contain per zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso iron but no zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso differed from the zzso zzso (8 zzso in that it zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso and was zzso by zzso The two zzso also differed significantly in the pH zzso in the apparent zzso for the electron zzso and in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were similar, however, in that the zzso zzso acid sequences determined for the alpha and beta zzso were identical up to zzso 23, indicating that the two proteins are zzso The zzso zzso as isolated, was found to display an zzso signal derived from zzso as evidenced by isotope zzso
