In an attempt to identify features of an zzso promoter, we have determined the location of zzso initiation for the zzso zzso The position for the zzso promoter was demonstrated by several independent means to be located zzso base pairs zzso upstream from the zzso structural zzso DNA sequence analysis of the promoter region demonstrates the presence of a zzso pair region of zzso symmetry followed by a sequence containing zzso to promoters which use the zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso for recognition of zzso In addition to the zzso promoter, a region responsible for low-level zzso expression of the zzso zzso was shown to initiate zzso zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso promoter, this second promoter contains no obvious secondary structure nor sequence zzso to zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis demonstrates the existence of an additional open reading frame zzso as zzso that is located between the promoters and the zzso structural zzso A zzso fusion of zzso to zzso was used to demonstrate that zzso is efficiently translated and regulated in a manner analogous to a zzso fusion of zzso to zzso Finally, we also demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso initiation and regulation does not involve any zzso gene zzso
