zzso zzso media zzso of acute zzso leukemia cell lines induce growth stimulation of other zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso iron binding zzso 50 protein was found to be the main growth factor of these zzso zzso and further characterization of this protein was performed by zzso methods, zzso zzso mapping and zzso acid zzso In addition zzso of zzso cell lines was zzso by Northern zzso analysis with zzso zzso specific for human serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso signals for these zzso have been zzso zzso results show significant differences between human serum zzso and zzso 50 growth factor with respect to retention time on reversed phase zzso pattern of zzso peptides in zzso and zzso acid zzso which suggests, that this protein is an additional tumor associated member of the zzso zzso
