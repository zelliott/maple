The tumor zzso zzso regulates cell cycle arrest and zzso by zzso several genes that are critical for these zzso The zzso activity of zzso is often regulated by zzso modifications and its interactions with various zzso zzso Here we report a physical interaction between the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso domain of positive zzso 4 zzso Using zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso competition experiments indicated that zzso binds to the zzso site of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso increased its binding zzso Computer modeling of the zzso complex revealed several important interactions that are reminiscent of those in the zzso zzso zzso The ubiquitous nature of the zzso zzso domain of zzso in zzso interactions with several zzso zzso is also zzso as a DNA zzso
