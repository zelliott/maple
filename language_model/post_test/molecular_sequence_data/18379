zzso acid zzso is thought to play a role in embryonic pattern formation in zzso A naturally occurring zzso of zzso zzso has been demonstrated in the developing chick limb zzso while local application of zzso leads to the formation of additional zzso In zzso a zzso spectrum of birth defects has been reported as a result of fetal exposure to excess zzso In zzso to the chick limb zzso it may be speculated that these zzso are the result of zzso of zzso zzso concentration zzso A candidate gene involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso is the gene zzso cellular zzso binding protein zzso We have isolated a partial zzso clone corresponding to the chicken zzso of zzso and performed in zzso zzso experiments on sections of zzso at various stages of zzso zzso expression was detected in the zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the peripheral nervous system, the limb zzso and the visceral arch zzso Our results indicate that the zzso specified expression pattern displayed by the zzso gene exhibits a striking correspondence to the zzso that are affected by exposure of avian or zzso zzso to zzso We zzso that zzso plays an important role in normal zzso and that embryonic zzso showing high zzso expression are susceptible to the adverse effects of excess zzso
