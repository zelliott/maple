Human zzso zzso are among the most common viruses infecting zzso Their circulation has been widely studied in most parts of the world but not in sub-Saharan Africa, where zzso remains zzso We report here the molecular characterization of 98 zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from 93 randomly selected cell zzso zzso from stool samples collected from 1997 through 2006 from children with acute zzso paralysis living in the Central African Republic zzso The zzso were typed by sequencing the zzso coding region and zzso further in the zzso coding region, and zzso studies were carried zzso Among the 98 zzso zzso 3, 74, 18, and 3 were found to belong to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso species, zzso Overall, 42 types were zzso In most cases, the zzso type was correlated with that of the zzso zzso Some of the zzso belonged to lineages that also contain viruses isolated in distant countries, while others belonged to lineages containing viruses isolated only in zzso In particular, one isolate zzso zzso did not fall into any of the zzso already zzso indicating the existence of a previously unknown zzso for this zzso These results illustrate the considerable diversity of zzso zzso from the stools of paralyzed children in the zzso The presence of diverse zzso types makes zzso between zzso and other zzso species possible and could promote the emergence of zzso zzso zzso similar to those that have been implicated in repeated zzso outbreaks in several developing zzso
