The mechanisms involved in the zzso degradation of cellulose are of great ecological and commercial zzso The breakdown of cellulose by zzso species is performed by a consortium of free zzso known as zzso and zzso which are found in many of the 57 zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso I zzso zzso found in zzso zzso family 7, from the zzso fungus zzso zzso has been solved at zzso A zzso In addition to the native zzso structures have also been determined with both the affinity label, zzso zzso and the reaction product zzso The affinity label is zzso bound, as expected, to the zzso zzso zzso with clear evidence for binding of both the R and S zzso zzso is found bound to the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso In marked contrast to the structure of zzso I with a zzso zzso zzso which spanned the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and which had a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso sugar zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso the zzso complex shows no zzso ring distortion in the zzso zzso zzso that strain is induced primarily by the additional zzso zzso interactions and that the product is found, as expected, in its zzso zzso
