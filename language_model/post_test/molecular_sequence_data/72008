To identify genes responsive to cold stress, we employed the differential display zzso analysis technique to isolate a novel gene from zzso zzso which encodes a protein zzso of 430 zzso zzso A zzso of this zzso with zzso zzso acid sequence identity was also found in zzso zzso Both zzso contain 11 zzso typical of protein zzso zzso analysis revealed that the predicted zzso acid sequences resemble those of zzso protein zzso zzso especially zzso and zzso protein zzso which are known to be involved in various stress zzso However, it should be noted that the zzso zzso in the normally zzso zzso zzso site zzso is replaced by zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso basic protein zzso and became zzso However, the zzso zzso protein in which zzso was replaced by Ala lost the ability to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript in zzso zzso increased markedly upon temperature zzso from 35 to 15 degrees C zzso degrees zzso Interestingly, zzso shock either by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso expression of the zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the activity of the zzso as determined by an immune complex zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso was also induced by zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is induced by physical stresses such as cold temperature and zzso The present results suggest that this zzso may function in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
