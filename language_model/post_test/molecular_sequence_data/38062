zzso is a zzso floral organ identity gene required for the normal development of petals and zzso in zzso zzso expression is induced in the stage 3 flowers zzso zzso and is maintained until zzso zzso zzso To explore in more detail the zzso regulated gene expression of zzso we have analyzed the zzso promoter using zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso deletion analyses suggest that early zzso expression is zzso by the zzso region and that late expression is zzso by the zzso zzso Based on the zzso expression patterns in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or organ identity zzso we have shown that zzso and zzso zzso zzso induce zzso expression in a zzso manner via a zzso promoter, and that zzso and zzso maintain zzso expression zzso in the later stages of flower development via a zzso zzso In addition, we have demonstrated that de zzso protein synthesis is required for the zzso zzso zzso
