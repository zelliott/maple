zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the virus zzso in zzso infected zzso zzso links virus zzso to host zzso via a zzso zzso domain which interacts with the sequences located in terminal repeats zzso of the virus zzso and via an zzso zzso sequence which associates with the host zzso zzso Recent data suggest that zzso also actively zzso in the replication of zzso zzso zzso in the transient DNA replication zzso In this report, it was found that zzso and zzso but not zzso cell lines are zzso for the transient replication of zzso zzso zzso Using several zzso zzso the minimum domain of zzso required for replication activity was also zzso In addition, the N zzso of zzso inhibited the transient replication systems of zzso and zzso virus zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, but the C zzso of zzso specifically inhibited the transient replication system of zzso in other cell zzso zzso with previous reports, these data further emphasize the functional importance of the N zzso of zzso on replication from the zzso zzso origin of DNA zzso
