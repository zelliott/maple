zzso is a zzso of the zzso family closely related to the zzso zzso Several zzso species accumulate zzso zzso zzso zzso first described in zzso species are thought to be involved in zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso of zzso A full length zzso clone zzso a zzso was isolated from zzso zzso leaves by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of another nine zzso species were amplified by zzso using zzso and 3' end zzso deduced from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso long and encodes for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso 30 zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli and zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso were determined for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The by far highest specificity constant zzso was estimated for zzso indicating that this zzso zzso may be more related to the natural zzso of the zzso than zzso The atomic structure of zzso was zzso using the crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso as the zzso All sequence motifs specific for zzso as well as the zzso motif typical for zzso zzso were present and the protein sequence fitted into the template zzso
