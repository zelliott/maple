The functions of delta zzso zzso in the replication of zzso delta virus zzso have been identified zzso The small zzso acts as a zzso whereas the large zzso has a negative effect on zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of zzso zzso we have established a replication system in zzso cells by zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso the small zzso We demonstrate that a zzso repeat in the middle domain of the small zzso is involved in binding to the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso When the zzso repeat was disrupted by a substitution of zzso for zzso at position zzso both zzso and zzso activity of the small zzso were zzso In contrast, the binding and zzso activities were not affected when zzso and zzso of the small zzso were replaced by zzso In addition, small and large zzso can interact with each other to form protein complexes in zzso The complex formation that may lead to the zzso negative regulation of large zzso in zzso replication is zzso by a cryptic signal located between zzso acid zzso 35 and 65 other than the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, an extra zzso extension near the N zzso converts the small zzso into a zzso zzso with negative regulation activity of zzso replication even though the extreme zzso zzso is zzso
