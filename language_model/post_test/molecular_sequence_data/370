The family B DNA zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a long open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso acid zzso The gene is split by one intervening sequence that forms a continuous open reading frame with the two zzso zzso In this study, the zzso DNA zzso gene both with zzso zzso and without zzso zzso its zzso was expressed in zzso coli, zzso by heat treatment and zzso zzso zzso column zzso and zzso zzso sequence analysis of the mature zzso zzso showed high sequence identity with DNA zzso in the zzso zzso The expressed precursor form was easily spliced during zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso DNA zzso is about 90 zzso as estimated by zzso Both zzso DNA zzso showed the same zzso zzso performed with this zzso was found to be optimal in the presence of 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, long-range zzso and zzso zzso were performed using various specific ratios of zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso plus DNA zzso
