zzso zzso containing reversed zzso bonds between each zzso along the zzso sequence zzso zzso have been analyzed for their zzso and in zzso zzso properties in the zzso II and zzso cell response zzso Two zzso peptides were selected for this study, namely zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is involved in the production of zzso that neutralize the zzso of the virus, and zzso zzso from the third constant region of mouse heavy chain zzso zzso gamma zzso which mimics a zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso In a competition zzso performed in zzso using reference zzso of known zzso class II zzso both zzso zzso bound (although more zzso in our zzso to zzso and/or zzso class II zzso However, in both cases, this lower affinity was apparently largely compensated in zzso as a T cell response (with zzso zzso equivalent to that obtained with the zzso zzso was observed following zzso of zzso mice with the zzso zzso Moreover, these T cells proliferated and produced zzso in response to the zzso zzso It is concluded that the T cell receptors of T cells primed in zzso with the zzso zzso readily zzso with parent and zzso zzso zzso The approach of using zzso containing changes involving the zzso and not the orientation of side zzso may thus be promising to design potent zzso for class zzso T zzso
