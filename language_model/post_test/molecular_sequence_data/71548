The usefulness of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence determination, as a complementary approach to the zzso tests traditionally used for zzso species zzso is shown by its application to the identification of a strain, zzso isolated from a natural bacteria mixture used for cheese zzso Using combined approaches we zzso zzso that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso However, its zzso region has an interesting zzso In our previous study of zzso from various zzso species zzso et zzso 1997, zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the two zzso zzso strains zzso were found to contain an additional zzso long zzso structure as compared to the zzso of other zzso only one out of the 3 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain a similar zzso long zzso zzso The zzso of strain zzso is zzso identical to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso except that the zzso additional zzso is zzso This strongly suggests the existence of lateral DNA transfer or DNA zzso events at a hot spot position of the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Small and large zzso zzso sequence determination for strain zzso generalized the notion of two kinds of zzso in zzso one with a zzso zzso one without zzso zzso To complete strain zzso zzso its zzso zzso sequence was zzso This is the first complete zzso zzso zzso sequence determined for an zzso zzso
