We describe the cloning and functional characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel member of the nuclear zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso C domain of zzso shows zzso sequence identity to both human zzso and zzso zzso zzso but a much lower level of conservation of the zzso E domain zzso zzso zzso analysis places zzso within the zzso group as an early offshoot of this zzso zzso zzso is expressed at all zzso stages but at higher levels in the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso protein is expressed at markedly different levels, being almost absent from eggs while present at the highest concentration in zzso zzso zzso fails to bind to the consensus direct repeat response zzso either alone, or as a zzso with mouse zzso acid zzso alpha or the zzso zzso zzso However, the use of zzso constructions shows that the C domain of zzso will bind to conventional response elements as a zzso and that its specificity is modified by the presence of the D and E zzso In accordance with these results, native zzso failed to zzso the zzso of a reporter gene after zzso of zzso cell zzso
