Two zzso clones zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from a mouse bone zzso zzso zzso One was thought to be the zzso of the human zzso zzso termed zzso alpha zzso and the other form, termed zzso beta zzso differed from the zzso alpha zzso in the seventh zzso domain and zzso zzso Analysis of the mouse zzso DNA showed that both receptors originated from a single zzso The different zzso sequences of the zzso beta zzso were zzso by separate zzso zzso these receptors were generated by differential zzso zzso High affinity binding of zzso to each zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso after binding to each zzso were zzso In the zzso cells expressing the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso increase, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were observed by stimulation of zzso and these responses were abolished by zzso with zzso zzso Since zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso we speculate that zzso signaling zzso such as zzso zzso may lie between zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, these zzso signals were not detected in zzso cells expressing the zzso beta zzso Northern blots and reverse zzso chain reaction analyses indicated that the zzso alpha zzso was highly expressed in the brain, heart, zzso zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso whereas the zzso beta zzso zzso was not detected in these zzso However, the zzso beta zzso was expressed in mouse embryonic zzso stage (7 and 11 zzso bone zzso cells and several zzso cell zzso These results suggest that the zzso beta zzso is an embryonic and a bone zzso form of the zzso zzso which decreases in the expression during development and zzso
