zzso modification methods represent fundamental techniques that are zzso in many zzso In this study, a zzso protein zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso reaction was zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso zzso reactions and form zzso in their zzso zzso and these species subsequently react with each other to form zzso or further react to generate zzso Here, a zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso of which the zzso acid sequences were either zzso or zzso was genetically introduced at the zzso of a model zzso zzso coli alkaline zzso zzso Following the incubation of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso were efficiently zzso with each other, whereas zzso zzso did not undergo zzso indicating that the zzso zzso in the zzso were recognized by zzso as the zzso To determine the zzso of the zzso reaction, the zzso was selectively removed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso without the zzso showed no zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso treatment were almost completely zzso into zzso zzso units following incubation with the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso retained zzso of their native zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso through zzso zzso positioned in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reaction should offer a practical option for zzso and zzso protein zzso
