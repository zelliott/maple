We report the involvement of zzso domain 4 zzso of zzso in forming the putative zzso pathway, using zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso studies using the zzso zzso zzso zzso We individually zzso each of the 21 zzso acids in zzso to zzso on a fully functional, zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells, and their cell surface expression levels, transport activities zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and sensitivities to zzso exposure were zzso Only zzso lacked zzso zzso Overall, zzso replacement was tolerated at charged and polar zzso except for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso versus the zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, all of these zzso were clustered along one face of the putative alpha zzso zzso zzso were not sensitive to zzso (12 zzso sodium zzso thereby ruling out a direct role of zzso in sodium zzso Our results demonstrate that primarily the zzso half of zzso is highly zzso and plays an important role in zzso function and zzso zzso zzso with the existing experimental data, a three-dimensional model for the orientation of zzso is zzso
