Recently, we described a strategy for the design of miniature proteins that bind DNA and protein surfaces with high affinity and zzso This strategy involves identifying the functional zzso required for zzso recognition by a natural protein and presenting it on a small, stable protein zzso In previous work, zzso DNA recognition was achieved only when the miniature protein contained the complete functional zzso Here we report a miniature zzso that recognizes its zzso target site in the zzso concentration range at 25 degrees C, despite the absence of DNA contact zzso located along the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that miniature proteins can achieve high affinity and selectivity for DNA by design even when the functional zzso is incomplete by using zzso to effectively compensate for lost zzso zzso In this case it has been possible to zzso both the recognition surface and the structural framework of a zzso protein zzso
