The zzso gene cluster for the respiratory nitrous oxide zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso has been cloned and zzso Seven protein coding regions corresponding to zzso zzso the structural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence exhibited a high degree of similarity to other nitrous oxide zzso from various zzso The zzso protein included a signal zzso for protein zzso zzso strains carrying either a zzso or a zzso zzso accumulated nitrous oxide when cultured zzso in the presence of zzso zzso expression of a P zzso fusion in strain zzso required simultaneously both low level oxygen conditions and the presence of zzso zzso zzso of the fusion required zzso and zzso
