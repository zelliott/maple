zzso virus X coat protein zzso is, through communication with host zzso involved in processes such as virus movement and symptom zzso Here, we report that zzso also interacts with the precursor of zzso a protein involved in photosynthesis, both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso with only the zzso transit zzso In subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso both proteins were zzso within zzso Western zzso analyses of zzso zzso showed that zzso could be detected in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso demonstrated that zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso gene zzso of zzso by prior infection of zzso zzso using a zzso rattle virus zzso reduced the severity of symptoms that developed following subsequent zzso infection as well as the zzso of zzso in isolated zzso However, zzso could not be detected in pea zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso using the zzso precursor zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso interacts with the zzso precursor protein and that zzso the expression of this protein leads to reduced zzso zzso in zzso and ameliorates symptom severity in host zzso
