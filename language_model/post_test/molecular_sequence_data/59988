On the basis of our studies with zzso class II transgenic mice, we had proposed that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso may determine both disease zzso and severity in zzso arthritis zzso According to our model, certain zzso zzso such as zzso zzso individuals to zzso while a zzso derived from the third zzso region zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso can protect from disease if presented by the zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined the zzso effects of the zzso derived zzso zzso zzso on zzso arthritis zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the severity of arthritis zzso score zzso zzso vs zzso in zzso whereas multiple doses of the zzso reduced the zzso of disease zzso vs zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso protection may be due to the generation of a subset of regulatory cells, which zzso zzso zzso zzso These results provide additional insights towards understanding the role of zzso class II molecules in zzso zzso
