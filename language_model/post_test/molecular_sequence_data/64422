Identification of genes selectively expressed in tumors or individual zzso is a crucial prerequisite for molecular diagnosis and treatment of cancer by addressing molecular zzso By screening an expression database, we identified the novel gene zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso which is highly zzso in normal prostate tissue and prostate zzso zzso The corresponding transcript contained an open reading frame of 453 zzso zzso a putative protein of 150 zzso zzso A large part of zzso 8 of the zzso gene shows strong similarity to the zzso zzso binding protein 2 zzso zzso The highly specific zzso of the zzso gene in normal and zzso prostate zzso and in a few additional tumors was demonstrated by using multiple tissue dot zzso cancer profiling dot zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso of 18 pairs of zzso and zzso prostate zzso from zzso patients by quantitative zzso revealed zzso transcripts in all zzso The potential usefulness of zzso as a sensitive marker for zzso prostate zzso cells in zzso zzso was demonstrated by the detection of one zzso cell in 1 zzso zzso normal zzso zzso cells using real-time zzso zzso of 22 zzso zzso from zzso patients either containing zzso prostate cancer cells or diagnosed as zzso was in full zzso with zzso zzso These results validate zzso as a transcript with high tissue specificity and with a potential application in the diagnosis of zzso
