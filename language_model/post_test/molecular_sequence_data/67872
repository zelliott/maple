The zzso mechanism of zzso zzso is quite different from many other animal zzso In this article, several characteristics of zzso and bisexual populations of zzso zzso were zzso including some important zzso synchronized life cycle feature and sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggested even though many observations of the two populations were similar to each other, some important differences also zzso The zzso apron of zzso females was wider than that of bisexual zzso zzso individuals (except zzso zzso were significantly larger in weight than bisexual individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso the difference of zzso zzso female feeding and zzso and egg incubation periods between the two populations were significant zzso hatch percentage of zzso was lower than that of bisexual population zzso and zzso zzso zzso individuals had a slightly longer development cycle than bisexual individuals zzso and 129 days, zzso zzso attempts failed between zzso Comparing to the two strains of bisexual zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso inserted two zzso of zzso though the genetic distance of zzso zzso between the bisexual and zzso populations was zzso In order to clarify the relationships of the two zzso populations of zzso zzso the sequences of zzso zzso of four strains of two other species were also zzso The divergence between zzso and Xinjiang strains of zzso zzso was 0, and the sequences were totally identical between zzso The divergence between the two subspecies of zzso zzso was zzso The results indicated that the relationship between bisexual and zzso zzso zzso was certainly closer than that between subspecies, but farther than that between the same zzso populations of zzso
