zzso sequencing of selected zzso regions, coupled with in zzso gene zzso is a robust approach to identifying previously unknown zzso In this way we have found a gene zzso that is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was situated on zzso 2 between zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso zzso oriented toward the zzso zzso consisted of 16 zzso spanning more than zzso zzso of zzso DNA, and was expressed zzso in human zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso acid zzso by alternative zzso the larger zzso contained a region extremely rich in charged zzso zzso in particular zzso and zzso zzso zzso also bore sequence zzso to the human zzso zzso Its conservation among highly divergent species suggests that zzso belongs to a novel gene zzso
