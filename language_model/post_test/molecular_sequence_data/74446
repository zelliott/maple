zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied by analyzing the sequence of zzso The samples of zzso zzso were collected from zzso County in zzso Province and zzso County in zzso Province in May and June, zzso The zzso fragments were obtained by zzso amplification with the template zzso DNA of the fresh zzso or zzso body of the collected samples and the cultured zzso of zzso zzso with the universal zzso zzso zzso The amplified fragments were cloned into zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis was performed with these sequences and those from zzso The result showed that all of the 46 clones randomly chosen from the amplification of zzso zzso shared identical or almost identical zzso regions and had over zzso identity with some zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso registered in zzso but all of them had only about zzso identity with that of zzso zzso Two pairs of specific zzso were designed based on the zzso sequence of zzso zzso then zzso and zzso were performed with the template zzso DNA of the zzso or zzso body of zzso zzso samples mentioned zzso The apparent bands amplified by zzso were obtained from all of the samples, and the sequences showed zzso identity with the zzso sequence of zzso zzso In addition, another pair of specific zzso were designed based on the zzso sequence registered in zzso as the marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the latter only shared zzso identity with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This pair of zzso was used to amplify the zzso zzso samples by zzso and the amplified sequence showed zzso identity with that of zzso The result indicated that zzso zzso is the main body of zzso zzso while some other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso commonly exist in the natural zzso zzso
