The zzso of variable regions of zzso C virus zzso proteins was studied by zzso by using zzso synthetic peptides from 120 variable regions and 90 zzso from zzso zzso Some regions from certain zzso were less zzso or even zzso compared with their zzso in other zzso However, the mean recognition of all peptides from zzso zzso zzso and 3 by zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso and 3, respectively, showed no significant differences, suggesting a similar overall zzso of variable regions from these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be the most zzso zzso of individual peptides by the zzso of infected patients showed that the zzso response against zzso is zzso The work shows that zzso peptides may zzso several zzso zzso These zzso may lie in slightly different positions in different zzso Thirty-one percent of the zzso peptides were recognized by some of the 35 healthy zzso This may be a reflection of the large number of zzso to which they had been exposed, but it may also reflect a strategy of zzso to respond to immune zzso After selection and zzso a set of 40 peptides was used to assess zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 in the zzso of zzso patients, with sensitivities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of 100, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The overall sensitivity and specificity for the assessment of zzso 1, 2 and 3 were 64 and zzso zzso
