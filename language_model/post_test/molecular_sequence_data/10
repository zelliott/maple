To efficiently zzso the biological roles of zzso zzso we developed zzso zzso zzso display to identify zzso zzso The procedure of zzso panning was zzso with a zzso clone expressing zzso a well-known zzso zzso Three rounds of zzso panning with zzso zzso display zzso library resulted in approximately zzso enrichment in zzso zzso A total of 17 zzso zzso clones were zzso Unlike zzso display with conventional zzso libraries, all 17 zzso clones were zzso zzso 13 real zzso zzso analysis revealed that all identified zzso zzso clones had zzso basic zzso acid zzso zzso fusion proteins were expressed for 3 zzso proteins and verified for their binding activity to zzso zzso but not zzso zzso These results zzso previously unknown zzso proteins and demonstrated that zzso zzso display is a versatile technology capable of efficiently identifying binding proteins for zzso molecules like zzso
