zzso zzso type I is an zzso iron overload disease associated with a zzso in zzso zzso The most common zzso zzso zzso the zzso bond necessary for the association of zzso with zzso and abrogates cell surface zzso zzso zzso mice develop iron overload indicating a central role of the protein in the zzso of zzso zzso type zzso However, despite significant effort, the role of the zzso protein in iron metabolism is still zzso To shed a light on the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso we studied protein expression changes zzso by zzso in the liver which is the organ critical for the regulation of iron zzso We undertook a zzso study comparing protein expression in the liver of zzso deficient mice with control zzso We compared zzso animals with control animals with identical iron levels obtained by dietary treatment to identify changes specific to zzso zzso rather than iron zzso We found 11 proteins that were zzso expressed in the zzso liver using two-dimensional zzso and mass zzso zzso Of particular interest were urinary proteins 1, 2 and 6, zzso zzso zzso binding protein 2, zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Our data suggest possible involvement of zzso zzso signaling and zzso alpha regulatory zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and suggest future targeted research addressing the roles of the identified candidate genes in the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso
