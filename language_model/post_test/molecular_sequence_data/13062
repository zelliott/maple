The zzso acid sequences of all known zzso zzso zzso contain internally zzso repeats (a and b) that are zzso zzso in length and are arranged in tandem within the putative zzso zzso In the bovine lung zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso these repeats span zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso that is zzso in repeats a and b of all known zzso zzso was changed to zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and wild type zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso bovine lung zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed identical zzso zzso with approximately zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed decreased affinity for zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and the zzso zzso showed increased affinity for zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso as compared to zzso and native zzso zzso and native zzso displayed an identical zzso profile of zzso zzso which was consistent with the presence of distinct slowly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sites of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso displayed a single zzso zzso zzso zzso which was similar to the calculated zzso for the fast site of zzso and native zzso and the zzso zzso displayed a single zzso zzso zzso zzso which was similar to that calculated for the slow site of zzso and native zzso These results were consistent with the loss of a slow zzso site in repeat a of the zzso zzso zzso and the loss of a fast site in repeat b of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso possesses two distinct zzso sites located at repeats a and zzso with the zzso zzso acid being crucial for interaction with zzso at each zzso
