To investigate the reading properties of zzso in the zzso position we have used zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso gene to substitute the zzso A in the zzso position of the corresponding zzso The effect of this change on the ability of the zzso to discriminate between the zzso in the third position of the zzso zzso has been zzso We have compared the ability of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the mycoplasma zzso zzso to read the zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso did not fully discriminate between the zzso zzso These experiments were carried out using a new in zzso protein zzso system that allows us to monitor the reading of all four zzso zzso In the present paper we give a detailed description of this new in zzso zzso
