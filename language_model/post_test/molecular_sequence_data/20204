A critical evolutionary step during rice zzso was the elimination of seed zzso Wild rice zzso seeds freely at maturity to guarantee the zzso while cultivated rice retains seeds on the zzso to make easy harvest and decrease the loss of zzso The molecular basis for this key event during rice zzso remains to be zzso Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso was mapped to a zzso zzso zzso fragment, which contains a single open reading frame, using a zzso population between cultivated rice zzso and an zzso line zzso with the seed shattering habit derived from perennial common wild rice, zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso in zzso and zzso is distinguished from that in eight zzso rice zzso including zzso by only a single zzso acid substitution zzso caused by a single zzso change zzso Further sequence zzso on the zzso zzso site revealed that the zzso zzso is present in all the zzso rice zzso including 92 zzso and 108 zzso zzso but not in any of the 24 wild rice zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso in zzso accounts for the elimination of seed zzso and that all the zzso rice zzso harbor the zzso zzso gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at zzso In addition, our data support the theory that the zzso trait selection during rice zzso occurred prior to the zzso differentiation in rice evolutionary zzso
