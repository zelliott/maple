zzso zzso length zzso zzso DNA zzso was investigated as a tool for fast and accurate identification of zzso acid bacteria zzso to the species zzso One hundred and thirty five reference strains and 15 additional zzso representing 50 recognized species of the family zzso were subjected to zzso analysis using the restriction zzso combination zzso and the primer combination zzso The reference strains had been previously subjected to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso region gene sequence analysis and were regarded as being accurately classified at the species zzso The present study revealed that six of these strains should be zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso DNA fingerprints of the reference strains revealed one cluster for each species, showing a linkage level below 50 % with other zzso except for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These three species were separated into two, two, and three zzso zzso At present, confusion exists regarding the zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso data from this study supported their zzso as separate zzso The 15 additional strains could all be identified at the species zzso zzso analysis further revealed that some species zzso genetically diverse zzso whereas other species consisted of strains showing similar zzso patterns, indicating a more limited genetic zzso It can be concluded that zzso DNA zzso is suitable for accurate identification and zzso of a broad range of zzso as well as for the determination of zzso genetic zzso
