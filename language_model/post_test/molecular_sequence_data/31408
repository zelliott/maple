zzso the zzso of proteins is critical for an understanding of virtually all cellular zzso Current methods for measuring in zzso protein stability, including large-scale approaches, are limited in their zzso or in their ability to discriminate among small differences in zzso We developed a new method, zzso which uses a simple genetic selection combined with zzso DNA sequencing to assess the in zzso stability of a large number of zzso of a zzso The zzso are fused to a zzso zzso which here is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso fusion proteins are transformed into zzso with the zzso fusion proteins accumulating to different levels based on their stability and leading to different doubling times when the zzso are grown in the absence of zzso zzso of an input population of zzso of a protein and the population of zzso after zzso selection allows the stability of tens of thousands of zzso to be scored in zzso By applying the zzso method to zzso of the protein degradation signal zzso from the zzso zzso zzso we generated a high-resolution map that reveals the effect of zzso zzso on protein zzso We identified zzso that likely affect stability by changing the activity of the zzso by leading to translation from new start zzso or by affecting zzso zzso zzso should be zzso to other organisms via the use of suitable reporter zzso as well as to the analysis of complex zzso of fusion zzso
