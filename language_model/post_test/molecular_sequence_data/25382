A zzso zzso for cultured zzso cells was zzso from zzso zzso culture medium of a human zzso cancer cell line, zzso Based on zzso acid sequencing and estimated molecular weight, this zzso was identified as an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high molecular weight zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor domain zzso of zzso but not low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation and proliferation in zzso cells, and specific, competitive binding sites for zzso but not zzso zzso were zzso These studies demonstrate the production of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso by a human zzso cancer cell line which may be of importance in the zzso of zzso zzso
