The zzso zzso zzso system may play a crucial role in development of essential hypertension zzso zzso zzso zzso arteries and lowers blood pressure and zzso proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells via the type B zzso zzso zzso However, the association of the human zzso gene with zzso has not been zzso because little is known about the zzso organization of this zzso We designed zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence of the human zzso zzso and long-range zzso chain reaction zzso was zzso The amplified fragments were zzso directly, and the zzso organization of the human zzso gene was zzso The zzso which spans approximately zzso zzso is composed of 22 zzso and the zzso junctions follow the zzso zzso Seven hundred fifty base pairs of the zzso region were zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This region contains 10 potential zzso binding sites and lacks a zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso revealed the zzso start site at zzso zzso A zzso zzso repeat was identified with a zzso method and was converted to a zzso site zzso The zzso zzso repeat was localized to zzso 2 approximately 150 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were detected in both zzso patients and zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso linear zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso is associated significantly with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso The zzso frequency was zzso zzso for the zzso group and zzso zzso for the zzso group and differed significantly between the zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso The structural organization of the human zzso gene was determined, and a novel zzso repeat zzso which associated with zzso was zzso These results suggest that one cause of zzso is a zzso in this gene or a closely related gene or zzso
