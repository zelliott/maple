A zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence zzso zzso possesses a very high zzso activity, comparable to that of zzso both in the cellular and zzso immune zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso effective zzso zzso of zzso although its potency is weaker than that of zzso Replacement of each consecutive zzso with zzso in zzso allowed identification of essential zzso acids involved in the zzso We also evaluated the roles of its zzso and zzso groups by their zzso and/or zzso zzso The active sequence is located in the external loop of the zzso and therefore it may serve as an important functional zzso for zzso zzso Based on the crystal structure of zzso zzso we designed and zzso the zzso analogue with a restricted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by reacting the zzso zzso side chain with the zzso zzso The zzso was designed to mimic the zzso loop, in order to obtain the zzso that may interact with hypothetical receptors of the zzso The zzso product selectively but strongly suppresses the cellular immune zzso The results indicate that the zzso loop may serve as an important functional zzso in the zzso zzso for zzso zzso
