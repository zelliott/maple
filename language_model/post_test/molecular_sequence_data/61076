Analysis of zzso zzso zzso 3, and comparison with zzso 2, highlights novel features of zzso organization and gene zzso The zzso regions of zzso 3 show a zzso order of features, including repetitive DNA zzso members of zzso families involved in zzso and zzso variation, a number of zzso zzso and several genes of unknown zzso A putative zzso has been identified that has a core region of about 2 zzso with an extremely high zzso + zzso composition and zzso of tandem zzso We have predicted 215 zzso genes and two transfer zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso genes can be divided into three main zzso zzso are not zzso zzso have a large zzso with short additional zzso or 3' zzso and zzso have a multiple zzso structure more typical of higher zzso
