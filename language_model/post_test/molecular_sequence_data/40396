Three strains of zzso zzso acid bacteria were isolated from flowers in South zzso The zzso formed a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso group, closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso according to zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that the three strains belonged to the same zzso and formed a genetically distinct group, well separated from their zzso zzso The three strains produced acids from only two of the 49 carbohydrates tested, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was more rapidly fermented than zzso Good growth was recorded on zzso or zzso in the presence of external electron zzso However, delayed growth was recorded on zzso without electron zzso The novel strains produced zzso acid, ethanol and zzso acid from zzso at a ratio of zzso These characteristics were distinct from other species of the zzso zzso Based on the data zzso the three zzso represent a zzso and novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
