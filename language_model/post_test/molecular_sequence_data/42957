The zzso diseases zzso and tuberculosis zzso and the zzso are characterized by a wide spectrum of disease zzso and by the fact that the majority of individuals exposed to the zzso organisms zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso become infected but do not present with clinical zzso In order to determine whether a human zzso to the zzso zzso resistance gene zzso influences zzso to human disease, zzso families for all three diseases have been collected, and linkage analysis performed using a panel of markers in the region of human zzso zzso known to be zzso with the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso Because of the paucity of available zzso zzso information for zzso data from 35 zzso zzso zzso and visceral zzso families zzso zzso were first pooled to produce a detailed zzso map of the zzso Peak zzso scores well in excess of 3 were observed for linkage between adjacent pairs of a more zzso zzso set of markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and between adjacent pairs of a more zzso zzso set zzso zzso and zzso These peak zzso scores and the corresponding values for zzso were used in the zzso program to generate a multiple zzso map with gene zzso intervals zzso of: zzso zzso zzso Although local support for the placement of zzso in this order was weak zzso zzso 2, except for zzso where zzso zzso zzso the map is consistent with the gene order for those zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously mapped in the zzso Data from 17 zzso zzso families zzso zzso were further zzso for linkage between a putative disease zzso locus zzso controlling zzso to zzso per zzso and each of the marker zzso Assuming zzso zzso for the zzso zzso no positive zzso score was obtained for linkage between the zzso and any of the marker zzso Instead, the data provide convincing evidence zzso scores zzso zzso that a zzso does not fall within zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or within zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso This effectively excludes a putative zzso controlling zzso to zzso per zzso from the entire region zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
