To study self zzso a transgenic mouse model has been established in which the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso insulin promoter zzso These mice zzso do not spontaneously develop zzso however, infection with the zzso strain WE rapidly zzso zzso In this study, comparative analysis of zzso zzso animals demonstrated that the zzso influences the zzso and zzso of diabetes and alters the requirement for the zzso T cell zzso This study also showed that the properties of the virus expressing the self target zzso determined whether zzso occurred in zzso zzso Various zzso strains were able to induce diabetes in zzso animals, whereas infection with a zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso did not induce zzso However, zzso could induce diabetes in double zzso mice, where the majority of zzso T cells expressed a zzso specific for zzso suggesting that a critical number of zzso T cells must be activated to induce zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso taken various days after zzso or zzso infections indicated that induction of diabetes coincided with an increase in zzso class I expression on the zzso of zzso Additional studies with zzso were done to determine other factors that possibly enhance zzso zzso zzso mice expressing both zzso and zzso under the control of the zzso were infected with zzso and 50% of zzso animals became zzso These data suggest that the increased local zzso traffic as a result of zzso expression attracts activated zzso T cells, enhancing the possibility of zzso zzso these results demonstrate that the induction of diabetes in this model is influenced by the zzso zzso the infectious agent, zzso zzso the level of zzso class I zzso and the induction of a threshold number of zzso zzso
