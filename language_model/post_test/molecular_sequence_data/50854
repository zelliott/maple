Two zzso peptides were isolated in pure form from an extract of the brain of the European green frog, zzso zzso The primary structure of the most abundant component was identical to that of zzso zzso The primary structure of the second zzso present in approximately zzso of the abundance of zzso was established as zzso This sequence shows two zzso zzso for zzso and Met for zzso compared with zzso zzso The data provide evidence for a zzso gene family in zzso as well as in zzso zzso
