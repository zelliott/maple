The zzso gene family zzso is the largest zzso group of zzso genes within the human zzso and is associated with both risk and outcome of cancer and other zzso We searched for copy number zzso in all zzso genes using quantitative zzso analysis and analysis of inheritance patterns of single zzso zzso Two deletions were zzso one zzso deletion in zzso present in zzso of zzso and one zzso deletion in zzso present in zzso of zzso Each deletion eliminated one complete zzso and created zzso coding that eliminated the zzso zzso of the resulting truncated gene product, which therefore likely is a zzso zzso zzso zzso identified by DNA sequencing located the zzso deletion zzso to a long zzso element zzso repeated zzso while the deletion in zzso is located in a single copy zzso To search for an association between each deletion and risk of prostate cancer zzso we analyzed a cohort of zzso zzso men zzso PC cases and 401 men with no evidence of PC at zzso using short zzso zzso zzso There was no association between evidence of PC in this cohort and the presence of either gene zzso zzso revealed a single origin of each zzso with most recent common zzso estimates of zzso and zzso zzso years for the deletions in zzso and zzso zzso The presence of the deletions on the same zzso in 1000 zzso data of both European and African populations indicate an early origin of both zzso The old age in combination with zzso presence of zzso zzso suggests that some zzso zzso have zzso zzso
