zzso models of the variable zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso which has higher affinity to the zzso zzso were constructed by zzso model building using known structures of highly zzso zzso as zzso zzso dynamics simulations were used to dock the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is predicted to bind to slightly different sites in the two zzso zzso concerning the role of a number of preferred zzso in zzso zzso are zzso These can be tested by zzso and zzso In particular, the higher binding affinities of the different zzso zzso are shown to correlate with better zzso of zzso The molecular dynamic simulations also suggest that two mobile zzso at the mouth of the pocket may play an important role in the binding of zzso
