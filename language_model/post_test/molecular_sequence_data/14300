Despite overwhelming interest in the impact exerted by zzso during evolution of zzso zzso the relative contribution of the polarity of zzso templates remains poorly zzso Here, by zzso zzso zzso leaves, we show that zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso is competent to initiate zzso zzso synthesis on an zzso expressed zzso negative strand zzso zzso and faithfully complete the replication zzso zzso we sought to examine the role of zzso polarity in zzso zzso by expressing a series of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of progeny sequences revealed that the genetic makeup of the primary zzso pool is determined by the polarity of the zzso zzso When the polarity of the zzso template was zzso the zzso pool that accumulated during early zzso of replication was a mixture of zzso zzso These are longer than the zzso template zzso and a nascent 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso was added to the input zzso zzso 3' zzso due to zzso template switching by zzso zzso during zzso zzso In contrast, when the polarity of the zzso was zzso the progeny contained a pool of zzso zzso zzso generated by template switching of zzso zzso with a nascent zzso from zzso zzso or zzso during zzso zzso zzso of a point zzso caused by zzso error occurred only when the polarity of the zzso template was zzso These results contribute to the explanation of the functional role of zzso polarity in zzso zzso by copy choice zzso
