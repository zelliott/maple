zzso DNA zzso the outer surface zzso A zzso of zzso zzso under the control of either strong zzso or its own bacterial promoter was injected zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T helper 1 cells zzso were induced only with those plasmids containing the zzso structural gene including its own regulatory control region immediately zzso In the absence of the zzso promoter, no or only marginal immune responses to zzso were zzso even when strong zzso zzso elements were zzso Together with the finding that the zzso promoter is active in a mouse zzso line, the data suggest that zzso are able to express at least part of their genes in the zzso zzso Mice previously vaccinated with the relevant zzso zzso DNA were protected against subsequent experimental challenge with a virulent strain of zzso zzso as measured by the appearance of zzso to a prominent protective zzso zzso and the failure to zzso zzso from ear zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso mice could be protected against infection by passive transfer of immune zzso from zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained after repeated zzso persisted for 200 days and zzso This simple procedure of zzso using zzso DNA consisting of a zzso gene under the control of its own promoter holds great promise for the development of alternative zzso vaccines against bacterial infections, including zzso zzso In addition, the availability of this novel zzso promoter element now allows the study of the basis for the differential expression of bacterial genes in zzso and zzso zzso
