Recently, a unique case of zzso at a social level was reported in local populations of the desert zzso zzso Queens mate with males originating from a different genetic lineage than their own to produce hybrid workers, but they use zzso for the production of zzso offspring zzso and zzso As a result, zzso workers are all zzso hybrids, whereas the sexual line is purely zzso Here, we show that this zzso zzso system occurs in all populations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso workers are hybrids of the same two genetic lineages along a 400 zzso zzso crossing the whole distribution range of the zzso These results indicate that social zzso in zzso zzso allows their maintenance over time and across a large geographical scale of two highly divergent genetic zzso despite their constant zzso The widespread distribution of social zzso in zzso zzso supports that this zzso strategy has been zzso zzso over a long zzso
