In zzso zzso coli, zzso toxin is produced by zzso zzso We have isolated the zzso zzso that is responsible for production of zzso toxin type 2 zzso and determined the complete zzso sequence of this zzso zzso The entire DNA sequence consisted of zzso zzso exhibiting marked similarity to the zzso zzso zzso However, several differences were observed in the immunity and replication regions, where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O, and P genes were present: zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso O and P in the zzso zzso did not show significant similarity to the counterparts of the zzso zzso however its zzso showed higher similarity to zzso Furthermore, O and P closely resembled those of zzso zzso These observations suggest that the various degrees of zzso observed in the immunity and replication regions of zzso could have resulted from frequent zzso events among the zzso zzso and that these regions play a key role as a functional unit for zzso propagation in competition with other zzso zzso
