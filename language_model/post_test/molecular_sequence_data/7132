We expressed the cloned zzso zzso zzso in high abundance zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso tag zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was similar to the zzso zzso R zzso binding and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso the labeled zzso was shown to be largely confined to the plasma zzso zzso with zzso failed to affect the cellular distribution of the zzso as judged by zzso and zzso binding zzso In contrast, exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused strong labeling of zzso zzso indicating extensive zzso cellular zzso of zzso zzso binding studies suggested partial net zzso and a small degree of zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a prominent band at approximately 70 zzso with weaker bands at approximately 65 zzso zzso was labeled with zzso in zzso cells, zzso and analyzed by zzso gel zzso zzso A prominent band at zzso zzso indicated the presence of zzso zzso zzso occurring in the absence of zzso which was enhanced approximately zzso with the addition of zzso In conclusion, zzso trafficking of the zzso appears to depend on the zzso with zzso and zzso having markedly different zzso Unlike other G zzso zzso zzso zzso is substantial, even in the absence of zzso
