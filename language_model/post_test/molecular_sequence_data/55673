zzso of some members of the zzso gene family, including zzso leads to transformation of established zzso zzso We have previously shown that transformation by zzso requires the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report that transformation by zzso also requires an intact zzso domain composed of the functionally zzso basic region and zzso zzso as well as sequences present in the N zzso that serve a regulatory zzso zzso of the zzso sequences results in proteins impaired in zzso zzso and zzso This region does not itself function as a zzso zzso domain but instead regulates the zzso functions present in the zzso zzso The requirement for this zzso region can be abolished by the presence of a strong zzso zzso zzso The primary sequence of the region that we have defined is highly zzso in the zzso family of zzso suggesting functional zzso
