zzso zzso zzso the last step in the zzso of stored zzso in the zzso and presumably also zzso the action of zzso zzso in degrading zzso from zzso and very low density zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a mouse zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence consisted of zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a molecular weight of zzso The sequence showed no extensive zzso to other known zzso zzso but a number of microbial zzso including two bacterial zzso and a family of zzso were found to be zzso related to this zzso By means of multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure zzso the structural elements in zzso zzso as well as the putative zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of the proposed zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso is zzso expressed among zzso with a transcript size of about 4 zzso
