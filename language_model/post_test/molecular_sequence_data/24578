The zzso binding protein family zzso are zzso factors that play integral roles in the development and function of many organ systems, including zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso We have identified and characterized putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta using zzso zzso screening and computer searches of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and g were mapped within 1 zzso of each other on linkage group zzso 7, zzso with human zzso and G genes on zzso zzso zzso was mapped to zzso and zzso was mapped to zzso on the same LG as a recently identified unique zzso in zzso zzso The mapping of these genes established new zzso relationships between zzso and human zzso 20, extended existing zzso between zzso and human zzso 19, and confirmed the zzso between zzso and human zzso zzso In addition, these zzso between zzso and human zzso are also zzso in the mouse zzso To characterize the expression of these zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso of wild type and a zzso zzso zzso was zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and d were expressed in many embryonic zzso zzso and b were expressed in a subset of zzso cells in a region consistent with zzso zzso In addition, there was expression of zzso and b in the liver and zzso zzso and d in regions of the gastrointestinal zzso The expression of the zzso may serve as important markers for analysis of zzso zzso development, and other zzso processes in the zzso
