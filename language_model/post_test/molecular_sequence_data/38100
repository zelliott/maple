zzso protein zzso is a naturally occurring zzso of zzso zzso It is expressed mainly in the zzso nucleus where it plays an important role in the zzso control of feeding and energy zzso by antagonism of central zzso 4 receptors in zzso Besides in the brain, the zzso 4 zzso is expressed in numerous peripheral zzso in the zzso To examine whether or not the peripheral zzso 4 zzso signaling could be regulated by zzso we cloned and localized the expression of the zzso gene in the zzso The chicken zzso gene was found to zzso a 154 or 165 zzso acid zzso depending on the usage of two alternative translation initiation zzso The coding sequence consisted of three zzso like that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of the predicted zzso displayed high levels of identity to zzso counterparts zzso and all 10 zzso zzso zzso functional zzso of zzso were zzso however, other regions showed apparently no zzso suggesting that biological activities of zzso are located in its zzso zzso zzso analysis detected the zzso zzso in all zzso zzso the brain, adrenal zzso heart, liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle and zzso zzso Interestingly, the skin also expressed the zzso zzso where zzso another zzso zzso zzso regulating hair zzso is expressed in zzso Most of those zzso zzso have been demonstrated to express zzso 4 receptors and/or other zzso of zzso zzso whose zzso counterparts can bind zzso These results imply the possibility that some peripheral zzso systems could be regulated by the functional interaction between zzso and zzso at zzso receptors in the zzso
