In the course of zzso zzso zzso certain zzso acid zzso in zzso interact with counterparts in zzso to produce the zzso changes that zzso muscle zzso some of these interactions are zzso but the stronger interactions are zzso In an effort to identify zzso zzso participating in zzso zzso zzso (from smooth zzso fragments with zzso at suspected sites were engineered and compared with zzso zzso It was found that the zzso of doubly zzso zzso and zzso fragments was minimally activated by zzso and did not decorate zzso well to form the regular zzso pattern characteristic of zzso binding to zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso and zzso are important participants in the zzso zzso zzso
