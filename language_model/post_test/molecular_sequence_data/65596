Human zzso 8 zzso is the zzso agent of zzso zzso We present a zzso map of 85 zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso open reading frames were cloned with a zzso tag in expression zzso confirmed by full-length sequencing, and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso Fifty-one percent of all proteins were localized in the zzso zzso were in the nucleus, and zzso were found in both zzso Surprisingly, we detected viral zzso zzso in the nucleus and in the zzso whereas cellular zzso are generally localized exclusively in the zzso This suggested that zzso may exert additional or alternative functions compared to cellular zzso In addition, it has been shown recently that the zzso protein can bind to at least 15 different zzso zzso We noticed that zzso and only five of its 15 putative binding factors were localized in the nucleus when the proteins were expressed in zzso cells zzso Interestingly, in zzso experiments zzso zzso with zzso (13 of zzso of its putative binding zzso zzso was induced by zzso of either zzso alone or both zzso These results indicate active zzso zzso processes in zzso zzso zzso in this zzso the zzso map may provide a useful reference to further zzso the function of zzso genes in human zzso
