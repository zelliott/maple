zzso zzso zzso systems regulate key cellular processes to promote cell survival during periods of zzso During zzso cell growth, zzso typically interact with their zzso toxins to inhibit activity presumably by preventing zzso zzso We solved two zzso crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex and found that, unlike most other zzso systems, the antitoxin zzso makes minimal interactions with toxin zzso zzso adopts a zzso family zzso fold containing a highly zzso zzso surface where we predict its active site is zzso zzso does not cover the zzso zzso active site, suggesting that, in general, toxin zzso is not solely zzso by active site hindrance by its zzso Each zzso zzso contains a zzso motif that binds to its own DNA operator to repress zzso during normal cellular zzso This is distinct from zzso belonging to other zzso that typically only form zzso motifs upon zzso We further show that disruption of the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso operator zzso Taken together, our zzso and structural studies zzso the novel molecular details of the zzso zzso zzso
