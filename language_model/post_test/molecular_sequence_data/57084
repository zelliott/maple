A family of six specific zzso growth factor binding proteins zzso zzso the biological actions of the zzso growth factors, zzso and zzso In the present study, we determined the binding affinity of zzso human zzso zzso for zzso human zzso zzso whose binding to zzso zzso zzso and insulin receptors was previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the regions zzso the most important zzso of zzso binding to the zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the analogous zzso from human insulin zzso reduced binding to zzso zzso and zzso more than zzso and to zzso by zzso binding to zzso and zzso was reduced zzso The same substitution markedly reduced binding to the zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso or insulin zzso Although substitution of zzso 54 and 55 with the analogous zzso from zzso zzso abolished binding to the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was not substantially zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso which decreased binding to the zzso and insulin zzso reduced binding to zzso and zzso up to zzso but had lesser effects on the other zzso zzso and zzso which had a more markedly reduced affinity for the zzso and insulin receptors than did zzso were bound by the zzso with relatively unchanged affinity compared with zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso binding to zzso partially overlap those for the zzso zzso zzso and overlap those for the zzso zzso to a lesser zzso zzso and zzso are most sensitive to changes in zzso structure, although zzso binds zzso and zzso with equal zzso whereas zzso has a marked preferential binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso with selective impairment in recognition by specific zzso or receptors will provide a useful tool for zzso the role of the different zzso binding zzso in the mediation of zzso zzso
