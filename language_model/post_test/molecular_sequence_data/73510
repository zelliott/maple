We expressed the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso expression system in insect zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso domain zzso zzso which is zzso identical to a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the appearance of zzso zzso protein apparently due to incorrect zzso The longer zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which shares zzso identity with zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a soluble zzso During zzso this protein was released from cells to the culture medium and was zzso from the culture medium by zzso affinity zzso followed by zzso on a zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso domain bears a folate binding site, possesses zzso zzso activity, and exists as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that native zzso bound both the zzso of the reaction, zzso zzso and the product of the reaction, zzso with the same affinities as its zzso domain did and that both proteins bound the zzso with a zzso higher affinity than the zzso Neither the zzso domain nor its mixture with the previously zzso zzso domain had zzso zzso zzso zzso of complexes between the zzso and zzso zzso also was not zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso activity of zzso is a result of the action of the zzso zzso zzso center residing in the zzso domain on the zzso bound in the zzso domain and that the intermediate domain is necessary to bring the two functional zzso together in the correct zzso
