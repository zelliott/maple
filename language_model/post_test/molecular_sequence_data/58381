Assembly of the T4 zzso zzso requires coordinated interactions among the core zzso and the clamp zzso zzso and sliding clamp zzso accessory zzso Here we describe the creation of a zzso of zzso that can be uniquely modified by fluorescent zzso within each protein zzso at a zzso zzso zzso The zzso labeled zzso was shown to have the same biological activity as the zzso zzso These strike zzso zzso zzso were then used in zzso and zzso polarization studies to monitor the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso complex and zzso DNA in the presence and absence of zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that a complex of zzso zzso with appropriately labeled zzso shows significant fluorescent enhancement (and an increase in fluorescent zzso that can be partially reversed by interaction with zzso zzso zzso binding zzso between zzso and zzso zzso reveal that the two protein complexes bind with a zzso zzso Analysis shows that these methods can be used to follow the zzso loading of zzso onto the zzso by the zzso zzso complex, and in combination with the kinetic data presented in the companion article, provide insight into the zzso steps during clamp assembly on zzso zzso A reaction zzso for this zzso zzso process is zzso
