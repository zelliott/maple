The 1918 zzso influenza pandemic represents the largest recorded outbreak of any infectious zzso The crystal structure of the zzso precursor of the major surface zzso of the extinct 1918 virus was determined at zzso zzso resolution after zzso of the zzso gene from viral zzso fragments preserved in 1918 zzso lung zzso A narrow zzso zzso site, two previously zzso zzso patches, and a less exposed surface loop at the zzso site that activates viral membrane fusion reveal structural features primarily found in avian zzso which may have contributed to the extraordinarily high zzso and mortality rates observed during zzso
