AIDS vaccine and zzso research will benefit from a more diverse array of cloned zzso challenge stocks from which to zzso Toward this end, 20 envelope genes were cloned from an extensively used, primary stock of zzso zzso Each of the 20 clones had a unique zzso Their translated sequences differed by as many as 26 zzso acids from one another and by as many as 45 zzso acids from the commonly used clone zzso zzso sequences up to and including the zzso domain were exchanged into the infectious zzso zzso clone and virus stocks were produced by zzso cell zzso zzso of the 20 zzso were replication zzso The zzso per zzso zzso of the 17 new zzso zzso in zzso cells and in zzso cells ranged from minus zzso to plus zzso relative to zzso A range of sensitivities to zzso by zzso and by zzso from zzso zzso was observed but none was as sensitive to these zzso agents as zzso the highly zzso zzso of zzso Four strains that were most sensitive to zzso zzso were also among the most sensitive to zzso zzso None of the new zzso viruses zzso as well as zzso in primary zzso zzso cultures from zzso monkeys but three of the strains did exhibit significant levels of delayed replication in these primary zzso reaching peak levels of virus production of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso with zzso These new zzso clones are being contributed to the zzso AIDS zzso zzso and are available to the scientific zzso
