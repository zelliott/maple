The human zzso virus zzso envelope zzso is zzso as a precursor zzso and subsequently zzso to generate the external zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso have been demonstrated to mediate critical functions of zzso including viral attachment and fusion with the cell zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso envelope zzso has presented a significant problem in the design of appropriate and successful vaccines and offers one explanation for the ability of zzso to evade immune zzso zzso the development and characterization of functional zzso against zzso regions of the envelope zzso is zzso Because of this need, we generated a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso envelope zzso To accomplish this, we zzso zzso mice with a zzso zzso 160 zzso that was zzso in a zzso expression zzso From the zzso zzso three zzso were generated that demonstrated significant zzso with zzso zzso but failed to show zzso against zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso that zzso zzso truncated zzso of zzso we were able to map zzso of all three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the first 204 zzso of zzso zzso the N zzso of zzso via Western zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for these zzso may have important implications for zzso of infection by zzso Our initial attempts to map these zzso with linear zzso have not zzso a specific zzso zzso however, several physical characteristics have been determined that suggest a continuous surface zzso Although these zzso failed to neutralize zzso or zzso infection by zzso they did mediate significant zzso cellular zzso zzso activity, indicating potential therapeutic zzso In zzso these data suggest the identification of a potentially novel site in the first 200 zzso of zzso that mediates zzso
