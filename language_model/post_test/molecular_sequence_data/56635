zzso growth factor zzso is a single chain, zzso acid, zzso hormone, which is essential to the process of growth and differentiation in higher zzso zzso exhibits a very high degree of conservation throughout zzso evolution, and recent studies in fish have shown improved rates of growth in zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a role for this hormone in fish similar to that in zzso This paper reports the identification and sequencing of four different zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The different zzso all contain sequences that zzso an identical mature zzso zzso The differences between the four zzso are of two zzso 1) single zzso changes and 2) additional blocks of sequence occurring at one site within the zzso regions of three of the four zzso The sequence data indicate that each of the zzso identified was transcribed from a different zzso zzso and analysis of the zzso salmon zzso by Southern zzso supports the existence of four distinct zzso genes and suggests that there are at least two zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of total zzso from zzso liver identifies only a single major transcript of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis suggests the presence of two structurally different zzso zzso genes with the potential for multiple zzso alternatives of the zzso zzso
