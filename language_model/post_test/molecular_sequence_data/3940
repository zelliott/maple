zzso proteins zzso are zzso animal zzso that recognize high zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso zzso bind to their zzso zzso by forming a series of zzso coordination and hydrogen bonds with two zzso groups equivalent to the 3- and zzso of zzso In this work, the zzso of the orientation of zzso bound to rat serum and liver zzso zzso and zzso have been systematically zzso The crystal structures of zzso soaked with zzso and zzso and also the structure of the zzso zzso zzso by a high zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso or zzso zzso bind to zzso in one orientation, whereas zzso or zzso zzso binds in an orientation rotated 180 degrees around a local symmetry axis relating the 3- and zzso zzso In contrast, a similar set of zzso all bind to zzso in a single zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to its zzso zzso zzso causes Man alpha zzso to bind in a mixture of zzso These data combined with modeling indicate that the zzso at this position influences the orientation of bound zzso in zzso We propose that the control of binding orientation can influence the recognition of zzso zzso A lateral association of zzso in the zzso zzso may reflect interactions within higher zzso of zzso that are stabilized by zzso zzso
