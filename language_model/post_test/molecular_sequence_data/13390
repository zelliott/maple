The New World zzso zzso zzso zzso originated through zzso of ancestral zzso species that presently have zzso ranges in zzso (the zzso and the American zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso analysis of sequence data from the zzso DNA internal transcribed zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals two strongly supported zzso one corresponding to African species and the other containing all American zzso species except zzso zzso which occupies a zzso position within the African zzso This placement conflicts with evidence from fertility zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso restriction site analysis, which specify a zzso relationship for zzso zzso and zzso zzso deeply embedded within the American zzso zzso Several alternative explanations for this striking zzso are zzso The most probable zzso zzso an ancient zzso event, zzso zzso zzso experienced contact with an zzso either at the zzso level or at the zzso level as a consequence of zzso with a New World zzso and zzso repeated zzso of the hybrid into the zzso zzso zzso thereby restoring a nearly pure zzso but in the process generating a zzso zzso zzso We suggest that this process may zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso as the closest living descendant of the ancestral zzso parent of the zzso In addition, this example of zzso zzso zzso between species groups now occupying different zzso illustrates how ITS data may provide insights into zzso composition and evolutionary history, especially when used in the context of a holistic view that encompasses information from a variety of zzso
