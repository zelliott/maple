The zzso in liver cancer one zzso tumor zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso gene has multiple zzso zzso and we have previously established a mouse strain containing a gene trap zzso zzso which specifically reduces the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene trapped zzso when zzso results in embryonic zzso and the zzso gene trapped mice do not show an increased zzso of zzso suggesting that cooperating zzso changes may be required for zzso In the present work, we have studied the in zzso cooperation between zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso We have observed an increase in invasive zzso zzso including both zzso and zzso resulting in significantly shortened life spans in mice zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso only zzso The zzso mice showed a high degree of zzso in the zzso We have found zzso specific selective zzso of the zzso zzso 2 promoter and reduction of the corresponding protein expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso The zzso deficient zzso zzso cell lines exhibited increased zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines also exhibited increased stress fiber formation and zzso zzso Introduction of the three zzso zzso zzso with zzso into these cells resulted in different zzso zzso These results suggest that loss of expression of only zzso 2 may be sufficient for the development of zzso tumors and zzso
