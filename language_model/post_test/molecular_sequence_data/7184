zzso tail removal is a critical first step in the zzso zzso for many zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rates can be regulated by zzso sequences within the transcribed portion of zzso which in turn control zzso turnover zzso The zzso element zzso found in the 3' untranslated regions of many highly zzso zzso zzso is a well-established example of this type of zzso It represents the most widespread zzso stability zzso among those characterized in zzso zzso Here, we report that two structurally different zzso the zzso ARE and the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso both direct rapid zzso as the first step in zzso degradation, but by different zzso For zzso zzso the zzso population zzso zzso zzso zzso and is zzso at the same rate, zzso the action of zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, the population of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is zzso zzso with the formation of fully zzso zzso consistent with the action of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso An important general implication of this finding is that different zzso elements direct zzso either by modulating the zzso at which a single zzso functions or by recruiting zzso distinct zzso We have also employed targeted zzso of translation initiation to demonstrate that the zzso function of both zzso can be zzso from translation by zzso In addition, a blockade of ongoing zzso has been used to further probe the functional similarities and distinctions of these two zzso Our data suggest that the two zzso are targets of two distinct zzso zzso zzso A general model for zzso zzso degradation involving a potential role for certain zzso nuclear zzso and zzso proteins is zzso
