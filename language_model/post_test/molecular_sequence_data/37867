zzso of the plant protein zzso zzso leads to a zzso switch between shoot growth and the development of flower structures zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso to zzso A zzso This structure confirms the zzso proteins as a subset of the family of zzso proteins zzso as predicted from sequence zzso zzso forms of zzso have been found to act as zzso of zzso zzso zzso a central zzso cascade regulating cell zzso zzso and zzso proteins share a similar zzso dominated by a large central zzso The strong conservation of a binding pocket at one end of this sheet which is capable of binding zzso zzso suggests the biological effects of zzso like zzso arise from the ability of this region to form complexes with zzso zzso hence interfering with zzso and their zzso
