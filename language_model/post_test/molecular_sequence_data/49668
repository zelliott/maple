In bacteria, the first reaction of the zzso zzso zzso involves the conversion of zzso and zzso to zzso by the action of zzso zzso which is composed of the alpha zzso gene zzso and beta zzso gene zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso gene zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was interrupted by a zzso cassette by zzso zzso The zzso double zzso zzso was not able to grow on solid or in liquid zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso when zzso or zzso was added to the media, therefore showing that disruption of the zzso zzso zzso gene resulted in zzso zzso The authors have also characterized a second zzso marker that allows the construction of a zzso zzso zzso coli shuttle zzso and the functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
