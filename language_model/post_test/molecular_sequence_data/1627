zzso is present in many zzso and can be used as an energy source by zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso Thus the zzso of zzso in comparison to zzso by zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria was investigated, using zzso cultures, zzso with activated zzso and molecular ecological zzso In batch enrichment cultures grown with zzso a population established in 2 weeks, which was dominated by zzso and zzso zzso as determined by zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments, with the zzso zzso targeting zzso probe zzso In other batch enrichment cultures using zzso the zzso population was assessed by zzso amplification, cloning and zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso While only one of the 48 zzso zzso gene clones could be identified as zzso zzso zzso the zzso approach revealed two more zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to be present in the zzso FISH analysis of the enrichment with probe zzso and newly designed zzso for a specific detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso related organisms, respectively, showed that zzso zzso zzso formed about 50% of the total bacterial zzso Also zzso zzso (about zzso of the total zzso and zzso zzso (about zzso of the total zzso were relatively zzso Additionally, continuous zzso were performed under oxygen zzso When zzso was the energy source, the community in this reactor consisted of zzso bacteria and zzso zzso with probe zzso As the zzso was changed to zzso zzso related to zzso zzso became the dominant zzso in this oxygen limited zzso This resulted in a direct conversion of zzso to zzso gas, without the addition of organic zzso
