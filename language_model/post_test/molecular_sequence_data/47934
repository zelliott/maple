The zzso zzso complex zzso in potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is largely associated with the membrane fraction of zzso zzso zzso whereas most of the other zzso acid cycle zzso are found in the soluble zzso zzso The zzso of zzso from either membrane or soluble zzso zzso resulted in the increasing dependence of its activity on the addition of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso to apparent zzso and with a specific activity of zzso zzso per zzso of protein in the presence of zzso added zzso was zzso zzso revealed that the zzso complex consisted of three major zzso with apparent molecular masses of 48, 50 and 105 zzso Before the zzso zzso step, zzso zzso of 57 and 58 zzso were identified by zzso as minor proteins associated with zzso The zzso sequence of the 57 zzso protein was identical with that previously zzso as the zzso component of the zzso zzso complex from zzso The 105 zzso protein was identified as the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the 50 and 48 zzso proteins shared zzso identity over 20 zzso and were identified by sequence similarity as zzso zzso zzso The incubation of zzso with zzso resulted in the zzso zzso of both the 48 and the 50 zzso protein zzso zzso previously reported as zzso of complex I of the respiratory chain from zzso zzso and zzso zzso are proposed to be zzso and the possible basis of this association is zzso
