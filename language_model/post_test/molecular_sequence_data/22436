A clear understanding of the dynamic events of zzso beta zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso would be of great significance in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso However, zzso of these zzso dynamic events is a difficult issue due to uncontrolled zzso which also poses a significant obstacle for establishing an experimental system that zzso the pathological function of zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso method, we zzso developed a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso for example, zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso group was introduced at the zzso group of zzso in zzso zzso zzso From the results, zzso the click zzso did not exhibit the zzso nature under zzso conditions due to one single modified zzso zzso zzso of the click zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso migration afforded the intact zzso with a quick and one-way conversion reaction zzso zzso while the click zzso was stable under zzso or storage zzso In addition, it is advantageous that no additional zzso zzso zzso were released during conversion to zzso This method provides a novel system useful for investigating the dynamic biological functions of zzso in zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso
