The fluorescent labeled zzso which contain zzso zzso zzso zzso at their zzso end were prepared by treating zzso bound zzso with zzso The hybrid formation of d zzso zzso with its complementary DNA was studied by zzso zzso The zzso of d zzso A in a single strand was largely zzso by stacking interaction with the base at 3' zzso When d zzso zzso zzso with their complementary zzso relative zzso quantum yields zzso against d zzso A changed in specific zzso These results suggest that d zzso zzso are zzso to study the local structure of DNA in zzso
