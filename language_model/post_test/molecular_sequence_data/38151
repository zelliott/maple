To zzso the molecular mechanism involved in the suppression of zzso and zzso scars by zzso we investigated the target protein of zzso in bovine skin and zzso A specific zzso protein was isolated from both zzso by drug affinity zzso and was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso seemed to be specific since zzso zzso could be zzso from the drug affinity column by zzso itself and also binding of zzso zzso to other zzso drugs zzso and zzso is significantly weaker than that to zzso Light and electron microscopic zzso detected the protein at the periphery of elastic fibers in normal human zzso In zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso was located on small zzso of zzso These findings provide support for the concept that zzso occurs in zzso tissue and zzso zzso might be one of the targets for zzso
