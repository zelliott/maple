In many zzso zzso modified zzso acids are important for biological zzso The zzso acid zzso acid zzso has been found only in three zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso family produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso produced by zzso zzso We studied the zzso zzso zzso genes involved in zzso zzso and the downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso predicted to zzso a zzso protein of unknown function, a zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced overall zzso yield and led to production of a series of novel zzso zzso containing zzso instead of zzso zzso by only zzso or its zzso zzso zzso zzso restored the zzso of the zzso compounds in the zzso Compared with zzso the zzso derivatives were less active against zzso zzso Further genetic analyses showed that members of the zzso locus zzso contributed to optimal zzso zzso deletion of zzso zzso or zzso genes reduced the yield significantly, while expression of zzso or zzso from the strong zzso promoter substantially increased zzso zzso The results indicate that these genes play important roles in the zzso of zzso and that zzso encodes a zzso zzso
