Although zzso to zzso and zzso are clinically zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not readily zzso A zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso was tested that makes use of two zzso zzso zzso at positions 1910 and zzso of zzso These zzso distinguish the gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Four primer sets that selectively amplified zzso and zzso from zzso DNA were zzso Two sets detected the zzso at zzso 1910 and two sets detected the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso results were compared among 64 zzso 

The zzso were specific for zzso and zzso when testing DNA for three donors of known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso results for the 1910 zzso were identical to the zzso results in all 64 subjects, but for the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso results were identical for only 49 zzso In 12 subjects with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in 2 with zzso and in 1 with zzso the zzso zzso was zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso does not always correlate with the zzso zzso zzso to the presence of an zzso zzso gene with a zzso zzso at 1910 and a zzso zzso at zzso The zzso zzso at zzso is silent and this zzso yields a zzso zzso Only analysis of the zzso zzso can be used to zzso zzso and zzso
