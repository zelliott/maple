zzso linear zzso zzso has been zzso as a zzso zzso for DNA sequencing by zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso gel stability have been overcome for the routine application of zzso to DNA zzso A simple zzso zzso zzso detection system based on a single laser and two zzso zzso has been adopted for this zzso zzso information for four bases has been obtained from two fluorescent zzso and two peak height ratios, detected in two optical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been chosen because both zzso are efficiently excited with a zzso zzso zzso laser, can be zzso zzso and exhibit minimal zzso shifts in DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso running buffer (1 zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso and column operation at 32 degrees C permitted the resolution of difficult compressed sites in the sequence of zzso zzso zzso examination of the zzso reaction of zzso has led to methodology that has proven to be zzso for obtaining DNA sequencing information of zzso zzso for 350 zzso in close to 30 zzso
