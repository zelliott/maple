We reported previously that more than one-third zzso of primary zzso zzso cell zzso zzso demonstrate diffuse zzso zzso independent of zzso This observation made us question whether zzso zzso in zzso zzso is due to human zzso zzso zzso 

To determine whether the presence of high-risk zzso zzso DNA could be detected in these tumor zzso 

Fourteen cases of primary zzso zzso which were positive for zzso by zzso were zzso for the detection of zzso by in zzso zzso and the signal amplification zzso zzso zzso positive for detection of zzso by zzso zzso were amplified by using zzso zzso zzso and amplification products were DNA zzso 

zzso of zzso by the in zzso zzso method was negative in all cases zzso of zzso However, in 3 of 14 cases zzso the presence of zzso DNA was detected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was followed by identification of zzso All positive cases were confirmed by using zzso zzso amplification followed by DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso included zzso 16 (2 zzso and zzso 35 (1 zzso 

zzso zzso DNA is zzso in a subset of primary zzso zzso Based on the well-documented zzso potential of zzso there is a necessity for additional studies to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso
