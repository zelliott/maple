zzso zzso of zzso virus 40 zzso are highly efficient gene delivery vehicles that zzso a broad range of cells and zzso To develop a controlled, cell zzso delivery system, we sought to display foreign peptides on the zzso surface by genetically manipulating the major zzso protein zzso Here we report the identification of two sites within the surface zzso of zzso that can accommodate foreign peptides in such a way that the foreign peptides are displayed on the surface of the zzso particles zzso without interfering with zzso assembly or the packaging of viral zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso motifs at these sites strongly inhibited cell attachment of zzso which normally associate with host cells through cell surface molecules such as major zzso complex zzso class I and zzso zzso Instead, zzso carrying the zzso motifs bound to zzso in zzso and to the cell surface in an zzso zzso Thus, zzso of foreign sequences into the surface zzso of zzso can reduce natural zzso interactions and even zzso an ability to bind to a new target zzso This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of this strategy for the development of novel delivery vehicles with different cell zzso
