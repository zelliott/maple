An zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso roots in zzso The zzso designated strain zzso was a strictly zzso zzso zzso The cell wall contained type zzso zzso with zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The major cellular zzso were zzso zzso zzso and unknown zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was 36 zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analyses showed that strain zzso formed a distinct zzso line within the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso zzso zzso similarities to other type strains were lower than zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular properties, the isolate represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
