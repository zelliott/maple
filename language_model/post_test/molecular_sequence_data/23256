zzso belongs to the zzso family of adapters and was identified as a negative regulator of insulin signal zzso Between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso is a new binding domain implicated in the interaction with zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso insulin zzso interaction zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso interact with the insulin zzso but their relative role varies considering the member of the zzso family and the zzso zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso is the main binding domain and is sufficient to inhibit the insulin zzso zzso zzso We have proposed, on the basis of zzso zzso that zzso lacks ordered structure and presents a high flexibility, although remaining fully zzso To complement this first study, we have used zzso zzso scattering in solution together with a modeling approach representing the zzso domain as a chain of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were also performed in the presence of variable amounts of zzso These zzso together with an ensemble of sequence analyses and previous zzso results, all support the view of zzso as essentially zzso but with a potentially structured short stretch encompassing zzso zzso This stretch, which may be only structured zzso in the isolated zzso could play a major role in zzso zzso binding to a biological partner by undergoing a structural zzso
