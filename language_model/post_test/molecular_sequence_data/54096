zzso quantitative trait zzso zzso underlying complex, zzso traits is notoriously zzso zzso for such traits, calving ease is an important breeding objective of cattle zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso underlying calving ease, we performed a zzso association study using estimated breeding values zzso as highly zzso zzso for paternal calving ease zzso and related zzso The zzso structured study population consisted of zzso bulls of the German zzso zzso zzso Two zzso regions on bovine zzso zzso 14 and 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified using principal components analysis to correct for population zzso The two most significantly associated zzso explain zzso of the zzso zzso Since marker zzso with negative effect on zzso have positive effects on zzso traits, the zzso may exert their effects on the zzso process through fetal growth zzso The zzso region on zzso zzso to a human zzso zzso region that is associated with growth zzso The zzso region corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso is zzso imprinted and involved in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso candidate genes on zzso revealed a highly significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated zzso zzso a zzso signal of the gene zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Our study demonstrates the leverage potential of zzso in unraveling the genetic architecture of lowly zzso zzso
