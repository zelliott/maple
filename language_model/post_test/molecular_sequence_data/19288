zzso zzso is the third most prevalent species of the zzso zzso complex zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso Its ability at fixing nitrogen makes it one of the main zzso species showing strong zzso with environmental zzso In this study, zzso (29 over zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the environmental ones (over 29) were found expressing the zzso complex zzso by the zzso zzso which is essential in zzso zzso Among the deficient zzso two were found growing with ammonium zzso suggesting that they were defective in zzso zzso and four with zzso acids supplements suggesting that they were zzso zzso zzso To get insights about the genetic events that led to the emergence of the zzso defective zzso a genetic analysis of zzso zzso zzso property was zzso A zzso zzso cluster and zzso regulatory genes were identified within the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso genetic marker exchanges showed the zzso cluster and several other genes like zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso to play a key role in zzso zzso ability at growing in zzso zzso zzso cluster DNA zzso of restricted zzso DNA blots showed a full deletion of the zzso cluster for one of the zzso defective strain while the other one showed a genetic organization similar to the one of the zzso zzso For zzso of zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso lungs appeared to have zzso the selection of zzso or deletions leading to zzso zzso
