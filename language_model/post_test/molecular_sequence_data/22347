zzso zzso channels zzso are zzso zzso zzso channels, involved in zzso processes related to zzso pH fluctuation such as zzso zzso perception of sour taste and synaptic zzso The zzso zzso toxin zzso 1 zzso has previously been shown to inhibit specifically the zzso zzso channel zzso To identify the binding site of zzso we produced an zzso form of the toxin zzso and developed a set of binding and zzso experiments on several zzso of zzso and the zzso channels zzso and zzso We show that zzso binds specifically to zzso at a single site, with an zzso of 128 zzso distinct from the zzso blocking zzso zzso obtained from zzso indicate that zzso does not bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in formation of the zzso zzso but binds principally on both zzso zzso I and II zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso regions, although not involved in the binding site, are crucial for the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso The zzso domain between zzso and zzso is important for their correct spatial positioning to form the zzso binding zzso These results will be useful for the future identification or design of new molecules acting on zzso
