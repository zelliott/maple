The zzso zzso one of the major cellular zzso zzso exhibits a diverse and highly regulated tissue zzso To better understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying its particular expression pattern, we have cloned the zzso gene from human zzso zzso By zzso with various DNA zzso derived from different regions of the zzso zzso several clones were identified and zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso DNA zzso was selected for further zzso The zzso zzso clone zzso with zzso corresponding to the 3' as well as the zzso region of the zzso zzso and gave rise to zzso expression after zzso into the zzso deficient zzso melanoma cell zzso The identity of the expressed zzso was verified by reaction with five different zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso analysis of about zzso of DNA around the zzso start zzso revealed putative binding sites for various zzso factors situated in the zzso untranslated region as well as within the first zzso These include zzso zzso and zzso binding sites as well as zzso and zzso acid responsive zzso
