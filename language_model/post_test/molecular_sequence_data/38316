DNA zzso beta zzso zzso is the only zzso DNA zzso identified to date that can catalyze extensive bypass of zzso zzso in zzso Previous studies suggest that DNA synthesis by pol beta is zzso on primed zzso DNA and zzso on gapped zzso The data presented in this paper provide an analysis of zzso synthesis past zzso and zzso zzso by pol beta functioning in both zzso and zzso modes using primer extension and zzso kinetic zzso zzso synthesis past zzso zzso was greater with gapped DNA templates than with zzso DNA zzso In the zzso mode pol beta did not discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso while in the zzso mode it displayed about zzso increased ability for zzso synthesis past zzso compared with zzso zzso The differentiation between zzso and zzso zzso resulted from a zzso increase in the efficiency of zzso incorporation across from the zzso of zzso zzso Rates of zzso across zzso zzso determined by the zzso kinetic zzso were higher in reactions with primed zzso templates than with gapped DNA and a slight increase in the zzso of zzso across from the zzso was found for zzso compared with zzso zzso
