zzso studies have identified a region of the zzso loop of zzso zzso channels zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso block and zzso zzso We previously modeled a similar region of the zzso channel as four zzso with the C strands from each of the zzso forming the external zzso and with charged zzso at the zzso forming the selectivity zzso However, the zzso channel P region zzso acid composition is much more zzso in this zzso Here we propose a structural motif for the zzso channel pore based on the following zzso zzso zzso zzso The external zzso binding site is formed by four zzso zzso P loop zzso participating in the internal zzso binding site are four zzso and zzso zzso zzso P regions form extended zzso with zzso in sequence zzso zzso only C ends of zzso form the inner walls of the zzso zzso They are extended zzso strands with backbone zzso zzso of segment zzso facing the pore with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of P zzso of the four zzso forms the zzso Fitting the external and internal zzso sites to zzso molecules predicts an zzso pore with the zzso point zzso as wide as zzso A, suggesting that selectivity may be achieved by interactions of zzso with partially hydrated zzso Other potential zzso binding sites also exist in the zzso
