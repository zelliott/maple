The zzso sequence of the gene zzso the zzso protein A zzso of zzso zzso 5 was zzso The gene consists of an open reading frame of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contained one domain highly similar to a zzso domain of zzso zzso belonging to family 9, two zzso zzso and four zzso of unknown zzso Among the four zzso of unknown function, the zzso 1 and 2 region had significant zzso in zzso acid sequence with the zzso zzso in the family 9 zzso zzso The cloned gene was inserted into an expression zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli as a fused zzso The fused protein was detected by zzso using zzso against zzso
