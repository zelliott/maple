zzso in zzso A zzso an essential zzso protein with multiple binding partners, cause zzso anomalies in zzso 

We determined the structure of the 23rd zzso repeat of zzso zzso that interacts with zzso a zzso zzso protein and regulator of cell polarity and movement, and the effect of the three zzso zzso on this zzso A combination of zzso structural analysis and in zzso modeling revealed the structural interface details between the C and D zzso of the zzso and the zzso 32 zzso of zzso zzso of the predicted key interface zzso confirmed the binding constraints between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated and used to analyze the importance of the zzso interaction in zzso Point zzso revealed that disruption of the zzso interface zzso cell zzso zzso does not bind zzso zzso zzso or zzso establishing the importance of this interaction to the human zzso zzso Tight complex formation requires zzso of both partners and the correct alignment of the binding surfaces, which is promoted by a flexible hinge domain between repeats 23 and 24 of zzso zzso zzso associated with human zzso anomalies disrupt the binding interaction and weaken the elasticity of zzso network under high mechanical zzso 

zzso analysis informed by structure can generate zzso for probing specific cellular interactions of zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso effects on zzso zzso
