Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are capable of forming zzso on zzso We used zzso zzso to identify a zzso zzso affecting zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso contained a consensus region signature of the zzso family of regulators, suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene confirmed that the gene was involved in zzso formation on polystyrene and zzso zzso analysis of the wild type and the zzso suggested that the zzso gene mediates the zzso formation of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso stage rather than at initial zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso resulted in the loss of an approximately zzso zzso zzso production by the zzso could be restored by zzso with a zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso The zzso zzso affected the induction of zzso formation by zzso and a high concentration of zzso but not by zzso The zzso did not affect the zzso of the zzso genes previously shown to be required for zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso gene is involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso step of zzso zzso zzso formation in response to zzso and salt and that this regulation may be zzso through the zzso zzso
