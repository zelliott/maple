We have previously identified a zzso zzso zzso which clustered zzso with zzso zzso zzso but lacked zzso with L cell zzso expressing the human zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these zzso we zzso that zzso might recognize the human zzso gene zzso To test this hypothesis, we have isolated a full-length zzso zzso the human zzso zzso and have characterized its product in additional zzso zzso The results of these studies indicate that the human zzso zzso encodes a product recognized by the zzso zzso Interestingly, the human zzso zzso cannot be expressed alone, but requires the human zzso zzso for efficient cell surface zzso A zzso composed of the human zzso and zzso molecules may have importance in T zzso cell zzso
