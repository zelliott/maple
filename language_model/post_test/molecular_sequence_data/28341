The rational design of drugs that can inhibit the action of viral zzso depends on obtaining accurate structures of these zzso The crystal structure of chemically zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso zzso resolution (R factor of zzso with the use of a model based on the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso In this zzso active zzso the zzso were replaced by zzso acid, a zzso coded zzso zzso This structure, in which all 99 zzso acids were located, differs in several important details from that reported previously by zzso The interface between the identical zzso forming the active zzso zzso is composed of four zzso beta strands from both the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 86 to 94 have a zzso zzso The observed arrangement of the zzso interface suggests possible designs for zzso zzso
