zzso zzso zzso is the last key zzso in the zzso zzso for zzso of zzso from zzso zzso could be provided through zzso however, zzso has been shown to be important for the adequate supply of zzso to zzso zzso a major zzso zzso With a view to determining zzso roles of zzso in mice, we report the sequence of a complete mouse zzso zzso along with its associated zzso structure, generation of specific zzso zzso and the tissue distribution and zzso expression patterns of zzso in zzso A zzso zzso full-length zzso containing an open reading frame of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from adult mouse zzso A 35 zzso mouse zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso library zzso It contained promoter regions, 12 zzso ranging in size from 53 to 579 zzso spanning over 30 zzso and zzso boundaries that were zzso with rat and human zzso The zzso core promoter contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso and several zzso zzso consensus zzso The zzso transcript, protein and zzso activity were detected in liver, zzso and, at much lower levels, in small zzso and stomach of both rats and zzso In developing mouse liver and zzso the expression levels of zzso protein and activity gradually increased with age until reaching their peak value at 3 weeks of age, following which the expression levels in liver remained constant, whereas those in kidney decreased zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso zzso expression in zzso and kidney cortical zzso These results suggest important zzso roles for zzso in zzso
