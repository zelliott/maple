The recently published sequence of zzso zzso III zzso provides the longest continuous stretch of a zzso DNA zzso zzso to date zzso zzso The sequence contains 116 distinct zzso open reading frames of at least 200 zzso in zzso more than 50 of which had not been described previously nor bear significant similarity to known zzso We have zzso the zzso known and putative protein sequences with respect to significant statistical features which might reflect on structural and functional zzso The zzso proteins have striking similarities and differences in their sequence attribute zzso compared to the corresponding zzso for all available zzso sequences and other protein zzso Nine examples of zzso proteins with distinctive sequence features are discussed in zzso
