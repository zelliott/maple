zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso action in rat zzso muscle zzso We have zzso a novel zzso zzso I zzso zzso which exhibits zzso action, to zzso from this zzso by a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its purity was assessed by zzso zzso and mass zzso Its molecular weight was found to be zzso zzso zzso as calculated from zzso mass zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence was zzso by sequencing of reduced and zzso toxin and a zzso zzso zzso generated by the zzso of toxin with zzso zzso The complete sequence of zzso I is zzso This toxin is composed of 64 zzso acid zzso and contains 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso I has high similarity to zzso I and zzso II when compared with toxins from other scorpion zzso The effects of zzso I on zzso responses were investigated using the rat isolated zzso mounted in zzso solution zzso degrees C, zzso CO2 in zzso zzso I (2 zzso markedly relaxed the zzso zzso the relaxation was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso I is the first zzso that can mediate zzso responses in the rat isolated zzso
