zzso are promising zzso for production of zzso zzso zzso compounds and in particular zzso yet development of sensitive and reliable zzso strategies for zzso has been hindered by the paucity of zzso zzso finished zzso 

Using the zzso zzso zzso as a model, we assessed current zzso zzso strategies by producing the complete zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of seven strains from six zzso zzso Genes on the zzso and zzso zzso have been highly zzso in content, size and order, strongly zzso selected and evolving at a rate zzso and zzso of nuclear zzso zzso Pt zzso diversification was driven by zzso evolution of two zzso repeats zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are highly zzso whereas their counterparts in zzso exhibit three zzso types of structural zzso via zzso or disruption of whole or partial zzso In the zzso zzso however, a single evolution hotspot varies in zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and nuclear markers zzso zzso and zzso that are widely used for zzso analysis obtained a divergent zzso for the seven zzso largely due to low zzso zzso A new strategy for zzso zzso of zzso was thus proposed that includes zzso twelve sequence markers that are of higher sensitivity than zzso for zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso sequence typing based on zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso reconstruction and zzso several zzso zzso for identification of strains within a given zzso 

This first comprehensive zzso of zzso zzso for a zzso zzso enabled exhaustive assessment and searches of all candidate zzso markers on the zzso zzso A new strategy for zzso zzso of zzso was proposed which might be generally zzso to other zzso zzso and should serve as a valuable tool in the expanding zzso biotechnology zzso
