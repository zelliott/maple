Three zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been characterized so zzso All have the same sequence up to the 46th zzso following the 7th zzso domain, followed by different zzso zzso Whereas zzso and zzso receptors possess a short zzso zzso tail, the zzso zzso has a very long zzso Compared to cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso a higher zzso potency and zzso zzso C activity were detected in cells expressing zzso zzso Another zzso with a short zzso tail, the zzso zzso has been recently isolated from human zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso also exists in the zzso Like all rat zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso activates zzso C upon stimulation with zzso zzso zzso Although the rank order of zzso potency is the same on zzso and zzso zzso zzso are less potent in stimulating zzso C in zzso zzso cells than in cells expressing zzso zzso Moreover, like the other short zzso it has no significant zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso shares similar functional properties with the other short zzso zzso zzso zzso and further suggests that the long zzso tail of the zzso zzso increases zzso C zzso zzso
