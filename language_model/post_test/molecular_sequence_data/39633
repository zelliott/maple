The zzso virus zzso gene encodes a zzso protein with a predicted zzso zzso Our zzso analyses of zzso virus revealed that zzso protein is incorporated into zzso mature zzso however, the function of zzso protein in the zzso virus life cycle has not been zzso In this study, a zzso zzso virus, zzso expressing zzso protein under zzso zzso regulation was zzso Under zzso conditions when zzso protein was zzso the zzso virus life cycle proceeded zzso resulting in plaque formation in zzso zzso In contrast, under zzso conditions when zzso protein expression was zzso no plaques were formed, showing that zzso protein is essential for zzso virus growth in cell zzso In infected cells when zzso protein was not zzso the formation of zzso mature virus zzso and zzso enveloped virus occurred zzso showing that zzso protein is not required for zzso zzso zzso particles containing zzso or lacking zzso zzso protein were zzso and were found to be indistinguishable on microscopic zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso however, zzso zzso failed to enter the cells, showing that zzso protein is required for zzso penetration into zzso Finally, zzso protein was required for fusion of the infected cells under zzso zzso Thus, our results provide direct evidence that zzso is an essential component of the zzso virus fusion complex, in addition to the previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso and A16 zzso
