We have studied the role of the zzso domain of the alpha zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso during zzso initiation at promoters lacking an zzso The temperature requirement for open complex formation was used as an indication of the zzso of this zzso We have previously shown that zzso is required for zzso initiation at low temperature at the zzso promoter, a promoter containing an zzso zzso I zzso has been used to reveal the structure of open promoter complexes and the temperature requirement for open complex formation has been determined using zzso zzso as a zzso In this work we show that, although zzso is not absolutely required for zzso initiation at promoters lacking an zzso it does play a role during zzso zzso This role is independent of the sequence of the promoter upstream from the zzso region and does not require stable zzso interactions as determined by zzso I zzso The role of zzso at promoters lacking an zzso is zzso
