The presence of a zzso zzso region within the zzso of zzso E virus zzso remains zzso Previous studies have described the zzso as a zzso zzso between zzso functional zzso of the zzso zzso Others have proposed that the region has no function, that it reflects a zzso region of the virus zzso that it is derived from the zzso and evolution of host sequences or that it is subject to positive zzso This study attempts to differentiate between these explanations by documenting the evolutionary processes occurring within the zzso We have measured the diversity of zzso sequences within acutely infected individuals or amongst sequences derived from zzso linked samples and, surprisingly, find relative zzso amongst these zzso We found no evidence of positive selection for zzso acid substitution in the zzso Through an analysis of published zzso we conclude that the range of zzso diversity observed within virus zzso can be explained by the zzso of zzso and, to a much lesser extent, through deletions or zzso of this zzso All published zzso zzso acid sequences display a relative overabundance of zzso and zzso zzso that cannot be explained by a local bias towards zzso in this part of the zzso Although all published zzso contain one or more zzso zzso zzso this motif does not occur more frequently than would be expected from the proportion of zzso zzso in these zzso Taken together, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso has a structural role that is dependent upon length and zzso acid zzso rather than a specific zzso
