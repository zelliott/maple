zzso zzso factors zzso are members of a family of zzso zzso that regulate a wide variety of zzso signaling zzso including the regulation of membrane traffic and zzso zzso zzso perform these functions through interactions with zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso Signaling zzso most commonly zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been shown previously to regulate the activities of a number of these regulators and zzso of zzso The ability of zzso itself to bind these same zzso also has been reported zzso though without much structural zzso We investigated the ability of human zzso zzso to bind zzso zzso zzso the soluble zzso for zzso and a short zzso soluble zzso analogue using zzso single quantum zzso zzso zzso zzso A patch of positive zzso potential on the surface of zzso is identified as being directly involved in zzso zzso but structural and stability changes extending to the zzso zzso and zzso site of zzso are also zzso The identified binding site and the zzso structural changes are discussed in terms of a possible influence of zzso on the binding of zzso to zzso and subsequent zzso zzso
