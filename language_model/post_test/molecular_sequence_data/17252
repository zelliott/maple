The chicken zzso zzso zzso element acts as a barrier to the encroachment of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences are highly enriched with zzso zzso and zzso zzso regardless of neighboring gene zzso We report here that zzso elements recruit these zzso modifications when protecting a reporter zzso from zzso zzso zzso studies identified a single protein binding site within zzso footprint IV, that is necessary for the recruitment of zzso modifications and for barrier zzso We have determined that zzso proteins bind to footprint zzso zzso is present in complexes with zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso and these zzso specifically interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression leads to a loss of zzso modification recruitment and subsequent encroachment of zzso zzso We propose that barrier activity requires the zzso recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at multiple zzso to counteract the propagation of condensed zzso zzso
