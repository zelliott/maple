To determine which zzso acids in zzso zzso are important for its structure and function, random libraries were previously constructed which systematically zzso the 263 zzso of the mature zzso A comprehensive screening of these libraries identified several zzso zzso core positions, including zzso and zzso which are strictly required for zzso levels of zzso zzso An examination of positions 66 and 76 in the class A zzso gene family shows that a zzso at position 66 is strongly zzso while position 76 varies considerably among other zzso It is possible that position 76 varies in the gene family because zzso zzso with zzso zzso at position 76 retain partial zzso In contrast, position 66 may remain unchanged in the gene family because zzso zzso at this location are zzso for zzso structure and zzso By determining the zzso resistance levels of the 38 possible zzso at positions 66 and 76 in the zzso zzso it was confirmed that position 76 is indeed more tolerant of zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso Data Bank files for three class A zzso indicates that volume constraints at position 66 are at least partly responsible for the low tolerance of zzso at this zzso
