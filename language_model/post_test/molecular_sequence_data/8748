To gain further insight into structural elements involved in zzso function, differences in the intrinsic zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso forms of the protein were zzso When excited at 290 zzso zzso displays zzso zzso at zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso gamma zzso zzso The zzso zzso intensity is zzso by approximately zzso in the zzso gamma zzso form relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules were created by zzso zzso to convert the zzso two zzso to zzso zzso Fluorescence studies reveal that the observed changes upon zzso gamma S exchange are due to a blue shift in the zzso zzso for both zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the blue shift in the zzso zzso both zzso are more resistant to zzso by zzso in the zzso gamma zzso zzso These data indicate that both of zzso zzso are brought into a more zzso zzso environment upon zzso changes promoted by zzso zzso zzso Since zzso lies adjacent to zzso zzso switch II domain, local zzso changes would be predicted based on the known structure of zzso However, zzso lies within a region of zzso potentially related to the switch III domain unique to zzso G alpha zzso Thus, changes in the zzso properties of zzso upon zzso zzso exchange suggest that zzso proteins may have zzso relationships similar to those described for zzso zzso zzso
