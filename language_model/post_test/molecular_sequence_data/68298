In a zzso aimed at tagging zzso genes in zzso with the zzso zzso element zzso a primary zzso of a line called zzso that is zzso for four zzso zzso zzso M, N and zzso was identified that possessed 10 copies of the zzso element, one of which was linked (29 map zzso to zzso Descendants of this plant, which had from 8 to 15 copies of zzso were crossed to a zzso line and the progeny screened for zzso zzso When the zzso linked to zzso was present in the parent, a high frequency of zzso zzso was observed (29 zzso in zzso By contrast, when this zzso was zzso no such zzso were observed in zzso zzso The background frequency of zzso zzso was low (five in zzso A detailed analysis was made of the first 11 zzso zzso recovered from parents carrying the zzso zzso zzso While none of the zzso possessed a zzso resistance zzso all lacked an zzso marker closely linked to zzso suggesting that deletions were responsible for loss of the zzso zzso In many of the zzso one or more zzso markers in the vicinity of the linked zzso were also zzso These findings suggest that the linked zzso may be inducing zzso zzso
