zzso hormone zzso is a zzso zzso in the zzso that regulates both appetite and energy zzso in zzso zzso was initially identified in zzso zzso as a zzso zzso hormone that induced zzso zzso in zzso in the zzso however, this function of zzso has not been observed in other zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso is involved in zzso feeding behavior, spurring the hypothesis that the original function of zzso in early zzso was appetite zzso The present study reports the results of zzso cloning zzso zzso and two zzso receptors from an zzso fish, zzso zzso a member of zzso the earliest zzso class in zzso The putative zzso zzso is composed of 19 zzso zzso similar in length to the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction revealed that zzso is expressed in the zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell bodies and fibers were identified by zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is not released via the zzso zzso into general zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso but were not found in the zzso These results indicate that zzso does not have a peripheral function, such as a zzso effect, in the skin of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were not affected by zzso suggesting that feeding conditions might not affect the expression of zzso in the zzso
