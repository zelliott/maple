The zzso promoter contains a complex hormone responsive region zzso upstream of a binding site for the zzso factor nuclear factor I zzso zzso induction of zzso expression requires the integrity of both the zzso and the zzso binding zzso However, in zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso factor on the zzso promoter that does not cooperate but rather competes with the hormone receptors in terms of binding to zzso zzso that contain the zzso and the zzso binding site have been zzso into zzso zzso hormone receptors bind efficiently to these zzso zzso does zzso Therefore it has been zzso that the zzso structure may be responsible for the inability of zzso to bind to the zzso organized inactive zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pattern indicate the presence of a zzso covering the zzso and the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso shows that in zzso the zzso setting of the zzso promoter DNA in this zzso is identical to that previously reported for zzso zzso in which the major grooves of the zzso half zzso are facing towards the zzso zzso and appear not to be accessible to zzso These results indicate that zzso promoter sequences are determining zzso positioning in zzso and supports the concept that zzso positioning of DNA in this zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso
