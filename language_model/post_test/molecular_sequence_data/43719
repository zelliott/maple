zzso zzso zzso coding regions in the only three green zzso zzso investigated to date are fundamentally different in that they are continuous in zzso zzso but highly fragmented and scrambled in zzso zzso and zzso zzso To gain more insight into the mode of evolution of fragmented and scrambled zzso zzso zzso zzso genes within the green zzso group, this work zzso provides additional information on fragmentation patterns of zzso small- and zzso zzso and zzso zzso that strongly supports the concept of a gradual increase in the extent of zzso of zzso zzso among zzso green algae and zzso reports the first example of fragmented and scrambled zzso zzso zzso coding regions in a green zzso zzso outside the zzso zzso The present study zzso suggests that the scrambling of the zzso zzso coding regions may have occurred early in the evolution of fragmented and scrambled zzso zzso genes within the zzso green zzso group, most likely in parallel with the fragmentation events, zzso proposes zzso as a possible mechanism involved in the evolution of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso presents a hypothetical zzso for converting continuous zzso zzso genes into the highly fragmented and scrambled zzso coding regions of zzso through a series of zzso events between short repeated zzso
