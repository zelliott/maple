This study presents the first characterization of zzso small zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Small zzso act as zzso and zzso regulators, controlling specific target genes involved in various cellular zzso zzso are zzso zzso organisms that play major roles in environmental zzso such as food zzso and global carbon zzso Small zzso zzso libraries were constructed for zzso growing zzso zzso and then subjected to highly parallel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso From the zzso analysis of approximately 300,000 sequences in the zzso library and over 17 million sequences in the zzso libraries, there exists evidence of a core set of small zzso genes zzso novel zzso zzso short interfering zzso and zzso short interfering zzso The zzso zzso contains elements similar to plant small zzso systems, such as the zzso machinery, a high percentage of short interfering zzso originating from zzso and repetitive regions of the zzso and putative binding sites of the small zzso occurring primarily in the coding section of the predicted zzso The characterization of the small zzso zzso of zzso zzso establishes the possibility of a wide range of gene regulatory mechanisms in zzso
