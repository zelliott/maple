zzso is a central component of the zzso junction in zzso cells and continuously zzso zzso via zzso zzso and/or zzso depending on the cell zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso for the zzso factor 6 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso canine kidney zzso zzso cells were used as a model, and zzso localized in the zzso and along the zzso junction where zzso was zzso Next, activity of zzso was compared with that of other zzso zzso an zzso of zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso nor zzso strongly inhibited zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso rather enhanced the zzso incorporation of a membrane protein other than zzso Thus, in zzso cells, zzso appeared to be zzso solely through zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells zzso zzso showed a reduced degree of cell migration compared to zzso cells, as assessed by wound healing and zzso zzso and this reduction in migration appeared to be due to the zzso of zzso at the zzso junction in cells zzso zzso zzso zzso likely represents a key zzso in zzso dependent zzso of zzso in zzso zzso This activity of zzso in zzso turnover may be involved in zzso organization and/or zzso zzso
