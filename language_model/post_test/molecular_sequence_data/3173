The type II restriction zzso zzso shows sequence similarity with 10 other restriction zzso among them the type zzso restriction zzso zzso which requires binding to an zzso site for efficient DNA zzso and the type zzso restriction zzso zzso which is active as a zzso and zzso DNA with two recognition sites in a concerted zzso We show here that zzso is an zzso type II zzso which is active as a zzso and does not require zzso by binding to an zzso zzso Nevertheless, it shares with zzso and zzso a very similar zzso site and zzso center as shown here by a zzso analysis, indicative of an evolutionary relationship between these three zzso We suggest that a similar relationship exists between other zzso type II, type zzso and type zzso restriction zzso This may explain why similarities may be more pronounced between members of different zzso of restriction zzso than among the members of a given zzso
