zzso is diagnosed by zzso testing or by identification of the zzso agent, zzso zzso The zzso has historically been detected in clinical specimens by zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso or the rabbit zzso test zzso zzso is considered to be very sensitive and specific, although it is available only in research settings and is not clinically useful due to the length of time required to obtain a zzso In recent years, several zzso methods have been developed for the detection of zzso zzso but none of these has shown a clear advantage in sensitivity over zzso We have developed a specific and highly sensitive reverse zzso zzso zzso that targets a zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso can detect a single zzso by Southern analysis when whole organisms are diluted and zzso to zzso zzso zzso organisms when zzso zzso are used to make zzso The test was demonstrated to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Twenty different strains of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso humor, blood, and zzso were shown to be zzso by this zzso This efficient and sensitive technique could be more useful than existing methods for detecting very low numbers of organisms in clinical zzso
