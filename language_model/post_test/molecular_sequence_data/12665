At the zzso pole of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a tightly localized assembly of pole zzso This spatial restriction of zzso activity has been thought to be achieved by the zzso of zzso zzso since zzso of the zzso to the anterior zzso anterior pole zzso However, zzso pole zzso does not form in zzso zzso where zzso zzso is not zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is zzso As a first step towards understanding how zzso activity is restricted to the zzso pole, we analyzed zzso translation in wild type and zzso We show that the targeting of zzso activity to the zzso pole involves two steps of spatial zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that two zzso of zzso protein are produced by alternative start zzso zzso The short zzso which is translated from the second zzso zzso of the zzso has full zzso zzso Finally, we show that when zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso protein requires the functions of zzso and zzso as well as zzso itself, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism in the induction of pole zzso by zzso
