zzso family members are implicated in synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso is an zzso in neurological zzso zzso however, there has been no genetic analysis of zzso function in higher zzso We show that zzso zzso is localized to zzso membrane zzso in many cell types, including zzso zzso zzso the intricately folded zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso density of zzso zzso zzso zzso that lack all zzso function are viable, lack any zzso zzso zzso but have abnormal zzso of the zzso proteins zzso large, zzso giant larvae and zzso altered synaptic zzso and behavioral zzso zzso of zzso outside its normal membrane domain in zzso zzso results in striking zzso zzso The strong zzso zzso coupled with the mild zzso and lack of zzso suggests that zzso acts zzso with other proteins to organize specialized membrane zzso within a diverse array of cell zzso
