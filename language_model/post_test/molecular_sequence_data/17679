A generalized model is presented of zzso binding to zzso zzso channels zzso Broad similarity in the structure of zzso suggests that the binding sites of zzso may have evolved from a zzso zzso zzso sequence data identified as a candidate for such a site a highly zzso 15 zzso stretch of primary structure in the zzso zzso region of all known zzso zzso We modeled this zzso termed the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and propose that it may form a major zzso of a zzso structural binding zzso In the model of the binding complex zzso an zzso zzso zzso at position 11 of the zzso is the zzso site interacting with the positively charged zzso group of zzso zzso a local zzso within the zzso system of zzso is favorably oriented in the zzso field of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso aromatic zzso at the turn of the zzso interacts zzso with the zzso zzso density at its zzso center, and zzso selective recognition is partly a result of the type of zzso acid zzso at position 6 of the zzso Additionally, formation of a hydrogen bond between the zzso atom of the zzso system of zzso and a complementary group in the zzso may be important in the zzso binding of zzso
