zzso zzso which is not of zzso origin, has been identified in many regions of the rat zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso increases zzso zzso zzso content in zzso female zzso To determine if zzso stimulates zzso zzso we examined the effect of zzso on the in zzso production of zzso and on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and cerebral zzso To examine the effect of zzso on the in zzso production of zzso zzso zzso was injected into the lateral zzso and its incorporation into zzso zzso was determined by zzso and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso In zzso but not zzso zzso rats, a 24,000 zzso zzso zzso protein was detected in the zzso and zzso 2 and 4 h after zzso zzso No zzso zzso proteins were detected in the amygdala, zzso cortex, or serum at either time zzso In addition, in the zzso but not the zzso a second zzso band was detected with an apparent zzso zzso of zzso To determine if zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso copy DNA was obtained by reverse zzso of zzso zzso prepared from intact and vehicle or zzso zzso rats and analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso In zzso from zzso rats, there was little, or no, zzso levels of zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso rats zzso zzso was easily detected in the zzso and zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso These data suggest that zzso increases the zzso content in the zzso and zzso by increasing zzso gene zzso in a manner similar to that reported in the zzso
