zzso B3 zzso generates zzso deleted zzso zzso during replication in zzso zzso We show here that zzso populations with zzso can also be generated within two to three passages of zzso in primary, but not zzso cell zzso zzso of less than 49 zzso increase in size during passage, while zzso zzso of 49 zzso appear to be the maximum deletion zzso The cellular environment of zzso primary cell cultures or the zzso in zzso is sufficient for the selection of zzso zzso over zzso zzso
