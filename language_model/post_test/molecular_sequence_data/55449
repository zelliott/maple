The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso growing in zzso mine zzso both displayed high metal resistance and enhanced the growth of zzso plants in a zzso zzso Our goal was to determine whether bacterial metal resistance or the capacity to produce zzso had a larger impact on the growth of host plants under zinc zzso Eight zzso zzso and one zzso zzso with reduced zzso acid zzso production were obtained by zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence and of zzso via reverse zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso gene disruptions revealed that zzso and the zzso regulator zzso played important roles in the zinc zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, interruption of a putative zzso zzso transport protein reduced zzso synthesis and also showed reduced zinc and cadmium resistance but had no influence on copper zzso In greenhouse studies, zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso displayed a significant increase in biomass production over that without zzso even in a zzso zzso Interestingly, the differences in plant biomass improvement among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 15-6 zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso rather than genes zzso zinc resistance zzso were the dominant factor in enhancing plant growth in contaminated zzso
