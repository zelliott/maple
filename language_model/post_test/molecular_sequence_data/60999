zzso A is a severe bleeding disorder caused by a zzso in blood zzso factor VIII zzso zzso zzso containing a potent human zzso expression cassette zzso a truncated zzso zzso were developed that zzso sustained zzso expression in normal and zzso mice and complete zzso correction of the bleeding disorder in zzso mice and dogs zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we evaluated two zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso one containing the full-length zzso and the second containing a truncated zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso the human full-length zzso zzso have not been described zzso zzso zzso was efficient and dose dependent, ranging from 50% to zzso High levels of functional zzso were zzso from zzso cells at amounts up to zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso deleted zzso was expressed at levels at least zzso higher than the full-length zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso levels were similar with both zzso These data provide the first demonstration of zzso zzso zzso function in primary human cells and verify the potential clinical utility of zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso
