zzso wheat lines with zzso zzso zzso often show zzso conversion of zzso into zzso under zzso zzso In the zzso zzso an zzso zzso is formed within the transformed zzso and female zzso is also observed because of abnormal zzso zzso 

In this study, four wheat zzso zzso zzso genes were isolated and named zzso to zzso zzso expression was observed in the zzso boundary region of the zzso in both normal zzso and transformed zzso zzso was also strongly expressed in zzso not only of normal zzso in zzso but also of the zzso zzso in transformed zzso and the zzso expression pattern in the sterile zzso seemed to be identical to that in normal zzso of fertile zzso In addition, zzso and zzso showed interactions with the three wheat zzso proteins through the zzso zzso zzso however, formed a complex with wheat zzso and zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso but not with a wheat zzso zzso 

zzso of the four zzso genes is evident in zzso zzso including zzso and transformed zzso and is independent from female zzso in zzso wheat lines with zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction was zzso among various plant species, indicating the significance of zzso complex formation in wheat zzso zzso The functional features of zzso are likely to be distinct from other zzso gene functions in wheat zzso
