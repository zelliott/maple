Recently, zzso and co-workers solved the structure of a zzso hairpin loop that is zzso in large zzso zzso zzso (In zzso coli, the zzso consists of zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso center of 23 S zzso A major feature of that structure is a zzso zzso that closes the zzso Our laboratory reported previously the isolation of the zzso zzso and its characterization as a zzso of zzso zzso and a cause of zzso zzso For the work reported here, we asked whether zzso causes its zzso precisely because it is part of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we introduced base zzso at zzso zzso and zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso was then tested for the two zzso zzso nonsense suppression and zzso growth zzso Our results indicate that zzso at zzso do not cause the zzso zzso because zzso is part of the zzso zzso We discuss alternative avenues to the observed zzso zzso and, in particular, present a model in which a specific interaction of the loop is involved in zzso chain zzso
