The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso circular DNA zzso which is transcribed from both strands as zzso zzso which are further processed to yield the mature zzso zzso zzso and zzso We compared the gene expression patterns of zzso and adult zzso brains and identified a sequence tag from the zzso 6 region of the zzso zzso which, in adult brain, was more abundant in the sense zzso form, but, in zzso brain, more abundant in the zzso form zzso By means of solution zzso zzso protection zzso Northern zzso and zzso based techniques, we demonstrated that the zzso 6 region of the zzso zzso zzso is transcribed as zzso stable sense and zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified sense and zzso transcripts from this region consisting of zzso assembled fragments joined together at a direct repeat of 7 zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso processing of zzso zzso are much more complex than presently zzso
