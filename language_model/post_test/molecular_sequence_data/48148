Recently, we demonstrated a marked reduction in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using an zzso against the zzso zzso zzso To further examine this zzso we raised an zzso to the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso with this zzso confirmed the reduction in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso detected 2 forms of zzso in zzso zzso in contrast to normal zzso in which a single form of zzso was detected by both the zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso studies with zzso focusing in the first dimension identified normal zzso zzso as an 85 to 92 zzso protein with an zzso point zzso of zzso zzso zzso contained an additional 80 to 82 zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso Analysis of zzso expressed by the human zzso cell line, zzso showed 2 zzso similar to those found in zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell and normal zzso zzso with zzso converted the more zzso zzso zzso to the more basic one, indicating that the 2 zzso differed with respect to zzso zzso Furthermore, in contrast to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was susceptible to zzso H zzso indicating defective zzso processing by zzso zzso The zzso zzso was specific for zzso as 2 other zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso were processed zzso zzso the extent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with disease duration and zzso zzso
