zzso was originally found by expression cloning of a mouse zzso zzso library through its zzso binding capacity zzso et zzso zzso 11, zzso zzso zzso has characteristic regions important in zzso signal zzso these are an zzso domain, a cluster of putative zzso for zzso zzso and zzso sequences with zzso zzso In this paper, we report zzso cloning of human zzso and a zzso of it from a zzso zzso zzso The human zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso We identified two forms of human zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso represents the human counterpart of original mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso the newly identified form, is identical to zzso except for its lack of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso identical in their zzso acid sequences and zzso identical within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of adult mouse tissue zzso indicated expression of zzso and of zzso in various zzso Evidence suggesting the presence of the zzso protein in human tissue was obtained by zzso followed by zzso with two different zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso are zzso
