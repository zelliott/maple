Analysis of the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso region of zzso T4 gene 25 revealed three potential Shine and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a spacing of 8, 17 and 27 zzso from the initiation zzso of this zzso zzso zzso of our experiments in the zzso zzso expression system clearly demonstrate that the zzso sequence is required for efficient expression of gene zzso We propose the existence of a zzso structure that includes zzso and zzso sequences and brings the zzso sequence to a zzso spacing with the initiation zzso of gene zzso Since the predicted secondary structure in the zzso initiation region of gene 25 is relatively unstable and the zzso zzso zzso is more typical than the zzso zzso zzso we suggest that this structure could control the level of gene zzso
