zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso processed zzso and zzso proteins but its zzso role in zzso is zzso We show here that zzso zzso site zzso in the zzso protein do not compromise its interaction with zzso and that, whilst zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif of zzso and zzso are required for efficient interaction with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is not zzso In zzso zzso can form stable complexes with zzso and zzso proteins in both the zzso and zzso bound zzso zzso the zzso complex is zzso to the action of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus zzso by zzso with zzso and preventing GAP zzso zzso zzso may allow transit of the activated form of the zzso protein between physically separated zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso
