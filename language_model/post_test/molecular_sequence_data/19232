zzso are the most common type of zzso protein in zzso In this paper, we show that circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marina zzso and zzso zzso from various zzso share a similar gene structure, with two zzso zzso at zzso positions zzso and zzso Despite sequence divergence between zzso and zzso zzso these data strongly suggest that these three zzso types are derived from a common ancestral zzso gene and evolved by zzso events leading to diversification of zzso types and derived zzso A zzso analysis shows a distinct evolutionary history of zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso surprisingly exhibits close zzso relationships to some zzso zzso zzso We have characterized the gene structure of zzso zzso zzso to confirm assumptions about its zzso with zzso It appears that it has the same zzso position as in zzso zzso suggesting a common ancestry with zzso In zzso zzso zzso may be a derived zzso with an unusual zzso zzso
