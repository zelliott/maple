zzso fringe zzso one zzso of zzso zzso plays an essential part in zzso of zzso boundaries during animal early development, especially zzso To characterize the promoter of zzso zzso and generate zzso transgenic zzso we isolated the upstream regulatory region of zzso zzso by blast search at the zzso zzso database ( zzso ) and analyzed the promoter activity using green fluorescent protein zzso as a zzso zzso activity zzso in zzso shows that the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso can direct zzso zzso zzso while the zzso and zzso fragments with further upstream sequence included drive zzso expression more zzso We produced zzso founders showing zzso expression of zzso and consequently generated a zzso zzso zzso The eggs from zzso female zzso show strong zzso zzso which is consistent to the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso detection of zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso This reveals that zzso zzso is a maternal factor existing in matured eggs, suggesting that fish zzso may be influenced by maternal zzso
