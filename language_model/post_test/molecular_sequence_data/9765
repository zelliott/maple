The zzso gene is involved in the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso leukemia and related zzso This gene is unusual in that it codes for two distinct zzso a small zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of material from zzso zzso and very low levels of zzso expression have so far prevented a thorough description of zzso zzso Here, we characterize two additional zzso bearing zzso allowing this zzso In one case, with a zzso located zzso to the zzso zzso the level of zzso of previously described zzso transcripts is zzso In the second case, with a zzso within the zzso zzso I, an alternative zzso initiation site is demonstrated in the tumor cells at 229 zzso upstream to zzso zzso The identification of this internal promoter, together with the similarity between zzso and zzso zzso structures, allow us to propose a model in which the zzso of an ancestral gene was followed by the zzso of one copy within the zzso of a zzso zzso accounting for the unusual feature of the zzso zzso
