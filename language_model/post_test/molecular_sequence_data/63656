zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso of the calcium zzso The zzso of zzso gene can cause zzso periodic paralysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso Current research on zzso was mainly in human being and model animal, but rarely in livestock and zzso In this study, zzso pigs zzso zzso pigs zzso zzso pigs zzso and the second generation zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso were designed according to the sequence of human zzso gene and zzso was carried out using pig zzso zzso zzso products were zzso and compared with that of human, and then single zzso zzso zzso were investigated by zzso while zzso tests were performed to validate the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso DNA fragments of zzso zzso gene were acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso ) and the identity of the zzso region was zzso between human and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found within the cloned zzso among which 24 were in zzso zzso zzso the results of zzso were in accordance with that of zzso According to the zzso of zzso zzso gene published in zzso zzso zzso 8 of the 11 zzso identified in the present study were consistent with the base difference between two zzso zzso
