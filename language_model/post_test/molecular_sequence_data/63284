The aim of this study has been to determine the zzso of diverse human zzso strains circulating in Thailand between October 2004 and April 2006 by means of molecular zzso zzso patients aged between 2 months and 5 years diagnosed with acute zzso zzso in Bangkok and zzso Thailand were tested for human zzso A zzso by zzso A total of 130 specimens zzso were found zzso positive and 126 were characterized by direct sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis and zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the uncommon strain zzso zzso zzso sites of zzso over time imply dependence on geographical location along with seasonal variation of relative zzso and distribution of zzso zzso Thus, continuous molecular monitoring of human zzso epidemiology is essential for adjusting vaccine zzso
