Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a single domain all zzso protein with its eight zzso arranged as a Greek key zzso or zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso of zzso were made by joining the native zzso and zzso and introducing new zzso at sites originally within connections between zzso The locations of the new zzso were chosen to interrupt zzso between the two zzso zzso and the short zzso Greek key zzso zzso levels in the zzso coli zzso were indistinguishable from that of native zzso zzso rates for the zzso proteins were similar to those of the native zzso indicating that the zzso are correctly zzso zzso the zzso zzso provided by the Greek key connection reduced the stability of the protein by approximately zzso zzso indicating only a slight contribution to zzso zzso The experiments test and eliminate two hypotheses for folding pathways for Greek key zzso that require zzso zzso or zzso attachment across the short Greek key zzso
