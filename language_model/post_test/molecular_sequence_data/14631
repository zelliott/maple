The zzso cells missing zzso regulatory gene of the sea zzso zzso zzso is first expressed in zzso daughter cells as the zzso target of late zzso stage zzso signaling from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required in zzso progeny during late zzso for the early phase of zzso cell precursor zzso Here we report on a later acting zzso module that assumes control of zzso expression by the early zzso zzso stage and maintains it through zzso cell differentiation and zzso zzso analyses reveal that the two critical elements within this late module are consensus matches to zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso from the zzso zzso stage zzso zzso with zzso zzso reveal a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels fall sharply after zzso is zzso while depleting zzso leads to significant reductions in output of zzso zzso or zzso These results support the conclusion zzso and zzso comprise a positive zzso feedback loop in the zzso zzso This often employed cross regulatory zzso feature here ensures self-sustaining zzso output in a cohort of fully specified zzso cell precursors at a relatively early zzso zzso
