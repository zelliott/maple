The previously predicted structures of human zzso by zzso with zzso egg white zzso by an automatic method, after the alignment stage, are compared to the X-ray determined structure of zzso zzso The root mean square by rotation method zzso zzso for 122 zzso atoms between the two models and the X-ray structure are zzso A and zzso zzso The zzso zzso for all zzso except for differences in human and zzso zzso are zzso A and zzso zzso If the flexible zzso zzso zzso are removed then these zzso zzso are reduced to zzso A and zzso A zzso These results are consistent with the fact that the zzso zzso between the human and zzso X-ray structures increases from zzso 112 zzso and is zzso zzso
