The zzso of mice zzso for the zzso zzso zzso includes zzso and a variety of studies demonstrate that zzso in these mice are present but zzso We have identified a novel gene that has zzso to a family of zzso domain proteins with transport functions and maps to zzso mouse zzso 19, in a region to which the zzso zzso has been previously zzso The putative zzso is abundant in normal zzso but its expression is markedly reduced in zzso from zzso mice when tested using Northern and Western zzso Southern analysis of this zzso which we call zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrates that it is intact and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso studies show that zzso is expressed in developing zzso We propose that the absence of zzso expression results in an zzso zzso in zzso
