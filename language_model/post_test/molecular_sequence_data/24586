zzso zzso is an opportunistic fungus which causes pulmonary complications in humans and zzso The clinical spectrum observed with zzso zzso is attributed to the zzso nature of its zzso Lack of understanding on the molecular processes and complexity of the fungus have spurred interest in the identification and characterization of its zzso with biological activities and zzso zzso For identification of some of these zzso a zzso library of zzso zzso was screened with zzso of allergic zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso clones was zzso and observed to have an open reading frame of 1095 zzso corresponding to a zzso of 364 zzso zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence showed significant zzso with the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The expressed zzso fusion protein exhibited specific zzso and zzso binding with zzso present in zzso patients' zzso The zzso protein in zzso zzso folding of scrambled zzso The probable zzso regions of the deduced zzso acid sequence were mapped by zzso zzso This is the first report of isolation of a gene zzso a member of the zzso family from zzso zzso The zzso zzso of proteins may play an important role in the protein folding mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso for their interaction with the zzso
