Eleven V zzso genes within a zzso region which has been zzso from the short to the long arm of zzso 2 have been characterized by sequence zzso Nine of the zzso genes exist within the zzso in three highly zzso copies zzso zzso comparisons of the zzso genes make it very likely that the three copies of a given gene were produced at different times during zzso A chain of events which led to a zzso amplification of precursor genes is zzso
