The zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso analysis reveals that the zzso zzso zzso shares low identity zzso and similarity zzso to both zzso and zzso the zzso components of the respiratory nitrate and zzso zzso zzso zzso predicting the zzso zzso selectivity of zzso has proved difficult based solely on sequence zzso In the present study, we have zzso both zzso and zzso on the recently determined X-ray structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and have identified a number of key zzso acid zzso zzso in all known zzso zzso including zzso that we speculate may enhance selectivity towards zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso and zzso zzso
