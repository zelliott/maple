The nuclear export of the influenza A virus zzso zzso is crucial for virus zzso As a major component of the zzso zzso zzso alone can also be shuttled out of the nucleus by interacting with zzso region maintenance 1 zzso and is therefore hypothesized to promote the nuclear export of the zzso In the present study, three novel nuclear export signals zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso identified as being responsible for zzso its nuclear zzso The nuclear export of zzso was zzso dependent, whereas that of zzso or zzso was zzso zzso zzso of these zzso led to an overall nuclear zzso of zzso zzso of all three zzso significantly impaired viral zzso Based on structures of influenza virus zzso zzso these three zzso zzso are found present on the surface of zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso is also required for nuclear export of zzso Together, these results suggest that the nuclear export of zzso is important for virus replication and relies on its zzso and zzso
