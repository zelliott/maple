In the present study, the zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso according to the zzso usage of zzso zzso and both the native and the zzso gene were expressed in zzso zzso Use of the zzso gene resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso activity that reached zzso zzso times that observed using the native zzso This is the highest zzso activity reported to zzso The zzso zzso was zzso active at pH zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso production from zzso was studied using the zzso zzso produced from the zzso zzso After zzso under optimal conditions, which included zzso zzso an zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso and pH zzso the zzso yield was zzso The high zzso concentration and short reaction time described here should reduce production costs zzso compared with the conditions used in previous zzso Thus, this study may provide the basis for the industrial use of this zzso zzso for the production of zzso
