In zzso cells, the main stored neutral lipids are zzso and zzso zzso which are produced by two related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Very little is known about the zzso zzso storage and function of neutral lipids in many zzso lower zzso In this paper, we have characterized the activity of an important zzso synthetic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A full-length zzso and gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified and designated zzso The gene is composed of 15 zzso and 14 zzso and encodes a protein with a predicted zzso zzso containing signature motifs characteristic of the zzso zzso The native protein zzso at zzso under reducing zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein localized to the zzso cortical and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso oriented to the zzso of the zzso When a zzso zzso zzso strain lacking neutral zzso production is transformed with zzso zzso a significant zzso activity is zzso resulting in zzso synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso zzso resembling zzso bodies in zzso zzso No production of zzso zzso is observed upon zzso expression in zzso In contrast to human zzso lacking fatty acid zzso zzso zzso incorporates zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso are also neutral zzso zzso and illustrate the first example of the existence of a functional zzso gene in an ancient zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso is zzso zzso
