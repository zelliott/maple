We present the zzso complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso a zzso pathogen causing typhoid zzso A comparison with the zzso sequence of recently isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso showed that 29 of the zzso predicted genes in zzso are unique to this strain, while 84 genes are unique to zzso Both zzso contain more than 200 zzso 9 of these genes in zzso are intact in zzso while 11 intact zzso genes are zzso in zzso A zzso zzso inversion in zzso relative to zzso was zzso The two strains exhibit differences in zzso zzso zzso and island zzso While zzso carries two zzso one zzso multiple drug resistance, zzso has no plasmids and is sensitive to zzso
