A zzso procedure for obtaining zzso doubly zzso zzso from readily available precursor molecules is zzso Isolation of the zzso zzso coli zzso from zzso coli cultures grown on zzso doubly zzso media in the absence of reducing agents yields the mixed zzso zzso in both the protein and the zzso zzso zzso assignments for zzso obtained from two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso assignments for the entire mixed zzso obtained from combined use of three-dimensional zzso experiments and zzso correlation zzso zzso demonstrated unequivocally that the zzso is zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso This result also supports earlier suggestions that the zzso zzso activity is sensitive to the zzso zzso status of the zzso Complete sets of zzso zzso and zzso chemical shifts of both components in the mixed zzso of zzso and zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso zzso
