zzso diseases comprise a group of rapidly progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders for which there are no effective zzso While conversion of the cellular prion protein zzso to a zzso rich zzso zzso ) is known to be a critical event in propagation of infectious zzso the identity of the zzso form of zzso and its mechanism of action remain zzso zzso into this mechanism have been provided by studying zzso molecules harboring deletions and point zzso in the zzso central region, encompassing zzso zzso When expressed in transgenic mice, zzso deleted for these zzso zzso causes a spontaneous neurodegenerative illness that is reversed by zzso of zzso zzso In cultured cells, zzso zzso zzso hypersensitivity to certain zzso antibiotics and zzso spontaneous zzso channel activity that can be recorded by zzso zzso We have zzso these zzso and zzso activities to identify which zzso zzso and zzso locations are required for zzso We present an zzso channel model for the toxicity of zzso zzso and related zzso and speculate how a similar mechanism could mediate zzso zzso zzso regimens designed to inhibit zzso zzso as well as formation of zzso , may prove to be the most clinically zzso
