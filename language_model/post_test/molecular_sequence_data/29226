The cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable us to sense cold are not well zzso zzso into this process have come from the use of pharmacological agents, such as zzso that elicit a cooling zzso Here we have characterized and cloned a zzso zzso from zzso sensory zzso that is also activated by zzso stimuli in the cool to cold zzso This zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso channels, and we propose that it functions as a zzso of cold stimuli in the zzso zzso These findings, together with our previous identification of the zzso channels zzso and zzso demonstrate that zzso channels detect temperatures over a wide range and are the principal sensors of zzso stimuli in the zzso peripheral nervous zzso
