The zzso zzso and zzso relationships within the bear family remain zzso subjects in recent zzso Prior investigation has been concentrated on the application of different zzso zzso sequence data, zzso we employ two nuclear zzso gene zzso the partial zzso 1 from gene zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso and the complete zzso 1 from zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with previously published zzso data, to clarify these enigmatic zzso The combined analyses of nuclear zzso and zzso zzso not only zzso prior zzso positioning the zzso bear most zzso and grouping the brown and polar bear together but also provided new insights into the bear zzso suggesting the zzso association of zzso bear and sun bear with strong zzso zzso based on combination of nuclear and zzso genes differed from nuclear analysis in recognizing the zzso bears as the earliest zzso species among the zzso zzso representatives while the exact placement of the sun bear did not zzso zzso and American black bears clustered as sister group in all analyses with moderate levels of zzso support and high zzso zzso Comparisons between the nuclear and zzso findings suggested that our combined nuclear zzso have the resolving power comparable to zzso zzso for the zzso interpretation of the bear zzso As can be seen from present study, the unanimous zzso for this recently derived family was still not produced and additional independent genetic markers were in zzso
