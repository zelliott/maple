zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso were used in structure activity zzso CD zzso revealed an overall structural similarity between the zzso and zzso zzso unfolding demonstrated that the zzso contributed significantly to the zzso stability of zzso This appears to be due to the formation of two zzso zzso The zzso were zzso active, exhibiting half of the zzso zzso activity of zzso However, zzso analysis showed that deletion of both 5 and 10 zzso zzso resulted in loss of the zzso zzso properties of zzso providing functional evidence that the zzso is important for zzso activity and zzso zzso A more detailed study of the zzso may assist in identifying the molecular basis for the zzso and zzso activities of zzso
