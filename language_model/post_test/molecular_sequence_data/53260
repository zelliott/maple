zzso zzso factor 2 zzso a putative zzso factor found in the human central nervous system, was cloned from an expression zzso library from human zzso zzso shares weak similarity to bacterial type I zzso and shares zzso sequence identity to a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at or above equal zzso ratios generated zzso patterns that were abolished by zzso Thus, zzso appears to relax zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso pattern of zzso complexes was shown to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to enter the S phase of the cell zzso
