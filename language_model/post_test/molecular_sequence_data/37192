Secondary and zzso structures of human blood zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, have been studied for the first time by infrared and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed details of the secondary structure and the structure content predicted by zzso modeling of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bands, and zzso zzso structure at pH zzso Our model shows that the protein folds as a highly symmetrical zzso protein dominated by a single zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics in the range zzso degrees C followed by zzso zzso and analyzed by principle component analysis revealed full zzso of the protein motion upon heating dominated by decreasing of zzso zzso difference zzso confirmed the proximity of zzso to zzso zzso
