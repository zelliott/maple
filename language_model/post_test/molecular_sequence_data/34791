To evaluate the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso relationships of its members, partial nuclear large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso from 10 species of zzso and 15 related zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso was zzso zzso and its members were divided into three zzso The constrained tree excluding zzso zzso (the type species of zzso from zzso core group was zzso thus rejecting the zzso concept to segregate zzso from zzso The zzso of zzso belonging to zzso zzso complex was zzso thus rejecting the complex definition based on zzso zzso The exclusion of zzso zzso (the type species of zzso from zzso core group was rejected and zzso proved to be zzso in both best zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with zzso core group also was zzso zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso and formed an independent lineage from zzso core group at the zzso position of brown rotting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso tree zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso was similar to the one of the best zzso tree based on the zzso analysis but showed a higher likelihood score in the zzso test and reflected better evolutionary patterns for the zzso of zzso
