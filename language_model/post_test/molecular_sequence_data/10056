The kidney and several other zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso hormone zzso protein zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 36 zzso on zzso responsible for most of the zzso zzso zzso and T4 zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from human kidney zzso and used to generate zzso zzso zzso of four peptides revealed identity to zzso acid sequences deduced from a human zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein is a major structural zzso lens protein with no known function in other zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends using a human brain zzso library and zzso zzso zzso confirming identity to the previously cloned human zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with significant zzso (40 to zzso with two bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso but not zzso bound zzso specifically with high affinity zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and was labeled by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso labeling of zzso fusion protein were activated by zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso The expressed protein displays the appropriate binding properties, indicating that zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso characterized in human zzso
