zzso synthesis in animals is controlled by the regulated transport of zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso where the zzso factors are processed zzso to release active zzso Transport is inhibited by either cholesterol or zzso blocking cholesterol zzso zzso acts by binding to the zzso protein zzso thereby causing zzso to bind to anchor proteins called zzso Here, we show that zzso act by binding to zzso causing zzso to bind to zzso zzso analysis of the six zzso zzso of zzso reveals that the third and fourth are important for zzso binding to zzso and to zzso These studies define zzso as zzso zzso explaining the zzso ability of zzso to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in animal zzso
