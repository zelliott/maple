zzso and subsequent zzso degradation serve as a well characterized mechanism to fine-tune and zzso zzso zzso However, other members of the zzso zzso family have been reported to be zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso of zzso is regulated in an zzso zzso zzso zzso were efficiently zzso whereas zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso indicating trafficking via early zzso to late zzso zzso A zzso motif within the zzso sequence that lacks from zzso was necessary both for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and provided a binding site for a WW zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso promoted its zzso into zzso zzso and zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso negative zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso differ in zzso and degradation by a mechanism zzso by zzso zzso motif interacting with a WW zzso zzso zzso zzso
