To investigate the factors that contribute to the exceptionally high affinity binding of zzso to human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso zzso and zzso with native and chemically modified zzso were examined using zzso and zzso zzso 

The binding affinity of zzso as well as zzso to zzso was lower than that of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The percentage of zzso that binds to zzso was low at zzso pH but increased with increasing zzso reaching a maximum at pH zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso was comparable to that of zzso No significant difference was found for the binding of zzso to zzso and A zzso of zzso Chemical modification of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused a decrease in percentage of bound zzso zzso zzso showed the largest decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso results indicate that zzso zzso play a prominent role in the binding of zzso to zzso 

A zzso at position zzso of zzso appeared to influence the binding specificity of the drug, and zzso zzso in zzso play a prominent role in the high affinity binding of zzso to zzso
