The full-length zzso for the zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso A single zzso point was found and the sizes of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were according to the parental zzso The zzso zzso site zzso domain sequence of the zzso protein was identical to those of zzso 2 zzso while the zzso region of the zzso protein was identical to those of zzso zzso zzso For the parental zzso two hairpin structures, zzso and zzso were predicted for the zzso zzso and downstream of the crossover site, which were not present in the zzso zzso zzso shared similarity with the zzso hairpin of zzso zzso virus zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso extension during zzso This study suggests that zzso has emerged by zzso zzso during zzso synthesis via template switching because of constraints imposed by the zzso hairpin of the zzso zzso
