Brown zzso bites are associated with zzso including zzso zzso spreading and a massive inflammatory response, along with systemic problems that may include zzso disturbances and zzso zzso The mechanisms by which the zzso exerts its noxious effects are currently under zzso It is known that the zzso contains a major toxin zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that can zzso induce zzso inflammatory response, animal mortality and zzso zzso zzso we describe zzso zzso zzso zzso and functionality of a novel zzso of the 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis evidenced correct folding for the zzso The zzso toxin was recognized by whole zzso serum zzso and by a specific zzso to a previously described zzso zzso The identified toxin was found to display zzso activity and zzso zzso Additionally, the toxin caused a massive inflammatory response in rabbit skin zzso evoked zzso zzso increased vascular zzso caused zzso and death in zzso These characteristics in combination with functional studies for other zzso toxins illustrate that a family of zzso toxins exists, and includes a novel member with high activity that may be useful for future structural and functional zzso
