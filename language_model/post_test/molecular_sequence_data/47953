zzso heavy chain class switching to zzso is directed by zzso and zzso by inducing zzso from the zzso zzso zzso A crucial zzso factor in this process is zzso which binds to a specific DNA element upon zzso zzso In this paper it is shown that the B zzso and zzso factor zzso interacts with a closely spaced sequence in the human zzso zzso promoter that zzso with a previously described binding site for zzso zzso zzso The authenticity of zzso was demonstrated by specific competition and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, in zzso translated zzso could interact with an zzso derived from the zzso zzso promoter containing the zzso binding site and migrated with the same mobility compared with the complex formed with nuclear zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso promoter reporter gene zzso demonstrated that zzso affecting DNA binding of zzso or zzso zzso zzso had no or little effect on zzso zzso of these zzso However, point zzso that abolished binding of both factors zzso zzso zzso No strict spacing of the zzso and the composite zzso zzso B elements is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding was retained in zzso zzso zzso double zzso The data demonstrate that cooperation of zzso with at least zzso or zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso
