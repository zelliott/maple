We have recently isolated a zzso zzso the zzso major zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso Southern zzso analyses indicate that this protein is zzso by a single copy gene in zzso major and that this gene is highly zzso throughout the zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in both zzso major zzso and zzso however, zzso transcript levels can be zzso in zzso by a shift in culture temperature from 26 to 37 degrees zzso zzso of transcript was zzso within zzso of heat shock and continued to increase for a further 8 h before returning to zzso zzso In addition, zzso incorporation of zzso followed by zzso revealed an increase in the level of nascent zzso protein zzso when zzso cultures were shifted from 26 to 37 degrees zzso The zzso major zzso protein and the heat shock proteins zzso and zzso form a zzso complex in zzso major zzso as evidenced by zzso using an zzso specific for zzso major zzso Furthermore, this complex can be zzso in zzso by adding zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso tag to zzso zzso and subsequent zzso using metal zzso affinity zzso
