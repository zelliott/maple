A previously zzso DNA unwinding zzso referred to as the zzso zzso was recently zzso from zzso coli cell extracts and zzso characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to initiate the genetic analysis of the zzso zzso the gene zzso this zzso was zzso DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the gene since the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso precisely matched the sequence of the first 27 zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso is similar in several regions to the zzso acid sequences of two other zzso coli zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso was mapped to 22 zzso on the zzso coli zzso We propose that this newly defined locus be referred to as zzso and, to avoid confusion with other zzso coli zzso with a similar molecular size, we propose that the zzso zzso be referred to as zzso zzso
