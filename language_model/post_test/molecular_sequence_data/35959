zzso growth factor zzso has been shown to be involved in zzso induction during zzso zzso Its presence in the zzso suggests that zzso is an zzso zzso By zzso chain reaction zzso methods and by screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso library with a zzso probe for human zzso zzso we have isolated two full-length zzso zzso which we designate zzso and zzso based on their zzso to the human zzso receptors zzso and zzso Both zzso clones zzso zzso zzso receptors that share characteristics common to members of the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso identical overall with the human zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to the human zzso zzso overall zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of both receptors are remarkably zzso The two receptors show distinct patterns of regulation during early zzso zzso first appears as a zzso derived zzso and zzso levels remain constant during early zzso zzso However, zzso zzso is first expressed at the late zzso stage, which suggests that its expression is a result of zzso zzso Furthermore, northern zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso is distributed evenly in the early zzso while zzso zzso is predominantly localized to the zzso zzso At zzso stage, zzso transcripts are localized primarily to the neural and zzso zzso zzso transcripts are most abundantly expressed in neural zzso and more transcripts are detected in lateral plate zzso than in the zzso When animal cap zzso of zzso are cultured in the presence of zzso factors, zzso zzso levels are maintained by zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels are significantly zzso These observations suggest a differential expression and regulation of zzso receptors in early zzso zzso
