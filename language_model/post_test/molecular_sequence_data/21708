zzso in the vitamin K zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso of house mice zzso zzso zzso can cause resistance to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Here we show that resistant house mice can also originate from selection on zzso zzso acquired from the Algerian mouse zzso zzso through zzso zzso We report on a zzso zzso zzso region in European zzso zzso zzso that stems from zzso zzso spans zzso zzso on zzso 7, and includes the molecular target of zzso zzso zzso We show that in the laboratory, the zzso complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso resistance when zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso with selection on the zzso zzso after the introduction of zzso in the 1950s, we found signatures of selection in patterns of variation in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we detected zzso protein evolution of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in radical zzso acid zzso that apparently cause zzso tolerance in zzso zzso as a zzso zzso Thus, positive selection produced an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the donor species, zzso zzso which crossed a species barrier and produced an zzso zzso trait in the recipient species, zzso zzso zzso
