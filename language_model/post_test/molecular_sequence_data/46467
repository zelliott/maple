The expression of the zzso diphtheria toxin zzso zzso in bacteria other than zzso zzso has proven to be zzso Here we propose a new and alternative procedure for the production of full-length zzso in zzso zzso The present study relates specifically to the expression of an artificial sequence and to a method for the isolation and zzso of the corresponding zzso In particular, a synthetic gene coding for zzso bearing a short zzso tag and zzso for zzso coli zzso zzso was cloned in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the protein was simply induced with zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso protein was zzso and always found inside protein zzso which were zzso using zzso Surprisingly, the expression of zzso devoid of the short tag, always zzso Following a zzso step, the zzso zzso was zzso by affinity and zzso zzso and the purity of the final preparation reached zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein features zzso activity, indicating that the presence of the tag is not affecting its zzso zzso However, the removal of the synthetic tag could be easily obtained by zzso the target protein with a proper quantity of a commercial zzso
