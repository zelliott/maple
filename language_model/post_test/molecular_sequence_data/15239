zzso zzso plays a key regulatory role in a variety of cellular zzso To better understand the function of protein zzso in seed zzso a zzso cloning method was employed and five zzso clones zzso for protein zzso were isolated from a zzso library prepared from immature seeds of kidney bean zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences showed that the five protein zzso zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso type 3 zzso family, which interacts with zzso zzso proteins zzso Two zzso clones zzso and 2) for zzso were further isolated from the zzso zzso The predicted primary sequences of the proteins zzso and 2) displayed significant identity (more than zzso with those of other plant zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the isolated zzso except zzso are expressed in leaves and early maturing seeds, whereas zzso is zzso expressed during seed zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that among the five zzso only zzso interacts with both zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso protein zzso via zzso complexes occurs during seed zzso
