zzso structure was investigated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso focusing on the Coral zzso zzso We used as genetic marker a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso in a total of 147 individuals from 26 sampling zzso The zzso network of zzso zzso was split into seven distinct zzso within the Coral zzso zzso Different zzso had exclusive but zzso geographic zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso Strong genetic differences were also zzso between local populations within a zzso where zzso zzso between geographically adjacent samples was observed on several zzso Nearly zzso of the total molecular zzso could be ascribed to differences between geographic samples within a zzso whereas zzso variation accounted for zzso of the total zzso The strong zzso structure observed within a zzso can be explained by either zzso or female zzso We interpret the zzso distribution of zzso as the joint result of 1) expansion from refuge populations at times of low sea level, and 2) possible enhanced competition between individuals from different zzso or zzso zzso or hybrid zones, along lines of secondary zzso The zzso structure uncovered in the present study parallels regional differences at nuclear marker zzso thus pointing to zzso zzso within Coral zzso zzso zzso
