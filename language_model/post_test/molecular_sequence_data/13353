A 400 base pair region of the zzso zzso zzso I gene zzso was zzso for zzso species of zzso representing zzso zzso The sequence was found to be highly zzso with zzso divergence within families, and up to zzso divergence between zzso zzso analysis using the zzso method shows the zzso zzso as a distinct zzso but also shows that all other zzso zzso zzso soon after the zzso zzso zzso some species are grouped within their respective families, others are too zzso for easy zzso The main disagreement with trees constructed using comparative zzso and the fossil record is the position of the zzso zzso zzso may be an zzso gene for molecular zzso at lower zzso levels, or in other insects, improved resolution of this particular zzso will require a more highly zzso zzso
