zzso termination of zzso in zzso coli involves the formation of an zzso hairpin in the nascent zzso This hairpin plays a central role in the release of the transcript and zzso at intrinsic termination sites on the DNA zzso We have created zzso of the zzso zzso zzso hairpin and examined the relationship between the structure and stability of this hairpin and the template positions and efficiencies of zzso The results were used to test the simple zzso acid zzso model of zzso and von zzso and showed that this model must be modified to provide a distinct role for the zzso sequence in the nascent zzso since a perfect zzso sequence that is sufficiently long to form an zzso hairpin that could destabilize the entire putative zzso zzso hybrid does not trigger termination at the expected zzso Rather, our results show that both a stable zzso hairpin and the run of zzso zzso zzso that immediately follows are required for effective intrinsic termination and that termination occurs at specific and zzso template positions relative to these two zzso zzso structural or kinetic modifications of the simple model are proposed in the light of these findings and of recent results implicating zzso and possible zzso zzso of zzso complexes in intrinsic zzso Thus, these findings argue that the structure and dimensions of the hairpin are important zzso of the zzso decision and suggest that a complete mechanism is likely to involve specific interactions of the zzso the zzso zzso zzso and, perhaps, the zzso template sequence that codes for the run of zzso zzso at the 3' end of the nascent zzso
