The large zzso zzso is a zzso that zzso in the zzso of nascent zzso from the plasma zzso Recently, zzso has been demonstrated to associate with the zzso apparatus in zzso cells by zzso and zzso zzso Additional studies using a well zzso zzso zzso have supported these findings by demonstrating a requirement for zzso function in the formation of zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso network zzso In this study, we tested if zzso zzso in zzso function in living cells through the expression of a dominant negative zzso construct zzso zzso zzso to express this zzso zzso and a zzso zzso resident protein zzso exhibit zzso structures that are either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of these zzso cells revealed large numbers of zzso stacks comprised of highly zzso zzso and an extraordinary number of coated zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated a marked retention zzso to zzso of the nascent viral zzso in the zzso compared to control zzso These observations in living cells are consistent with previous zzso and in zzso studies demonstrating a role for zzso in the formation of zzso zzso from the zzso
