We show that the zzso gene is essential for zzso survival and development by characterizing several zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso rescue and sequence analysis were used to identify the zzso gene as the zzso zzso group of the zzso region of zzso 3 zzso et zzso zzso zzso line zzso carrying an zzso zzso whose expression is driven by the zzso promoter, fully rescued the first to second zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso The molecular defects in two zzso zzso were zzso One of these zzso which resulted in second zzso zzso contained a zzso deletion in zzso segment 22 zzso at zzso acid zzso zzso producing a premature stop zzso between the two zzso hands found in this zzso The second zzso which resulted in first zzso zzso contained a 20 base pair deletion in the middle of segment 1 (at zzso acid zzso zzso resulting in a premature stop zzso zzso of the zzso larvae revealed a loss of contact between zzso cells of the gut and disruption of zzso zzso The most pronounced zzso change was seen in zzso of complex cellular architecture such as the middle zzso where a loss of cell contact between zzso zzso cells and neighboring zzso cells was accompanied by disorganization of the zzso cell brush zzso Our examination of zzso deficient larvae suggests that an important role of zzso zzso is to stabilize cell to cell interactions that are critical for the maintenance of cell shape and zzso organization within zzso
