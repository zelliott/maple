The zzso binding domain zzso family of proteins was defined based on sequence similarity in their DNA binding zzso In light of their high degree of zzso it is of inherent interest to determine the zzso distribution of these zzso and their associated zzso zzso One potential zzso of specificity resides in differences in the intrinsic DNA binding properties of the various zzso zzso In this report, we use a zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and neutral zzso to calculate zzso binding zzso zzso proteins were zzso on pairs of zzso and zzso duplex zzso corresponding to the promoter regions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and binding affinities for each case were calculated by zzso zzso With the exception of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all the zzso proteins showed higher affinity for zzso DNA (in the zzso zzso than for zzso DNA (in the zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso proteins in the affinity for zzso DNA were observed, ranging within two orders of zzso By zzso analysis of zzso and using zzso we demonstrate the critical role of specific zzso within the zzso in zzso selectivity for zzso zzso Interestingly, the binding affinity of specific zzso proteins for zzso DNA fragments from naturally occurring sequences are affected by local zzso zzso
