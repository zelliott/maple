zzso zzso are zzso zzso that regulate the zzso rhythm in animals and zzso In zzso two types of zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso rhythm, but rat zzso have not yet been zzso zzso we isolated and characterized zzso zzso from the rat zzso The cloned rat zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and has a single zzso frame that encodes the rat zzso of 594 zzso acids with start and stop zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the rat zzso was zzso identical with that of mice and zzso with humans, but it showed a relatively low identity of zzso with that of zzso It also exhibited a high zzso (about zzso with zzso of mice and zzso A Northern zzso analysis showed that rat zzso was expressed in all of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at a relatively higher level in peripheral zzso than in the zzso In zzso zzso in the whole brain indicated that the strong signal of zzso zzso is mainly present in the zzso nucleus zzso region, but very weak in other brain zzso zzso present results indicate that rat zzso may function in zzso zzso in the rat zzso
