The derived zzso sequences of the proteins zzso by zzso coli genes zzso and zzso have been compared with other protein sequences using computer assisted zzso This work has shown that zzso and D, which inhibit the propagation of zzso containing long zzso DNA zzso are zzso related to two putative zzso zzso These zzso both comprise two zzso chains which are the products of genes 46 and 47 of zzso T4 zzso 46 and zzso zzso and genes zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The comparisons reveal that zzso zzso 46 and zzso zzso are more closely related to each other than are zzso zzso 47 and zzso zzso zzso appears to have undergone a partial zzso of an ancestral zzso These proteins all contain motifs common to the zzso of zzso proteins that includes zzso and the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso
