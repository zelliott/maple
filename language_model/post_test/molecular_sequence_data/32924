The role of peptides zzso and zzso in the early zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso is frequently emphasized in the zzso It is known that zzso is more prone to zzso than zzso even though they differ in only two zzso zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso A direct comparison of the ensembles of zzso adopted by the zzso in solution has been limited by the inherent flexibility of the unfolded zzso Here, we characterize the zzso of zzso and zzso in water by using a combination of molecular dynamics zzso and measured zzso zzso data from zzso zzso We perform replica exchange MD zzso simulations and find that classical zzso reproduce the zzso data zzso when the sampling is extended to the zzso zzso Using the quantitative agreement of the zzso data as a validation of the model, we proceed to compare the zzso ensembles of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our analysis confirms the existence of structured regions within the otherwise flexible zzso zzso We find that the C zzso of zzso is more structured than that of zzso The formation of a zzso in the sequence zzso involving short strands at zzso zzso and zzso (in zzso reduces the zzso flexibility of the zzso zzso and may be responsible for the higher propensity of this zzso to form zzso
