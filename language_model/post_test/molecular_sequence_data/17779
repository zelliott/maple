zzso linked to zzso produce various types of zzso on a complementary target zzso The observed reactions include zzso of zzso bases and zzso reactions of the zzso to its target zzso zzso located close to the zzso zzso were the most altered as compared to more remote zzso on the target zzso No specific reaction was observed when the complexes were zzso at temperatures above the melting temperature of the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso reactions accounted for zzso zzso modification of the target chains in the zzso Our results show that zzso zzso linked to zzso are efficient systems for inducing irreversible zzso zzso on a target zzso
