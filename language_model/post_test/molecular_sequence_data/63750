zzso is a scorpion zzso that blocks zzso the zzso currents of the zzso zzso channel of rat zzso zzso zzso It was isolated from the zzso of the zzso scorpion zzso zzso and contains 38 zzso acid zzso with a zzso acid at the zzso zzso zzso has the lowest sequence identity zzso zzso among the six members of the zzso zzso of scorpion zzso In order to find out which zzso are important for the blocking effects of zzso six zzso were chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correctly folded and their zzso properties were zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for basically charged zzso acids increases the blocking activity of zzso specially the zzso zzso at the zzso segment of the zzso Analysis of zzso models of the zzso zzso and zzso supports the idea that basic zzso improve their blocking activities, similarly to what happens with zzso a toxic zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso which has the highest known blocking effects of zzso currents in zzso channels of rat zzso zzso zzso
