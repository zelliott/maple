The major biological effects of zzso are thought to be initiated through changes in the expression of cellular zzso However, the mechanisms involved in the suppression of some gene products by zzso are not well zzso zzso mouse zzso cells were treated with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso minus zzso zzso were used to screen an zzso zzso zzso Using this method, we found that the recently identified human protein zzso zzso promoter binding protein zzso zzso was induced by zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and binds to a specific DNA zzso Further investigation zzso zzso DNA elements located in the promoters of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play a role in the zzso repression of these and other zzso
