zzso of zzso gene expression is believed to be zzso by multiple nuclear factors that interact with zzso DNA sequences within the first 160 base pairs zzso of the zzso The minimal promoter sequence required to generate zzso expression has not been clearly zzso We have constructed a series of transient expression zzso containing progressive deletions of the mouse zzso gene zzso sequence fused to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene and include the zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso zzso activity was determined in mouse zzso and zzso cell lines by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All constructions were compared with zzso zzso which contains all the sequence zzso between the rat and mouse zzso Low levels of expression were observed with zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of promoter sequence to zzso zzso progressively increased activity to zzso in the zzso cells, while zzso and zzso zzso had activity similar to the zzso zzso level, and zzso zzso showed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso The inclusion of promoter sequences upstream of zzso generated low levels of expression in the zzso We also show that factors from mouse liver nuclear extracts protect at least five regions of the zzso promoter upstream of zzso Our results indicate that tissue specificity is established within the zzso promoter region and that additional zzso elements that may have a functional role in the efficiency of zzso gene expression are located upstream of zzso zzso
