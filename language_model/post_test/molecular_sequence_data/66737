zzso levels of zzso zzso alpha zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and bed nucleus of zzso zzso zzso have been hypothesized to play a significant role in the expression of male behaviors associated with zzso zzso the regulation of zzso could be a critical factor in determining male behavior and the evolution of zzso Central expression of zzso zzso was compared in hybrid offspring from crosses between two zzso distinct populations of prairie zzso zzso zzso Illinois zzso zzso are socially zzso and display low levels of zzso while Kansas zzso zzso display some characteristics associated with zzso and have higher levels of zzso In offspring from hybrid zzso the pattern of zzso expression was dependent upon zzso the two types of hybrid crosses did not produce the same zzso pattern in the zzso In the zzso and zzso hybrid males expressed zzso patterns consistent with those of males from their mother's population, while hybrid females had zzso patterns typical of females belonging to their father's zzso The zzso patterns of zzso expression are suggestive of zzso zzso therefore, the zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso and examined for zzso zzso zzso from this study indicate that while maternal factors may play a major role the expression of zzso in their male zzso zzso zzso is unlikely to be involved, suggesting another mechanism is zzso
