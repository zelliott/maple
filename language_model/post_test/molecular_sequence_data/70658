In zzso fish, zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso involved in the production of zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of two zzso which zzso proteins with high zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso from rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA analysis showed that the two zzso zzso are derived from two different zzso Northern zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that trout zzso are broadly expressed in various zzso zzso characterization using zzso zzso proteins produced in zzso coli showed that the product of one of the two zzso had both zzso and zzso activity, but the other had neither zzso Although the functional significance of the two genes remains zzso these results clearly demonstrate the presence of two distinct zzso transcripts in the trout zzso
