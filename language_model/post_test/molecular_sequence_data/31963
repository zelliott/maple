zzso zzso zzso regulates embryonic development and adult tissue zzso zzso of its zzso components including zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein complex occupies a central position in the zzso zzso zzso pathway, especially in zzso Here structures of full-length human and zzso zzso the human zzso complex, along with normal mode analysis and zzso measurement results, reveal that zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso is stabilized by zzso binding and inhibited by zzso treatment, whereas the zzso state of zzso is promoted by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of critical interface zzso disrupt the zzso complex and prevent zzso from zzso zzso transcription, zzso zzso in the zzso and protecting zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Our study thus provides zzso insight into the mutual recognition and regulation between zzso and zzso
