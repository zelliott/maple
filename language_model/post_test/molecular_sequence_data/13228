The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that possesses two zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate the existence of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso have separate, zzso expression zzso Further, the data clearly indicate that control of which of the two zzso is to be expressed is initiated at the zzso level, suggesting that they have distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the product of a delayed early response gene in zzso zzso zzso and its zzso is regulated through a zzso that requires protein zzso zzso The human zzso of zzso zzso has also been cloned and is strongly zzso in the early stages of zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates and cellular zzso experiments confirm that this zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore the initial example to our knowledge of a zzso zzso zzso that contains two tandem of zzso zzso
