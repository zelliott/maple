zzso zzso channels zzso mediate rapid chemical zzso in the zzso zzso This gene zzso includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 3, and zzso zzso Upon zzso binding these receptors undergo a rapid zzso transition from the closed to open zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso between zzso binding and channel gating remains poorly zzso in part due to the lack of a high-resolution structure of the entire zzso zzso zzso and zzso published a 4A resolution structure of the zzso and proposed that a single zzso 44 in zzso 2 of the zzso zzso as a critical zzso of a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso in zzso Here we examined whether this proposed zzso mechanism also contributes to channel zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso We zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso 44 in the zzso zzso zzso 56 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results obtained in this study do not support a simple zzso mechanism of zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This conclusion is consistent with other recent reports in which zzso of zzso distributed throughout several zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors had large effects on gating zzso
