zzso is a zzso acid zzso and acts as a potent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is reported to zzso zzso transmission and to block the spinal zzso that is thought to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the authors investigated the effect of zzso administered zzso and zzso zzso on the level of zzso zzso after partial zzso nerve injury in the zzso 

zzso zzso nerve injury was created by tight zzso of one third to one half of the right zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso was evaluated by the difference score, which was calculated by zzso the paw withdrawal zzso against zzso zzso stimulation in the zzso paw from that in the injured zzso Drugs were administered zzso 7 or 11 days after the nerve injury, and the level of zzso zzso was measured 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 zzso after the drug zzso 

zzso injection of zzso but not of zzso antagonists, attenuated the level of zzso zzso in a zzso manner at a dose of zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso injection of zzso attenuated the level of zzso zzso induced by partial zzso nerve injury, and zzso zzso spinal zzso does not play an important role in maintaining zzso zzso in rats with partial zzso nerve zzso
