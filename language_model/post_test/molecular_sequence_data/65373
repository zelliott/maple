zzso zzso T cells, so called zzso cells, constitute a newly identified zzso cell population, which is critically involved in some inflammatory zzso To explore the role of zzso cells in zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso a model of human zzso zzso where zzso responses predominantly participate in the zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso for disease zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso was induced in zzso mice just like in zzso zzso mice at early zzso of the zzso However, at zzso zzso the severity was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was comparable between zzso and zzso mice during the time zzso In zzso blockade of zzso and zzso resulted in zzso of zzso at later zzso with zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrated that zzso zzso in the late zzso of zzso and also that zzso and zzso responses are zzso required for zzso
