The zzso zzso is the mother compound of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso partially complementary zzso that are zzso if expressed correctly, to code for zzso were zzso to yield long and zzso DNA by zzso and zzso After addition of two stop zzso to the zzso DNA, the DNA segment was inserted between the zzso coli zzso promoter and a zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso that would express a zzso zzso Another zzso zzso that would express a fused protein with a constitution of the zzso 167 zzso acids mostly from zzso and the following zzso was also zzso The zzso DNA on zzso was very unstable in most of zzso coli zzso zzso except for strain zzso Upon induction of the zzso promoter with zzso acid, zzso coli zzso harboring zzso formed inclusion bodies which were observed under an optical zzso However, analyses of the inclusion bodies revealed that they consisted of many species of proteins derived from the host strain with a small amount of the zzso which could be detected by an zzso method with zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso directed the synthesis of the fused zzso as inclusion bodies, which was calculated to be zzso of the total cellular zzso
