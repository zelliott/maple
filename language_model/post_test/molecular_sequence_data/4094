The zzso X zzso zzso is a key regulator in multiple signaling pathways because it can form either a zzso with itself or a zzso with members of the class I nuclear zzso The zzso zzso regulate zzso by recruiting zzso or zzso to the target zzso The binding of zzso to zzso is zzso through a zzso pocket formed in part by the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about interactions of zzso with zzso and its roles in zzso zzso Here we show that the repression activity of zzso zzso with its binding to the zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso hormone receptors zzso This intrinsic repression activity is masked by the zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding by the zzso zzso requires specific zzso acid sequences and the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso site on zzso is independent of zzso 11 but zzso with the zzso zzso On the basis of these results, we propose a structural model to help understand the molecular mechanism of zzso recruitment by zzso
