With the cloning of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a new family of inwardly zzso zzso channels has been zzso zzso channel zzso are highly and zzso expressed in zzso zzso segments of the zzso zzso These channels exhibit many of the characteristics of the low zzso zzso zzso channels found in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and principal cells that are involved in zzso zzso Thus zzso channel zzso appear to be involved in the formation of these zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of these channels should provide further evidence for their role in the zzso zzso channels and new insights into the function and regulation of these zzso
