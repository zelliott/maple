The search for diverse plant zzso zzso zzso bacteria is gaining momentum as efforts are made to exploit them as zzso for various economically important zzso In the present study, 17 zzso strains belonging to eight different zzso isolated from rice zzso fields were screened for multiple zzso traits and evaluated for their zzso effects on canola and rice zzso All of the strains tested positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and production of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, four of the strains were able to zzso zzso zzso five tested positive for zinc zzso zzso and sulfur zzso zzso and eight strains produced zzso Based on the presence of multiple zzso traits, 10 strains were selected for zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso resulted in maximum root length zzso zzso vigor, and dry biomass in zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso exhibited the lowest activity under zzso zzso However, under pot culture conditions, zzso zzso zzso significantly increased plant height and dry biomass production by zzso and zzso zzso zzso plants and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly higher zzso zzso In greenhouse experiments, zzso zzso zzso increased rice plant height by zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced biomass production by zzso and rice zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso zzso Our findings indicate that most of the selected strains possess multiple zzso properties that significantly improve the growth parameters of the two plants when tested under controlled zzso
