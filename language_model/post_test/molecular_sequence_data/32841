Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene amplification system are routinely used to generate stable producer zzso cell clones in zzso zzso The present study proposes a novel method by the zzso of the zzso zzso targeted to zzso gene for improvements of selecting zzso clones in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso also resulted in improving the stability of the zzso protein expression in the absence of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This new method is proposed to generate highly expressed stable cell clones of both zzso and zzso zzso cells for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso designed in this study can improve zzso expression through zzso gene amplification in other zzso cell lines for vaccine zzso
