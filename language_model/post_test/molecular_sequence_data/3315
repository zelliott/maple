The genetic diversity among the Indian zzso A zzso disease virus zzso zzso sampled over a period of 24 years zzso was studied by sequencing the zzso zzso In the zzso tree, constructed from 83 Indian and 37 other available zzso the zzso type A zzso were distributed into 10 major zzso zzso as zzso The Indian zzso were distributed in 4 zzso zzso IV, VI and zzso and zzso of at least 2 zzso zzso and zzso in different states of the country in recent years is evident from the zzso The study also revealed differential geographic distribution of zzso for example, some zzso I and zzso were recovered from large geographical areas, some time even across the continents, suggesting the spread of the viruses beyond zzso zzso zzso of zzso restricting to a particular country zzso III and zzso was also observed in the zzso The genetic diversity in the field zzso has been discussed in relation to the zzso acid zzso at the known zzso zzso This work provides valuable insights into the zzso situation of type A zzso in India and necessary information in the selection of suitable vaccine zzso if required, for the National zzso control zzso
