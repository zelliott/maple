zzso is a zzso of zzso of approximately 70 and 80 zzso zzso and zzso zzso that binds to DNA zzso zzso cells lacking zzso are defective in DNA zzso break zzso repair and in zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the identification and zzso of zzso the gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso disruption enhances the zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso functions in a DNA zzso repair zzso that does not rely on zzso zzso Indeed, through using an in zzso zzso rejoining zzso we find that zzso plays an essential role in illegitimate zzso events that result in the accurate repair of restriction zzso generated zzso Interestingly, in the absence of zzso residual repair operates through an zzso zzso that results in zzso between short direct repeat zzso This resembles closely a zzso zzso repair zzso in zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso mechanisms for zzso repair exist in zzso Furthermore, they imply that zzso binds to zzso in zzso and promotes repair both by enhancing accurate DNA end joining and by suppressing alternative zzso repair zzso Finally, we report that zzso zzso zzso display dramatic zzso zzso suggesting that, in addition to zzso DNA damage, zzso also binds to naturally occurring zzso zzso These findings raise the possibility that zzso protects zzso zzso from zzso attack and functions as part of a zzso length sensing zzso
