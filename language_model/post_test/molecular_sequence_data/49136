The mixed lineage leukemia gene zzso also known as zzso zzso and zzso located at zzso is involved in zzso with over 40 different zzso bands in a variety of leukemia zzso Here we report our analysis of a rare but recurring zzso zzso This zzso has been described in a small subset of cases with both acute zzso leukemia and zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso is fused to zzso in the zzso Here we zzso a sample from another patient with this zzso and confirm the presence of an zzso zzso However, we have also identified and cloned another fusion transcript from the same patient zzso In this fusion transcript, zzso is fused to a novel zzso zzso partner containing zzso domain zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso fusion transcripts with the potential to code for novel fusion zzso zzso is also located on zzso 15, approximately 170 zzso zzso to zzso zzso contains a highly zzso zzso the zzso domain which, in other zzso has been shown to bind to zzso zzso zzso The zzso fusion may be functionally important in the leukemia process in at least some patients containing this zzso
