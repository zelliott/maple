A gene that codes for a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso has been identified in the zzso of zzso zzso A native zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso soluble zzso had strong affinity for zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso could rapidly degrade zzso zzso in zzso without the need for zzso zzso of the zzso to remove surface zzso zzso almost all the final zzso products produced from the in zzso degradation of zzso zzso by zzso were zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso could also zzso zzso zzso zzso with the generation of zzso zzso The disruption of the zzso gene significantly affected zzso zzso zzso during the zzso stage in zzso zzso as demonstrated by transmission electron zzso and the measurement of the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is functional in zzso zzso zzso in zzso Some of these features, which are in striking contrast with those of other known zzso zzso zzso may provide an advantage for zzso zzso zzso in zzso production of the zzso valuable zzso compound zzso
