We have zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso a gene zzso sensory zzso I zzso The gene has been zzso for cassette zzso by incorporating 30 unique restriction sites with uniform spacing throughout the zzso coding zzso For zzso the coding region was placed downstream of the promoter and translation initiation region of the zzso gene on a zzso zzso This construct encodes zzso with an extended N zzso that includes the zzso acid leader sequence and the zzso acid N zzso of zzso To obtain a zzso zzso zzso strain for expressing the synthetic zzso we used zzso zzso to delete the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The deletion strain was transformed with the synthetic zzso expression zzso Using zzso directed against the zzso region of zzso we detected in zzso zzso a protein with the zzso mobility expected for zzso with a processed zzso zzso The synthetic gene product was functionally identical to zzso Its zzso zzso difference spectrum and zzso reaction cycle in membrane envelope zzso were characteristic of zzso The protein fully restored zzso responses in the deletion zzso
