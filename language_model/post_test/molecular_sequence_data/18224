zzso zzso are zzso by a large zzso family with at least nine members, as determined by Southern zzso zzso Two expressed zzso represented by the beta 1 zzso clone and the beta 2 zzso zzso were examined in this zzso The two genes zzso zzso which show zzso sequence identity at the zzso acid zzso zzso beta 1 transcript levels were highest in zzso root tip and tissue culture cells, which are both rapidly dividing zzso No transcripts were detected in zzso leaf zzso In contrast, beta 2 transcripts were present at relatively high levels in tissue culture cells and at lower levels in zzso root tip and leaf zzso The zzso mobility of the beta 2 zzso was examined in relation to the constellation of zzso zzso on two-dimensional gel western blots of a zzso zzso total protein zzso No evidence for zzso modification of the zzso zzso was found in zzso
