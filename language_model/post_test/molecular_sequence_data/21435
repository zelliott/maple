zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso disease of fatty acid zzso mainly affecting long chain fatty acid zzso The disease usually presents at zzso period with severe zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso dysfunction, skeletal muscle zzso and zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso by molecular analysis of the zzso gene has recently become clinically zzso In contrast to zzso analysis, sequence analysis is a more rapid and reliable method for diagnosis of zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso sequencing and target array zzso to identify molecular defects in the zzso gene of patients with clinical features and an zzso profile consistent with zzso zzso Eight novel zzso including a large zzso zzso deletion encompassing zzso 5 to 9 of zzso were zzso Review of the published cases revealed that zzso zzso is a zzso disorder with a broad zzso zzso zzso are distributed along the entire gene without a hot zzso Two thirds of them are nonsense, zzso or zzso site zzso resulting in premature stop zzso This study underscores the importance of comprehensive molecular analysis, including sequencing and targeted array zzso of the zzso gene when zzso zzso is zzso
