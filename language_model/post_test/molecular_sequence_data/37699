A challenge for theories of general zzso is the existence of compounds predicted to be zzso but which, instead, do not produce zzso and often elicit other behavioral effects such as zzso This study focused on zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent volatile zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso were studied using the zzso zzso technique on zzso zzso currents in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors are promising molecular targets for the actions of zzso zzso general zzso zzso acted as a zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso but had no effect at zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso actions on zzso responses at zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso responses at zzso and zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso responses at zzso zzso zzso Point zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso which have been previously shown to abolish zzso of zzso responses by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso also zzso zzso of zzso responses by zzso These same zzso in the zzso zzso had only modest effects on the zzso actions of zzso zzso receptors with zzso zzso zzso to antagonism by zzso were still inhibited by zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso antagonize zzso responses by distinct sites or mechanisms of zzso In zzso antagonism of zzso receptors is likely to account for the zzso effects of zzso while the general zzso actions of zzso like those of other zzso zzso may be related to positive zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso
