zzso isolated from zzso snake zzso constitute a chemically homogeneous family of zzso Within this group several biologically different zzso zzso We report a comparative analysis of the structure of 20 zzso using circular zzso zzso methods and zzso zzso It is shown that zzso fall within two structural zzso zzso of group I are characterized by zzso CD zzso having an intense positive band close to zzso zzso and a negative trough at 225 zzso with no positive band around 230 zzso zzso strong zzso with a zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso toxin gamma and zzso a high tendency to form a reverse turn in the region of position zzso zzso of group II are characterized by zzso CD zzso displaying a much weaker positive band at zzso zzso a negative band around 210 zzso and a positive band at 230 zzso zzso little zzso with the aforementioned zzso and zzso a high zzso potential at position zzso It is suggested that the observed differences result from differing zzso in the zzso beta sheet which constitutes the main secondary structure of zzso
