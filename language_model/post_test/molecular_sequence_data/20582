Three zzso electron carriers, zzso and two zzso zzso with low- and zzso zzso are present in the purple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the growth rates of zzso lacking one, two, or all three electron carrier proteins showed that zzso is the main electron donor to the zzso reaction center and that zzso zzso zzso plays a subsidiary role in the electron donation in zzso growing zzso However, the triple deletion zzso was still capable of zzso growth, indicating that another electron donor could be zzso A new soluble zzso zzso which can reduce the zzso reaction center in zzso was zzso Based on zzso acid sequence comparisons to known zzso this zzso was identified as a zzso zzso c of the family of zzso zzso The quadruple zzso lacking this zzso and three other electron carriers showed about three times slower growth than the triple zzso under zzso growth zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso can function as a zzso electron carrier in the zzso electron transport chain in zzso zzso
