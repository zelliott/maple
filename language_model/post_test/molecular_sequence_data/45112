The zzso zzso domain of the major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso chain zzso has long been implicated in both correct folding and function of the zzso class II zzso To function correctly, zzso must form a zzso and the TM domain is one of the zzso thought to stabilize the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the TM domain have been shown previously to disrupt zzso class II functions such as mature complex formation and zzso zzso possibly due to disruption of zzso TM zzso zzso Although this hypothesis has been reported several times in the literature, thus far no experimental zzso have been made to explore the relationship between TM domain structure and TM zzso that affect zzso zzso We have applied zzso and zzso methods to study the folding and assembly of the zzso TM domain in isolation and find that the TM domain strongly zzso According to zzso zzso zzso the primary zzso state for this TM domain is a strongly associated zzso with a zzso constant of approximately 120 zzso in zzso zzso We have also examined the effect of functionally important zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the TM domain on its structure, providing results that now link the disruption of TM zzso interactions to previously reported losses of zzso zzso
