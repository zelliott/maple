zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was initially identified as a zzso zzso in zzso Recent studies show that zzso is a zzso zzso with diverse functions in cell zzso and other processes such as cellular zzso cell migration, proliferation and zzso In fish, the knowledge on the structure and function of zzso is limited as only zzso zzso has been characterized and shown to play a role in embryonic zzso In the present study, we isolated a zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso from grass zzso The deduced grass carp zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso acids shared zzso of similarity with the zzso in other zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed a zzso domain and two zzso growth factor zzso repeats in the zzso region of zzso which were both zzso in zzso from fish to zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso transcript was expressed with high abundance in skin, zzso zzso head zzso zzso zzso and head kidney zzso zzso Furthermore, real time zzso zzso was developed to assess zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso significantly increased zzso zzso expression in a zzso and zzso manner and the peak response was observed at zzso after treatment with 30 zzso of zzso These results indicated that zzso may be a zzso gene involved in the immune response in fish head zzso
