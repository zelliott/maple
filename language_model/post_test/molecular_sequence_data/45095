zzso is the zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso regulator that binds as a zzso to DNA containing zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of this protein family, binds to zzso (opposite polarity to zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso motif zzso its zzso repression function without zzso DNA zzso We report the X-ray crystal structures of DNA complexes with zzso and zzso and solution DNA binding studies of selected zzso zzso zzso These studies reveal the molecular details of zzso zzso zzso recognition, and suggest a role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso complex shows an unexpected conservation in the DNA recognition mode of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and points to a critical function of a zzso region between the zzso zzso cluster and zzso regions in DNA binding zzso Broader implications of these findings are zzso
