The zzso factor zzso recruits a 3' terminal zzso zzso zzso to selectively block zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously identified as an zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso and control of zzso zzso Here we investigate the protein and zzso zzso for this zzso zzso dissection and zzso zzso reveal the zzso zzso necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zinc finger domain of zzso was found to be responsible for the functional interaction with zzso We identify zzso zzso as an alternative zzso that functions with zzso in zzso and zzso we find zzso and zzso zzso control zzso zzso in embryonic stem zzso Our study indicates that zzso uses two different zzso to control zzso expression and has important implications for stem cell biology as well as zzso
