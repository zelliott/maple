Wheat high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso are the most important zzso of its superiority for making zzso zzso Following zzso these proteins are zzso into the zzso zzso and assemble into extremely large elastic zzso linked by zzso and zzso zzso zzso To study the structural requirements for the assembly of zzso we have expressed in transgenic wheat a zzso protein between two zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the natural zzso zzso and zzso zzso a significant amount of the zzso zzso remained zzso zzso zzso gel zzso coupled with limited zzso showed that the zzso form of the zzso zzso contained an unusual zzso zzso bond, linking an zzso zzso to the single zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso analysis revealed that this zzso zzso bond zzso the ability of the zzso zzso to assemble into zzso Despite of its altered zzso a notable amount of the zzso zzso zzso was also present in zzso zzso Moreover, its presence significantly altered the zzso composition of the zzso Our results show that it is possible to modify zzso assembly and properties by expressing zzso zzso in transgenic zzso and have a major implication for the improvement of wheat zzso zzso
