Most zzso zzso can be grouped into two structurally and mechanistically different zzso Whereas zzso by zzso zzso proceeds with little movements by the zzso zzso zzso exchange DNA strands by a mechanism requiring large zzso zzso Here we use zzso zzso to investigate the zzso changes that accompany the formation of the synaptic complex and the exchange of DNA strands by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso corresponding to the zzso region provides the first experimental evidence for interactions between zzso zzso within this region and zzso between different zzso zzso that have been observed in crystal structures of related zzso zzso zzso profiles between zzso introduced over the 35 zzso zzso region that constitutes most of the proposed rotating interface both support the long zzso structure of the region and provide strong experimental support for a zzso rotation mechanism that mediates DNA zzso
