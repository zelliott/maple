zzso virus, a zzso DNA zzso virus, is a major human pathogen from the zzso zzso The zzso is one of the zzso cycle proteins required for successful viral zzso In addition to the previously described zzso and zzso activities on zzso DNA and zzso zzso we observed an zzso activity for zzso virus zzso in the presence of zzso giving a possible explanation for its role in host zzso zzso Its crystal structure shows a zzso core of the zzso zzso zzso closely related to the zzso from zzso zzso with a bridge across the zzso zzso This bridge may reduce zzso activity, ensure zzso or play a role in strand separation of zzso zzso As the DNA strand that is subject to zzso is likely to make a sharp turn in front of the bridge, zzso activity on zzso DNA stretches appears to be possible, explaining the zzso of circular zzso
