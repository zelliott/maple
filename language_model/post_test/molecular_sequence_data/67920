In zzso the zzso of proteins to the plasma membrane via their zzso attachment to zzso zzso is essential and thus provides a valuable point of attack for the development of zzso zzso Unfortunately, studying the underlying biology of zzso synthesis is difficult, especially in medically relevant zzso pathogens because they are not genetically zzso Compounding difficulties, many of the genes in this zzso are essential in zzso zzso Here, we report the discovery of a new small zzso christened zzso (for zzso zzso zzso which selectively zzso zzso a critical zzso required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso After zzso the target specificity of zzso using genetic and zzso techniques, we used it to probe key, zzso relevant consequences of zzso zzso anchor metabolism in zzso We found that, unlike all three major classes of zzso in current use, the direct zzso activity of this compound results predominantly from its ability to induce overwhelming stress to the zzso zzso zzso did not affect the viability of zzso cells nor did it inhibit their zzso zzso This enabled its use in zzso experiments to examine zzso effects on zzso zzso In zzso of zzso zzso the most common zzso pathogen in humans, exposure to zzso at zzso zzso impaired zzso and unmasked cell wall zzso to stimulate a zzso zzso response in zzso zzso is a promising zzso drug target, and zzso is a useful probe for studying how zzso zzso synthesis zzso viability and alters zzso interactions in genetically intractable zzso
