Many examples of zzso zzso expansion in infiltrated diseased zzso have been zzso However, it remains to be established whether such observations can be generalized and to what extent zzso patterns obtained after in zzso culture of zzso infiltrates reflect in zzso zzso Using new high resolution analysis which requires no in zzso cellular expansion, we detected such zzso zzso expansions in 7/7 melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso of inflammatory skin during acute graft versus host disease zzso after zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso and 7/7 zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso expansions are readily observed when a sufficiently sensitive detection method is used, suggesting that similar expansions are the rule among zzso infiltrates in different zzso This observation and the monitoring of the in zzso evolution of such expansion during the course of the disease and during in zzso culture should have important clinical zzso
