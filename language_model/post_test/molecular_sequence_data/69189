Grass zzso zzso belong to the most important and widespread zzso of zzso zzso Using serum zzso from a grass zzso allergic patient, a complete zzso zzso a group II zzso was isolated from a zzso grass zzso zzso zzso expression zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso p II zzso shows an average sequence identity of zzso with the protein sequences determined for group zzso zzso from rye grass zzso zzso and a sequence identity of zzso with the zzso portion of group I grass zzso zzso from different zzso A zzso leader zzso similar to leader peptides found in other major grass zzso zzso heads the deduced zzso acid zzso indicating that group zzso grass zzso zzso belong to a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso p II, detected the protein exclusively in zzso and not in other plant zzso The zzso zzso p II was expressed in zzso coli and showed similar zzso capacity as the natural zzso
