zzso zzso complex zzso provides a core entry function through interactions with the fusion protein zzso and can also influence zzso through zzso zzso The zzso virus zzso and zzso serve both functions for entry into zzso and B cells, zzso Human zzso zzso zzso can be bound by the zzso proteins or zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso suggest that zzso interactions are necessary for the core entry function on all cell types, whereas the binding of zzso to zzso likely relates to a distinct zzso function for entry into some specific cell types zzso zzso but not others zzso zzso and zzso There are at least eight zzso of zzso that differ by 10 to zzso of zzso zzso and previous analysis of two zzso strains suggested that some zzso of zzso function like zzso zzso during assembly to leave zzso zzso in the zzso zzso while others remain bound to zzso For the current report, we analyzed the zzso complexes present in the zzso envelope of several zzso zzso each of which encodes a distinct zzso zzso zzso indicate that all strains of zzso contain stable zzso zzso and zzso zzso and little, if any, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained vastly more zzso than zzso whereas zzso zzso contained mostly zzso despite abundant zzso zzso remaining in the infected zzso zzso of zzso expression during zzso replication dramatically shifted the ratio toward zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is less efficient than other zzso zzso at competing with zzso for binding to zzso Thus, zzso diversity may influence the zzso of zzso through effects on the assembly of the core versus zzso zzso zzso
