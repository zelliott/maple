Although the integration of zzso B virus zzso into human DNA has been found to be associated with the development of zzso zzso zzso the molecular mechanism remains zzso In order to obtain additional insight into the correlation of zzso integration and zzso development, integrated zzso in 14 primary zzso cases was isolated and characterized by sequencing zzso Our findings in this study showed that: zzso none of the known cellular zzso or tumor zzso gene was affected by the zzso zzso zzso although the integration of zzso is random, the integration site was often within or close to human repetitive zzso zzso integrated zzso may possess the capacity to transpose to another zzso region through zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequence were observed in all the 14 zzso involving (most zzso X zzso zzso P zzso S zzso and C zzso zzso and zzso zzso X gene and zzso zzso truncated X protein caused by zzso integration was observed in 10 zzso These deletions cause the losses of zzso zzso repression binding site, zzso factor zzso binding site, and zzso effect domain, leading to cell proliferation and zzso This finding suggests that zzso X gene caused by the zzso integration may play an important role in the zzso zzso
