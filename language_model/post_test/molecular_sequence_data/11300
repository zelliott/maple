DNA zzso beta zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that plays a central role in zzso base zzso zzso To better characterize the mechanisms governing rat pol beta activity, we examined zzso on synthetic zzso of different zzso zzso kinetic analyses revealed that the zzso efficiency of pol beta zzso is strongly influenced by gap size and the presence of a zzso group at the zzso of the zzso pol beta exhibited the highest zzso efficiency on zzso zzso gapped zzso This efficiency was zzso times higher than on zzso zzso and zzso (with or without zzso gapped zzso and 2,500 times higher than on zzso with no zzso The zzso zzso zzso of pol zzso as judged by its ability to form zzso zzso was also higher zzso zzso on zzso zzso gapped DNA compared with the other DNA zzso zzso These data suggest that a primary function of zzso pol beta is to fill zzso zzso zzso
