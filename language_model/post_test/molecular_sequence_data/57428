zzso treatment of partially zzso zzso rats with zzso and zzso zzso the emergence of zzso zzso in rat zzso These zzso zzso cell populations are thought to contain the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the study presented here, we addressed the question of whether putative zzso in zzso zzso zzso can cooperate with activated zzso in the process of transformation in zzso Both zzso in zzso and transformation in zzso have been shown to be zzso processes requiring at least two independent transforming zzso zzso and zzso rat zzso were isolated by zzso zzso The purity of the zzso zzso was 88 zzso zzso in the zzso fraction and 84 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from both the zzso cell zzso and, for comparison, zzso from zzso rats were zzso by zzso with zzso expression zzso containing the zzso human zzso zzso gene and of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso DNA was similar in both zzso zzso No cell lines could be established by using the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso could be converted by zzso with the zzso zzso into permanent zzso growing cell lines with zzso zzso and zzso These cell lines expressed the zzso zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso are sensitive to transformation by the zzso zzso suggesting cooperation between putative zzso zzso in the zzso cells and the zzso zzso product in zzso zzso
