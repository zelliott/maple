zzso shows an immune response when challenged by injection of low doses of zzso To date, the molecules involved in this immune reaction have remained zzso with the exception of zzso zzso zzso peptides initially isolated from the zzso zzso zzso for which three closely related genes have been characterized zzso We report the molecular cloning and sequencing of a zzso from a library of immune zzso which encodes a novel member of the family of zzso zzso zzso peptides initially isolated from the fly zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso are detected 2 h after injection of zzso They are apparently derived from a single gene mapping at position 56 A on the right arm of the second zzso We discuss the existence of a distant relationship between the zzso and two other groups of zzso insect zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso
