The behavior of the complexes of zzso with the DNA zzso zzso and zzso in which the terminal AT base pairs are in either a zzso or a zzso zzso has been explored by molecular dynamics taking into account experimental data from zzso studies zzso and zzso zzso 1988, 27, zzso The DNA binding specificity of zzso appears to be the result of a subtle balance between stabilizing and zzso zzso Among the former is a number of hydrogen bonds between the zzso zzso of zzso and both the zzso and zzso groups of the zzso bases which decisively determine the strong affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso On the other hand, there appears to be an zzso zzso interaction between the zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso This zzso component of the stacking interactions also contributes to explaining the zzso preferences of the zzso zzso upon zzso zzso the zzso moment of an AT base pair is found to increase significantly and alter its relative zzso In the zzso complex, this arrangement helps to improve the stacking interactions with the zzso system, but would lead to zzso zzso interactions in the zzso zzso The bearing of these findings on the binding of zzso to several sequences as well as on the altered binding selectivity of other members of the zzso family of antibiotics is also zzso
