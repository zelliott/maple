zzso zzso the leading killer of young adults worldwide, newly affects one person every second and kills one in every 15 zzso The recent increase of zzso in developing countries has been exacerbated by many causes including pandemic zzso war and political instability, drug resistance, and increasing zzso zzso zzso has emerged with tremendous potential in vaccination against zzso with success in animal models with naked DNA zzso different genes such as zzso zzso and zzso However, there are shortcomings in translating this success into reality in human clinical trials due to limitations at the level of delivery, quality, and quantity of DNA to be zzso which can be zzso by using an attenuated bacteria delivery system for zzso vaccination for zzso zzso targeting the zzso sites of the immune zzso We compare this novel delivery system using an attenuated zzso delta zzso strain through a zzso route with classic intramuscular DNA delivery using a potential protective zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis in a mouse infection virulent challenge zzso We show an immune response and superior protection in the mice at the level of the lungs as well as the zzso against a virulent challenge after zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso rather than the classic DNA zzso and at par with the protection zzso by zzso This study establishes the proof of principle of this system for further exploitation of this platform for vaccine development, which is being pursued for zzso vaccine development for zzso
