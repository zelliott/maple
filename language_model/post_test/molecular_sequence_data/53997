Pig zzso transplanted into primates are rapidly rejected because of the interaction between Gal zzso zzso carried by the graft and natural zzso zzso zzso present in the blood of the zzso This report describes a simplified synthesis of the zzso zzso and its linkage to activated gel zzso The zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso donor with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to the free zzso whereas zzso alone resulted in the zzso zzso Both products were tested by zzso zzso of natural zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to be the best zzso Thus, the zzso group of the partially zzso zzso was zzso via the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso into an zzso group amenable to binding to zzso zzso gel zzso in order to obtain specific zzso zzso zzso made of gel zzso with 5 zzso of zzso per zzso were found efficient for the zzso of zzso zzso from human zzso
