zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso is a potentially powerful zzso zzso however, its therapeutic usefulness is limited by its cardiotoxic and negative zzso zzso zzso studies were undertaken to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso Single cell zzso zzso alpha zzso binding and Western zzso experiments demonstrated that rat cardiac cells predominantly express type I zzso alpha receptors zzso or zzso zzso alpha inhibited cardiac zzso zzso channel current zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is possible that the negative zzso effects of zzso alpha are the result of zzso blockade of cardiac zzso zzso
