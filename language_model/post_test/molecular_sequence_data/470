zzso cells use surface zzso receptors to discriminate self from zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain zzso has been considered the sole regulator of zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that the membrane zzso zzso binding zzso (the stalk zzso is critical to zzso binding and zzso The stalk region is required for zzso binding to zzso on target cells zzso zzso but is zzso for zzso binding to zzso on the same cell zzso zzso Also, signaling in a trans manner depends on the stalk region zzso the formation of the zzso zzso Thus, our data modeling zzso function at the cellular level reveal an essential role for the stalk region as a specific zzso of zzso signal integration, by which zzso interactions at the interface initiate and deliver information to the zzso separated zzso zzso
