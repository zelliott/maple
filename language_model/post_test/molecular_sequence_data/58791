Two types of zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso are structurally similar zzso with different tissue zzso The two zzso are organized into the following five zzso an zzso zzso two zzso zzso a zzso connecting the zzso zzso a zzso zzso Under the control of a zzso promoter, rat zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso The specific activities of the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and the most efficiently zzso saturated fatty acids were those with zzso carbon zzso Among zzso fatty acids with zzso carbon zzso the most preferred zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and, for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To determine the functionally important regions in the zzso zzso we constructed five zzso zzso lacking each of the five zzso Introduction of these zzso into zzso coli revealed that all five regions in zzso are required for functional expression of the zzso in zzso zzso deletion of any one of the five regions almost completely abolished the zzso zzso
