zzso in zzso regulation lies in a large part in the specificity of DNA binding by zzso zzso One group of zzso factors which are of great interest for studying zzso specificity is the zzso zzso proteins which contain two zzso DNA binding zzso a paired domain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins can bind to at least three types of specific DNA zzso the zzso binding sites, the zzso HD binding sites and a composite HD and zzso binding zzso We propose that zzso proteins regulate different zzso of their target genes through modular binding to one of these three specific zzso We show that, in a tissue culture system, a member of the zzso family, zzso is able to activate zzso after binding through either its zzso or its zzso The zzso zzso by one domain does not require DNA binding of the other zzso Furthermore, binding sites specific for the zzso of zzso are sufficient to mediate embryonic expression of a reporter gene in a zzso zzso The expression of the reporter gene is dependent on wild type paired function and, in a zzso zzso background, it can be rescued by an zzso paired gene zzso a protein whose HD is not able to bind to zzso Finally, we show that the zzso protein uses differently its zzso zzso domain when zzso is zzso through its zzso or its zzso These results and recent evidence from other zzso proteins strongly suggest that this class of proteins is able to achieve specific and modular zzso regulation through its multiple DNA binding zzso
