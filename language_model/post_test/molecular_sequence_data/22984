zzso from studies using molecular and genetic methods in humans and zzso suggest that zzso zzso factor zzso is involved in the behavioral effects of abused drugs, making understanding of its zzso structure and regulation of substantial zzso Recently, we have reported that the human zzso gene contains seven upstream zzso that can each be spliced independently to the major zzso coding zzso to form diverse zzso zzso zzso We also identified a novel zzso gene that is transcribed to produce alternatively spliced natural zzso transcripts zzso its fifth zzso zzso with the protein coding zzso VIII of human zzso To better understand zzso zzso structure and differential regulation, we now describe the zzso zzso gene and zzso This gene includes six zzso transcripts that are generated by six independently transcribed zzso each of which is spliced to a major coding zzso and a zzso transcript that is composed of two upstream zzso and one coding zzso In addition, we found no evidence for zzso opposite strand zzso gene transcripts in mice or zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso display specific patterns of differential expression in different brain regions and peripheral zzso Acute cocaine administration increased zzso expression of a specific zzso zzso zzso by up to zzso Interestingly, however, neither zzso nor self-administered chronic cocaine administration enhanced zzso zzso zzso These data suggest a role of specific zzso promoter regions and regulatory sequences in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in the zzso that changed zzso expression is likely to zzso in the zzso
