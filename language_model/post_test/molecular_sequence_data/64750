zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a single zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and are responsible for induction of embryonic zzso in zzso zzso and sex zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso is present in several species that have a zzso zzso However, the function of the zzso zzso remains zzso In the present study, we cloned the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso utilizing the rapid amplification of the zzso ends zzso The zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the longest open reading frame of this zzso encodes a zzso acid precursor protein that zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and three other zzso all of which have a common zzso zzso motif zzso ( zzso zzso zzso A zzso search showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso to those from other zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated a single message zzso corresponding to the size of zzso zzso from zzso zzso with significantly higher expression in the zzso of zzso zzso than zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed zzso zzso expression from zzso of both males and zzso When zzso zzso was injected into zzso larvae and zzso it did not induce zzso but rather efficiently broke zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to terminate zzso zzso is 20 zzso The other four zzso zzso from the zzso zzso precursor have cross activity for zzso zzso These observations therefore suggest a potential role for these zzso family peptides in promoting continuous development in several zzso zzso The high expression of this gene in zzso adults and adults indicates that the zzso family peptides may have multiple zzso zzso
