To explore the zzso and zzso distribution of zzso 4 of programmed cell death 1 zzso zzso and to analyze its relation to the zzso of developing systemic lupus zzso zzso in indigenous Han Chinese from zzso zzso 

Blood samples from 122 patients with confirmed zzso and 143 controls were collected for a zzso zzso DNA of the subjects was extracted and amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The single zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso locus and zzso locus were further confirmed by direct DNA sequencing and zzso 

The zzso zzso locus was zzso as type zzso among all the subjects zzso There were significant difference at zzso zzso locus with zzso zzso and zzso locus with zzso zzso between zzso patients and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso locus with types of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients were zzso zzso and zzso while in control they were zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was significant difference in the frequency of zzso in zzso locus between zzso patients and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso locus zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients were zzso zzso and zzso while in control they were zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was significant difference in the frequency of zzso in zzso locus zzso between zzso patients and controls zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso seemed to have the function of preventing the development of zzso ( OR zzso zzso OR zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso gene zzso locus was zzso in all indigenous Han Chinese, while the zzso of zzso gene zzso locus and zzso locus might affect the zzso to zzso zzso
