Members of the human protein zzso zzso are the major regulatory zzso involved in the activity control of zzso signal zzso zzso As protein zzso reside at the zzso of zzso signal transmission, comprehensive analysis of their cellular expression and zzso zzso can provide important insights into the architecture and functionality of signaling zzso However, in global zzso studies, low cellular abundance of protein zzso often results in rather minor zzso species that are zzso by a vast excess of peptides from other cellular zzso These zzso limitations create a rationale for zzso enrichment of protein zzso prior to mass zzso zzso Here, we employed stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso to compare the binding characteristics of three zzso affinity zzso by quantitative mass zzso The evaluated zzso tools possessed zzso zzso zzso as immobilized capture zzso and retained considerable zzso of the human zzso Based on these results, an affinity zzso displaying the broadly selective zzso zzso zzso was employed to zzso the relative expression of more than 170 protein zzso across three different, zzso cancer cell zzso These experiments demonstrated the feasibility of comparative zzso profiling in a compact experimental zzso Interestingly, we found high levels of zzso and low levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso leukemia cells compared with the adherent cancer lines zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was further exploited to zzso zzso for targeted zzso analysis, which revealed about 1200 distinct zzso sites on more than 200 protein zzso This zzso largest survey of zzso zzso across the zzso significantly expands the basis for functional follow-up studies on protein zzso zzso In conclusion, the straightforward experimental procedures described here enable different zzso of zzso zzso with considerable potential for future signal zzso and zzso drug target zzso
