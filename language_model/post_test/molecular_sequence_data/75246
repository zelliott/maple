A single stranded circular zzso was isolated from zzso infected with yellow zzso zzso The zzso which we have called zzso yellow zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso and has the potential to form the zzso secondary structure characteristic of zzso zzso has 37% sequence zzso with the recently described apple zzso skin zzso zzso 330 zzso and has some sequence zzso with the zzso in the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso has characteristics which fit the structural zzso described for the zzso zzso However, zzso lacks the zzso central zzso zzso Instead, there is a zzso sequence in the central region of zzso and zzso which has the potential to form a stem loop zzso and a stable zzso structure as does the central zzso region of the zzso zzso These structural features suggest there is a different central zzso region for zzso and zzso The results support the zzso nature of zzso and its inclusion into a separate zzso group which we suggest should be represented by zzso
