To study the zzso requirements of zzso from a zzso zzso area zzso zzso of respiratory zzso zzso virus fusion zzso zzso peptides of increasing length containing zzso acids essential for these zzso were zzso The synthetic peptides were tested for binding to a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso for this area as well as to rabbit zzso and human zzso zzso zzso binding was dependent on zzso zzso thus, a zzso zzso spanning zzso acids 215 to 275 of the F1 zzso zzso zzso reacted with more zzso than a shorter zzso zzso zzso and this one with more than the zzso zzso zzso Most human zzso zzso contained zzso that reacted with peptides zzso and zzso but failed to react with zzso The results of zzso binding could be related to the structure adopted by the peptides in solution, as determined by circular zzso zzso and zzso of peptides to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso abolished zzso with certain zzso supporting the notion that higher order structures were needed for zzso zzso High zzso zzso zzso were induced in rabbits zzso with the zzso however, these zzso failed to react with the native F zzso In mice, only the largest zzso zzso induced an zzso response, but their zzso reacted poorly with the native F protein and the animals were not protected against an zzso virus zzso These results illustrate the potential use of synthetic peptides in studies of the F protein physical and zzso structures as well as the problems in designing synthetic zzso virus zzso
