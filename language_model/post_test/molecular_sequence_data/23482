zzso zzso receptors of the zzso family play a significant role in vital cellular processes and in various zzso zzso members are unique among zzso as the regulatory elements of their zzso zzso are zzso ready for zzso Nevertheless, the receptors are not constantly zzso This apparent paradox has prompted us to seek mechanisms of regulation in zzso zzso domain that do not involve zzso changes of the zzso zzso Our zzso zzso based on the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso domain suggest that direct contact between the zzso and a segment from the zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso would then involve zzso zzso of this stable complex, for example, via zzso contact formation between the zzso zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The model provides an explanation at the molecular level for the effects of several zzso zzso zzso
