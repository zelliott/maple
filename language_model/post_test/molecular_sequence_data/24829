We found that zzso in small zzso zzso affect several zzso during the development of the fruit zzso In zzso zzso zzso have defects in zzso and the body wall muscles have defective zzso As adults, zzso flies have smaller and thinner zzso with a reduced diameter, suggesting a defective zzso zzso The zzso we observe are consistent with defects in cell zzso We identified zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso export protein that has been characterized in human zzso and zzso zzso as the protein zzso by the small zzso zzso Given that a global decrease in zzso export in these zzso is zzso the zzso we observe suggest that certain zzso are acutely sensitive to lower levels of zzso zzso and the zzso decrease in protein synthesis during key stages of cellular zzso
