In zzso cap 1 zzso is linked to higher levels of zzso however, the zzso responsible remains zzso We have validated the first zzso zzso cap 1 zzso zzso zzso a member of a zzso family that zzso the first transcribed zzso of spliced leader and zzso small nuclear zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to cap 0 zzso zzso in these zzso has zzso zzso on the first four zzso with base zzso on the first and fourth zzso zzso conveyed via zzso of a universal spliced zzso The function of this cap 4 is zzso zzso leader is the majority zzso zzso II zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso small nuclear zzso has the same first four zzso as spliced leader, but it receives an zzso cap with zzso at position one only zzso zzso Here we examine the zzso properties of zzso zzso Active over a pH range of zzso to zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso zzso constitute the zzso zzso zzso A zzso cap on zzso independent of its zzso zzso status is required for zzso recognition, but an zzso is not zzso zzso favors the spliced leader zzso zzso as reflected by a preference for A at position 1 and zzso of activity for zzso with base changes at positions 2 and zzso With similarities to human cap 1 zzso activity, zzso is an excellent model for higher zzso cap 1 zzso and the consequences of cap 1 zzso
