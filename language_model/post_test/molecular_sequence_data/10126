The zzso properties and sensitivity to different zzso have been determined for the reverse zzso zzso of group O human zzso virus type 1 zzso The zzso region was cloned from a new zzso group O isolate from Spain, expressed in zzso coli, and zzso by affinity zzso This new zzso showed zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the corresponding zzso of group M zzso B strain zzso The two zzso showed very similar zzso of zzso DNA zzso using zzso zzso and zzso H specific zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also similar for both zzso However, the two zzso differed dramatically in their sensitivity to several zzso While the zzso of the zzso isolate was sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso the zzso of the Spanish zzso group O isolate showed high-level resistance to those compounds zzso zzso 200 zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso of group O zzso contains three zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso which are found in group M zzso B strains resistant to zzso zzso zzso The zzso group O zzso zzso should be useful for studies aimed at discovering and designing drugs directed toward group O zzso of zzso
