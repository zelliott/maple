The zzso proteins comprise a large zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso recognizing a B cell surface zzso This zzso zzso zzso three proteins in the zzso zzso range and the smallest of these proteins has a striking zzso at its zzso to human zzso a zzso specific member of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso cells, this zzso is expressed in the zzso of B cells and is zzso by zzso activated B zzso This surface zzso is not B cell zzso Since zzso is not expressed by zzso cells, however, this zzso appears to recognize a new member of the zzso zzso
