zzso males and zzso females have a sex reversal disorder which can be caused by an abnormal interchange between the X and the Y zzso We have isolated and characterized a novel gene on the Y zzso zzso This gene is highly zzso to a previously isolated gene from zzso zzso and represents a member of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso gene zzso zzso interchange can occur anywhere on zzso zzso to zzso We can show that abnormal interchange happens particularly frequently between zzso and zzso In a collection of 26 zzso males and four zzso zzso between 27 and zzso of the zzso take place between zzso zzso but at different sites within the zzso zzso and zzso are located far from the zzso region where zzso exchange normally takes zzso The unprecedented high sequence identity and identical orientation of zzso to its zzso partner on the X zzso zzso explains the high frequency of abnormal pairing and subsequent zzso zzso leading to zzso males and zzso females and to the highest rate of zzso outside the zzso zzso
