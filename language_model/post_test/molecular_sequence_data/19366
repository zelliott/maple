Iron is both essential for bacterial growth and toxic at higher zzso thus, iron zzso is tightly zzso In zzso zzso the majority of zzso gene regulation is zzso by the zzso zzso regulator protein zzso a protein classically defined as a zzso zzso Recently, however, zzso studies have identified a number of genes in zzso zzso that are iron and zzso zzso demonstrating a new role for zzso as a zzso zzso Since zzso has been shown to indirectly activate gene zzso through the repression of small regulatory zzso molecules in other organisms, we hypothesized that a similar mechanism could account for zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we used a zzso approach to screen for the presence of zzso small zzso molecules in zzso zzso zzso This screen identified one small zzso zzso named zzso (for zzso regulatory zzso responsive to iron zzso which was demonstrated to be both iron responsive and zzso regulated and which has a zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, this screen identified a number of other zzso novel small zzso zzso Lastly, we zzso a new zzso approach to predict regulatory targets of the zzso small zzso This analysis led to the identification of the zzso and zzso zzso which were subsequently demonstrated to be under zzso regulation in an zzso zzso This study is the first report of small zzso in zzso zzso and the first to use a zzso approach to zzso a zzso regulatory targets of a small zzso
