The zzso are an important group of zzso bacteria inhabiting the zzso zzso strains of zzso identified zzso were evaluated by a combination of nearly complete and partial zzso zzso sequence that identified all strains as either zzso zzso or zzso zzso All sequences fell into cluster IV of the zzso while other species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fall into cluster zzso of the zzso zzso cluster IV sequences were used to design a zzso zzso zzso probe to assess the relative abundance of target populations in a stable zzso zzso A stable population zzso fed eight times per day) was established in sheep so that statistically robust comparisons could be made in the absence of variation due to zzso rumen zzso The steady state populations were sampled six times over a 24 d period and direct microscopic counts zzso total zzso counts zzso and total zzso counts zzso were zzso DC and zzso data zzso and zzso were compared with relative abundance estimates of zzso IV and zzso zzso A combination of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the bacterial population and zzso bacteria zzso by zzso zzso were zzso of the total zzso zzso These data suggest that a major portion of the zzso and zzso diversity has been cultured and is represented by available zzso Steady state populations were measured over several days in three sheep and an estimate of variation in DC, zzso zzso and zzso data were zzso These zzso estimates could be used to determine the theoretical sample sizes required to obtain statistically significant differences under different experimental zzso
