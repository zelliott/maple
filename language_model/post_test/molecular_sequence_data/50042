Class switch zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are mechanistically related processes that share common key factors such as zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown a role for zzso zzso in zzso in zzso In this paper we show that the frequency, distribution, and nature of base pair zzso in the zzso variable zzso heavy chain genes in zzso patients are largely similar to those in normal donors, suggesting a normal zzso zzso zzso of the third zzso region in B cells from zzso patients also shows a normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be identified in the switch zzso zzso region (up to several hundred base pairs upstream of the S zzso zzso zzso in normal in zzso switched human B zzso In the absence of zzso zzso can still be found in this region, but at less than half the frequency of that in normal zzso The latter zzso are mainly due to transitions zzso compared with zzso in zzso and are biased to A or T zzso An zzso zzso different from that generating zzso in V zzso is therefore likely to be involved in introducing zzso zzso in the S zzso zzso may thus be one of the factors that is not shared by the zzso and zzso zzso
