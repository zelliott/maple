The clinical and pathological significance of zzso of the zzso zzso gene was examined in 108 cases of primary zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and direct DNA sequencing zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected in 19 zzso of 62 cases of cancer of the zzso corpus and was more frequent in groups at an advanced clinical stage and/or with aggressive zzso Among four zzso arising in the lowest portion of the zzso zzso three showed integration of human zzso zzso types 16 and/or 18 DNA, and two of them also showed zzso zzso In cancer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso in total, zzso zzso of cases with integration of zzso types 16 and/or 18 DNA and zzso zzso of cases without zzso DNA zzso Three zzso were detected among two cases at clinical stage IV and two cases of zzso cervical zzso zzso all five cases of zzso cancer which showed diffuse zzso 50% of cancer zzso nuclear zzso of zzso protein also carried the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were suggested to be involved in the development of zzso zzso showing aggressive biological zzso Although a high zzso of zzso DNA integration and a low zzso of zzso zzso were confirmed in cancer of the zzso zzso there was no inverse association between integration of zzso types 16 and/or 18 DNA and zzso zzso
