The study of the genetic and selective landscape of immunity genes across primates can provide insight into the existing differences in zzso to infection observed between human and zzso zzso Here, we explored how selection has driven the evolution of a key family of innate immunity zzso the zzso receptors zzso in African great zzso zzso We zzso the 10 zzso in various populations of chimpanzees and zzso and zzso these data jointly with a human data zzso We found that zzso selection has been more pervasive in great apes than in zzso Furthermore, in chimpanzees and zzso zzso selection has targeted zzso zzso of whether they are zzso or cell surface, in contrast to humans where strong selective constraints are restricted to zzso zzso These observations suggest important differences in the relative importance of zzso pathogen zzso such as that of recognition of zzso bacteria by zzso between humans and great zzso Lastly, we used a population zzso method that jointly analyses zzso and divergence data to detect zzso variation in selection pressures at specific zzso within zzso zzso We identified different zzso at different zzso as being under positive selection in each species, highlighting that functional variation at these genes has zzso a selective advantage in immunity to infection to specific zzso zzso Overall, this study showed that the degree of selection driving the evolution of zzso has largely differed between human and zzso zzso increasing our knowledge on their respective biological contribution to host zzso in the natural zzso
