The involvement of zzso in the zzso II damage and repair process in zzso zzso was zzso A full-length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso zzso patterns of the zzso gene were investigated upon shifting a zzso zzso culture from zzso to zzso growth conditions, designed to significantly accelerate the rate of zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses and nuclear zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant but transient induction of zzso gene transcription, followed by a subsequent increase in zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso centers had zzso followed by native gel zzso revealed the formation of a 320 zzso protein complex that zzso in addition to the zzso the zzso but as yet zzso D1 protein as well as zzso and zzso Evidence suggested that the 320 zzso complex is a zzso forming zzso repair zzso zzso zzso of the 320 zzso zzso repair intermediate by zzso resulted in zzso of its zzso constituents, yielding a 160 zzso protein zzso The role of the zzso in the repair of zzso zzso centers, zzso in stabilizing the zzso zzso complex and in zzso the D1 degradation and replacement process, is zzso
