A single zzso base pair in the zzso zzso is the major zzso of zzso acceptance in zzso transfer zzso Transfer of this base pair into other transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso substitution eliminates zzso acceptance in zzso and in zzso In this work, a population of zzso zzso zzso zzso amber zzso was subjected to a selection for zzso that compensate for the zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso were zzso Instead, a zzso substitution that replaced the zzso zzso in the zzso stem created a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso at amber zzso in zzso The zzso substitution is at a location where previous zzso work established an zzso zzso Thus, this zzso may act by functionally zzso a zzso part of the zzso structure to the active zzso
