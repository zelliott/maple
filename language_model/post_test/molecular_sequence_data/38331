zzso virus zzso zzso can zzso cells by several mechanisms, including zzso gene addition by zzso integration or zzso zzso expression or zzso gene targeting by modification of zzso zzso zzso The latter process can be used to correct a variety of zzso in zzso genes with high zzso and zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso to introduce zzso alkaline zzso reporter genes into normal human cells and subsequently corrected these zzso with zzso gene targeting zzso We find that increasing the length of zzso between the zzso zzso and the target locus improves gene correction rates, as does positioning the zzso to be corrected in the center of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene targeting increases with time and zzso of infection, similar to zzso gene zzso However, in contrast to gene addition, zzso stress did not affect gene targeting rates, suggesting that different cellular factors are zzso In the course of these studies, we found that zzso zzso zzso less than half of zzso size could be packaged as zzso or zzso and zzso packaged zzso consist of zzso repeats with zzso closed zzso at either zzso These studies should prove helpful in designing zzso gene targeting zzso for basic research or gene zzso
