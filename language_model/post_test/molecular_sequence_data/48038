An zzso zzso gene was identified near the 3' zzso of a naturally occurring deletion zzso in the human zzso gene cluster on zzso zzso The gene encodes an zzso acid sequence that is 40 to 51% identical to that of a set of zzso receptors that have only recently been identified as a distinct family of zzso There are two zzso genes in the mouse that zzso zzso acid sequences that are 73 and zzso zzso respectively, to that zzso by the human zzso This zzso zzso gene is expressed at the zzso level in human and zzso zzso cells at all stages of zzso This zzso expression is probably due to the location of the gene in the zzso active zzso domain of the extended zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso
