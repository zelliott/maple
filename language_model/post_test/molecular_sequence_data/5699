We have examined the effect of zzso zzso on the solution zzso of three zzso zzso One of the zzso containing three zzso repeat units zzso remained zzso under conditions where zzso induced a two-state transition from a random zzso to an zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso formation of two peptides derived from human zzso zzso and E was accompanied by the formation of discrete zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso further zzso to form zzso at higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso The results suggest a class of peptides capable of discrete zzso in the presence of zzso which zzso zzso hydrogen zzso
