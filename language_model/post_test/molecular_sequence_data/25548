A zzso zzso was cloned from zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso zzso F with the use of zzso derived from the genes zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the cloned DNA indicates this zzso to be a zzso zzso the gene for the small zzso zzso zzso molecular mass zzso zzso zzso precedes that for the large zzso zzso zzso molecular mass zzso zzso zzso as in other zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the small and large zzso of the zzso zzso share zzso zzso with those of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso Fourteen zzso zzso ten in the small and four in the large zzso which are thought to zzso the zzso clusters and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso are found to be zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso molecular masses and zzso acid composition derived from the gene sequence are very similar to the data reported for the zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso and zzso suggesting that this zzso belongs to the general class of zzso zzso despite its low zzso content and apparently anomalous spectral zzso
