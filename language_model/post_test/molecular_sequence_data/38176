The zzso location and pattern of expression of the gene zzso the zinc finger protein 265 zzso zzso in human zzso and mouse zzso was zzso By zzso zzso analysis, we mapped zzso to mouse zzso zzso zzso was localized to human zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Since discovery of zzso (in zzso came from studies of changes in zzso expression in kidney cell lines, we examined the cell specificity of expression in kidney and also determined zzso of zzso with zzso in other zzso We found that expression was not confined to zzso zzso cells but was zzso Moreover, the fact that highly zzso zzso of zzso exist in lower organisms zzso zzso in zzso suggests that this protein may have a generalized role in zzso mechanisms in various cell types and zzso
