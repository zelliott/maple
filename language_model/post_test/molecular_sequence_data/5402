A zzso simple, sensitive zzso polarization zzso was developed to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso This zzso involves incubation of a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso product is zzso with the zzso zzso resulting in an increase in the polarization signal as measured in a zzso polarization zzso Among several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to give the best polarization signal with the test zzso For validation of the zzso polarization zzso zzso activity was compared with a zzso transfer zzso In both the zzso polarization and zzso transfer zzso zzso activity showed a similar dependence on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso gave similar zzso zzso with a known zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These results show that the zzso polarization zzso can detect zzso and is comparable to the zzso transfer zzso The zzso polarization method is advantageous compared to the zzso transfer zzso or zzso or zzso because it is a zzso zzso that does not involve several zzso liquid transfer, and sample preparation zzso It has the added advantage of using zzso zzso The zzso polarization zzso thus is environmentally safe and zzso handling zzso The homogeneous nature of the zzso makes it readily adaptable to zzso screening for zzso drug zzso
