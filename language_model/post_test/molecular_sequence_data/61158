Two binding sites are associated with zzso substance P receptors in both zzso cells and zzso zzso To further delineate the interactions between the crucial zzso zzso of substance P and these two binding sites, we have incorporated newly designed constrained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of these C zzso SP zzso to bind both sites and to activate zzso zzso and zzso formation have been measured, together with those of their corresponding zzso and zzso The molecular nature of these two binding sites and their selective zzso to zzso signaling pathways are discussed in the light of current models of zzso zzso The less abundant binding site is coupled to zzso zzso whereas the most abundant one interacts with zzso proteins in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso with human zzso zzso The specific orientation of the zzso zzso side chain imposed by these constraints shows that zzso zzso and zzso angles of this crucial zzso zzso are similar in both binding zzso However, slight but significant variations in the rotation around the zzso bond yield different either stabilizing or zzso interactions in the two binding zzso These results highlight the need of such constrained zzso acids to probe subtle interactions in zzso zzso
