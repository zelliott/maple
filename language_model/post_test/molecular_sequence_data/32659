We cloned two distinct zzso for zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is a small freshwater zzso The zzso code for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both of which have a unique, zzso domain structure of the zzso heavy chain and zzso zzso zzso zzso light zzso When compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibited extremely low zzso activity for small synthetic zzso zzso Twelve zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso were produced by zzso zzso Among them, one zzso zzso zzso was found to have considerably reduced zzso zzso activities both for synthetic and protein zzso without serious reduction of its zzso zzso zzso For the zzso of fusion proteins containing a zzso site, the zzso zzso zzso were shown to have advantages over their zzso zzso Based on our present data, we propose that the zzso zzso is the most appropriate zzso to specifically cleave proteins containing the zzso zzso zzso
