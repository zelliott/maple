The zzso of zzso and their supporting zzso to the highly specialized zzso unit included the recruitment of zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso proteins zzso zzso with a zzso zzso at the root of zzso we identified three zzso pairs in zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences zzso remarkably after gene duplication, indicating functional zzso Each zzso has adopted a distinct zzso expression pattern in neural zzso zzso and in zzso zzso the closest zzso to zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso after zzso nerve zzso zzso is expressed in zzso stem cells, and the other four zzso are confined to zzso of zzso zzso Comparing protein sequences and gene structures from birds, zzso one zzso species, and four zzso we have reconstructed major steps in the evolution of zzso
