zzso zzso have been proposed to have important symbiotic roles during zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, the symbiotic responses of transgenic alfalfa plants that express a portion of the putative alfalfa zzso gene zzso or zzso in either the zzso or sense orientation were analyzed following zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants were zzso exhibited zzso and developed not only zzso large zzso but also numerous small zzso both of which zzso zzso zzso plants were intermediate in growth and zzso number compared with zzso and zzso control zzso The symbiotic abnormalities of zzso zzso plants were similar to but milder than the responses shown by the zzso plants, whereas zzso zzso plants exhibited symbiotic responses that were identical to those of zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in zzso zzso by Northern zzso analysis but was localized to alfalfa zzso zzso and the adjacent cells of the invasion zone by in zzso zzso transcripts were also detected in root zzso A similar spatial pattern of zzso expression was found by using a zzso in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso for an zzso zzso gene zzso were detected in white zzso zzso zzso zzso and root zzso
