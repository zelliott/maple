zzso zzso zzso are zzso insects characterized by enlarged zzso with silk zzso whose silk is used to produce galleries in which the insects live zzso The zzso position of zzso has been zzso In the present study, an almost complete zzso DNA zzso sequence of zzso is reported for the first zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso zzso , has the 13 zzso genes zzso generally found in zzso zzso zzso There is a zzso of a large region including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso does not seem to affect zzso zzso although zzso acid composition in some parts of the zzso is biased compared with other zzso zzso Based on zzso analyses using zzso sequences of all zzso zzso with two zzso genes and the zzso acid sequences of all zzso zzso zzso is sister to zzso a zzso of typical stick and leaf zzso
