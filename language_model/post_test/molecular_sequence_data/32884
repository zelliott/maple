zzso display two types of zzso zzso and zzso cell polarity zzso and both are crucial for zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways comprise zzso zzso such as zzso Night, and zzso zzso proteins such as zzso During establishment of zzso in the zzso wing, zzso proteins accumulate zzso in distinct zzso zzso on zzso and zzso plasma zzso This finding suggests that their localized function depends on prior definition of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso a zzso protein essential for zzso polarity in the zzso zzso development of zzso but has no effect on zzso zzso The zzso zzso is associated with a failure to restrict zzso night to the zzso and zzso plasma zzso of the wing zzso We further demonstrate that zzso expresses two zzso spliced zzso in wing zzso discs, which zzso two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso form contains a zzso zzso which mediates binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso support the occurrence of such an interaction in wing zzso zzso The results suggest that interaction between the zzso and zzso cell polarity systems has to be tightly coordinated to ensure proper zzso of the wing disc zzso
