zzso zzso interactions represent a crucial step in zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognize zzso zzso in the context of particular sequence motifs in zzso zzso zzso However, the modest binding affinity of zzso zzso to zzso containing peptides may not account for and likely represents an zzso mechanism for regulation of selectivity of signaling pathways in living zzso Here we describe the crystal structure of the activated zzso zzso domain of zzso in complex with a zzso zzso zzso The structural and zzso data and experiments with cultured cells show that the selectivity of zzso zzso binding and signaling via activated zzso are determined by interactions between a secondary binding site on an zzso domain and a region in zzso zzso domain in a zzso independent zzso These experiments reveal a mechanism for how zzso domain selectivity is regulated in zzso to mediate a specific cellular zzso
