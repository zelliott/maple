zzso zzso zzso is an zzso binding zzso zzso factor that plays an important role in both zzso and zzso stress signaling zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso finger zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The transcript level of zzso in tobacco zzso zzso increased upon treatment with salicylic acid zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and virus zzso zzso appeared to be physically associated with the zzso surface but zzso from it after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in plant cells following zzso zzso zzso expression increased zzso zzso and was able to functionally compensate for loss of the zzso zzso zzso domain through a direct interaction with zzso zzso plants simultaneously zzso zzso and zzso displayed stronger pathogen resistance and salt tolerance than did transgenic plants expressing either zzso or zzso zzso zzso with this, the expression of a subset of stress-related genes was induced in a cooperative manner in zzso transgenic zzso These results together implied that zzso recruits zzso to the promoters of stress-related genes to zzso zzso zzso zzso
