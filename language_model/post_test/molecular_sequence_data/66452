zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso has been found to detect a zzso zzso protein zzso which showed zzso activity and host cell binding characteristics after zzso Using the zzso a colony containing a zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso A full length zzso sequence of the zzso protein was completed after zzso which consisted of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso consisted of a zzso of zzso zzso acids without significant zzso to any other known zzso This sequence contains an zzso terminal stop transfer sequence downstream of a short neutral zzso zzso middle zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that the zzso is inserted into the zzso membrane with both zzso and zzso
