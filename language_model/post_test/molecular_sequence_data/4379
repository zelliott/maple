Properties of a zzso delta virus zzso zzso zzso system, which consists of three zzso zzso strands zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso and contains a hybrid sequence of zzso and zzso zzso cores, are zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso metal zzso species, zzso and temperature on the zzso activity were zzso The zzso zzso activity increased with increasing zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most effective zzso zzso and zzso was less zzso The zzso activity increased with increasing pH zzso The optimum temperature for the zzso activity was zzso degrees zzso The zzso zzso pH and temperature zzso are different from those reported for the zzso zzso (about zzso although the zzso metal zzso preference is very zzso zzso change induced by zzso zzso zzso was monitored by zzso The CD data and the zzso concentration data were analyzed by zzso analysis using equations derived for multiple metal zzso binding zzso The data can be explained by a model in which three zzso zzso bind to one zzso zzso
