zzso zzso zzso zzso shows in zzso activity against zzso zzso under conditions of iron zzso A zzso reporter gene introduced by zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was induced by a factor released by the zzso zzso zzso The induction of the zzso gene was lost upon treatment of the zzso zzso with commercial zzso A zzso concentration as low as 1 zzso could induce the expression of zzso The zzso did not affect the zzso potential for fungus antagonism but drastically decreased the zzso of the zzso in liquid culture and suppressed the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso as a carbon zzso A subsequent zzso zzso in zzso one of the zzso zzso genes upstream of zzso silenced the zzso zzso This double zzso restricted zzso growth only under conditions of high zzso which probably results in internal zzso zzso These data confirm the role of the zzso zzso in zzso and they indicate its additional role as an zzso of or a signal for zzso zzso
