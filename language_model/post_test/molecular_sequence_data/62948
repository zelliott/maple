zzso of the internal transcribed zzso zzso region including the zzso zzso gene delineated seven zzso within the three varieties of zzso zzso via specific combinations of eight zzso differences located at positions 10, 11, 15, 19, 108 zzso 221 zzso zzso and zzso zzso The ITS types correlated to zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso DNA zzso molecular zzso with ITS type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular types zzso and the zzso A zzso of the zzso hybrid, zzso ITS type 2 zzso zzso D zzso of the zzso hybrid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ITS type 3 zzso and ITS type 7 zzso type III, ITS type 4 zzso type II, ITS type 5: zzso type I, ITS type 6 zzso type IV, all corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso revealed that the hybrid zzso is zzso at the zzso locus carrying the ITS type 1 zzso and the ITS type 2 zzso zzso ITS sequencing is a useful technique for zzso the three zzso zzso varieties and for zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso
