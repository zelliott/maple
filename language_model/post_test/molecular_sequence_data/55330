The zzso converting zzso zzso has been repeatedly discussed as zzso factor for major depression zzso and the zzso relation between MD and cardiovascular disorders zzso In this context, functional zzso of the zzso gene have been linked to depression, to zzso treatment response, to zzso serum zzso as well as to hypertension, zzso zzso and zzso risk zzso The mostly investigated zzso zzso zzso accounts for zzso of the zzso serum concentration zzso the remaining half is probably determined by other zzso environmental or zzso factors, but these are poorly zzso 

The main aim of the present study was the analysis of the DNA zzso pattern in the regulatory region of the zzso gene in peripheral zzso of 81 MD patients and 81 healthy zzso 

We detected intensive DNA zzso within a recently zzso functional important region of the zzso gene promoter including zzso in depressed patients zzso zzso zzso and a significant inverse correlation between the zzso serum concentration and zzso promoter zzso frequency in the total sample zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a significant inverse correlation between the zzso of the inflammatory zzso risk markers zzso zzso and zzso and the degree of zzso promoter zzso in MD patients could be demonstrated zzso zzso zzso - zzso 

The results of the present study suggest that aberrations in zzso promoter DNA zzso may be an underlying cause of MD and probably a common zzso factor for the zzso relationship between MD and cardiovascular zzso
