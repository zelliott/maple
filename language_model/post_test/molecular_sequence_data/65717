zzso have been recommended as potential indicators of human zzso pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman zzso zzso The objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this zzso indicator group in different animals and environmental zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso were used to study the presence of zzso among zzso zzso DNA extracts from 32 different zzso Twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two zzso impacted zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had the broadest host distribution zzso to zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in fewer than zzso of all zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso clones obtained from different animal feces showed that zzso zzso of all of the sequences clustered with cultured zzso while the rest formed a zzso with low sequence identity zzso zzso to previously described zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained 53 zzso sequences from seven different animal zzso suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this zzso In contrast, two zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig zzso zzso respectively, suggesting host zzso Using zzso zzso zzso were detected in only two of the surface water DNA zzso although other zzso zzso bacteria were detected in these zzso Overall, the results suggest that the use of zzso species as potential markers to monitor human zzso pollution in natural waters may be zzso
