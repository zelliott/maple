The active site of a protein folding reaction is in domain V of the zzso zzso in the bacterial zzso and its zzso in other zzso This domain has long been known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso V of zzso zzso is split into two zzso the more zzso large zzso zzso loop zzso and the rest zzso These two segments together act as a protein folding zzso as well as the complete domain V zzso A number of zzso zzso were introduced in zzso and zzso of zzso taking clues from reports of these sites being involved in various steps of protein zzso For example, sites like zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso region are protected by zzso zzso at high zzso concentration and zzso is protected by zzso zzso zzso when the P site remains occupied zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso region render the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tobacco zzso Sites in P loop zzso and zzso in zzso are protected against modification by the zzso end of the P site bound zzso zzso were introduced in corresponding zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of domain zzso The zzso were tested for zzso using unfolded protein binding zzso with unfolded zzso zzso In the protein folding zzso the zzso showed partial to complete loss of this zzso In the filter binding zzso for the zzso protein complex, the zzso showed an extent of protein binding that agreed well with their protein folding zzso
