Two zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso that zzso energy from zzso zzso reduction zzso with zzso zzso were isolated from permanently cold Arctic marine zzso Both strains grew at temperatures down to zzso degrees C, with respective temperature zzso of 14 degrees C and zzso degrees C for strains zzso and zzso The isolated strains reduced zzso using common zzso products such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or hydrogen as electron donors, and they also grew with zzso as the sole zzso As alternatives to zzso they reduced zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso to zzso zzso zzso Mal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso therefore represent novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
