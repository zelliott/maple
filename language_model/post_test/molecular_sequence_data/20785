zzso analyses have identified a set of zzso genes in zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying the expression of these genes is still zzso In this study, we presented a zzso zzso zzso that displayed a low level of zzso expression in a zzso white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed the effects of the zzso untranslated region zzso on gene zzso The zzso zzso sequence zzso the reporter activity of zzso zzso gene under zzso promoter by zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso in the transgenic tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso sequence decreased the transcript level of the zzso reporter gene by zzso zzso a regulatory role of zzso zzso in zzso and/or zzso zzso The comparison of zzso activity with the transcript abundance indicated that the zzso zzso sequence decreased the translation efficiency of target gene by zzso Additionally, the analysis of the transgenic zzso plants showed that both the zzso sequence and the leading zzso within the zzso zzso region were responsible for the regulation of gene zzso Our results suggested a negative effect of the zzso zzso of zzso gene on gene zzso
