zzso is a single domain zzso We have engineered a zzso in which a unique zzso replaces the zzso zzso found in the zzso corner of this Greek key zzso a region that has been proposed to have an important role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated multistate unfolding in zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso at 15 degrees zzso in which one or more partially folded species are populated in zzso 3 M zzso Using a variety of zzso techniques, we show that these species, on average, have lost a substantial portion of the native secondary structure, lack fixed zzso packing involving zzso and zzso zzso are less compact than the native state as determined by zzso lifetimes and zzso zzso but retain significant residual structure involving the zzso zzso zzso ranging in length from 11 to 30 zzso encompassing this region, however, did not contain zzso zzso structure, suggesting that long-range interactions are important for stabilizing the equilibrium partially unfolded species in the intact zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that the equilibrium zzso of zzso zzso generates one or more partially unfolded species that are globally collapsed and retain elements of the native structure involving the newly introduced zzso zzso We speculate on the role of such zzso in the generation of the complex Greek key zzso
