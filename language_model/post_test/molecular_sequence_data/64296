zzso for late onset zzso disease zzso and plasma zzso beta levels zzso zzso by zzso an intermediate zzso for zzso show linkage to zzso zzso Several strong candidate genes zzso zzso zzso lie within the zzso support zzso for zzso Others have independently identified zzso in the zzso zzso region harboring zzso that show highly significant association with intermediate zzso zzso and with risk for zzso To pursue these associations, we analyzed the same zzso for association with plasma zzso in 24 extended zzso families and for association with zzso in two independent zzso zzso One series zzso 188 zzso zzso zzso did not show association zzso with the six zzso in the zzso region spanning three genes zzso zzso and zzso previously shown to associate with zzso The other series zzso 109 zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso association with these zzso In the zzso series, the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had the same effects previously zzso In this series, the zzso zzso zzso zzso also had an effect similar as in one previous case control series but not in zzso In the extended families, the zzso zzso was associated with significantly elevated plasma zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso which is associated with reduced risk for zzso in the other study is associated with reduced plasma zzso zzso in our family zzso These results provide strong evidence for zzso zzso in the zzso region harboring zzso that influence intermediate zzso zzso and risk for zzso
