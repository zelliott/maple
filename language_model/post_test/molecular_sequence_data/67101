Recent studies revealed that zzso E virus zzso zzso are more variable than previously thought and zzso regions suitable for designing universal zzso are zzso In this study, based on alignment of 70 full-length zzso sequences of zzso zzso a part of the zzso overlapping region was found to be the best target region for zzso amplification of various zzso zzso Using the newly designed zzso an zzso method zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso sequence within the zzso overlapping region and is capable of amplifying all known zzso sequences was zzso When compared with the previous zzso method zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was two to three times more sensitive than zzso zzso upon testing serial zzso of three zzso zzso serum zzso The zzso zzso zzso could detect zzso in five patients with acute or zzso zzso E zzso days longer than zzso zzso after disease zzso All 41 zzso zzso serum samples of various zzso tested positive for zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso of zzso zzso contain variable zzso a zzso tree of the zzso products could clearly distinguish the different zzso zzso
