All species of the zzso zzso have a characteristic red zzso in their zzso zzso due to the presence of zzso zzso Some of these zzso zzso known as zzso zzso are responsible for many of the zzso activities of zzso saliva such as zzso and zzso Several zzso have been described zzso and zzso where zzso is the only one with affinity to zzso zzso zzso prediction suggested that zzso also has an extended zzso tail on signal zzso zzso however, the complementary DNA does not allow the determination of the exact site of signal zzso zzso On the other hand, according to previous studies, the exact length of the zzso has important consequences for the zzso oxide binding properties of zzso Here, a method was developed to select zzso zzso proteins from zzso tissue for analysis by mass zzso The method was used to determine the exact zzso of the zzso protein zzso from zzso of the zzso zzso of 5th zzso zzso stages of zzso zzso
