When placed downstream of the start zzso zzso of the zzso CA zzso translation from zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence or absence of an untranslated leader zzso zzso expression in the absence of a leader and zzso sequence indicated that stimulation by CA zzso was independent of translation signals contained within the untranslated zzso zzso of CA zzso a significantly higher level of zzso expression than zzso of individual C or A zzso zzso levels increased as the number of CA repeats zzso fewer zzso were required for enhanced expression from zzso zzso than from zzso that was deleted for its leader zzso zzso of zzso CA zzso increased the zzso binding strength of zzso in zzso and the amount of full-length zzso in zzso suggesting that the enhanced expression resulted from translation of a more abundant functional message containing a stronger zzso binding zzso The presence of downstream zzso zzso occurring naturally in several zzso coli zzso might contribute to translation of other zzso zzso of CA zzso might represent a general mechanism for increasing expression from genes of zzso
