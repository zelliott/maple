zzso of the sea zzso early zzso genes occurs zzso during early zzso reaching the maximum at the zzso stage and declining to an zzso level at the zzso zzso To identify the regulatory elements responsible for the timing and the levels of zzso of the zzso zzso we used promoter binding studies in nuclear extracts and zzso of a zzso zzso driven by the early zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso nuclear proteins produced indistinguishable zzso I footprint patterns on the zzso zzso Two sites of zzso zzso on the zzso and on the zzso box respectively, were zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso of an excess of zzso sequences severely affected the expression of two zzso driven by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, a DNA zzso containing 3' coding and zzso zzso zzso where upon zzso three zzso zzso hypersensitive sites were previously zzso specifically zzso at the zzso stage the expression of the zzso driven by the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso is essential for the expression of early zzso gene and that sequences for zzso are localized near the 3' end of the zzso zzso
