The zzso growth factors zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso are zzso for the related G zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso We have developed a model of zzso that predicts interactions between three polar zzso and zzso One of these, zzso zzso which is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hydrogen bonds with the zzso zzso zzso Our previous zzso study identified that the corresponding zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso pairs with the zzso zzso These two results predict that this zzso might influence zzso recognition and zzso zzso of zzso interchange point zzso of zzso and zzso validated this prediction as the presence of zzso was required for zzso recognition, whereas zzso recognition was possible with either zzso or zzso The most likely explanation for this dual specificity behavior is a shift in the equilibrium between the acid and zzso base forms of zzso acid due to other zzso acids surrounding that position in zzso producing a mixture of receptors including those having an zzso zzso that recognize zzso and others with a neutral zzso acid that recognize zzso Thus, zzso modeling of these receptors provided valid information necessary for understanding the molecular pharmacology of these zzso
