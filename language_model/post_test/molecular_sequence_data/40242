In January and November 2008, outbreaks of avian influenza have been reported in 4 provinces of zzso Eight zzso A H5N1 viruses were recovered from these 2008 zzso outbreaks and zzso characterized and analyzed for zzso identity, genetic zzso zzso zzso and possible sites of zzso The results show that the 2008 H5N1 viruses displayed genetic drift characteristics (less than zzso genetic zzso as commonly found in influenza A zzso Based on zzso analysis, zzso 1 viruses in Thailand were divided into 3 distinct branches zzso 1, zzso and zzso Six out of 8 H5N1 zzso have been identified as zzso H5N1 zzso while other zzso belong to an original H5N1 zzso These viruses have undergone zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso and thus represent new zzso 2008 H5N1 zzso The zzso viruses have acquired gene segments from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso whole zzso sequences of the 2008 H5N1 viruses supported the zzso sites between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso of the time of the most recent common ancestors of the 2008 H5N1 zzso the potential point of genetic zzso of the viruses could be traced back to zzso zzso analysis of the 2008 H5N1 viruses has shown that most zzso zzso in all 8 genes of the viruses have remained zzso In zzso two zzso H5N1 lineages were circulating in zzso The original zzso lineage mainly circulated in central Thailand and the zzso lineage zzso zzso and zzso predominantly circulated in zzso zzso To prevent new zzso emphasis should be put on prevention of H5N1 viruses circulating in high risk zzso In addition, surveillance and whole zzso sequencing of H5N1 viruses should be routinely performed for monitoring the genetic drift of the virus and new zzso zzso especially in light of potential zzso between avian and zzso H5N1 zzso
