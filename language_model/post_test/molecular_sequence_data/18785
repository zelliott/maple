Despite the strong evidence of zzso infection as the zzso agent in a subset of oral cancer, oral zzso detection is rare in healthy individuals, and little is known of the existing of novel zzso types in oral zzso 

We determined whether novel zzso types can be isolated from oral zzso samples collected from healthy zzso 

We performed rolling circle amplification zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso on 48 oral zzso samples to amplify novel zzso zzso Full length zzso DNA was cloned using long range zzso zzso type specific zzso zzso were used to determine the prevalence of novel zzso types in 158 zzso oral tissue zzso 

We were able to isolate four novel human zzso zzso Full length zzso DNA was cloned for three of the four novel zzso zzso All four zzso types belong to the zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso showing zzso zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso showing zzso zzso zzso 173 is most closely related to zzso 4, showing zzso zzso oral sample zzso zzso 37 is most closely related to zzso zzso showing zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso 173 was rarely present in oral zzso zzso zzso zzso was only detected in normal oral zzso zzso and zzso zzso was more prevalent in zzso oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Novel zzso types are present in oral cavity of healthy zzso
