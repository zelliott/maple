The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso in this zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and double zzso in both of the zzso respiratory pathways were zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments on zzso from the zzso were consistent with the anticipated characteristics of all the zzso zzso zzso of the individual zzso zzso or zzso zzso had normal respiratory rates with zzso zzso but zzso significantly lower than the zzso rate with zzso zzso as a zzso The growth rates of the individual zzso zzso or zzso zzso were not markedly different from that of the zzso strain, but the zzso zzso zzso strain was noticeably growth retarded at and below zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso strain was unable to grow on zzso plates at zzso tensions of zzso or less on zzso zzso As the zzso growth was unaffected by varying the zzso tension, the results indicate that the role of the zzso zzso pathways is to provide zzso at intermediate (5 to zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso genes are zzso zzso with zzso zzso N zzso caused zzso and 7- to zzso increases in the promoter activities of zzso and zzso respectively, but these activities were affected little by the zzso level supplied to the zzso
