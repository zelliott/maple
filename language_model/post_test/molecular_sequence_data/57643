We previously described the isolation of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that are deficient in zzso assembly zzso zzso We describe the characterization of one of these zzso zzso and the cloning of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is deficient for growth, but not for division or segregation of zzso or for induction of zzso zzso Two distinct zzso targeting signals, zzso and zzso have been identified that are sufficient to direct proteins to the zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso is deficient in the import of proteins with the zzso but not the zzso targeting zzso This is the same import zzso as that found in cells from patients with the lethal human zzso disorder Zellweger zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso gene reveals that it is a novel member of the zzso repeat gene zzso zzso raised against zzso expressed zzso are used to show that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Also, we have found that in zzso translated zzso protein is capable of binding the zzso targeting signal specifically, raising the possibility that zzso is a zzso zzso
