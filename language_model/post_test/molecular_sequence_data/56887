zzso is one of a family of bean genes zzso zzso zzso which zzso the first reaction in a branch zzso of zzso zzso for the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The functional architecture of the zzso promoter was dissected by a novel zzso plant in zzso zzso initiation system in which zzso and nuclear extracts from zzso soybean cells direct accurate and efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso from an immobilized promoter zzso zzso zzso from the zzso promoter template was also observed with zzso extracts from zzso cells of zzso zzso and the zzso rice, and the soybean zzso extract transcribed several other immobilized promoter zzso zzso this procedure may be of general use in the study of plant gene regulation mechanisms in zzso zzso of the effects of depletion of the soybean zzso extract by zzso with small regions of the zzso promoter or defined zzso elements showed that trans factors that bind to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso respectively, make major contributions to the zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso Both zzso zzso factor interactions in combination are required for zzso zzso zzso of these functional zzso zzso factor interactions in zzso provides the basis for study of the mechanisms underlying zzso expression of zzso in pigmented zzso cells established by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and for characterization of the terminal steps of the signal zzso for stress induction of the zzso defense zzso
