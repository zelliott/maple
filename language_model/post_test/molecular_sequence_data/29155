We present the zzso characterization of a Spanish isolate of zzso zzso Identification and molecular characterization of the zzso were performed using the technique of zzso zzso length zzso analysis zzso and sequencing of the zzso and the ITS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It was seen that our isolate is very similar to the strain described in Sweden, but differs in the sequencing of the ITS from the isolate in Great zzso zzso techniques facilitate a rapid diagnosis and enable a better understanding of the epidemiology of this zzso
