The two group I zzso zzso and zzso found at two different sites in nuclear zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso have been characterized in zzso Their structural organization is related to that of the mobile zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso extending the zzso of a typical group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all zzso in zzso generating zzso zzso and full-length zzso circles as well as internal processed excised zzso zzso zzso of full-length zzso circles is found to be a general feature in zzso processing of zzso nuclear group I zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso signal at exactly the same position in the 3' end of the zzso close to the internal processing sites, indicating an zzso zzso zzso expression zzso of zzso proteins in zzso The zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, zzso to zzso zzso zzso of 148 and 175 zzso zzso zzso contains an additional sequence motif zzso to the unusual DNA binding motif of three zzso beta sheets found in the zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso
