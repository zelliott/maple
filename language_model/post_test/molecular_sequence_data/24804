Cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed seven open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso Two incomplete zzso zzso the zzso zzso genes showed similarities to genes involved in zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso gene in zzso coli gave mainly inactive protein concentrated in inclusion bodies, whereas zzso expression on an zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso activity zzso and zzso respectively, in this zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a complete loss of zzso zzso activity whereas the low zzso activity remaining after zzso of the zzso gene indicated the presence of a second zzso zzso Two plasmids of 80 zzso and 190 zzso in size were identified by zzso gel zzso and the cloned zzso zzso genes were found to be localized on the 190 zzso zzso
