We describe the identification and expression cloning of two novel zzso a zzso and an zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso library from zzso zzso CBS zzso was constructed, and full-length zzso zzso an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso were cloned by expression cloning in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso precursor protein with a putative signal zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with an zzso leader zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and zzso It has a molecular mass of 36 zzso an zzso point of pH zzso a pH activity optimum at zzso and a temperature activity optimum around 40 degrees zzso Both zzso show only low sequence identity to other known zzso
