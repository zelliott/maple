Tight junctions zzso serve as a barrier that prevents zzso and water from passing through the zzso pathway, and as a fence between the zzso and zzso plasma zzso in zzso zzso zzso consist of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and many peripheral membrane zzso including zzso filament zzso scaffold proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso scaffold proteins zzso and cell polarity molecules zzso and zzso We identified here a novel peripheral membrane protein at zzso from a human zzso library and named it zzso (for protein incorporated later into zzso because it was incorporated into zzso later after the zzso zzso strands were zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso has a zzso zzso In zzso L cells zzso expressing zzso or zzso zzso was not recruited to zzso or zzso zzso contact sites, suggesting that zzso does not directly interact with zzso or zzso The present results indicate that zzso is a novel component of zzso
