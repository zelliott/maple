Currently, considerable controversy surrounds questions about the zzso evolution of zzso in patients with zzso zzso In order to analyze a possible zzso relationship between zzso of zzso zzso and a Ki zzso large cell zzso zzso in the same patient, a highly specific molecular probe for the zzso zzso clone of the large cell zzso zzso was zzso As a clone specific molecular marker, highly variable zzso sequences of rearranged zzso zzso genes were zzso An zzso primer complementary to these sequences was zzso and, using the zzso chain reaction, clone specific DNA was detected in all zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso These results provide evidence for a zzso relationship between zzso of zzso zzso and large cell zzso zzso developing in the same zzso
