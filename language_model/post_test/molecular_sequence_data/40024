The potential for zzso of aromatic zzso simultaneously at low temperatures and under saline and alkaline conditions is not well zzso but such zzso would be useful for zzso of zzso zzso A zzso moderately zzso pure culture using zzso as a sole source of carbon and energy was isolated by selective enrichment from alkaline and saline zzso in the vicinity of the zzso oil field in zzso An analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence and zzso and zzso characteristics showed that this strain is a member of the zzso zzso and it was designated as strain zzso zzso zzso could grow at temperatures between 2 and 36 degrees C zzso zzso and salt zzso from zzso to zzso Its optimal conditions for zzso of zzso were 20 degrees C zzso zzso and zzso salt zzso zzso zzso not only zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The kinetic model of strain zzso for zzso was solved to obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso of zzso and its derivatives simultaneously under multiple extreme zzso
