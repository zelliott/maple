The zzso sequence of a region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of the open reading frames zzso within this region has revealed similarities with a number of different classes of zzso proteins and zzso The zzso have been designated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a small, zzso protein which has similarity to the family of proteins known as zzso proteins zzso The zzso protein has similarity to a zzso of zzso which zzso their zzso as a part of their reaction zzso Included in these are several zzso zzso zzso of zzso with these proteins reveals a highly zzso domain containing the motif zzso This resembles the zzso site motif and may represent a zzso of the usual zzso except that Pro replaces zzso The zzso protein has similarity with a family of zzso zzso alcohol zzso of which the zzso coli K-12 zzso and zzso gene products are also zzso The zzso protein has sequence zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso bacterial zzso The latter are two components of the zzso complex which zzso the zzso zzso used in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso protein has sequence similarity with zzso zzso We were able to identify a number of the gene products using a zzso expression system, confirming several of the allocated zzso A zzso zzso for the zzso zzso component zzso acid, based on the zzso functions predicted for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso
