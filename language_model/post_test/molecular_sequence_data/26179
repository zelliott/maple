zzso H zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso share common features at the primary zzso acid sequence and activity zzso zzso H is involved in selection of the origins of replication in zzso coli and in DNA synthesis of the positive strand of zzso zzso studies of zzso coli zzso H indicate that several zzso zzso zzso in both cellular and zzso zzso zzso form an active site for zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso Multiple forms of zzso H are present in both zzso and zzso It is suggested that these zzso H may be part of larger zzso and, as has been shown for reverse zzso zzso H derived from zzso that the location and/or activity of the zzso H may be influenced by other regions of the zzso
