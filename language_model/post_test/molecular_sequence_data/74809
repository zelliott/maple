zzso zzso have key regulatory roles in multiple cellular processes by zzso zzso removal and zzso The zzso processing zzso zzso represent the largest zzso of zzso Recently, several zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso have been zzso Among these zzso three zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, indicating that this domain plays a crucial part in regulating their zzso To address the putative function of this domain, we systematically zzso and aligned zzso and human zzso zzso By zzso our analysis with structural and functional data, we present a zzso of the different zzso proteins and a model for their zzso
