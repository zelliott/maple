The genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso F3 were zzso and their zzso sequences were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were verified independently to a large extent by direct zzso zzso of 66 and zzso of native zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso F3 genes code for a typically long leader sequence of 45 and 39 zzso zzso respectively, and, in both cases, a mature protein of 290 zzso zzso Comparative structural analysis demonstrated minimum overall zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but revealed distinct clusters of identical zzso distributed throughout the entire zzso which represent motifs for binding and zzso of beta zzso linkages in complex zzso The mobility of native zzso zzso and zzso F3 on zzso gel zzso unlike zzso zzso did not correlate with the molecular weights determined from the coding region of the corresponding zzso Mass zzso confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso F3 were zzso and contained approximately zzso and 1200 zzso of mass not accounted for in the gene zzso We zzso that zzso zzso and zzso F3 are zzso zzso modified during zzso by possible linkage to the zzso of zzso
