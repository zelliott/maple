zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that suppresses several zzso pathogens of plants, produces the antibiotics zzso zzso and zzso A gene necessary for zzso production by zzso was identified as zzso which encodes the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Several zzso effects of an zzso zzso in zzso coli also were observed in an zzso zzso of zzso These included sensitivities of zzso cells to stresses imposed by hydrogen zzso or high salt zzso A zzso containing the cloned zzso zzso gene restored zzso production and stress tolerance to the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two antibiotics that inhibit growth of the zzso fungus zzso zzso and was superior to the wild type in suppression of zzso zzso of cucumber caused by zzso zzso When zzso onto cucumber seed at high cell zzso the zzso zzso did not survive as well as the zzso strain on surfaces of developing zzso Other zzso zzso of zzso such as the production of cyanide and zzso zzso were expressed by the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso s is only one of the zzso factors required for the zzso of genes in zzso cells of zzso zzso These results indicate that a zzso factor zzso by zzso influences zzso production, biological control activity, and survival of zzso zzso on plant zzso
