This study aimed to identify genes or gene products associated with high lean muscle mass in zzso that may serve as potential markers for zzso An animal with a genetic predisposition to high lean muscle mass, the Belgium Blue, was chosen as a model to compare with the zzso zzso a model that does zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis was zzso to compare the exhibited skeletal muscle zzso between the two animal types at two stages of zzso zzso A previously zzso zzso of a high expression zzso zzso zzso light chain 1 fast zzso was zzso The characterization of this zzso revealed a two zzso acid zzso in a part of the protein that has been implicated in modulating zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso was shown to be the product of two zzso that are zzso zzso studies were carried out on selected zzso and showed a very high frequency of one zzso Both zzso of zzso were produced by zzso means and zzso The zzso proteins were exchanged into zzso zzso zzso that were then subject to zzso measuring zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso could not reveal any significant difference in zzso activity between zzso containing one or the other zzso
