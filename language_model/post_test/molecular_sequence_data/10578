The major zzso step in the zzso zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso A zzso zzso proceeds through zzso zzso A, a zzso intermediate lacking the zzso zzso zzso An analog of this zzso zzso zzso zzso A, has been characterized in terms of regular backbone structure and zzso stability at pH zzso Nearly complete backbone zzso zzso and zzso zzso and most zzso zzso zzso have been assigned for the zzso zzso A using zzso zzso data and a computer program, zzso for automated analysis of resonance zzso Comparisons of chemical shift data, zzso zzso constants, and zzso data for the zzso and zzso proteins reveal that the overall chain folds of the two proteins are very similar, with localized structural zzso in the regions zzso adjacent to the zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso More significantly, zzso zzso exchange and zzso data reveal a global zzso of the zzso protein characterized by a significant difference in the zzso of the zzso transition zzso zzso of zzso degrees zzso and a significant increase in the zzso exchanging backbone zzso zzso exchange rates zzso faster in the zzso core of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparisons of the zzso zzso degrees zzso and zzso zzso degrees zzso of unfolding between zzso and zzso zzso zzso A reveal that some of the global zzso of the zzso protein arises from zzso and zzso changes in the folded zzso zzso of these observations for understanding the role of zzso in the folding zzso of zzso A are zzso
