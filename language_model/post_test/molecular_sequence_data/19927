Recent zzso analysis suggests that lateral gene transfer by zzso has contributed significantly to the genetic diversity of zzso To accurately determine the frequency of zzso gene transfer, we employed cycling primed in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and investigated the movement of the zzso resistance gene among zzso coli cells zzso by zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and T4 and the newly isolated zzso coli zzso zzso were used as zzso The zzso zzso determined by conventional zzso were zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso per zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of DNA transfer determined by zzso were zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso viable counting combined with zzso revealed that more than zzso of the cells carrying the transferred gene retained their zzso These results revealed that the difference in the number of viable cells carrying the transferred gene and the number of cells capable of growth on the selective medium was 3 to 4 orders of zzso indicating that zzso exchange of DNA sequences among bacteria occurs with unexpectedly high zzso
