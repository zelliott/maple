Childhood Acute zzso zzso zzso is a clinically and genetically zzso zzso zzso Despite improvements in outcome over the past decades, the current survival rate still is approximately zzso zzso zzso genetic abnormalities and early response to induction treatment are the main factors predicting clinical zzso While the majority of children carry zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients do not show any recognizable zzso zzso and are defined to have zzso normal zzso zzso This subset of patients is characterized by a significant zzso in clinical outcome, which is influenced by factors only recently started to be zzso In this respect, zzso analyses have been used with the aim of defining the full array of genetic zzso in zzso Recently, through zzso zzso parallel sequencing of seven cases of pediatric zzso we identified a novel zzso zzso fusion, predicting poorer zzso However, since the expression of zzso fusion in mice is not sufficient for zzso we speculated that further unknown abnormalities could contribute to both cancer transformation and response to zzso Thus, we zzso by zzso sequencing, 4 zzso patients, as well as 4 zzso zzso We identified a new fusion transcript in the zzso patients, involving Desert zzso zzso a member of zzso family, and Ras zzso zzso in Brain Like 1 zzso a gene coding for a small zzso of the Ras zzso Through the screening of a validation cohort of 55 additional pediatric zzso patients, we globally detected zzso fusion in 8 out of 20 zzso zzso zzso Gene expression analysis performed on zzso data revealed that zzso patients exhibited a specific zzso These 8 patients had an zzso overall survival worse than that of the remaining 12 zzso patients not harboring zzso fusion zzso vs zzso respectively, zzso Taken together, these findings are unprecedented and indicate that the zzso fusion transcript is a novel zzso feature in the changing landscape of zzso childhood zzso Moreover, it could be instrumental in the identification of a zzso of zzso patients with a very poor zzso
