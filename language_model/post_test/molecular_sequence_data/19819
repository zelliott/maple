zzso zzso are short zzso to zzso zzso molecules that have been shown to regulate the expression of other genes in a variety of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso has been observed in several human zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso were recently identified in patients with chronic zzso zzso Thus, human zzso can act as tumor zzso genes or zzso where zzso zzso or zzso can zzso the development of certain types of zzso In addition, previous studies have shown that zzso expression profiles can distinguish among human solid tumors from different zzso Because a single zzso can simultaneously influence the expression of two or more zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso could be candidate genes for cancer zzso Research in complex trait zzso has demonstrated that genetic background determines cancer zzso or resistance in various zzso such as colon and zzso of different zzso mouse zzso We compared the zzso positions of mouse tumor zzso zzso with those of mouse zzso Here, we report a statistically significant association between the zzso location of zzso and those of mouse cancer zzso zzso that influence the development of solid zzso Furthermore, we identified distinct patterns of zzso DNA sequences for several zzso located at or near zzso zzso in zzso strains with different tumor zzso These data provide a catalog of zzso genes in zzso strains that could represent genes involved in the development and zzso of solid zzso
