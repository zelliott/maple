zzso DNA zzso is a validated target for zzso zzso It consists of two zzso zzso and zzso which form an zzso complex in the active zzso zzso alignment of zzso tuberculosis zzso with other bacterial zzso predicts the presence of 40 potential additional zzso acids at the zzso zzso There are discrepancies between the zzso tuberculosis zzso sequences retrieved from different databases, including sequences zzso with or without the additional 40 zzso zzso This has resulted in differences in the zzso sequence zzso that has led to the reporting of previously known zzso zzso as novel zzso 

We have expressed zzso tuberculosis zzso with and without the extra 40 zzso acids in zzso coli and shown that both can be produced as zzso active zzso zzso and other zzso of the two proteins show no differences, suggesting that the additional 40 zzso acids have no effect on the zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso tuberculosis zzso shows that transcripts that could yield both the longer and shorter protein are zzso However, promoter analysis showed that only the promoter elements leading to the shorter zzso zzso the additional 40 zzso zzso had significant zzso 

We conclude that the most probable zzso start zzso for zzso tuberculosis zzso is zzso zzso which results in translation of a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso
