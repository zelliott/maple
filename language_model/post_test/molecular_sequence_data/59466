zzso is an abundant zzso serum protein zzso in the liver and for which the sequence is determined only for zzso Little is known about fish zzso zzso We have cloned a rainbow trout complementary DNA that encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso exhibiting an overall zzso zzso with human zzso and zzso with the goldfish warm temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deduced from zzso cluster analysis zzso was strong between the trout and human proteins since global zzso scores of zzso were obtained when the zzso or zzso halves of the two proteins were zzso Moreover, several characteristics of zzso were found in the trout zzso finally, the trout zzso zzso zzso was specifically expressed in the zzso We conclude that the trout protein is a good candidate for a true fish zzso
