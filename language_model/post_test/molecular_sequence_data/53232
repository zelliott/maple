The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso heavy chain gene zzso nuclear migration, colony growth and asexual zzso zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso It also alters the location of the first cell division event zzso and prevents nucleation of tip zzso We showed previously that a zzso of zzso zzso partially reversed the nuclear migration zzso and partially restored colony zzso We have now demonstrated that the zzso zzso also delays zzso and restores the zzso to its normal position, allowing tip cells to be zzso Although zzso does not affect nuclear migration or zzso zzso growth, it almost completely zzso zzso We propose that the zzso protein zzso in zzso and is essential for asexual spore zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso protein zzso that is located at the zzso pole body throughout the cell zzso zzso our results suggest that proteins at the zzso pole body are likely to be involved in zzso regulation of zzso in zzso zzso
