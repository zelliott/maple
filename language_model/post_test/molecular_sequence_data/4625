Recently a hybrid protein containing parts of the outer membrane proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso fused to the zzso was shown to protect mice against a zzso 50% lethal dose of zzso zzso To omit the use of the zzso the hybrid protein zzso was expressed in zzso coli using distinct modifications which have not to be eliminated after its zzso Using different signal zzso the yield of the hybrid protein zzso in zzso coli could be increased to zzso of the total cell zzso however, only a very small amount of the hybrid zzso was processed and could be isolated from the zzso of the zzso A construct containing an zzso extension of 11 zzso acids from the original zzso gene gave rise to a significantly higher expression in the zzso zzso was facilitated by the addition of a five zzso tag at the zzso An even higher expression was obtained by a construct in which a six zzso tag was attached to the zzso of the hybrid zzso The zzso extended zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso were zzso by zzso affinity zzso under native and zzso conditions and can now be tested for zzso against zzso zzso in animal model zzso
