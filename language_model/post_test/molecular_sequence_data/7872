Our current understanding of the interaction between bacteria and zzso cells of the immune system that play a major role in the defense against infection, is zzso zzso structures of zzso and zzso bacteria that account for these interactions are described in zzso Besides surface structures, soluble bacterial zzso toxins that are derived from zzso bacteria, are also shown to zzso zzso zzso In order to affect zzso functions, bacterial surface structures have to be recognized by the zzso and toxins have to be taken zzso zzso signal zzso mechanisms are initiated that enable the zzso to respond to the invading zzso To destroy bacteria, zzso employ many strategies, among which zzso processing and presentation to T cells, zzso zzso and different zzso mechanisms are considered to be the main zzso
