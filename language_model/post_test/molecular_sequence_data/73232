The status of the zzso and zzso genes in the zzso class II region has remained unclear for several zzso zzso zzso transcripts from each locus can be detected in B cells and some other cell types, but the issues of whether proteins are generated and, if so, whether they acquire partner chains to form class II zzso have not been zzso The products of the zzso zzso genes pair with each other to form the zzso zzso We now report that the products of zzso and zzso are expressed as a zzso in humans, zzso It is expressed in various class zzso cells including zzso zzso The zzso associates with zzso chain and has a relatively short zzso Its zzso distribution differs from zzso such that it is not expressed at the cell surface although it is found in some zzso zzso suggesting a role at the zzso stage of class II zzso In the zzso zzso of cells in both zzso and zzso including zzso and zzso cells, are zzso zzso zzso a zzso site of zzso death, are ringed by zzso zzso This unusual pattern of expression may suggest a specialized role for zzso in the zzso
