This is report of zzso analysis of higher plant zzso zzso zzso We identified and characterized the gene zzso yellow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The role of active site zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso completely abolished the zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed only trace activity toward zzso These results indicate that these three zzso acid zzso are necessary for zzso zzso Furthermore, as the result of replacement of zzso by less bulky zzso zzso acquired the ability to bind and zzso zzso We also analyzed the sequence of the zzso promoter zzso It appeared that there may be a direct link between zzso expression regulation and zzso zzso
