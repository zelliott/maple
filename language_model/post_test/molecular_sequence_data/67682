The core shell of zzso B virus is a potent immune zzso giving a strong zzso immune response to foreign zzso inserted at the zzso region, located at the tips of spikes on the exterior of the zzso Here, we analyze structures of core shells with a model zzso inserted at two alternative positions in the zzso zzso zzso expressed core protein assembles into zzso and zzso zzso shells, and atomic coordinates are available for the zzso zzso Since the modified protein assembles predominantly into zzso shells, a zzso model of the native zzso shell was zzso The spikes in this zzso structure resemble those in zzso shells zzso from expressed zzso However, the spikes in the modified shells exhibit an altered zzso similar to the DNA containing shells in zzso Both zzso allow full access of zzso to the foreign zzso zzso from the zzso region of zzso B virus surface zzso However, one zzso a zzso weaker immune response when injected into zzso In this zzso the zzso is less constrained by the zzso zzso regions and is positioned so that the symmetry of the shell causes pairs of zzso to come close enough to interfere with one zzso In the other zzso the zzso mimics the native zzso zzso and zzso The interaction of native core shells with an zzso specific to the zzso zzso is compared to the zzso with an zzso against the foreign zzso Our findings have implications for the design of vaccines based on zzso zzso
