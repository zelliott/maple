zzso control of zzso zzso and branching is essential for sustaining zzso growth of zzso zzso In order to study the molecular machinery ensuring polarity control in the industrial fungus zzso zzso we took advantage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that this strain serves as an excellent model system to study critical steps of polar growth control during zzso development and report for the first time a zzso fingerprint of zzso branching for a zzso zzso This fingerprint indicates that several signal zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and cell wall integrity zzso zzso act to control zzso zzso We zzso identified the genetic locus affected in the zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that a single zzso acid exchange in the zzso protein is responsible for induced zzso branching of the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the corresponding zzso gene is essential for the growth of zzso zzso and zzso analyses with zzso zzso evidenced that zzso serves as a functional equivalent of the zzso component zzso zzso signaling is required for zzso polarization and cell wall integrity in zzso zzso zzso our microscopic investigations showed that polarized zzso organization and zzso deposition are disturbed in the zzso zzso The integration of the zzso zzso and zzso data obtained in this study allowed us to reconstruct a model for cellular events involved in zzso zzso
