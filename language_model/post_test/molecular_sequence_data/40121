The authors employed a novel approach to identify zzso effective in zzso disease zzso The zzso region zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso precursor protein zzso is a significant regulator of the levels of the zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso The authors generated stable zzso zzso zzso that express zzso under the zzso control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso driven by a viral internal zzso entry zzso Using a zzso screen zzso they screened for the effect of zzso compounds obtained from the library of the Laboratory for Drug Discovery on zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso translation of the zzso zzso This screening yielded several nontoxic specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that had no effect on the zzso expression in the stable zzso zzso Moreover, these compounds either did not inhibit or inhibited to a much lower extent the expression of the zzso reporter regulated by a prion protein zzso zzso zzso used as an alternative zzso structure to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The hits obtained from this zzso specific, and highly quantitative zzso will be characterized to identify agents that may be developed into useful future therapeutic agents to limit zzso translation and zzso production for zzso
