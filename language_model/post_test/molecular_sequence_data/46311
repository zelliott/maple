zzso usage and disposal of the munitions constituent zzso zzso zzso has led to environmental releases on military zzso The chemical attributes of zzso are conducive for leaching to surface water which may put aquatic organisms at risk of zzso Because zzso has been observed to cause zzso zzso effects across a wide range of animal zzso we assessed the effects of zzso on central nervous system zzso functions in the representative aquatic zzso model species, zzso zzso zzso zzso We developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso library enriched for transcripts zzso expressed in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were zzso quality filtered and assembled yielding zzso unique sequences and 945 significant zzso matches zzso zzso The zzso library was leveraged to create zzso zzso for use in transcript expression zzso The impact of zzso on transcript expression in brain tissue was examined in zzso zzso exposed to zzso at zzso zzso 5, zzso or an zzso control for 10 zzso zzso toxicity of zzso in zzso zzso occurred only at the highest exposure concentration resulting in 50% mortality and weight zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso data indicated significant changes in transcript expression at zzso as low as zzso zzso In total, 154 zzso representing 44 unique transcripts were zzso expressed in zzso zzso the majority of which were validated by reverse zzso zzso zzso Investigation of molecular zzso gene zzso zzso and individual gene functions affected by zzso zzso indicated changes in zzso processes involved in: oxygen zzso neurological function, calcium zzso energy zzso cell zzso zzso stress and zzso In total, our study indicated that zzso exposure affected molecular processes critical to zzso function in zzso zzso
