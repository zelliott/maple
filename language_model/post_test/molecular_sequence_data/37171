The zzso zzso C, of zzso encephalitis virus has recently been found to tolerate deletions up to a length of 16 zzso acid zzso that partially removed the central zzso domain, a sequence element zzso among zzso which may be crucial for zzso zzso In this study, zzso with deletion lengths of 19, 21, 27, or 30 zzso removing more or all of this zzso domain, were found to yield viable virus zzso but this was without exception accompanied by the emergence of additional zzso within protein zzso These point zzso or sequence zzso were located downstream of the engineered deletion and generally increased the zzso suggesting that they may compensate for the loss of the central zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso together with the corresponding zzso were introduced into a zzso genetic zzso and the analysis of these zzso zzso provided direct evidence that the viability of the deletion zzso indeed depended on the presence of the zzso zzso Our results corroborate the notion that zzso interactions of protein C are essential for the assembly of infectious zzso particles but rule out the possibility that individual zzso of the central zzso domain are absolutely required for zzso Furthermore, the double zzso were found to be highly attenuated and capable of inducing a protective immune response in mice at even lower zzso doses than the previously characterized zzso deletion zzso suggesting that the combination of large deletions and zzso zzso may be a superior way to generate safe, attenuated zzso vaccine zzso
