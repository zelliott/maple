A zzso zzso the zzso zzso precursor of zzso V zzso has been isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the mature toxin is zzso as that of zzso by a signal zzso of 19 zzso and a zzso zzso of 16 zzso ending with a pair of basic zzso This is similar to the precursors of zzso from another sea zzso zzso zzso and to those of some zzso peptides of the zzso and zzso families from zzso The deduced zzso sequence of the potential cell attachment zzso zzso zzso shows zzso identity to that of zzso
