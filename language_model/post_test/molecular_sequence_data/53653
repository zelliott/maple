We have cloned and characterized a novel zzso zzso protein zzso zzso (with no zzso zzso from a rat brain zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso acids and can be detected as a protein of approximately 230 zzso in various cell lines and rat zzso zzso contains a small zzso domain followed by the zzso domain and a long zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain has the greatest similarity to the zzso protein zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso in zzso cells exerts no zzso effect on the activity of known, zzso zzso protein zzso suggesting that it belongs to a distinct zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso basic protein as well as itself mostly on zzso zzso confirming that it is a zzso protein zzso The demonstration of activity was striking because zzso and its zzso in other organisms lack the zzso zzso zzso in zzso II of protein zzso that is crucial for binding to zzso A model of zzso using the structure of zzso protein zzso suggests that zzso 233 in zzso zzso I may provide this zzso zzso of this zzso zzso to zzso eliminates zzso activity, consistent with the conclusion that it is required for zzso This distinct organization of zzso zzso indicates that zzso belongs to a novel family of zzso protein zzso
