The small zzso gene zzso the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned in zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso analysis revealed an zzso zzso 382 zzso acids without a signal zzso zzso Four regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso constituted four repeated and zzso sequence zzso the zzso zzso When zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shared zzso sequence identity and zzso similarity if conservative replacements were zzso The zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso showed the same folding zzso as the zzso three-dimensional structure of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located around the pocket of modeled zzso zzso small zzso were superimposed with the zzso pocket of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso as well as the role of the zzso zzso have not been characterized for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso were found to be involved in the zzso activity of zzso zzso small zzso with zzso properties and zzso zzso zzso Four zzso motifs were found remote from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the highly zzso zzso acids located in the zzso zzso suggest that these highly zzso zzso are important in maintaining the zzso structure of zzso The results of this study provide some knowledge for the design of new zzso of small zzso
