In this study, the enhanced degradation of TNT using cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been examined and the zzso of shuffled strain was compared to the zzso zzso zzso Genome zzso of zzso zzso zzso was used to achieve a rapid enhancement of TNT zzso The initial zzso population was generated by zzso treatment and zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain was able to degrade zzso zzso TNT within 6 days, yet barely tolerated zzso zzso TNT while the shuffled zzso zzso was capable of completely degrading zzso zzso TNT within 8 days, and zzso zzso within 24 zzso The zzso analysis of the shuffled zzso zzso demonstrated the changes in the expression levels of certain proteins compared to zzso zzso These results provide clues for understanding TNT tolerance and improved TNT degradation by shuffled zzso zzso zzso zzso and have possible applications in the processing of industrial waste containing relatively high TNT zzso
