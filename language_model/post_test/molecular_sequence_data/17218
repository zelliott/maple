Using zzso zzso and the zzso reaction, the growth hormone zzso gene and the zzso of the large yellow zzso zzso zzso were amplified and zzso The gene structure was analyzed and compared to the zzso genes of 5 other zzso fish downloaded from zzso Also the zzso gene of the large yellow zzso and the genes from 14 zzso and 2 zzso species were aligned using zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso was used to construct the zzso tree using maximum zzso and zzso zzso zzso trees by the two methods are identical in most of the zzso with high zzso zzso The results are also identical to those from zzso zzso In general, this analysis does not support the zzso of the families zzso and zzso But our zzso gene tree indicates that the representative species of the families zzso and zzso are a zzso zzso
