zzso virus zzso a member of the zzso zzso affects zzso million people in tropical and zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain is located at the zzso of the zzso zzso and requires for its zzso activity a zzso segment of the zzso that acts as a zzso The zzso is an important zzso drug target because it plays a crucial role in virus replication by zzso the zzso zzso into mature functional zzso Currently, there are no drugs to inhibit zzso zzso zzso Most structural and functional studies have been conducted using protein zzso containing the zzso zzso domain connected to a soluble segment of the zzso membrane protein via a zzso zzso For in zzso structural and functional studies, it would be useful to produce a natural form of the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso domain and the full-length zzso zzso zzso we describe the expression and zzso of a natural form of zzso zzso zzso containing the full-length zzso protein and the zzso domain of zzso zzso The zzso was expressed and zzso in zzso zzso necessary for its zzso Our results show that this zzso protein was active in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso These findings should facilitate further structural and functional studies of the zzso and will facilitate drug discovery targeting zzso
