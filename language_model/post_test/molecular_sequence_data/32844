The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from mouse kidney zzso by zzso zzso analysis showed that it contained a zzso open reading frame zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso The protein was expressed in zzso coli with or without an zzso zzso and had functional zzso activity that was highly specific for zzso and zzso To investigate the roles of the zzso and zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso we generated clones with several single zzso acid zzso of these zzso in an zzso zzso zzso These zzso significantly reduced the activity of the zzso zzso against zzso zzso acids and did not zzso any additional specificity to other zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are zzso important for full zzso zzso
