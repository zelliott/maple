zzso we describe the design and zzso characterization of a de zzso designed zzso zzso which zzso zzso folding at the zzso zzso zzso zzso is designed to be zzso in zzso saline solution, yet undergo zzso folding that is largely governed by the periodic positioning of zzso acid zzso zzso within the primary sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that the zzso remains unfolded and zzso in solution under normal zzso zzso however, CD zzso indicates that in the presence of zzso the zzso avidly binds to the mineral surface adopting a zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate nearly quantitative surface coverage and zzso zzso 310 zzso for the zzso binding zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso coupled with the zzso zzso data suggests that zzso binds to zzso forming a zzso zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of using zzso surfaces to trigger the zzso folding of designed peptides and represents the initial stages of defining the design rules that allow zzso zzso zzso
