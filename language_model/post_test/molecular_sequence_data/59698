We have zzso four kinds of reversed peptides of various zzso active zzso which inhibit zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso produce zzso zzso growth zzso exert zzso activity and inhibit cell attachment, zzso They were examined for their biological activity in comparison with that of normal zzso that is, naturally occurring zzso The reversed peptides induce similar activities, but to a lesser extent than those of the normal zzso zzso These results indicate that there may be zzso ambiguous binding in some of the naturally occurring zzso zzso This method may be useful as a tool to rapidly generate a novel lead zzso with the desired biological function from a naturally occurring active zzso
