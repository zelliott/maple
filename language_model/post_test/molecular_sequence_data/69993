zzso expression of human zzso zzso A4 zzso has been established in zzso insect cells using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in this system is at least zzso higher than previously achieved in a bacterial cell zzso zzso viral human zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso studies with zzso viral zzso zzso When zzso cells expressing zzso are incubated in the presence of zzso and zzso acid, zzso acid zzso and zzso are zzso in a ratio of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in these insect cells results in the synthesis of zzso zzso and in addition zzso and the ratio shifts to zzso for zzso The production of zzso formed zzso after addition of zzso acid to the zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso and zzso is the first demonstration of channeling of zzso acid to zzso in an engineered intact cell zzso This zzso a novel biological system to zzso significant amounts of the potent zzso agent, zzso Studies in which zzso cells infected with zzso were incubated with zzso cells infected with zzso resulted in export of zzso from the zzso cells and zzso metabolism of zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso
