Previously we have shown that expression of the zzso growth factor II zzso gene in 36 normal smooth muscle zzso zzso and 26 benign smooth muscle tumors zzso was zzso by Northern zzso analysis but that the zzso levels were zzso In 9 of 20 zzso smooth muscle tumors zzso zzso gene expression was also low or zzso while in 11 of 20 the zzso gene was abundantly zzso In 32 of these zzso we have now studied the DNA zzso state of the zzso zzso For the analysis of overall zzso of the gene the restriction zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In normal smooth muscle and in zzso the zzso gene appeared to be zzso In zzso with low zzso gene expression the DNA was partly zzso In zzso with abundant zzso gene expression overall zzso of the DNA tended to be zzso In addition, we have studied the zzso state of one particular zzso site in the zzso gene with the restriction zzso zzso The results of the latter analysis confirm the analysis with zzso and zzso In conclusion, in zzso smooth muscle tumors the data indicate an inverse correlation between zzso zzso and expression of the zzso zzso
