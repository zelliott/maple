The zzso crystal zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has high toxicity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso but is less toxic to Aedes zzso To study the functional role of putative domain II and surface zzso in zzso zzso 16 zzso substitution zzso were introduced into zzso All zzso zzso were expressed as zzso zzso and subsequently zzso by zzso to produce further fragmented zzso of 40 and 25 zzso With zzso however, most zzso were zzso to 60 zzso and minor zzso The circular zzso zzso of the zzso toxins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated that there was no significant variation in their zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed substantial reductions in zzso activity toward zzso aegypti and zzso zzso These zzso also showed reduced competition with zzso zzso zzso zzso for binding to zzso zzso brush border membrane zzso These data suggest that the reduction of toxicity was a result of the reduced binding zzso From these studies we have identified loop zzso of domain II that are important in toxicity and zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso
