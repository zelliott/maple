zzso zzso an Australian zzso is known to produce a highly toxic zzso Both protein profiling and zzso sequence analysis showed the presence of four new zzso zzso in this zzso Besides being zzso the zzso zzso proteins were found to be moderately active zzso and they showed zzso zzso zzso cloning and characterization indicated the presence of two zzso of zzso proteins in a single zzso each containing the zzso zzso characteristic of group zzso zzso zzso The zzso cloning also confirmed the presence of two genes each containing four zzso that are interrupted by three zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso group zzso zzso gene is primitive and could have evolved from the same zzso as the zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we report that the zzso gene could be responsible for the production of zzso 2, and 3 possibly via zzso editing zzso
