zzso gene disruption is a powerful tool for studying gene function in cells and zzso In addition, this technology includes a potential to correct zzso zzso However, constructing targeting zzso is a zzso step in the zzso strategy, even apart from the low efficiency of zzso zzso in zzso Here, we introduce a quick and simplified method to construct targeting zzso This method is based on the commercially available zzso Gateway zzso The sole critical step is to design zzso to zzso amplify zzso fragments for zzso DNA arms, after which neither zzso reaction nor extensive restriction mapping is necessary at zzso The method therefore is readily zzso to embryonic stem zzso cell studies as well as all organisms whose zzso has been zzso Recently, we and others have shown that the human zzso cell line zzso allows for zzso gene zzso The combination of the simplified zzso construction system and the zzso gene targeting in the zzso cell line has enabled rapid disruption of virtually any locus of the human zzso within one month, and zzso knockout clones lacking a human gene of interest can be created within 2-3 zzso Thus, our system greatly zzso reverse genetic studies of zzso zzso
