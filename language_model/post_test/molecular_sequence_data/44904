The zzso zzso zzso is able to respond to environmental stress by changing from the zzso zzso green cell form to red stationary zzso This differentiation program is accompanied by dramatic zzso changes that must result, at least in part, from differential gene zzso To begin to identify genes that are zzso expressed as a response to stress, we applied the differential display technique to identify and isolate zzso expressed zzso zzso Here we report on the isolation and characterization of one such zzso sequence that codes for zzso zzso a member of a heat shock zzso zzso family previously described only in zzso Interestingly, database searches of mouse and human zzso sequences showed that a previously zzso zzso is also found in a number of zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in zzso cells, but was found at high levels in developing zzso Evidence presented suggests that zzso transcripts zzso this protein are zzso zzso and that the different zzso products are zzso expressed during the zzso zzso These experiments provide the groundwork upon which the zzso program of zzso zzso can be zzso In addition, they indicate that the zzso family of heat shock zzso zzso may play an important role in stress response in higher organisms as well as in zzso
