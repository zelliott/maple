zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso whose activity zzso at the onset of M zzso It is closely related to other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso polo, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The M phase of the cell cycle is a highly coordinated process which zzso the zzso of genetic and cellular materials during cell zzso To enable understanding of the function of zzso during M phase zzso various zzso zzso were generated and expressed in zzso cells and budding zzso In zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso prepared from zzso cells indicate that zzso and zzso play equally important roles for zzso activity and that replacement of zzso with a zzso charged zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the cell division zzso associated with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso closely with the zzso activity measured in zzso as it is enhanced by a zzso activated zzso zzso but is not observed with the inactive forms zzso zzso and zzso In a zzso zzso background, expression of zzso zzso or zzso but not of inactive forms, induced a sharp zzso of cells in zzso zzso with elevated zzso activity, this phenomenon was enhanced by the zzso deleted forms zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso also induced a class of cells with unusually zzso buds which developed multiple zzso zzso This was not observed with the zzso deleted form zzso zzso zzso It appears that the C zzso of zzso is not required for the observed cell cycle influence but may be important for polarized cell growth and zzso structure zzso
