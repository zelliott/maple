zzso relationships among plants, animals, and zzso were examined by using sequences from 25 zzso Four zzso were found that are shared by two of the three zzso groups in question, and all four are uniquely shared by animals and zzso relative to plants, zzso and zzso These include a zzso acid zzso in translation zzso factor 1 alpha and three small gaps in zzso zzso trees were constructed from published data for four of the most broadly zzso of the 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor 1 zzso with the latter supplemented by three new zzso zzso All four proteins place animals and zzso together as a zzso group to the exclusion of plants and a broad diversity of zzso In all cases, zzso analyses show no support for either an zzso or zzso zzso This zzso among multiple lines of evidence strongly suggests, in contrast to traditional and current zzso that animals and zzso are sister groups while plants constitute an independent evolutionary zzso
