We have discovered zzso a novel zzso zzso expressed in human gastric zzso The zzso gene product contains a signal zzso five zzso repeat motifs and a single zzso and zzso domain, suggesting its residence on the plasma zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso fusion construct confirmed its cell surface zzso Although the zzso portion of the zzso gene product does not contain known protein zzso approximately one-fifth of these zzso are either a zzso or a zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in signal zzso zzso searches revealed zzso to be an exact match to zzso a recently identified, but functionally zzso protein related to zzso a zzso repeat containing cell zzso zzso implicated in zzso tract zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso is zzso expressed in approximately zzso of tumor versus normal tissue from gastric zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso construct in the gastric zzso cell line, zzso led to altered zzso increased zzso zzso instability, decreased cell zzso and a nearly complete zzso of zzso in nude zzso These findings suggest a potential zzso role for zzso in gastric zzso
