The cells at the periphery of the root cap are continuously zzso off from the root into the zzso and are thought to be programmed to zzso By using zzso zzso screening and a zzso zzso screening strategy involving expression screening in zzso zzso cells, we isolated two related zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are specifically expressed in the zzso one to three cells of the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso proteins of 37 zzso mature zzso with a region of zzso zzso zzso and putative zzso signal zzso and represent members of a novel protein family which is zzso among zzso and zzso
