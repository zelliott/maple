Recent studies have indicated that zzso zzso predominance Hodgkin's disease zzso is a zzso zzso Although molecular events in the zzso transformation of zzso are not well zzso zzso virus infection and zzso protein zzso have been zzso to have zzso roles in some zzso zzso virus has been demonstrated in the zzso cells of Hodgkin's disease cases zzso than zzso as well as in some zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in the majority of zzso zzso The zzso role for zzso in HD is zzso Some reports have indicated the presence of zzso gene zzso associated with the zzso zzso detected by the zzso chain reaction in zzso recent studies have failed to confirm this zzso Reports in the literature describe only a few such analyses in the zzso zzso To address these conflicting issues, we examined 12 cases of zzso to determine whether zzso protein expression (by zzso and zzso virus (by in zzso zzso could be detected in the zzso zzso None of the cases showed expression of zzso protein or zzso virus zzso in the zzso zzso zzso virus does not appear to play an important role in the zzso of zzso Similarly, we cannot substantiate a role for zzso in the development of this type of Hodgkin's zzso
