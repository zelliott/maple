The development of collections of zzso characterized standard biological parts should facilitate the engineering of increasingly complex and novel biological zzso The existing zzso and fluorescent reporters that are used to characterize biological part functions exhibit strengths and zzso Combining both zzso and zzso activities within a single reporter protein would provide a useful tool for biological part zzso 

Here, we describe the construction and quantitative characterization of zzso a fusion between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of full-length green fluorescent protein zzso We show that zzso exhibits functional zzso activity, which we zzso with plates and zzso and functional zzso activity, which we zzso with zzso and zzso We show that the protein fusion increases the sensitivity of zzso activity and decreases the sensitivity of zzso 

zzso is therefore a zzso reporter with a wider dynamic range than the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso enables the characterization of gene zzso screening zzso via zzso activity, and quantitative zzso zzso or zzso via zzso zzso The zzso flexibility afforded by zzso will likely increase the efficiency of research, particularly for screening and characterization of libraries of standard biological zzso
