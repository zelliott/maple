The zzso are a family of 36 to zzso zzso zzso that block insect but not zzso zzso calcium zzso The high zzso specificity of these toxins recommends them as lead compounds for targeting insects that have developed resistance to chemical zzso We have begun to examine zzso relationships in the zzso in order to explore the molecular basis of their activity and zzso zzso By probing the zzso of the Blue Mountains zzso spider, zzso zzso for zzso toxins with masses close to that of zzso zzso we have isolated and zzso five additional zzso Five of the six zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso differ from one another by only 1-3 zzso and have similar zzso zzso In contrast, zzso differs from the other toxins by up to 10 zzso and it has markedly reduced zzso zzso thus providing information on key functional zzso The new zzso sequences have revealed that the three zzso zzso are highly zzso Despite the fact that these zzso are structurally zzso in solution we show here, by a series of zzso zzso that they contribute significantly to zzso zzso However, loss of activity does not correlate with deletion of highly zzso zzso which leads us to propose that the disposition of the zzso charge, rather than the chemical properties of the zzso zzso themselves, may be critical for the activity of zzso on insect calcium zzso
