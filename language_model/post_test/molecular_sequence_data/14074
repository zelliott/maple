The protein zzso of a mouse seminal zzso zzso was studied by circular zzso zzso At pH zzso the spectrum in the zzso region appears as one negative band at 217 zzso and one positive band at 200 zzso This together with the predicted secondary structures indicates no zzso but a mixture of beta form, beta turn, and zzso form in the protein zzso The zzso is stable even at pH zzso or zzso The spectrum in the zzso region consists of fine structures that are disturbed in zzso or alkaline zzso The environments around zzso and zzso of this protein were studied by intrinsic zzso and zzso zzso They give an zzso peak at 345 zzso and about zzso of them are accessible to zzso by zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso and zzso on the protein zzso to the charged groups along the zzso chain suggests the difference in the zzso zzso around the two zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the protein solution effects no change in the circular zzso but zzso the zzso due to zzso Analysis of the zzso data suggests a zzso site on the zzso which cannot coordinate with both zzso and zzso The association constant for the complex formation is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso
