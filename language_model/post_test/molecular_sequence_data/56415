An zzso reduction in the levels of the insulin zzso zzso transcribed from one zzso was reported in some patients with severe insulin resistance and zzso diabetes zzso zzso To detect this zzso we designed the less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the amplified zzso zzso by using silent zzso in the insulin zzso gene zzso positions at zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso and zzso in 10 normal subjects, and zzso and zzso in 20 zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso and zzso in the normal subjects, and zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso These results suggest that these two zzso are very common in zzso zzso zzso out of 30 cases are zzso at one or two zzso suggesting that it is possible to distinguish the zzso transcribed from each of two zzso of the insulin zzso gene with using zzso zzso zzso Although we successfully measured the ratio of zzso expression from two zzso of the gene in 20 zzso there was no patient whose zzso transcribed from one zzso of the insulin zzso gene was extremely zzso We showed that zzso zzso zzso method is useful for the screening of abnormal zzso gene zzso
