A new model of secondary and zzso structure of higher plant zzso zzso is zzso It consists of three zzso zzso alpha includes stem I and loop zzso domain beta contains stems II and III and zzso B and zzso domain gamma consists of stems IV and V and zzso D and zzso We propose that the zzso beta and gamma adopt zzso like structure due to irregularities caused by the different in size internal zzso B and E and the zzso occurring in the zzso A suggested zzso of zzso could bring single stranded fragments of zzso beta and gamma close enough to each other to allow zzso zzso The new model of plant zzso zzso differs from those suggested previously for zzso zzso zzso by arrangement of the zzso beta and gamma and the base pairing scheme of domain zzso The model is based on our results of partial zzso obtained with single and double strand specific zzso The experimental results were confirmed by computer aided secondary structure prediction analysis of all higher plant zzso zzso and computer modeling using energy zzso zzso Further support of our model have been provided by experiments including alpha zzso zzso H and chemical zzso
