zzso are zzso sequences in a gene that are transcribed to precursor zzso but spliced out during zzso maturation and are abundant in zzso zzso The availability of zzso molecular markers and saturated genetic linkage maps have been limited in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the development of 98 novel zzso length zzso zzso markers in zzso zzso using sequence information of the model plant zzso A total of zzso zzso expressed sequence tag zzso sequences were zzso of which zzso and 248 unique sequences were from zzso and zzso suppression zzso zzso libraries, zzso The zzso analysis of 98 zzso sequences suggests a nearly defined function for about zzso of them, and they were grouped into 11 different functional zzso All 98 zzso primer pairs showed a high level of zzso amplification in two zzso and two zzso species ranging from zzso to zzso with a mean of zzso The mean observed zzso and zzso average gene diversity zzso and zzso respectively, established the efficiency of the zzso markers for distinguishing the zzso zzso zzso Based on 26 zzso zzso a reasonable zzso of 45 zzso zzso zzso was constructed, demonstrating the utility of zzso markers in zzso zzso and zzso relationships in zzso and zzso zzso
