We have cloned and zzso two zzso zzso and zzso from anterior zzso tissue of the zzso fly zzso zzso The DNA and zzso protein sequences suggest both are produced as zzso zzso differs from the classic zzso pattern in having an unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso have lower zzso points and charge than insect zzso derived from fat zzso Northern analysis shows both of these zzso molecules are tissue zzso both are produced by the anterior zzso tissue and, unlike the other insect zzso reported to date, neither appears to be expressed in fat body or zzso Northern analysis also shows that zzso for both zzso are zzso produced in the anterior zzso zzso and that these transcripts are zzso in response to sterile as well as a zzso blood zzso However, zzso biological activity in the zzso is substantially enhanced by zzso These findings suggest that the insect zzso has its own zzso immune mechanisms and that this zzso zzso is, like several zzso zzso protected by specific zzso zzso
