Two zzso family genes identified in humans, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that serve as zzso receptors for zzso and zzso and participate in the transmission of human and zzso zzso viruses zzso and zzso zzso to target cells in zzso Here we characterize the zzso gene family in nonhuman primates and show that recent evolutionary zzso have occurred in this family across zzso zzso All of the zzso species tested, specifically, Old World monkeys zzso and apes, have zzso of human zzso In contrast, zzso is missing in zzso but present in zzso A third family member, that we have named zzso was cloned from zzso monkey zzso and subsequently identified in zzso and apes but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso was prominently expressed in the liver and zzso zzso zzso although preliminary data suggest that levels of expression may vary among zzso Despite a high level of sequence similarity to both human and zzso zzso zzso zzso was substantially less effective at binding zzso and poorly transmitted zzso type 1 and zzso to target cells relative to zzso Our data suggest that the zzso gene family has undergone recent evolutionary processes involving zzso and zzso the latter of which may be tolerated because of potentially redundant functional activities of the molecules zzso by these zzso
