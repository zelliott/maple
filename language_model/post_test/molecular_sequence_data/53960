zzso disease zzso the most common form of zzso neurodegenerative disorders, is associated with formation of zzso deposits of zzso zzso zzso While the direct involvement of zzso in zzso has been well zzso the relations between zzso production, zzso formation, and zzso remain zzso We propose that zzso is initiated by a protein zzso structural transformation in soluble zzso We zzso that spontaneous chemical modification of zzso zzso in zzso to transient zzso zzso a non-native zzso in a fraction of soluble zzso rendering it zzso and zzso zzso altered zzso is characterized by increased stability in solution and the presence of a non-native zzso that determines folding of zzso in solution and the structure of zzso zzso incorporated into zzso zzso While the soluble zzso zzso is both the factor triggering the neurodegenerative cascade and the precursor of zzso zzso these two events result from interaction of zzso with different sets of cellular components and need not coincide in space and zzso zzso literature data and experimental evidence are provided in support of this zzso
