The alkaline zzso (AP) is a zzso of potential applications in biotechnology and zzso in which zzso zzso are zzso zzso under alkaline conditions to yield zzso zzso The zzso occurs through an zzso intermediate in which the zzso zzso is zzso The reaction, which also requires a third metal zzso is proposed to proceed through a mechanism of zzso displacement involving a zzso zzso transition zzso zzso the transition state by zzso hydrogen bonding has been suggested to be the reason for conservation of an zzso zzso in the active zzso We report here the first crystal structure of alkaline zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure reveals many differences from other zzso 1) the zzso zzso is a zzso instead of zzso 2) there is no third metal zzso binding pocket, and 3) the zzso zzso forming zzso hydrogen bonding is deleted in zzso A zzso and an zzso zzso recruited together for the first time into the active site, bind the zzso zzso group in a manner not observed before in any other zzso These and other structural features suggest that zzso represents a new class of zzso Because of its direct contact with the zzso zzso group, the zzso zzso is proposed to play a significant role in zzso The structure is consistent with a mechanism of zzso displacement via a zzso zzso transition zzso The structure provides important insights into evolutionary relationships between members of zzso zzso
