The pea late zzso gene zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso is zzso to the pea early zzso genes zzso and zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that, like the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene is only expressed in the infected cell zzso The zzso gene is first expressed at the transition of the zzso zone II into the zzso zzso (the zzso zone preceding the fixation zone zzso whereas the early zzso genes zzso and zzso are already induced in the zzso zone zzso Thus these zzso genes zzso zzso proteins are induced at consecutive stages of zzso zzso The expression of the late zzso genes zzso zzso precedes the expression of the late zzso gene zzso Therefore these late zzso genes have to be regulated by different mechanisms despite the fact they are expressed in the same cell zzso This conclusion is consistent with the fact that zzso lacks one of the zzso regions occurring in the promoters of all other late zzso genes zzso
