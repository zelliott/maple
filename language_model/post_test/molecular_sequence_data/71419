A truncated zzso coding a rabbit zzso protein zzso was identified in a previous zzso In the present study the full-length zzso was isolated by the method of rapid amplification of zzso zzso The zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso with a zzso tail of 26 zzso and an open reading frame composed of zzso zzso zzso a deduced zzso containing 123 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of 13 zzso The zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso has about zzso zzso with the zzso gene of human zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso prepared from 17 different human zzso was performed using as probe a zzso DNA zzso corresponding to a segment of zzso zzso Positive reaction was zzso only with zzso zzso A DNA zzso corresponding to a section of the open reading frame of zzso zzso was cloned in zzso coli under the control of the zzso zzso The cellular content of the expressed zzso protein comprised about zzso of the total zzso The zzso zzso bacterial product migrated as a single band with an estimated zzso of 15 zzso on analysis by zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is expressed only in the zzso It is structurally related to the zzso core family of zzso zzso zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso
