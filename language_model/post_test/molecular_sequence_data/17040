zzso change of zzso has been examined by measuring the rate of zzso zzso exchange in zzso zzso Time dependent zzso shift caused by zzso exchange was monitored by zzso zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso zzso The rate zzso of zzso exchange were calculated from apparent zzso zzso The time course of zzso exchange exhibited two zzso of faster and slower zzso The smaller rate constant zzso estimated from the slower zzso exchange was correlated with an zzso content that reflected the folding zzso The order of zzso values obtained for human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso salmon zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequence of zzso is similar to that of zzso their zzso values were considerably zzso The results suggest that zzso is relatively rigid on the zzso side zzso structure in the folded zzso Further, the effect of zzso zzso on zzso has been zzso In the oxidized zzso that possesses similar biological activity with the intact zzso the zzso values obtained were nearly zzso The zzso of zzso increased via zzso zzso and the biological activity was weakened by zzso This suggested that zzso zzso of zzso produced unfolding in the secondary structure and that zzso unfolding of zzso led to the loss of biological zzso The results indicate that the zzso exchange rate constant may be used as an zzso zzso to zzso the relationship between the folded state and biological activity of zzso like zzso with secondary zzso
