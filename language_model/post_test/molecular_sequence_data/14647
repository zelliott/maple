The mechanisms underlying genetic zzso at zzso discovered by zzso association study zzso approaches in human cancer remain largely zzso In this study, we characterized the high-risk zzso association at the zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso variations correlate with increased expression of the zzso activated zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso showed zzso zzso effects, including decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso In established zzso zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient for zzso zzso zzso stabilized the Aurora family of zzso in zzso cells, suggesting both a mechanism for the observed effect and a potential therapeutic zzso Together, our findings identify zzso as an zzso driver of high-risk zzso zzso and more generally, they illustrate how robust zzso signals offer zzso landmarks to identify molecular mechanisms involved in both tumor initiation and zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with the Aurora family of zzso lends strong support to the ongoing work to develop Aurora zzso zzso for clinically aggressive zzso
