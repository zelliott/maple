Turkey zzso zzso virus zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and causes disease in turkey zzso characterized by zzso bloody zzso and zzso The mechanism responsible for zzso zzso formation and mortality is not known, although there is strong evidence that it is zzso All strains of zzso are zzso zzso although there are naturally occurring zzso strains of zzso that replicate efficiently in zzso without the zzso zzso or mortality associated with more virulent zzso The purpose of this study was to determine which viral genes are involved in zzso The full-length zzso of an zzso vaccine strain was zzso and compared with the zzso of a virulent field isolate from Israel that was zzso in zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso revealed 49 zzso differences resulting in 14 putative zzso acid changes within viral zzso zzso of the regions surrounding the 14 zzso zzso revealed variations in zzso zzso and the fiber zzso zzso domain in five additional strains with varying degrees of zzso Complete sequences of these genes were determined in a total of 11 different strains of zzso All strains had at least one zzso zzso in zzso and all but two of the strains had one zzso zzso in zzso At least one zzso zzso was found in the fiber zzso domain in six out of seven virulent zzso zzso variation of zzso zzso and zzso in strains of zzso with different zzso strongly indicates that these genes are the key factors affecting zzso
