A zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso encodes a fatty acid zzso component that is specific for zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso in all zzso zzso with no visible effects on plant zzso zzso analysis of the various zzso classes indicated that these novel fatty acids were largely excluded from the zzso position of zzso zzso and seed zzso whereas they were enriched in the same position in zzso zzso and zzso are precursors of zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso via the so-called zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of significant quantities of zzso and zzso in a higher plant is therefore a key step in the production of very long chain zzso fatty acid in zzso zzso The results are further discussed in terms of zzso and zzso pathways of zzso synthesis in zzso
