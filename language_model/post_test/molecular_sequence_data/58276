The membrane zzso zzso zzso like domain 3 of zzso shows significant sequence similarity to the zzso light chain variable zzso zzso According to our model, based on this zzso the zzso loop in zzso zzso to the zzso determining region zzso 3 of the zzso V zzso The zzso loop in the membrane zzso domain of the zzso growth factor zzso has previously been shown to participate in determining the zzso zzso binding specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso Here, we report the effects of additional zzso in this zzso zzso Both a single zzso zzso zzso and a double zzso zzso zzso zzso are found to have relatively mild effects on zzso zzso as was previously found for three other zzso loop zzso zzso In contrast, a single zzso zzso in the zzso loop of zzso is sufficient to abolish essentially all affinity of this zzso for its primary zzso zzso while some affinity for zzso is zzso zzso is, therefore, essential for zzso binding by zzso We discuss the likelihood of this effect being due to global or local structural changes or to the removal of a specific interaction with the zzso in relation to various known and model zzso Taking into account the mild effects of other zzso in the region and various other considerations, we tend to favor the idea that zzso is a key zzso in determining the local zzso of the zzso zzso
