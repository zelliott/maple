A novel method for zzso zzso materials is described which employs zzso zzso zzso followed by detection by zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso It is demonstrated through zzso zzso trap mass zzso that the formation of multiply charged zzso zzso which bind up to five sodium zzso allows the rapid analysis of zzso zzso with molecular weights in excess of 9 zzso zzso zzso generated from zzso of the zzso collected from the same SEC separation are shown to be in good agreement with the zzso zzso with respect to molecular weight zzso and types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso of samples obtained from sequential graded ethanol zzso and SEC zzso of acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso show important structural differences between zzso zzso In addition, a comparison is made between the mass zzso of native and zzso zzso fragments of acid and zzso treated zzso zzso information of the zzso zzso zzso can be rapidly established through the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso
