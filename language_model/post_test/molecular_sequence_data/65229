zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the acute phase reaction to zzso Although the zzso role of zzso is uncertain, its role in iron zzso zzso and protection against free zzso cell injury has been widely zzso Previous studies showed the existence of two molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a membrane zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso is produced mainly by the liver and is abundant in human serum whereas zzso is expressed in zzso zzso rat zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso we show using zzso that human peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso express the transcripts for both zzso molecular zzso previously zzso Also, expression of zzso in zzso is demonstrated by zzso with zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis using cells isolated from healthy blood donors with normal zzso zzso zzso the results obtained show that natural killer cells have a significantly higher zzso expression compared to all other major zzso zzso In this context, the involvement of zzso zzso on host defense processes via its zzso properties is proposed, giving further support for a close functional interaction between the immune system and the zzso zzso
