The zzso gene was recently discovered and proposed as a zzso zzso We examined the zzso gene in a panel of zzso zzso along with their corresponding zzso zzso by reverse zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso amplification and sequencing of the zzso A normal zzso transcript was found to be expressed at robust levels in 44 of 46 zzso zzso and in all of 46 zzso zzso zzso Of the 46 zzso zzso 21 zzso revealed the occurrence of zzso zzso In addition, of the 46 matched normal zzso 14 zzso showed the existence of zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso transcripts were missing in one or more zzso of the zzso zzso while 8 cases displayed zzso transcripts of the zzso gene both in zzso and in zzso zzso However, sequence analysis revealed that the patterns of the zzso transcripts were different between the corresponding paired zzso In addition, there were 6 cases displaying zzso zzso transcripts only in their zzso zzso These studies indicate that abnormalities of the zzso gene transcripts occur at a fairly high frequency in zzso and corresponding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso However, they might not be zzso related to the zzso of the zzso zzso
