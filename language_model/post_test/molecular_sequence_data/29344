zzso isolated from the zzso of the South American zzso zzso zzso zzso is a strongly basic zzso acid zzso belonging to the small basic zzso zzso As no zzso structure is available for this zzso zzso despite its important pharmacological interest, we propose in this paper a theoretical zzso model for zzso Starting from a zzso zzso zzso followed by intensive molecular dynamics zzso simulations in water and complementary CD experiments, the designed zzso model is the first example of a zzso structure in this family of small basic zzso zzso therefore, belongs to a newly identified structural family presenting a common fold also found in zzso and zzso The proposed zzso model will be used for future calculations about zzso zzso and interaction with zzso
