zzso sheep zzso has been largely eradicated in the UK but persists in the feral zzso sheep of St zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso transmit zzso zzso but zzso are typically cryptic and this zzso has not been recorded in the St zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso in preserved zzso and were also found in gut zzso from live zzso one infected gut was used to establish the zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso forms from culture confirmed its identity as zzso zzso Most zzso were found to zzso the zzso particularly those collected from zzso DNA was extracted from preserved zzso and from zzso grown in zzso zzso analysis of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the spliced leader transcript showed the zzso zzso sequences to be very similar to those from zzso zzso A partial sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene was also zzso The close genetic relationship of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso represents a lineage of zzso zzso that adapted to transmission by sheep zzso and hence became a specific zzso of zzso
