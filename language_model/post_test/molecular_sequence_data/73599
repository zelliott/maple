zzso of zzso carbohydrates by zzso has wide implications in important biological zzso The ability of plant zzso to detect subtle variations in zzso structures found on zzso cells and organisms have made them a paradigm for zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the most well studied family of plant zzso display a considerable repertoire of zzso zzso zzso perhaps to the sequence zzso in the zzso zzso their combining zzso However, lack of a rigorous framework to explain their zzso binding zzso has precluded a rational approach to alter their zzso binding activity in a meaningful zzso This study reports an extensive analysis of sequences and structures of several zzso zzso and shows that despite the zzso of their combining regions they exhibit within a significant pattern of zzso The results show that the size of the binding site loop D is zzso in the zzso specific zzso and is possibly a primary zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of size and sequence zzso of zzso reveal the existence of a common theme that zzso to define their binding zzso These results thus provide not only a framework for understanding the molecular basis of zzso recognition by zzso zzso but also a rationale for redesign of their zzso binding zzso
