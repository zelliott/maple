The zzso specificity of the different forms of the zzso zzso type zzso protein zzso and of the active zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso was investigated, using synthetic peptides zzso by either zzso protein zzso or by zzso zzso The zzso zzso are very efficient toward the zzso peptides zzso and zzso when compared with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite their distinct zzso both zzso peptides are excellent zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso being zzso faster than zzso zzso The slow zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso could be increased substantially by the zzso of zzso zzso basic zzso In contrast with the latter, the zzso zzso shows very poor activity toward all the zzso tested, without preference for either zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso basic zzso also favor the zzso of otherwise almost zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is highly favored by the nature of the zzso zzso acid, zzso activity toward zzso peptides may require specific zzso in the primary structure of the zzso zzso
