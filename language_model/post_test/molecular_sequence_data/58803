The zzso from the seeds of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein with physical and zzso properties reported to be similar to that of the jack bean zzso zzso A zzso Unlike other plant zzso both zzso and zzso bind with high affinity to the core zzso zzso zzso which is present in all zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso techniques have been used to investigate binding of zzso and zzso to a series of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and to a series of zzso zzso and complex zzso and zzso The results indicate that both zzso and zzso recognize zzso on all three zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso and zzso groups of the zzso zzso the zzso group of the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso groups of the central Man zzso of the core zzso However, unlike zzso zzso does not bind to zzso complex zzso This was confirmed by showing that zzso complex zzso do not bind to a zzso affinity zzso Unlike zzso zzso does not show enhanced affinity for a large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso Thus, zzso and zzso share similar zzso recognition of the core zzso zzso However, they exhibit differences in their fine zzso for larger zzso zzso and complex zzso
