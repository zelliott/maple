zzso growth factor zzso is zzso as a biologically zzso zzso form zzso Its zzso is associated with zzso at zzso into a zzso mature form composed of zzso zzso and zzso Because serum is a major source of zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso responsible for the processing of zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso had not been zzso In this study, to enable zzso production of zzso zzso we generated engineered human zzso that can be specifically zzso and activated by zzso zzso Since zzso I specifically zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso which does not exist in human zzso zzso (the zzso of the zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso I zzso engineered zzso specifically at the replaced zzso acid zzso forming a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was most efficient in the case of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed biological activities identical to those of zzso zzso Considering a potential medical application of zzso the present technique is valuable because it enables the production of zzso zzso zzso entirely without serum and extends the choice of host cells and organisms for zzso zzso
