We have used the zzso zzso of zzso dissolved in zzso water as zzso zzso for the detection of zzso hydrogen zzso Neither the measured OH temperature shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical shifts zzso delta zzso nor OH exchange rates allowed us to single out any zzso group in zzso with characteristics indicative of involvement in strong hydrogen zzso However, two-dimensional zzso exchange zzso zzso revealed a direct exchange between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that an zzso zzso hydrogen bond zzso exists in zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso water is proposed as a novel method to detect this type of weak hydrogen zzso
