The zzso zzso zzso region zzso region 1) of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso region zzso region 2) of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and compared with the zzso regions 1 and 2 of other zzso A high degree of zzso conservation was observed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and very similar sequences were found for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso region 1 is highly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso only the zzso gene and the zzso processing stems are highly zzso in the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The presence of a unique zzso gene without the 3' terminal zzso sequence seems to be a general feature of the zzso zzso region zzso A secondary structure model was built to show the interaction between the zzso regions 1 and 2 of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The rapid evolution of zzso region 1 in zzso is in part due to insertions and deletions of small zzso zzso zzso
