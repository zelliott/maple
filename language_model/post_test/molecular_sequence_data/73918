zzso Y zzso is a potent zzso agent that is stored in the sympathetic zzso In several species, zzso release is zzso when sympathetic impulse zzso zzso We investigated the extent to which zzso contributes to the zzso response to zzso and zzso electrical zzso zzso were zzso and the sympathetic trunk was zzso at either 20 or 3 zzso in the presence or absence of zzso of zzso and alpha and beta zzso zzso The zzso stimulation raised plasma zzso levels, but the zzso stimulation did zzso The zzso stimulation caused marked zzso responses that were maintained for several minutes after the end of stimulation regardless of whether rats were zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced the size of the zzso response that followed 20 zzso stimulation by zzso The rapid blood pressure spikes that occur during electrical stimulation are attenuated by alpha zzso but not by zzso zzso There is a prolonged zzso response after zzso stimulation of the sympathetic trunk in zzso rats that begins after 1 to 2 zzso of stimulation and lasts approximately 10 zzso after the end of zzso At least half of this zzso response is zzso by zzso
