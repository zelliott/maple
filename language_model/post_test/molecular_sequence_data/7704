We have cloned and characterized a genetic element zzso zzso that is responsible for the induction of zzso as well as zzso expression in zzso zzso This element zzso was isolated from zzso zzso DNA and protein data bases were searched with this element zzso which suggested it to be very similar to zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso found on zzso which encodes 100 zzso acids zzso had a zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso In fact, when the zzso protein was zzso in zzso coli, zzso as well as zzso expression was zzso
