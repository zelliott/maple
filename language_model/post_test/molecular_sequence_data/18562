Japanese encephalitis zzso is a disease that threatens both human and animal populations in Asian countries, and the zzso agent of zzso Japanese encephalitis virus zzso has recently changed from zzso III zzso to zzso I zzso However, a test for the rapid differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso is still zzso especially one that can be used for zzso zzso We have designed zzso and zzso primer sets for the rapid detection and differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso by multiplex reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The zzso and zzso primer sets were able to specifically amplify the target gene from zzso and zzso zzso zzso The limitations of detection were zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso the multiplex zzso was able to specifically detect and differentiate zzso and zzso zzso The multiplex zzso was able to successfully differentiate zzso and zzso virus in zzso zzso Thus, a sensitive and specific multiplex zzso system for the rapid detection and differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso has been developed, and this test is likely to be valuable when carrying out zzso zzso zzso
