Analysis of the distribution of zzso zzso II on the zzso of zzso and human cells using in zzso zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso II zzso zzso is concentrated at the zzso of thousands of zzso This appears to be irrespective of zzso zzso zzso a potential regulatory step in the zzso of many genes occurs after Pol II has associated with the zzso The zzso zzso technique widely used to monitor Pol II and other proteins on zzso in zzso however, does not reveal if Pol II is zzso engaged on zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso provides one method for detecting zzso engaged Pol zzso Using this approach, we have determined that the Pol II associated with the promoters of many genes has initiated zzso but paused in the region zzso zzso from the zzso Here we describe the application of this method in zzso and human zzso The method should prove useful in assessing if promoter bound Pol II has engaged in zzso and for investigating the establishment and regulation of zzso engaged Pol zzso
