zzso sensory zzso with zzso zzso is a very rare disease with both zzso dominant and zzso modes of zzso We previously mapped the locus of the zzso zzso form to a 25 zzso zzso between markers zzso and zzso on zzso zzso In this candidate zzso the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most obvious candidate gene since zzso in the zzso gene zzso the zzso delta zzso has been reported to be associated with zzso zzso zzso sensory zzso in mutilated foot zzso rat zzso 

A zzso Moroccan family with four patients displaying zzso sensory zzso associated with zzso zzso was zzso To identify the disease causing zzso the 11 coding zzso of the zzso gene were screened for zzso by direct sequencing in all family members including the four patients, parents, and six at risk zzso 

zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed a zzso zzso zzso in zzso 4 that results in the substitution of a highly zzso zzso for zzso zzso acid zzso Interestingly, zzso was absent in zzso control matched zzso zzso 

This is the first disease causing zzso that has been identified in the human zzso zzso zzso the zzso rat zzso could serve as an animal model for studying these zzso
