Human zzso virus zzso persists in zzso zzso and zzso zzso even during aggressive drug treatment, likely due to insufficient drug zzso at this zzso zzso to eliminate this residual virus, methods that enhance zzso zzso drug zzso are currently being zzso Although enhanced drug zzso in tissue have been achieved with zzso zzso zzso targeting these particles to zzso cells may provide specific delivery of drug to zzso target cells and further enhance drug zzso We have evaluated four candidate peptides with reported binding specificity to zzso for zzso on zzso zzso preparations previously shown to zzso in zzso zzso Terminal zzso containing candidate peptides were zzso to zzso zzso through zzso zzso for targeting to zzso zzso Using zzso labeled zzso zzso binding to cells with varying degree of zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso we zzso two zzso sequences that provided zzso selectivity to zzso These two zzso candidates on zzso zzso bound to cells corresponding to the degree of zzso expression and in a zzso dose dependent zzso Further, binding of these targeted zzso zzso was zzso specific, as zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso or free peptides inhibited the binding zzso These results indicate targeting of zzso zzso for specific binding to zzso can be accomplished by tagging zzso binding peptides with zzso and these results provide a basis for further evaluation of this targeted delivery system to enhance zzso drug delivery to zzso zzso host cells, particularly those in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
