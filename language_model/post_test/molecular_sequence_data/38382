We characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso from zzso animal caps by differential zzso The zzso is very similar to mouse zzso in the protein coding region including the zinc finger domain and zzso The expression pattern was analyzed by zzso and whole mount in zzso zzso zzso expression was initially restricted to the zzso marginal zone in the late zzso and was subsequently expressed at the lateral edge of neural plate and, in the zzso stage, in the zzso neural tube, and zzso zzso of zzso at the animal caps resulted in zzso of anterior neural markers without zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso induced enlargement of neural cells and zzso eye zzso In addition to abnormal head zzso many zzso were zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso which may be involved in the zzso signal zzso
