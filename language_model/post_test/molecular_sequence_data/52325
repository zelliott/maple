The interaction of factor zzso with tissue factor zzso results in an increase in the zzso efficiency for the zzso of several synthetic zzso zzso zzso by factor zzso The binding of human zzso factor zzso to zzso human zzso incorporated into zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso was studied using the increased rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a signal for the zzso The zzso dependence of rate on increasing zzso of factor zzso or zzso yielded no obvious evidence for zzso and could be analyzed according to the interaction of factor zzso with independent zzso sites zzso zzso 259 zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of factor zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and equilibrium parameters were derived from zzso using zzso or zzso in the absence of zzso indicating that possible zzso interactions do not further stabilize the zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant for the interaction of factor zzso with zzso zzso from zzso of factor X zzso zzso zzso 197 zzso 38 zzso was comparable with the values obtained from zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso nature of the zzso interaction, the rate of factor X zzso was reduced by approximately zzso when the zzso complex was assembled using zzso zzso zzso the result indicate that the membrane dependence of zzso zzso function primarily results from an influence of the membrane surface on factor X zzso
