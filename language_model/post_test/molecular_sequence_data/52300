The zzso start sites of the zzso human zzso zzso gene and zzso expressed TM zzso gene zzso were defined by zzso zzso mapping which showed two closely spaced sites at zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and internal deletion zzso of the TM zzso gene zzso reveal that the region from zzso to zzso exhibits a positive acting domain which is essential for zzso activity, whereas the region from zzso to zzso possesses two positive acting zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso which together augment zzso activity by about zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with a duplex zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso and zzso I zzso experiments show two specific interaction products which individually or zzso protect the DNA sequence from about zzso to zzso These components are essential for TM gene zzso since affinity zzso of nuclear extracts with a duplex zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso zzso the above interaction products and specifically zzso in zzso zzso activity of the promoter, whereas addition of the zzso components specifically restores in zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with duplex zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso as well as zzso to zzso and zzso I zzso experiments show two specific interaction products which individually bind to the two zzso but not zzso to zzso and protect the coding and zzso strands from zzso to zzso and the zzso strand from zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression studies reveal that the TM promoter construct starting at zzso and including the zzso box is responsive to zzso only in cell lines exhibiting sensitivity of the zzso zzso gene to zzso whereas other promoter zzso possessing a zzso box sequence are insensitive to zzso in all cell zzso Based upon the above data, the regulatory events involved in zzso zzso regulation of the TM gene can be defined with the experimental tools and conceptual framework developed by the present zzso
