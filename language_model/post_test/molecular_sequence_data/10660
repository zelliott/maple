We determined the zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso and related species of zzso zzso zzso made from alignment of this sequence with the sequences of other bacteria demonstrated that zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso species in the gamma zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously thought to be related to members of the order zzso but the representatives of this order have been shown to be members of the alpha 1 zzso of the zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso should be removed from the order zzso
