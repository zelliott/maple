zzso is a general event in plant zzso zzso zzso but has never been detected in a plant zzso transfer zzso zzso We demonstrate here the occurrence of a zzso editing event in higher plant zzso in both bean and zzso the C zzso at position 4 in the zzso zzso gene is converted into a U in the mature zzso This zzso change zzso the mismatched zzso zzso which appears when folding the gene sequence into the zzso structure and it is consistent with the fact that C to U transitions constitute the common editing events affecting plant zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is located upstream of the single copy zzso gene in both the potato and the bean zzso zzso The sequences of potato and bean zzso genes are zzso with the sequence of the mature bean zzso zzso demonstrating that this zzso is not zzso A single copy zzso gene was found upstream of the zzso gene in the potato zzso zzso A zzso mismatched zzso appears in the zzso folding of this gene and is maintained in the mature potato zzso zzso which argues in zzso of the hypothesis that the editing system of plant zzso can only perform C to U or occasionally U to C zzso
