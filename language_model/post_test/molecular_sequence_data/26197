The selective zzso of zzso by molecular oxygen has been studied in a batch reactor containing an zzso slurry of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso promotion of a commercial zzso catalyst resulted in zzso selectivity to sodium zzso up to zzso of zzso in the pH range zzso and at temperatures up to zzso zzso Performing the reaction under such conditions that the oxygen transfer to the liquid phase was zzso allowed the production of sodium zzso in high yields in approximately 1 zzso A maximum initial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found at a zzso zzso to zzso ratio of zzso Fifteen batches of zzso were oxidized with the same charge of catalyst without significant loss in initial activity or zzso Such other zzso as zzso zzso and zzso could be oxidized zzso with similar zzso
