zzso influenza viruses have become established and maintain long-term zzso in zzso The complete zzso of seven avian zzso influenza viruses were zzso These seven influenza virus zzso were obtained from live poultry markets in Shanghai, China, in 2002 and from 2006 to zzso zzso analysis revealed that all seven zzso had an zzso motif at the zzso site of zzso zzso indicating low zzso in zzso zzso analyses indicated that the seven avian zzso viruses belonged to the lineage represented by zzso zzso zzso a virus belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and that they are all quadruple zzso consisting of genes from different zzso The six internal genes of the zzso possessed zzso zzso indicating that they were zzso of zzso and zzso zzso All of the viruses had zzso (as well as zzso and zzso genes derived from the zzso zzso virus lineage but also had other genes of mixed avian virus origin, including genes similar to those of H5N1 viruses zzso The infected chickens showed no signs of zzso These results show the genetic and biological diversity of zzso viruses in Shanghai and support their potential role as pandemic influenza zzso
