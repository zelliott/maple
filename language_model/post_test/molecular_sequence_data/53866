A zzso clone for zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a mouse embryonic stem cell zzso zzso zzso It contains nine zzso spanning zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso All the zzso zzso sites are identical to that of the human zzso and human vitamin zzso zzso zzso A zzso signal zzso that differs from the consensus sequence at the second zzso was identified 16 zzso downstream of the 3' end of the previously reported mouse zzso This element is the only common natural zzso zzso The 3' end of the gene was determined using a zzso zzso Three zzso addition sites were observed 12, 15 and 22 bases from the zzso zzso Such distances are in agreement with what is required for maturation of zzso zzso This molecular cloning makes possible the generation of transgenic mice in order to further investigate the role and importance of the zzso zzso zzso
