zzso resistance protein 1 zzso is a human zzso cassette (ABC) zzso in the plasma zzso It zzso zzso resistance to tumor cells by actively zzso zzso zzso To examine the functional significance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso we determined the effect of zzso of the zzso acid sequence zzso which is zzso in zzso and zzso of human zzso 2 and 3, zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, and mouse zzso and zzso E and G in the zzso of human zzso were zzso to L and zzso respectively, and the zzso (including zzso and zzso (including zzso wild type or zzso halves of zzso were zzso in insect zzso The zzso of either zzso or zzso considerably decreased zzso zzso zzso into zzso of insect cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso analog of zzso zzso A zzso zzso was abolished by the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of zzso almost completely inhibited the labeling of zzso but not zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso of zzso abolished the labeling of both zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso of zzso almost completely inhibited zzso zzso with zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso signaling between zzso and zzso in zzso is vital for zzso zzso
