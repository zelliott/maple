zzso is a component of the zzso complex, which is involved in the zzso of the zzso precursor zzso The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism by which zzso zzso regulates zzso expression and the production of zzso In order to determine this, a hybrid gene harboring human zzso was constructed, and used in the zzso of zzso human zzso zzso This cell line was also zzso with a combination of human zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso Our results indicated that zzso human zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso activity and its zzso including zzso zzso and zzso thus production of zzso zzso zzso of human zzso with both zzso and zzso exerted no more profound effects on the induction of zzso proteins and its activity than did zzso with zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may facilitate assembly into the more active zzso complex, and may also induce an increase in activity, thus affecting zzso zzso
