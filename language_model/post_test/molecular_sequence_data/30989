The gene coding for rat group II zzso zzso was isolated from a rat zzso library by using the zzso for rat zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The rat group II zzso zzso gene spanned about zzso zzso pairs and consisted of five zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that a single copy of this gene exists in the rat zzso zzso A zzso sequence and two zzso binding zzso zzso were found upstream from the tentatively identified zzso initiation zzso
