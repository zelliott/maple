Analysis of aged and cataract zzso shows the presence of increased amounts of zzso fragments in the high molecular weight zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, the significance of zzso and interaction of low molecular weight zzso fragments in aging and cataract development is not clearly zzso In this study, 23 low molecular mass zzso peptides in the zzso zzso of young, aged, and aged cataract human zzso were identified by mass zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in aged and cataract lens but not young zzso and a third zzso zzso zzso present in all three lens groups were zzso to study the effects of interaction of these peptides with intact zzso zzso and zzso and alcohol zzso a protein used in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso peptides increased the scattering of light by zzso and zzso and alcohol zzso The ability of zzso zzso to function as molecular zzso was significantly reduced by interaction with zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso had no effect on zzso activity of zzso The zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso mass and partial zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso peptides abolished their ability to induce zzso zzso and light zzso Our study suggests that interaction of zzso peptides with intact zzso could be a key event in age-related protein zzso in lens and zzso
