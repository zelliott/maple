The zzso zzso sequences of the six most common European zzso species zzso have been obtained by direct zzso cycle sequencing and silver zzso zzso The sequence alignment and secondary structures of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso This gene proves to be a good marker for both specific determination and zzso zzso zzso The zzso importance is zzso considering the specific determination problems of individual snails and the present systematic chaos in zzso due to their pronounced zzso zzso which makes a zzso by traditional methods zzso The majority zzso of the total of 43 zzso positions appears to be confined to a small region included in zzso zzso of the variable region zzso enabling species group zzso zzso the first sequence is common to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the second sequence is unique to zzso zzso and zzso the third sequence is identical for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The other 26 zzso positions are dispersed over the entire zzso although four grouped zzso positions in zzso 6 of zzso are of interest in distinguishing zzso zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso trees obtained by comparison with four other zzso species (a zzso two zzso and a zzso zzso show the presence of four zzso zzso among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are worth mentioning from the zzso point of view, since the two zzso species of large medical and veterinary impact transmitted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to be linked to the first zzso
