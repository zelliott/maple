Parts of the zzso hybrid transcript supposed to be important for its transforming ability were zzso in a series of zzso blast crises, in order to evaluate the possible presence of zzso responsible for the disease transition from the chronic to the acute zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso as well as the zzso involvement was investigated by exploring their structure and expression in the same zzso We used traditional types of molecular analysis including Southern and Northern zzso together with methods that allow a rapid detection of point zzso and zzso such as zzso single strand zzso zzso and direct zzso The results obtained may be summarized as zzso no zzso were found in the parts of the zzso transcripts investigated in the present study zzso zzso and the region surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of the cases zzso These molecular defects are therefore responsible for the clinical progression of the zzso zzso only in a minority of zzso
