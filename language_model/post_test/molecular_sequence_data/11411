A zzso producing a zzso human zzso zzso zzso (named zzso has been derived from a fusion of mouse myeloma cells with human zzso zzso obtained from an zzso patient suffering from chronic idiopathic zzso The zzso was found to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To study the input of zzso zzso regions zzso into zzso zzso the zzso binding features of the zzso complete zzso zzso were compared with zzso a zzso zzso by hot zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments expressed in zzso zzso In detail, zzso were constructed zzso for zzso zzso and single chain zzso fragments containing the zzso and zzso genes connected by a zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso zzso equivalent and the zzso zzso zzso region, and zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso expressed in the zzso human fetal B cell zzso producing a zzso zzso zzso The expression zzso contained at the 3' end either a zzso motif allowing zzso on zzso or a zzso tag for specifically detecting the expression products by a zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso analyses of the expression products zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments were found in the bacterial zzso in extremely low amounts zzso zzso from 1 zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso fragments were obtained in suitable amounts from bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso fragments as well as the zzso obtained by zzso zzso reflected the zzso zzso binding features of the complete zzso zzso but did bind to the zzso with much lower zzso and zzso the zzso was found to be of critical importance for the zzso binding pattern of this particular zzso We discuss the expression of zzso zzso fragments in zzso coli as a suitable method in studying the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
