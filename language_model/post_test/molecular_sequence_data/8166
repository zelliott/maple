The zzso domain of zzso zzso from zzso coli contains four zzso segments in its native zzso two from each zzso We had previously used zzso analysis and zzso zzso between introduced zzso to obtain data relevant to the three-dimensional organization of this zzso In the current study we used zzso analysis to assess these data zzso for zzso along the sequences of the zzso The analyses provided a strong indication of zzso zzso in the first zzso segment and a substantial indication of that zzso for the second zzso On this basis, we considered both segments as idealized zzso and proceeded to model the zzso domain as a unit of four zzso For this zzso we calculated zzso zzso moments, parameters analogous to zzso zzso moments, as a quantitative way of condensing and utilizing a large body of zzso zzso zzso moments were used to define the relative separation and orientation of zzso pairs, thus creating a zzso derived model for the zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso zzso to provide a quantitative indication of zzso in data from analyses of zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso moments to position zzso pairs should be useful in modeling other zzso zzso
