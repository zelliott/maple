zzso species are zzso bacteria that are ubiquitous in the environment and display a range of virulent and zzso zzso This range is particularly evident in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where closely related strains cause anthrax, food-borne zzso and pneumonia, but can also be zzso Although much of this zzso range can be attributed to the presence or absence of a few key zzso factors, there are other zzso zzso that are zzso throughout the zzso zzso group, and we hypothesized that these genes may be regulated differently in zzso and zzso zzso 

Here we report zzso profiles of three closely related but zzso unique members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso an attenuated strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso strain zzso exponential growth in two distinct atmospheric zzso zzso zzso and ambient zzso We show that the zzso zzso strains undergo more distinctive zzso changes between the two zzso and that the expression of zzso zzso genes was increased exclusively in the zzso zzso We observed a core of zzso zzso genes that were zzso expressed in all three strains in both zzso Additionally, the expression profiles of putative zzso genes in zzso suggest that this strain, unlike zzso zzso may regulate gene expression with both zzso and zzso zzso regulators, each acting in a different zzso 

We have shown that zzso and even identical genes within the zzso of three closely related members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso group are in some instances regulated very differently, and that these differences can have important implications for zzso This study provides insights into the evolution of the zzso zzso group, and highlights the importance of looking beyond differences in gene content in comparative zzso zzso
