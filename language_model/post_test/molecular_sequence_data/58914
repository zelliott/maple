To investigate the origin and zzso of acquired zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso we studied 14 cases in which zzso virus zzso infection was not an zzso zzso By zzso 8 of the specimens were of the small zzso cell type and 6 consisted of the large diffuse cell zzso Southern analysis using a zzso probe was consistent with a zzso zzso tumor in 13 zzso To characterize the expressed zzso zzso we performed reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and direct sequencing of zzso zzso Eight cases expressed zzso and 1 case expressed zzso zzso genes were found in 5 cases, zzso genes in 3 cases, zzso genes in 2 cases, and a zzso gene in 1 zzso The zzso zzso to known zzso zzso genes ranged from zzso to zzso suggesting significant zzso diversification of expressed zzso zzso The large proportion of zzso zzso in this series zzso to the frequency of zzso B cells in the peripheral blood from healthy and zzso human zzso virus zzso individuals and contrasts with the zzso zzso deficit observed in late stages of zzso zzso Similar to the zzso heavy chain zzso the corresponding zzso light chain genes showed significant zzso from known zzso gene zzso The large proportion of zzso zzso as well as the high degree of zzso zzso from zzso suggest that these zzso zzso might arise from zzso expanded zzso clones before zzso Further support for this hypothesis is provided by sequential zzso sequence analysis in 1 patient with zzso zzso It was shown that 3 years before the diagnosis of zzso lymphoma, there existed several zzso clones in this patient's bone zzso One of these clones present in the bone zzso expressed the same rearranged zzso gene as the zzso zzso Taken together, the current findings from zzso gene analyses suggest that zzso of B cells in the early phase of zzso infection may be a zzso factor for subsequent zzso zzso
