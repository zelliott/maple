This report describes the development of a compact and zzso zzso chip device enabling the efficient zzso of zzso zzso to zzso mass zzso zzso zzso separation provides a convenient means of achieving rapid sample cleanup and resolution of zzso samples (typically zzso zzso prior to mass spectral zzso A low dead volume connection zzso the zzso of zzso devices to zzso was evaluated using two different zzso The first zzso used zzso zzso zzso directly coupled to the chip device via this low dead volume zzso thereby providing rapid separation of complex protein zzso The performance of this interface was compared with that of more traditional zzso using a sheath flow zzso arrangement where a zzso zzso of varying length enabled further zzso resolution of the zzso zzso The sensitivity and zzso characteristics of these zzso were investigated in both negative and positive zzso modes using standard zzso zzso The separation performance for synthetic peptides using a chip coated with zzso zzso ranged from 26,000 to zzso theoretical plates for a sheath flow zzso interface zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso injections of a dilution series of zzso standards provided detection limits of zzso zzso without the use of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of migration time ranged from zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso were observed on peak zzso The application of these devices for the analysis of protein zzso was further evaluated using zzso tandem mass zzso
