We used zzso repetitive DNA sequences in zzso in zzso zzso zzso to paint the rye zzso and to identify rye DNA in a wheat zzso A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso dispersed repetitive family zzso (named zzso was cloned and used as a FISH zzso zzso is dispersed over the seven rye zzso being absent from the zzso and zzso zzso A similar pattern of distribution was also observed on the rye B zzso but with weaker zzso The FISH zzso patterns using zzso as probe were comparable with those obtained with the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso There were, however, sharper signals and less background with zzso zzso was combined with the zzso sequences zzso and zzso to obtain a more complete zzso With these zzso the rye zzso were labeled with distinctive zzso thus, allowing the rye zzso zzso to be zzso It was also possible to distinguish rye zzso in zzso and alien rye zzso in zzso addition and zzso zzso The distribution of zzso was similar in cultivated rye and in the wild zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso can be used to detect zzso DNA zzso from wild species in a wheat zzso
