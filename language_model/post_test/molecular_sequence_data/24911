Two copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the type strain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and completely zzso The comparison of the determined sequences revealed considerable zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso and zzso The main differences were associated with zzso zzso located at the variable zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis that involved analogous genes from the zzso closest representatives of the zzso zzso showed that disregard of the zzso of the two gene copies zzso the position of the zzso studied in the zzso zzso
