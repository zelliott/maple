We performed benchmarks of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso experimenting with eight different models of structural evolution and two different programs for zzso zzso We evaluated our models using alignments of twelve zzso zzso We find that zzso prediction performance can vary greatly between different gene zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Our estimates for false positive rates are based on simulations which preserve local islands of zzso using these simulations, we predict a higher rate of false zzso than previous zzso zzso screens have zzso Using one of the tested prediction zzso we provide an updated set of zzso predictions for zzso zzso and compare them to zzso predictions and experimental zzso Many of our predictions show correlations with zzso zzso We found significant depletion of zzso predictions near the 3' end of coding regions and zzso depletion of predictions in the first zzso of zzso zzso Some of our predictions are zzso with larger putative zzso zzso for example, 17 of our predictions showing zzso to the zzso family zzso appear in a tandem array on the X zzso the zzso zzso spanned by the predicted tandem array is contained within a zzso zzso
