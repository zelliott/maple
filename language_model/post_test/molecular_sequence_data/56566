We have developed a method for processing and detecting zzso in clinical specimens using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso This zzso amplification of a segment of a zzso DNA gene results in a 310 zzso zzso The gene sequences used as zzso have been highly zzso throughout the zzso kingdom and positive zzso results have been obtained for all zzso and species of zzso tested zzso zzso zzso Neither human nor a variety of zzso bacteria zzso zzso 24) gave an amplified zzso This zzso method can detect as few as 15 cells of zzso zzso in clinical specimens following a simple processing zzso The sensitivity of the zzso for detecting other zzso remains to be zzso Analysis of the 310 zzso amplified product, following zzso with the restriction zzso zzso can be used to further characterize the identity of the fungus involved into the following five groups: zzso zzso species and closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinically related zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso the zzso zzso
