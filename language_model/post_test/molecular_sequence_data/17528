Growth factors and zzso zzso zzso induce various types of zzso zzso zzso most of which zzso zzso zzso To identify possible target genes for these early response gene products, we isolated complementary DNA clones of genes that were induced later by zzso A complementary DNA library was constructed using zzso from mouse zzso cells zzso treated with zzso for 4 zzso and the library was screened by differential zzso Five independent clones were zzso All of these genes were induced zzso 4 to 8 h after zzso zzso zzso showed that three of them zzso zzso and zzso were those of the zzso II zzso and one zzso was identical to the zzso zzso The other zzso had no significant zzso with known sequences and was considered to be a novel zzso The induction of zzso and zzso was decreased in the presence of zzso In mice, zzso zzso was detected in the lungs but not at appreciable levels in other zzso Open reading frame of zzso complementary DNA and its in zzso zzso product suggested that this gene encodes an Mr 26,000 zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso growth factor but not by zzso The zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso were significantly elevated in zzso zzso zzso
