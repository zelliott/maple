zzso zzso 2 zzso requires interaction with the neuroendocrine protein zzso for the production of an zzso zzso the mechanism for this effect is zzso zzso could act zzso to generate an zzso form of zzso during zzso or block spontaneous generation of zzso zzso We here demonstrate that addition of zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells expressing zzso prevented the unfolding and zzso of zzso zzso forms in a zzso manner, as assessed by zzso zzso activity zzso zzso experiments, and zzso density zzso zzso zzso was also found to exist in part as zzso zzso that were reduced in the presence of zzso zzso zzso addition did not result in the acquisition of zzso competence unless added before or very rapidly after zzso zzso indicating that an zzso structure cannot be maintained in the absence of zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that addition of zzso zzso zzso three different zzso species from a zzso zzso two zzso zzso species, the intact zzso and a zzso with a partially zzso zzso and an inactive zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso possesses zzso activity that blocks partially unfolded zzso forms from losing zzso competence and then zzso The loss of the zzso competent zzso appears to represent the earliest indicator of zzso unfolding and is followed on a slower time scale by the appearance of zzso Because zzso expression is not confined to areas expressing zzso zzso may represent a general zzso and zzso zzso zzso
