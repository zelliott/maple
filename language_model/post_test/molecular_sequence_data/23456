The architecture of higher plants is established through the activity of lateral zzso groups of stem cells formed during zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso generate branches and zzso structures, which define the overall form of a plant, and are largely responsible for the evolution of different plant zzso Here, we report the isolation of the barren zzso zzso which encodes a zzso basic zzso protein required for the initiation of all aerial lateral zzso in zzso barren zzso represents one of the earliest genes involved in the patterning of zzso zzso and, together with the zzso zzso zzso it regulates zzso lateral zzso zzso The architecture of zzso has been a major target of selection for early zzso and modern farmers, because it influences zzso breeding strategies and zzso By sampling zzso diversity in the barren zzso region, we show that two zzso entered the zzso gene pool from its wild zzso zzso and that only one was incorporated throughout modern zzso suggesting that barren zzso was selected for zzso zzso
