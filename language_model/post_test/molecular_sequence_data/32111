The zzso element zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso contains four zzso zzso and promotes the degradation of specific zzso that zzso proteins with functions in cellular proliferation and inflammatory zzso The fourth zzso domain zzso is essential for zzso recognition and zzso but requires the third zzso domain zzso for its zzso We show that zzso and zzso behave as independent binding zzso and can interact with different regions of the zzso zzso targets of zzso This provides zzso with the structural flexibility needed to recognize a set of different targets in the context of their zzso structural zzso Surprisingly, we find that zzso binds to its target zzso with lower affinity than zzso and that zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation activities are closely associated with a zzso structural element of zzso
