Complex human diseases can show significant zzso between patients with the same zzso zzso An zzso detection strategy was developed to identify zzso at the level of gene zzso that are of potential biological and zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso software package zzso zzso detection zzso that enables identification and zzso of gross abnormalities in gene expression zzso in individuals, using whole zzso zzso zzso Mean and standard zzso of expression in a healthy control cohort is used to detect both over and zzso zzso in individual test zzso We compared the potential of zzso to detect zzso genes in gene expression zzso with a previously described statistical method, gene tissue index zzso using a simulated expression zzso and a publicly available zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results support zzso as a novel approach to identify zzso genes of potential zzso relevance in complex human zzso The zzso is implemented using R packages and zzso
