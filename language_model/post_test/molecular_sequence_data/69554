Growth zzso signals govern the expression of three zzso zzso which, in turn, function as regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso to control cell cycle transitions during the late zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which zzso as zzso precursors in zzso 3 zzso express zzso zzso and D3 (but not zzso in complexes with zzso and zzso When transferred to zzso zzso factor zzso zzso cells stop dividing and terminally differentiate to mature zzso zzso D and zzso expression ceased as cells underwent growth arrest in zzso but zzso levels were zzso zzso cells engineered to zzso express zzso zzso exhibited contracted zzso intervals with a zzso lengthening of S phase but remained zzso dependent for cell zzso those zzso zzso zzso and D3 (but not zzso were unable to differentiate and died in zzso zzso zzso zzso which cannot efficiently bind to, or functionally interact with, the zzso protein zzso or its relatives zzso did not block zzso zzso the introduction of a zzso inactive zzso zzso into cells zzso zzso zzso restored their zzso zzso The persistence of zzso and its zzso to functionally interact with zzso zzso and D3 rather than D1 might explain the specificity of the differentiation zzso
