It has been suggested that genes involved in the zzso biology of insect disease zzso are potential targets for future alternative methods of zzso Little is known about the molecular biology of reproduction in zzso sand flies and there is no information available concerning genes that are expressed in male zzso zzso of zzso zzso the main zzso of American visceral zzso and a species zzso 

We generated zzso high quality zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso male zzso zzso that were grouped in zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso and 255 zzso zzso analysis revealed that only 57% of these sequences share similarity with a zzso zzso female zzso zzso Although no more than zzso of the zzso sequences showed similarity to protein sequences deposited in databases, more than half of them presented the zzso hits with zzso zzso Gene zzso analysis identified zzso of genes involved in biological processes such as protein zzso and DNA zzso which are probably associated with zzso A number of zzso sequences were also identified as putative male zzso zzso proteins zzso also known as male accessory zzso protein genes zzso 

The zzso analysis of zzso zzso male zzso zzso is one step further in the study of the molecular basis of the zzso biology of this important species zzso It has allowed the identification of genes potentially involved in zzso as well as putative zzso zzso which have been studied in many insect species because of their effects on female zzso behavior and physiology and their potential role in sexual selection and zzso These data open a number of new avenues for further research in the molecular and evolutionary zzso biology of sand zzso
