Complete sequences of zzso and zzso genes of the giant liver fluke zzso magna are zzso In particular, small zzso zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso gene zzso as well as zzso c zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso I zzso of the zzso DNA zzso were zzso The zzso and ITS sequences were compared with previously published sequences of the liver fluke zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic differences were determined that allow molecular differentiation of zzso magna and zzso zzso using either the zzso method or zzso amplification of zzso DNA zzso Additionally, zzso sequence zzso of the complete zzso and zzso zzso genes in geographically distinct zzso magna populations was zzso Based on the sequence zzso short zzso 500 zzso variable regions suitable for broader zzso studies of giant liver fluke were zzso
