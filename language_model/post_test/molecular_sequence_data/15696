The zzso zzso zzso shock protein zzso zzso zzso is known to bind both zzso and zzso zzso comprises three repeats of a zzso repeat zzso domain, each consisting of three zzso zzso The first and last zzso zzso are followed by a domain containing several zzso zzso repeats called the zzso zzso These analyses suggest that the hop genes result from successive zzso events of an ancestral zzso zzso From a zzso cluster analysis of zzso zzso protein sequences derived from gene families, we can zzso that shifts in the open reading frames are at the origin of the present zzso Moreover, these shifts can be related to the presence or absence of biological zzso We propose to extend the family of zzso zzso into the kingdom of bacteria, as several structurally related genes have been identified by zzso cluster zzso We also provide evidence of common structural characteristics between hop and hip zzso suggesting a shared precursor of ancestral zzso zzso
