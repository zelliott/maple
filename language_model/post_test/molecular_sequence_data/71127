The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso like other bacterial zzso zzso of four zzso it binds to 19 zzso boxes in the complex zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein differs from others in that it contains an additional stretch of 120 predominantly zzso zzso acids within domain zzso zzso between the zzso protein and the two zzso boxes derived from the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso gene were zzso in zzso using three independent zzso zzso experiments, zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso The zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso protein binds to both zzso zzso Thus, as in zzso coli and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene may be zzso zzso analysis showed that the affinity of the zzso protein for a DNA zzso containing both zzso boxes from the zzso promoter region zzso zzso zzso zzso is 10 times higher than its affinity for the single zzso zzso box zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso suggests the presence of at least two classes of complex containing different numbers of bound zzso zzso The above data reveal that the zzso protein binds to the two zzso boxes in a cooperative zzso To deduce structural features of the zzso domain II of zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso sequences of three zzso species were zzso However, according to the secondary structure zzso zzso domain II does not contain any common relevant secondary structural zzso It can be assumed that domain II of zzso protein can play a role as a flexible protein zzso between the zzso domain I and the highly zzso zzso part of zzso protein containing zzso domain III and zzso domain zzso
