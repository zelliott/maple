We examined the signaling function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells, where zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso of zzso activated G alpha i zzso zzso alpha zzso In cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso promoted by zzso toxin or zzso This effect of zzso was not observed in zzso cells or in cells zzso with zzso lacking zzso Thus, zzso through its zzso domain, mediates the zzso action of zzso in living zzso We also found that zzso truncated with zzso 28 zzso after zzso caused G beta zzso response of zzso in response to zzso by zzso zzso zzso with the G alpha zzso response of zzso by intact zzso suggests that the zzso zzso region zzso G beta zzso This study not only provides further evidence that zzso has zzso signaling function to interact with zzso G proteins with distinct roles by different zzso zzso it also suggests that zzso can separate and zzso the G alpha and G beta gamma signals following zzso zzso
