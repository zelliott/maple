In order to determine whether translation initiation events play a selective role in regulating the expression of zzso complexes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have undertaken an initial study to investigate the potential role of translation initiation factor zzso which also behaves as a zzso regulatory factor in some zzso Following the isolation and zzso of a zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso we used zzso zzso to clone and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso The zzso zzso encodes a protein exhibiting zzso identity zzso zzso with the zzso coli zzso zzso protein and, in common with all other zzso genes identified to date, zzso possesses a rare initiation zzso zzso Furthermore, in common with zzso zzso was shown here to perform a zzso function towards zzso start zzso confirming its role and function as an zzso in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso resistance cassette into the zzso end of zzso resulted in a viable zzso which exhibits growth rates similar to wild type but which possesses reduced zzso and zzso complexes in zzso zzso It is shown here that the zzso is still able to produce a zzso protein but that it possesses reduced zzso zzso This may account for the viable nature of the zzso strain, and may indicate that the effect of the zzso on photosynthesis can be more severe than shown in the present zzso The mechanisms by which zzso may exert its selective regulatory effect on photosynthesis expression are zzso
