The zzso zzso protein zzso folds and unfolds extremely zzso To understand the molecular basis for the slow zzso we have studied the folding and unfolding of zzso zzso and a series of zzso core zzso 

zzso of the zzso core creates stable, zzso and zzso proteins with dramatically increased rates of both folding and zzso The increases in rates are dependent upon the number and position of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso 

zzso folds by a rapid collision of zzso to form a zzso intermediate with substantial zzso content, followed by a slow zzso to the final native zzso zzso unfolding is a single extremely slow kinetic zzso The slow steps of both folding and unfolding are dramatically increased by zzso core zzso suggesting that their main effect is to substantially decrease the energy of the transition zzso
