The molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane zzso during zzso zzso zzso are not yet zzso zzso fusion protein zzso soluble zzso attachment proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso are elements of a zzso molecular machinery for membrane zzso that have been detected in zzso We examined whether zzso an zzso that has been shown to play a critical role in membrane zzso in many cell types, is necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso that mimic zzso sequence motifs inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso human zzso This zzso effect was zzso because neither zzso zzso peptides nor peptides containing similar zzso acids in a scrambled sequence inhibited zzso zzso The peptides that inhibited zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the human zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso It was also found that zzso zzso which inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso by zzso zzso was abolished by the addition of zzso zzso These data provide the first functional evidence that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso
