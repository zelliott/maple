We determined the zzso sequence and analyzed the zzso structure of a novel human gene designated zzso which shows significant similarity to the zzso domain of zzso proteins in the human lung tumor cell line zzso The zzso zzso sequence is divided into an incomplete zzso zzso zzso region, a zzso open reading frame which codes for zzso zzso acids and a zzso 3' zzso zzso The first zzso of the deduced zzso zzso acids resemble the zzso regions of zzso proteins from different zzso Furthermore, single zzso acid and short zzso acid stretches, which are thought to be essential for the zzso mechanism and zzso activity in zzso zzso are zzso in this zzso zzso The zzso 70 zzso acids exhibit no significant similarity to zzso nor to any other known protein zzso The zzso gene contains at least five zzso which differ significantly from zzso genes with regard to their size and location within the coding zzso The total size of this gene is more than 15 zzso zzso chain reaction zzso experiments showed that this gene is expressed in different human cell lines and zzso and it also seems to be highly zzso between human and zzso
