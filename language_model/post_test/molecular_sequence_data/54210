White spot syndrome virus zzso is the zzso agent of white spot syndrome, one of the most devastating diseases in shrimp zzso The zzso of zzso includes a gene that encodes a putative family B DNA zzso zzso which is zzso identical in zzso acid sequence to the zzso virus 1 DNA zzso The aim of this work was to demonstrate the activity of the zzso zzso protein as a DNA zzso and hence a putative zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in zzso The zzso protein showed zzso activity but with very low level of zzso zzso modeling of the zzso protein core zzso in zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence alignments of zzso indicate the presence of a putative zzso box, suggesting that the zzso putative DNA zzso may use a host zzso factor for optimal zzso We zzso that zzso zzso encodes a bona fide DNA zzso that requires accessory proteins for activity and maybe target for drugs or compounds that inhibit viral DNA zzso
