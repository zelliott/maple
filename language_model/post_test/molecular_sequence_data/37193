zzso carriers zzso are essential to the cell as they exchange zzso produced in zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso 2 of zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to probe the accessibility of the zzso zzso 1 and 3 depending on the environment of the zzso In zzso zzso zzso was not zzso whereas in zzso the zzso bound to the carrier, suggesting that the zzso are hidden in the native zzso Exposure of the zzso by zzso was reversed by zzso of the carrier in zzso or by exchanging with zzso having a zzso or a zzso head zzso zzso zzso zzso on peptides representing the zzso regions of all three zzso zzso showed that only zzso zzso induced a structural zzso Since in addition zzso was found to be tightly associated with the zzso carrier, the zzso loop regions are likely to be associated to the membrane by zzso
