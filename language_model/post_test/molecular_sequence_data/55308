We investigated the zzso history of zzso zzso one of the most widespread temperate tree species in East Asia, using a combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic differentiation at nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso samples zzso at five zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso samples zzso for zzso zzso at three zzso was zzso A major zzso break in Central China corresponded with those of other temperate species and the spatial zzso of the two temperate forest zzso of East Asia, consistent with the forests having been isolated within both East and West China for multiple zzso zzso Evidence for multiple glacial zzso was found in most of its current range in China, South Japan and the southernmost part of the Korean zzso In contrast, lineage zzso and absence of private zzso and zzso in zzso and the northern Korean Peninsula support a zzso origin of northernmost zzso Although zzso zzso predicted suitable climate across a zzso extending from South Japan to East China during the Last zzso zzso the genetic differentiation of regional populations indicated a limited role of the exposed sea floor as a zzso corridor at that zzso Overall, this study provides evidence that differential impacts of zzso climate zzso associated with landscape zzso have shaped the genetic structure of a wide-ranging temperate tree in East zzso
