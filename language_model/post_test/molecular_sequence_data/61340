The finding of outer membrane protein I zzso of zzso zzso in zzso used by patients with zzso zzso failure led us to study the possible role of zzso as zzso zzso However, there are few reports on the biological activity of zzso because it is difficult to obtain highly zzso zzso In this study, we attempt to establish a procedure for the efficient zzso of zzso which does not include zzso from the bacterial culture zzso not zzso to demonstrate that zzso is a potent zzso zzso From bacterial culture broth (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso which was confirmed previously by the sequence coding, was separated by zzso zzso liquid zzso and disk zzso Mouse bone zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso of the culture were analyzed by several zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumor necrosis factor alpha production zzso by zzso zzso was confirmed and zzso within 24 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor were also induced by zzso despite the absence of zzso We conclude that zzso has the potential to induce tumor necrosis factor alpha production in mouse bone zzso cells and that tumor necrosis factor alpha contributes to the induction of inflammatory zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor, while zzso has little effect on these zzso These results suggest the presence of a zzso of inflammatory signal zzso triggered by zzso In addition, zzso is possibly one of the harmful zzso pollutants in zzso patients besides the well-known zzso
