The protein fraction of the German zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso separation of proteins present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso at approximately 63 zzso zzso first appeared in zzso zzso zzso at 2 days zzso zzso and the amount of protein observed increased through day zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso chain reaction and contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso a predicted protein of zzso zzso zzso In a Northern zzso experiment using total zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso probe zzso to an zzso approximately 2000 zzso and confirmed the zzso zzso zzso size obtained by zzso zzso Using the zzso sequence similarity search zzso the top match to the zzso zzso was found to be an zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso deduced protein sequence with zzso from fruit fly, zzso zzso honey zzso zzso zzso zzso and yellow zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso throughout the zzso and sequence identities ranging from zzso to zzso Using a zzso zzso degradation of starch by native zzso was demonstrated in zzso and we propose that zzso may be involved in processing zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
