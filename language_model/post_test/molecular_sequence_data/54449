Recent reports have better zzso the components of the zzso zzso Complex 2 zzso and its functional role in embryonic stem cells zzso and their differentiated zzso The depletion of a newly described zzso zzso associated zzso zzso leads to an increase in zzso zzso and a delay in zzso a zzso similar to zzso of the core zzso zzso zzso and cell biology data suggest that zzso is important in cell fate decisions and may play a role in recruitment of zzso to target genes and zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso in zzso leads to a decrease in zzso at the zzso promoter regions of zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase in gene zzso These proteins subsequently activate expression of zzso zzso and zzso through a zzso gene regulatory circuit, altering the core zzso network and driving cell fate decisions towards zzso We propose a model zzso zzso of the zzso state of zzso zzso and zzso results in the enforced expression of the zzso network, preventing zzso
