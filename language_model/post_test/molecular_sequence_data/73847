zzso recognize zzso by forming specific zzso interactions that often involve zzso exposed zzso Changes in the zzso properties of these zzso upon binding can affect the zzso zzso of the system and thus are related to the zzso of zzso The role that dynamics plays in zzso recognition can be investigated by comparing the zzso properties of a free and zzso zzso zzso relaxation studies are well suited for examining changes in zzso especially for motions on a zzso to zzso time zzso Recently, we determined the solution structure of the zzso binding zzso domain of the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso derived from the zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso The zzso binds tightly to the protein in a surface exposed pocket, resulting in the partial burial of many protein zzso Using zzso relaxation studies, the dynamics of the backbone zzso of zzso zzso domain were studied in both the free protein and the protein when zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The backbone zzso of many zzso that make important contacts to the zzso are zzso restricted in the free and zzso zzso Additional zzso become zzso restricted only after zzso zzso including several zzso that do not make any direct contacts with the zzso These observed changes in the dynamics are compared to structural features of the zzso
