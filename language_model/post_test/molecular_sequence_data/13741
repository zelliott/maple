The zzso gene encodes a protein that is involved in DNA mismatch repair and is zzso in a subset of patients with zzso zzso colon cancer zzso The previously published zzso zzso sequence lacks an upstream zzso stop zzso preceding the zzso initiating zzso To evaluate the zzso zzso of the zzso coding region further, we isolated additional zzso zzso zzso products, and the corresponding zzso zzso segment of the zzso zzso The zzso gene transcripts were found to have zzso but zzso zzso zzso one of which contained an zzso termination zzso preceding the initiating zzso In addition, a novel gene zzso a zzso zzso was found to initiate zzso within zzso from the opposite zzso
