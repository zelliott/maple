Comparative kinetic and structural analyses of a variety of zzso have revealed both common and divergent elements of zzso zzso Although the parameters for zzso incorporation by the zzso zzso Family B zzso DNA zzso are similar to those previously derived for Family A and B DNA zzso parameters for analog incorporation reveal alternative strategies for discrimination by this zzso Discrimination against zzso was characterized by a decrease in the affinity of zzso binding and a lower rate of zzso transfer, whereas discrimination against zzso was almost exclusively due to a slower rate of zzso bond zzso Unlike Family A DNA zzso incorporation of zzso zzso (where X is zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso DNA zzso was enhanced over zzso via a zzso increase in zzso transfer zzso Furthermore, a zzso with increased propensity for zzso analog incorporation zzso DNA zzso had zzso zzso incorporation while displaying enhanced zzso analog binding affinity and rates of zzso zzso Based on kinetic data and available structural information from other DNA zzso we propose active site models for zzso zzso and zzso selection by zzso zzso DNA zzso to zzso structural and functional differences between zzso
