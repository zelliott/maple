Cell zzso zzso during zzso zzso is established by zzso zzso is an zzso that binds and zzso regulates zzso as well as a zzso zzso that zzso and zzso the zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso bound to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso form has been determined at zzso A zzso zzso adopts the zzso zzso fold of zzso and zzso zzso A domain of zzso contacts both zzso zzso while zzso of the zzso factor is zzso The interaction zzso an zzso zzso binding surface of zzso explaining the zzso zzso zzso The structure also explains the specificity of zzso for its target zzso factors and, in combination with genetic and zzso data, provides insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
