A zzso zzso with a 4 zzso insert at the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso P gene of zzso coli zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso 104, zzso was zzso into zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso coli zzso harboring zzso with a zzso zzso zzso showed more than zzso higher zzso activity than that of the host, after zzso at 37 degrees C for 40 h in zzso containing zzso When the gene DNA was inserted zzso in zzso the zzso productivity decreased zzso The whole zzso sequence of the inserted zzso of zzso zzso was clarified by the zzso zzso zzso Within this zzso the mature zzso zzso sequence was found to start just after an zzso zzso as judged by comparison with zzso protein zzso Eleven bases upstream from the proposed initiation zzso was an zzso sequence which seemed to be a zzso binding zzso Thirty-four bases upstream from the proposed start zzso was the zzso sequence zzso the so-called zzso region or zzso zzso Further, the zzso sequence zzso around 77 bases upstream from the start zzso was deduced to be a putative zzso region consensus zzso The zzso repeat at zzso was tentatively assumed to be a zzso The molecular weight of the zzso was estimated to be zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso gram atom of zinc per zzso The zzso activity was inhibited by zzso and activated zzso by zzso
