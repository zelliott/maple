zzso is essential for zzso replication in T cells and zzso zzso recruits a host zzso zzso complex to promote zzso degradation of the zzso restriction factors by zzso The cellular zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso function by stabilizing the zzso protein and promoting recruitment of a cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is a promising therapeutic target, but little is known about the zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso are crucial for zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso impaired binding to zzso degradation of zzso and virus zzso in the presence of zzso in zzso zzso In spreading infection, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso comparably to zzso virus in zzso zzso cells, but not in multiple zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso These results support a model in which zzso zzso zzso zzso may participate in binding zzso
