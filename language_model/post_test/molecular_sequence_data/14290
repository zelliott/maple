zzso A zzso and its zzso zzso zzso activity play an essential role in zzso C virus zzso zzso and mounting evidence indicates that zzso protein zzso zzso is the major target of zzso However, neither a consensus zzso motif nor specific zzso zzso that regulate zzso dependence and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso have been defined to zzso We systematically characterized all zzso zzso in zzso domain II, zzso sequence II zzso and domain III with both zzso binding and functional replication zzso A tandem zzso site spanning domain II and zzso was zzso The first site contains a consensus sequence motif of zzso (where zzso is a zzso zzso that is highly zzso in the majority of the zzso of zzso (six of zzso the remaining zzso has zzso The second tandem site contains a similar zzso and the zzso sequence is again zzso in six of the seven zzso zzso with the similarity of their zzso peptides representing the two binding motifs zzso for zzso binding in a zzso zzso and induced similar chemical shifts when bound to the active site of zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso of Japanese zzso zzso 1 zzso contained in these zzso as well as a zzso zzso in the zzso region, were required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, these data provide a high-resolution mapping of zzso zzso important for zzso binding and identify critical zzso acids modulating zzso zzso to the clinical zzso zzso
