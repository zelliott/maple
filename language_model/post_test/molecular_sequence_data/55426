To investigate bacterial communities between zzso and zzso zzso of the wild medicinal plant zzso zzso of zzso China, small zzso zzso zzso zzso from soil zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction using zzso specific to the domain bacteria and zzso by cloning and zzso The relative proportion of bacterial communities in zzso zzso was similar to zzso zzso in five zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso But there were differences in five other zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Over zzso % of the zzso clones were found to be unique to zzso and zzso soils, while zzso % were shared by both of zzso Our results indicate that there are differences in the composition and proportion of bacterial communities between zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the unique bacterial clones between zzso and zzso zzso of the wild medicinal plant zzso zzso have obvious zzso
