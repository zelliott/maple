zzso are soluble zzso proteins related to the zzso B2 zzso Since these proteins and their zzso zzso (the zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso bind zzso zzso may zzso their biological actions in a similar fashion as described for several other zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso encompassing the zzso cluster of basic zzso acids of zzso zzso adopts an zzso zzso in zzso zzso according to circular zzso experiments and zzso binds zzso to zzso with high affinity under zzso zzso conditions zzso zzso 15 zzso for the binding to immobilized zzso according to surface zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso in solution as determined with zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the cluster of basic zzso acids at the zzso of zzso forms an zzso structural element which can contribute to the zzso activity of this zzso guidance zzso
