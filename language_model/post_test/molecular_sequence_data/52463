To evaluate whether the expression of zzso zzso zzso V beta families in eight cases of zzso zzso zzso took place in a preferential manner, we analyzed four cases of zzso zzso zzso the most common form of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and four cases of primary zzso zzso zzso The usage of V beta families in zzso populations was investigated on zzso that was transcribed to zzso using a C beta primer and reverse zzso zzso the specific usage of the families was analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso using combinations of the selected C zzso primer and one of the zzso V beta zzso zzso blood zzso from four healthy volunteers and 1 zzso zzso zzso served as a control and expressed all 20 V beta families tested zzso In zzso lines, with restricted V beta zzso and in three patients with advanced zzso only one or two V beta families were expressed at the zzso zzso In an early zzso zzso this zzso expression was zzso several V beta families were expressed with a weak zzso This may indicate either a zzso origin of zzso or that too few zzso zzso cells were present in the tissue zzso In the four zzso zzso zzso only one family could be clearly zzso whereas some of the other V beta families showed only a weak zzso These latter families represent the zzso zzso component in the zzso zzso zzso Both in zzso zzso NHL and in zzso there was no preferential expression of a particular V beta zzso There was a good correlation between zzso data and the expression of V zzso protein products observed by zzso on tissue sections of the zzso zzso All zzso lines, three cases of zzso and three cases of zzso zzso NHL showed a zzso of the zzso beta chain on DNA zzso
