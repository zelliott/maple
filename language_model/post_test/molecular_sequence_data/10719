zzso zzso a zzso insulin zzso is identical to human insulin except for the zzso of zzso and zzso at positions 28 and 29 in the zzso of the B zzso The zzso reduced capacity for zzso in solution translates into more rapid zzso of insulin zzso than human regular insulin from subcutaneous zzso zzso insulin zzso are higher and are reached earlier with insulin zzso than with human regular insulin, and insulin zzso return to baseline values more quickly with insulin zzso consequently, insulin zzso has a more rapid onset and a shorter duration of zzso zzso These pharmacological properties provided the rationale for comparative clinical trials of subcutaneous insulin zzso zzso within 15 minutes before meals, preferably immediately before zzso and subcutaneous human regular insulin zzso 20 to 45 minutes before zzso in patients with type 1 diabetes zzso diabetes zzso or type 2 diabetes zzso diabetes zzso requiring zzso insulin therapy plus zzso insulin zzso Available clinical trials are well designed and results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso blood zzso levels with insulin zzso are similar to or lower than those with human regular zzso zzso and zzso zzso excursions are similar to or less pronounced than those with human regular zzso zzso zzso A values were generally similar with both zzso Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was associated with greater improvements in zzso blood zzso levels and zzso zzso A1 values with insulin zzso than with human regular zzso zzso data are zzso The zzso of zzso with insulin zzso was similar to or lower than that with human regular zzso In particular insulin zzso appears to be associated with a lower zzso of zzso and severe zzso zzso Evidence also suggests that patients perceive their quality of life to be improved with insulin zzso compared with human regular insulin, and that satisfaction with treatment is greater with the insulin zzso Thus, in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes requiring zzso insulin therapy, insulin zzso appears to provide greater zzso zzso control than human regular insulin without increasing the risk of zzso Furthermore, the reduced zzso zzso with this agent offers greater convenience for the patient than regular human zzso If longer term clinical experience supports these promising results it is likely that insulin zzso will offer important advantages over human regular zzso
