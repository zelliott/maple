zzso T cell clones derived from zzso mice infected with zzso zzso influenza virus, were shown to recognize zzso zzso sequences within the zzso zzso of the viral zzso zzso using synthetic zzso Three zzso T cell sequences were identified within zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two recognition sites presented in the context of the zzso zzso were mapped to zzso sequences zzso and zzso T cell clones specific for these regions of zzso demonstrated varying abilities to differentiate between natural zzso viruses that had accumulated zzso within their zzso molecules as a result of zzso zzso zzso that recognized sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed to discriminate between natural zzso and focused on zzso sequences within these zzso A majority of T cell clones were sensitive to zzso acid zzso that have featured in zzso drift occurring within three major zzso sites of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso 78 zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso viruses correlated with a zzso reduction in the zzso response for T cell clones specific for sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a clone that recognized zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso virus zzso implicating zzso acids at zzso position zzso and/or zzso within this sequence as crucial for zzso Our data, together with the previous finding that sequence zzso zzso is also a major zzso T cell recognition site, demonstrate a level of diversity in the T cell recognition of influenza zzso within a single mouse zzso zzso zzso and imply that the T cell repertoire diversity against foreign zzso may be greater than previously zzso Furthermore, the frequency at which zzso T cells have been identified that focus on zzso acids within the zzso zzso of zzso also featuring in zzso zzso suggests that a failure of zzso class zzso T cells to recognize specific zzso within zzso zzso molecules may contribute significantly to the capacity of zzso influenza viruses to evade immune zzso
