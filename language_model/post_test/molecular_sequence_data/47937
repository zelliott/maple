zzso zzso zzso was discovered because of its strong zzso in zzso during the acute phase of zzso We report here structural and functional data on the mouse zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso is 80 zzso acids long and shows zzso and zzso identity with its rat and human counterparts zzso The zzso gene is organized into three zzso interrupted by two zzso zzso regions involved in the regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso with progressive deletions of the zzso zzso region of the mouse zzso gene revealed four zzso elements located from zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso One positive element was identified between zzso zzso and zzso We identified a zzso binding protein zzso zzso element at position zzso zzso zzso of this consensus site decreased promoter activity to zzso of that of the zzso An zzso zzso zzso using an zzso probe corresponding to the zzso consensus and nuclear extracts of zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso expression zzso generated specific zzso complexes that were zzso with specific zzso against zzso and zzso zzso with zzso or zzso expression zzso and the zzso construct increased the reporter gene activity in a zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso or zzso still increased the promoter activity of both zzso (which contains the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso construct (which does not contain the zzso zzso zzso these results show that zzso and zzso zzso factors can promote zzso of the mouse zzso gene zzso by direct binding to the zzso consensus site, and zzso by enhancing the activity of other zzso factors interacting with the zzso zzso
