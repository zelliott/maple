The zzso zzso is one of the three zzso zzso that provide the bulk of the structural lipids in zzso zzso of seed zzso Unlike the zzso zzso is zzso at zzso pH because of its zzso zzso head zzso The zzso of this zzso proceeds in two steps: first, the assembly of zzso from zzso and zzso and second, the transfer of the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso The first reaction is zzso by the zzso protein in zzso Here we describe the identification of the zzso gene of zzso We propose that this gene encodes the zzso catalyzing the second step of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso plant zzso zzso in this zzso zzso of a transfer DNA into this gene in zzso led to complete lack of zzso in the respective zzso zzso This zzso showed reduced growth under zzso growth zzso The results support the hypothesis that zzso can function as a substitute of zzso zzso under zzso growth zzso Along with zzso zzso contributes to maintaining a zzso charged zzso zzso which presumably is required for proper function of zzso zzso
