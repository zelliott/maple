An zzso zzso zzso designated zzso has been isolated in order to understand molecular mechanisms involved in zzso Both zzso and zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso production by zzso in zzso slice zzso On Western blots of zzso zzso the zzso recognized zzso and zzso zzso The present study involves the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso The zzso proteins of 140 and 120 zzso were zzso from the adult rat zzso nerve and zzso acid sequencing of these proteins revealed significant zzso to alpha I and alpha II chains of collagen type zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis using pure zzso collagen I zzso and zzso D suggest that the zzso isolated from zzso nerve is zzso However, zzso studies using the zzso zzso collagen I zzso zzso D and Northern zzso analysis using a collagen probe do not fully support the view that the zzso zzso in the zzso is also a zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved in zzso zzso
