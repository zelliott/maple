The zzso zzso of zzso is translated into a large zzso that is zzso into a number of zzso The structural proteins are N terminal in this zzso and include three zzso called zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of the order in which they appear in the zzso Using zzso experiments, we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso is formed that is processed into zzso zzso and zzso in an ordered zzso zzso is initiated by a nascent zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso followed by zzso at the C zzso of zzso zzso is then rapidly zzso to form zzso and zzso After zzso is released from the zzso zzso is processed into zzso and zzso To identify the sites of zzso the N zzso of the zzso of the zzso classical zzso fever virus (formerly termed hog zzso zzso were zzso after expression in the zzso virus zzso The N zzso are zzso for zzso zzso zzso for E1 zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The sequences around the zzso sites zzso and zzso conform to the rules known for cellular signal zzso as does the sequence at the presumed C zzso of zzso The sequence upstream of the zzso zzso site also shows sequence characteristics of zzso processing sites but lacks the typical zzso signal zzso this zzso site has characteristics in common with a site in zzso that is also zzso in a delayed zzso The absence of any zzso region results in the shedding of zzso by infected cells, and zzso can be detected in the zzso zzso zzso of the sequences around the zzso sites of zzso suggests a general processing scheme for the structural zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso structural zzso suggests analogies between zzso and zzso
