The effects of a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso were assessed on the proliferation rate of human zzso smooth muscle cells zzso Compared to a control zzso the zzso zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso in a zzso manner without a major zzso zzso zzso of zzso from media zzso was significantly inhibited as zzso zzso of zzso expression by serum stimulation of cells was blunted by the zzso zzso as shown by zzso These results demonstrate that zzso expression is an essential factor for proliferation of zzso after growth zzso and they show the potential of zzso technology for modulating gene expression of zzso in zzso
