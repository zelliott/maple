zzso induction of zzso zzso triggers a cascade of events that initiate differentiation into zzso zzso proteins beta and delta zzso are expressed early in the differentiation program, but are not immediately zzso After a long lag, zzso become competent to bind to the zzso regulatory element in the zzso gene promoter, zzso being a zzso zzso of numerous zzso zzso As zzso acquire binding activity, they become localized to zzso as zzso zzso enter S phase at the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso occurs through zzso zzso sites in zzso satellite zzso zzso which is zzso becomes zzso much later in the differentiation program as zzso zzso expansion zzso and the cells become terminally zzso
