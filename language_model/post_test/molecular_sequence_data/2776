Our previous studies suggested that a zzso zzso zzso blank zzso zzso is either a zzso zzso zzso or a novel zzso zzso To examine these possibilities, the zzso and zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso cell lines zzso were zzso zzso and transferred into zzso zzso -C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected on the cell surface of zzso zzso by flow zzso with the zzso I zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso with currently available zzso specific zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene indicated that the zzso zzso is zzso because it contains all zzso zzso and zzso acid replacements commonly found in zzso zzso However, the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso lacks unique zzso zzso when compared with the sequences of other zzso zzso Moreover, apart from the zzso differences, the sequence of zzso is identical to the zzso class I consensus zzso This striking zzso of zzso to other zzso class I zzso suggests that zzso may be a weak zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso is not a zzso zzso zzso but is a newly described zzso zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso zzso is zzso zzso on the cell surface of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Rather unexpectedly, zzso was usually expressed at a lower level than zzso on the surface of zzso zzso as evaluated by zzso zzso binding zzso The sequence of zzso revealed several unique zzso acid zzso Two of these zzso at zzso 35 of the alpha 1 domain and zzso 275 of the zzso domain, may be responsible for the reduced cell surface expression of zzso Additional unique replacements at zzso 138 and 177 of the alpha 2 domain suggest that these zzso acids may be important in the formation of an zzso recognized by a zzso zzso
