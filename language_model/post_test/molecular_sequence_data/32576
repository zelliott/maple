A zzso reference map in zzso range zzso was constructed for the soluble protein fraction of zzso zzso growing zzso under standard zzso zzso zzso could be made for 517 spots out of zzso that were subjected to zzso analysis, according to the specific zzso numbers from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Further analysis of the data revealed 314 distinct zzso 118 of which yielded multiple spots on the master zzso zzso zzso of the proteins was made according to the zzso zzso groups defined in the zzso zzso zzso The functional class of zzso protein turnover and zzso was represented with the highest number zzso of the identified zzso Six proteins were assigned to the hypothetical proteins and 29 were predicted to have a signal zzso zzso zzso zzso predictions were also made for the identified zzso Of the protein spots detected on the master zzso 380 were found to be probably zzso and 96 of these matched to the identified zzso The reference map was efficiently used in the identification of the proteins zzso expressed under cadmium and copper zzso Three new zzso proteins as well as zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso factor zzso alpha zzso were demonstrated as the most strongly zzso
