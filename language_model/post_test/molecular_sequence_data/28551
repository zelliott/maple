The zzso zzso zzso is composed of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso or its zzso zzso To identify novel zzso and zzso zzso fragments of zzso and zzso were zzso in affinity isolation of binding proteins from rat brain zzso and the isolated proteins were identified using mass zzso With this approach, the nuclear protein zzso was shown to interact with the zzso regions of zzso and zzso Our detailed characterization showed that the zzso protein formed a complex with zzso through its binding to zzso The zzso region was mapped to a predicted zzso in zzso When zzso into zzso cells, zzso and zzso displayed overlapping zzso distribution in the zzso The nuclear zzso was zzso by zzso data of zzso zzso and zzso from cultured cortical zzso Finally, we demonstrated that the activity of zzso but not that of zzso was enhanced upon binding to the zzso zzso The tail region of zzso which is rich in zzso zzso is required for the zzso effect on zzso
