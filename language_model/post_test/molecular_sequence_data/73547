All class II zzso zzso coat proteins contain a zzso zzso acid sequence highly zzso to the loop portion of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso coat protein contains two regions of zzso to this zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso to a region of the zzso coat protein whose structure is zzso In some models of the virus structure, this region is zzso In others, it forms a loop that folds back on zzso The similarity of this region to the loop in the zzso zzso motif suggests that it takes on a loop structure in the zzso Each zzso zzso lacks at least one zzso normally involved in zzso consistent with the relatively weak zzso properties of the zzso zzso Consideration of the structure of the coat protein in the membrane and in the virus particle indicates that the protein may be more effective in binding zzso in its zzso form than in the virus zzso This suggests that release of zzso from this loop may be an zzso step during assembly of the proteins into the virus zzso
