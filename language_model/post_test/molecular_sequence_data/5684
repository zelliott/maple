We have previously shown that several protein zzso are present in higher activity levels in zzso resistant cell lines, such as zzso We have now isolated a gene that codes for a putative protein zzso zzso of over 130 zzso that is expressed at higher levels in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells was zzso and amplified by using zzso derived from consensus regions of zzso zzso zzso and amplified fragments were used to recover overlapping clones from a zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso of DNA sequence predicting zzso zzso has been zzso This zzso zzso to a zzso of about 7 zzso which is expressed at high levels in human heart and muscle tissue and zzso in drug-resistant zzso and zzso zzso Because its closest zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have called this gene zzso zzso is also related to the protein zzso family that includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso This protein represents the first of its type known in zzso and may be involved in growth control pathways similar to those described for zzso as well as possibly playing a role in zzso zzso
