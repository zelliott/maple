The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, which produce zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated for the first time from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso open reading frame zzso 463 zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso which shows high identity to zzso of other plant species, is predicted to possess a zzso transit zzso at the zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern analysis revealed that zzso has high levels of zzso in leaves and low levels of zzso in roots and zzso The expression of zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso and salicylic acid zzso but not by zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the function of this zzso A functional color zzso in zzso showed that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso indicating that zzso encodes a functional zzso zzso of zzso enhanced the production of zzso in cultured zzso roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel and important zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
