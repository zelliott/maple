The zzso sequence of the zzso coding region of zzso disease virus zzso strain zzso isolated from a disease outbreak occurring in Hong Kong in February 2002, was determined and compared with the sequences of other zzso The zzso coding region was zzso zzso in length and zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence with those of other zzso indicated that zzso belonged to zzso zzso A zzso sequence similarity tree of several zzso Asian zzso zzso showed that zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso found in Hong Kong from 1991 to 1999 and Taiwan in zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the major zzso region of zzso with that of the zzso O vaccine strain, zzso reveals significant zzso indicating that current zzso O vaccines may offer some degree of protection against zzso
