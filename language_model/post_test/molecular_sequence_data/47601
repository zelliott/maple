The marine, zzso zzso zzso was isolated in the late zzso It was the first zzso for which lipids were firmly demonstrated to be part of the zzso structure and it has been classified as the type zzso of the zzso zzso The host, zzso zzso zzso belongs to a common group of marine zzso We developed a zzso method producing zzso with specific zzso approximately as high as that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sensitivity of the virus to normally used zzso media such as those containing zzso is zzso We also present an alternative host, a zzso that allows enhanced zzso of the virus under reduced salt zzso We show, using zzso zzso acid sequencing and comparison with the zzso zzso that there are at least eight structural proteins in the infectious zzso
