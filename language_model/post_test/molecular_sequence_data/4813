Large quantities of DNA sequence information about plant genes are rapidly accumulating in public databases, but to progress from DNA sequence to biological function a zzso zzso for each of the genes zzso should be zzso Here we describe a gene trap construct that allowed us to disrupt transcribed genes with a high efficiency in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso used, the expression of a bacterial reporter gene coding for zzso zzso II zzso depends on the in zzso generation of a translation fusion upon the zzso integration into the zzso zzso Analysis of 20 selected transgenic lines showed that 12 lines are zzso zzso zzso The disrupted genes analyzed zzso zzso proteins (three zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding zzso zzso cassette zzso and five proteins of unknown zzso Four zzso genes were new for zzso The results presented here suggest that gene zzso using zzso as a reporter zzso can be as high as zzso and opens novel perspectives for systematic gene tagging in zzso zzso
