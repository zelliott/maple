zzso B surface zzso particles are composed of the major viral envelope zzso the S zzso embedded into a zzso zzso The description of the folding of this protein within the particle membrane could provide helpful information for replacing zzso protein zzso by foreign sequences without zzso the particle zzso Since the zzso of the protein in its zzso environment remains zzso in the near future, alternative approaches had to be zzso We combine here the available experimental structural and zzso data with a zzso procedure to identify zzso zzso of the zzso protein and to propose a three-dimensional description of their assembly within the particle zzso The proposed protein structure is composed of four zzso zzso and an zzso zzso located on the inner surface zzso The zzso zzso are assembled into a highly zzso complex in which no access to the water environment is zzso The approach could be extended to other zzso zzso
