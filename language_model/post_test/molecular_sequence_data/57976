A zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from human zzso by a series of zzso zzso The zzso zzso gave a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 30 zzso on zzso The sequence of the first 21 zzso acids at the zzso of the zzso was zzso A zzso for the zzso was cloned by zzso amplification from extracted zzso zzso using a supposed zzso zzso primer and a zzso zzso primer of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the isolated clone was identical to that of human zzso in zzso zzso mast cells from heart except for a zzso instead of a zzso at the zzso 7th zzso
