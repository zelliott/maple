A 16 zzso protein from an enriched gap junction preparation was isolated from bovine brain zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the first 20 zzso acids showed a complete zzso with a recently published sequence of a zzso from a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the brain gap junction preparation with zzso showed a significant binding of this compound to the 16 zzso zzso indicating that a zzso binding site also occurs within that particular zzso The data suggest that this 16 zzso zzso which has also been described in gap junction preparations from various other zzso belongs to the zzso transporting zzso
