zzso U zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family and is a zzso found in human zzso zzso has been proposed to be a molecular link between zzso and zzso Upon zzso of zzso the active zzso zzso rapidly becomes inactive due to its intrinsic zzso The inherent instability of CPU is likely to be of major importance for the in zzso zzso of its activity, but the underlying structural mechanisms of this fast and spontaneous loss of activity of CPU have not yet been explained, and they severely inhibit the structural characterization of zzso In this study, we screened for more zzso versions of CPU to increase our understanding of the mechanism underlying the instability of zzso zzso We have shown that single as well as a few 2-4 zzso in human CPU can prolong the zzso of zzso activity at 37 degrees C from zzso h of zzso CPU to zzso h for the zzso We provide evidence that the gain in stable activity is accompanied by a gain in zzso of the zzso and increased resistance to zzso digest by zzso Using one of the stable zzso we demonstrate the importance of CPU stability over zzso concentration in zzso zzso
