The primary structure of the zzso zzso binding zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso by direct protein sequencing of selected peptides prepared by zzso and chemical zzso of the intact zzso zzso The zzso chain contains zzso zzso acids and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso A comparison with the primary structures of the corresponding proteins from zzso coli and zzso zzso reveals a sequence zzso of zzso and zzso zzso With respect to both zzso zzso from zzso zzso contains particularly less Ala, zzso zzso and zzso whereas its content of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso In addition, two fragments obtained by limited zzso of the intact, unmodified protein were zzso
