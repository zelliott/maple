zzso a major component of the basement zzso has a domain structure zzso three zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso connecting zzso It contains six zzso motifs and one zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso has been identified by a zzso zzso zzso We prepared zzso zzso named zzso then cloned the zzso of zzso zzso using zzso as a probe, and determined its entire zzso zzso because the deduced zzso acid sequence exhibited high similarity to mouse zzso and human zzso and because the zzso localized in basement membrane of zzso zzso muscle, we have concluded that the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso clearly showed that the zzso zzso also has a domain zzso However, the zzso zzso lacked the zzso domain, and the zzso domain differed from that of mouse zzso in zzso consisting of two kinds of zzso zzso that is, the zzso motif and the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso have evolved by zzso the zzso especially by zzso the two kinds of zzso zzso
