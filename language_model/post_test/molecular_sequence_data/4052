zzso coli zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso has a high specific activity for zzso relative to zzso On the other hand, its zzso zzso exhibits higher activity for zzso which acts as a sulfur donor during the zzso of the zzso cluster and zzso The structure of zzso zzso with zzso was determined by X-ray zzso at zzso A zzso The overall zzso fold of the complex is similar to that of the zzso zzso indicating that no significant structural change occurs upon formation of the zzso In the complex, zzso forms a Schiff base with zzso providing the features of the external zzso formed in the active zzso The zzso zzso which is essential for the activity of zzso toward zzso but not toward zzso is clearly visible on a loop of the extended lobe zzso in all zzso forms zzso in contrast to the corresponding zzso loop zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is closely related to zzso The extended lobe of zzso has an zzso deletion compared with that of the zzso zzso These facts suggest that the restricted flexibility of the zzso extended lobe in zzso may be responsible for the ability of the zzso to discriminate between zzso and zzso
