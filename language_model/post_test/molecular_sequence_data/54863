zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen often associated with chronic lung infections in individuals with the genetic disease zzso zzso zzso Previous work from our laboratory revealed that five genes predicted to be important for zzso of zzso zzso are induced during in zzso growth in zzso lung zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that these genes comprise an zzso zzso to as the zzso zzso and that zzso a putative component of the zzso zzso system, is required for growth on and zzso of zzso Using primer extension analysis, the promoter of the zzso zzso was mapped and shown to be zzso by zzso and regulated by the zzso regulator zzso zzso analysis revealed that in addition to induction of the zzso zzso several zzso zzso genes zzso factors critical for zzso zzso production are also induced by zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso production of the zzso zzso Based on this data, we propose a model in which zzso zzso senses surrounding bacteria by monitoring zzso zzso and responds to this cue through enhanced production of an zzso
