The zzso for zzso zzso 1 zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso and expressed in zzso The single major open reading frame of the zzso pair zzso coded for a zzso acid zzso of approximately 37 zzso the predicted sequence of which showed strong identity with known zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited properties characteristic of zzso such as zzso by zzso the ability to zzso a highly specific zzso zzso and a strong preference for zzso over zzso A zzso zzso activity, partially zzso from soluble extracts of zzso zzso by affinity zzso through zzso columns displayed identical zzso The activity showed a zzso expression in the zzso in the order zzso zzso ring zzso zzso Northern analysis indicated the existence of two major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pairs long, the levels of which were in the order ring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso defined important zzso acid zzso and their potential role in the zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso appeared to be the one of the smallest and perhaps the most primitive zzso zzso known, containing little sequence information beyond the minimal zzso zzso
