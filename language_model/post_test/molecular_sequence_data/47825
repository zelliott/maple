Recent developments in zzso technology enable the use of random zzso libraries for identifying linear zzso acid sequences zzso which can mimic zzso zzso without necessarily exhibiting zzso acid sequence zzso with the native linear zzso In this study a zzso random zzso library displayed on the surface of a zzso zzso has been used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso raised against the envelope protein zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso Three zzso were identified that reacted with the selecting zzso in an zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that, whereas the three zzso had several zzso acids in common, there was no significant zzso with the primary zzso acid sequence of zzso although some zzso acids were shared between the variable region zzso and the three zzso zzso zzso of complex zzso zzso may have potential uses as novel vaccines and for the zzso diagnosis of zzso
