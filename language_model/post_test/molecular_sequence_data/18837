Fusion between viral envelopes and host cell zzso which is zzso by special zzso anchored on the viral zzso is required for zzso viral entry and zzso The zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso which zzso membrane fusion, adopts either an zzso or zzso structure depending on the cholesterol zzso We used zzso spin labels on the zzso zzso and different positions on the zzso chain to detect its zzso on zzso zzso containing different cholesterol zzso by zzso zzso Our findings were as zzso 1), zzso zzso affects the zzso order in the same manner as previously shown for influenza zzso zzso zzso it has a cooperative effect versus the zzso ratio, supporting our hypothesis that membrane ordering is a common prerequisite for viral membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane ordering in all zzso compositions zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso order to a significantly smaller zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso is in the zzso zzso its effect on the zzso ordering reaches deeper into the zzso The different extent to which the two zzso zzso is correlated with their zzso The possible role of the two zzso in membrane fusion is zzso
