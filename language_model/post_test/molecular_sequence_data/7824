In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso by the zzso compound zzso zzso has been zzso When zzso zzso was incubated with zzso three zzso bonds were formed per zzso of zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso 36, and zzso zzso zzso These were identified using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso When the zzso protein zzso was incubated with zzso a more random pattern of multiple zzso linkages was zzso zzso of zzso zzso also occurred on treatment with zzso zzso zzso and the same three major zzso bonds were formed as in the reaction with zzso These results suggest the interpretation that the zzso reaction occurs at the zzso centers while zinc zzso are still bound and that the two zinc fingers are not identical in their chemical zzso This latter point is consistent with the independent biological roles reported previously for the two fingers in the viral infection zzso
