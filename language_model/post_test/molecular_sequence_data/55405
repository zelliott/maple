A zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso was zzso with superior yields of zzso and zzso by conventional zzso or by foam zzso zzso zzso exclusion zzso zzso and sodium zzso gel zzso zzso yielded a molecular mass of 55 zzso The zzso possessed an zzso point of zzso and was able to zzso the common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a pH of zzso whereas the zzso was still able to zzso zzso and zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso exhibited low K ( m ) values of 8 zzso zzso and 80 zzso zzso and remarkable zzso efficiency towards the zzso zzso zzso of zzso k zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed a high stability towards high zzso of various metal zzso zzso and zzso indicating a considerable zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibited an increased activity as well as a striking boost of stability in the presence of zzso zzso zzso were deduced from zzso zzso The complete coding sequence of zzso was determined to zzso zzso and confirmed via amplification of the zzso zzso zzso sequence which included 12 zzso The deduced 516 zzso acid zzso sequence of the zzso gene shared zzso identity and zzso similarity with a zzso from zzso zzso The sequence data may aid theoretical studies and zzso engineering efforts to create zzso with an improved stability towards metal zzso and bipolar zzso
