In zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso are located in an zzso in a densely packed and zzso region of the zzso zzso with their side chains packed against those of zzso zzso and zzso in the second zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso was constructed in which the identities of the zzso at positions zzso and 422 were zzso zzso were designed so as to present like charges zzso zzso and zzso or opposite charges zzso zzso across the zzso interface to assess the role of zzso interactions in zzso zzso A fourth zzso zzso was also constructed to investigate the effects of introducing a potentially zzso bulky side chain into a crowded region of the zzso zzso In all cases, an active zzso zzso was found to be assembled but each zzso protein was zzso zzso A detailed zzso kinetic analysis indicated that each zzso zzso no longer displayed the zzso zzso kinetic zzso associated with the zzso zzso but exhibited what was best described as a random zzso zzso complex zzso This zzso depending on the chosen zzso zzso to apparent zzso zzso or complex kinetic zzso These experiments, together with others reported zzso indicate that simple zzso changes in regions distant from the active site can lead to dramatic switches in zzso kinetic zzso
