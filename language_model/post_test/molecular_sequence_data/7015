zzso requires degradation of vascular basement membrane prior to migration and proliferation of zzso zzso zzso are essential ingredients in this zzso Because of zzso multiple effects on zzso we have examined its role in zzso zzso zzso using human zzso vein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso media revealed a prominent zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cells resulted in the generation of 64 and 62 zzso zzso bands which is consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso had no effect in the absence of zzso This effect requires the zzso site of zzso since zzso A zzso was abolished by specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with excess tissue inhibitor of zzso or a zzso zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso A presumably by competing with the zzso zzso of native zzso A for interaction with an zzso site on zzso plasma zzso Although zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso cells by Northern and Western zzso the zzso function of this zzso in zzso zzso of zzso A needs to be zzso zzso A zzso did not require zzso signal zzso events zzso by the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that 1) zzso cells express a novel zzso mechanism for zzso A, 2) zzso active zzso regulates this zzso zzso and 3) zzso occurs independently of the functional zzso zzso
