The zzso membrane of the zzso is the center of zzso zzso To better understand the function of the zzso compartment within the zzso network, we have carried out a systematic characterization of the zzso zzso proteins from the model zzso zzso zzso Our data show that the zzso zzso has its own specific zzso of which 36 proteins were zzso Besides a large group of zzso zzso zzso and zzso a family of novel zzso domain proteins was zzso An analysis of the zzso signal peptides showed that 19 of 36 zzso precursors were marked by a zzso motif for import via the zzso zzso To compare the model zzso zzso with another typical higher plant, we investigated the zzso from the zzso zzso of spinach and found that the zzso proteins from both plants corresponded zzso As a complement to our experimental investigation, we made a theoretical prediction of the zzso proteins from the whole zzso zzso and estimated that the zzso zzso of the zzso contains approximately 80 zzso
