The zzso belong to a family of zzso basement membrane zzso with multiple zzso structures, and zzso zzso cells bind zzso and form zzso structures when zzso on a zzso basement membrane zzso zzso zzso is composed of 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because zzso is known to contain multiple biologically active sites, we have screened 156 synthetic overlapping peptides spanning the entire zzso zzso chain for potential zzso zzso Only 7 of these zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disrupted the formation of zzso structures by human zzso vein zzso cells on zzso zzso experiments in the presence of 50 to 200 zzso showed that tube formation was prevented by most peptides at 150 and 200 zzso except for zzso which showed strong activity at all zzso Active peptides promoted vessel zzso from zzso rings and zzso in the chick zzso membrane zzso In addition, the active peptides also promoted zzso cell zzso to dishes coated with zzso zzso of zzso and inhibited attachment to zzso but not to plastic or zzso Four of the active zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have zzso specificity with zzso cells, since they did not promote zzso zzso outgrowth or zzso of zzso melanoma and human zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that specific zzso zzso peptides have zzso activity with potential therapeutic zzso
