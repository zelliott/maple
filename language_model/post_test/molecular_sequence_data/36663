The zzso zzso zzso is dependent on an association with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of a zzso base pair zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso portion of the zzso coli beta zzso was zzso The DNA coded for the terminal 35 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the first 209 zzso acids of zzso zzso of zzso zzso The deduced sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were 71, 84, and zzso zzso respectively, to the zzso proteins of zzso zzso The sequences of two portions of the zzso region between zzso and zzso were nearly identical in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso One sequence constituted an zzso repeat that could be an zzso zzso zzso processing zzso the other sequence preceded zzso A compilation of the zzso usage for zzso zzso and other zzso zzso proteins indicated a major preference for A or T in the first and third positions, a result consistent with the low zzso plus zzso zzso + zzso content of the DNA of this zzso
