zzso zzso cassette (ABC) protein constituents of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso systems, including one zzso zzso protein were zzso for sequence conservation and zzso zzso The proteins were generally found to cluster in accordance with the zzso patterns previously observed for the zzso receptors and the zzso zzso constituents of these zzso The results suggest that these transport systems evolved from a single primordial system with minimal zzso of the three dissimilar protein constituents of the zzso
