zzso zzso therapy has recently been used in Uruguay for the treatment of uncomplicated zzso zzso As part of an active surveillance study to monitor the emergence of zzso resistance in zzso zzso we examined the levels of zzso zzso in 51 consecutive zzso obtained from males with uncomplicated zzso zzso zzso with decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso were common, and these zzso often displayed zzso to zzso zzso agents zzso and zzso zzso Resistance to zzso and zzso zzso is frequently due to zzso of the zzso zzso pump zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso that zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso we questioned whether clinical zzso that express decreased zzso zzso harbor zzso zzso zzso zzso that would decrease the level of expression of zzso as well as a zzso zzso at zzso 45 in the zzso region that would result in a radical zzso acid replacement within the zzso motif of zzso were found in these zzso When these zzso were transferred into zzso strain zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso was decreased by nearly zzso The zzso zzso pump system was responsible for this property since zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in enhanced zzso of zzso to zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso pump can recognize zzso and that the emergence of zzso strains with decreased zzso to zzso can, in part, be explained by zzso zzso
