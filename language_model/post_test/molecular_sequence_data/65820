zzso DNA zzso is a novel form of zzso DNA consisting of thousands of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso replicate free of the zzso network but nicks and gaps in the newly zzso strands remain at the time of zzso to the zzso zzso We show here that the zzso population of zzso zzso zzso only becomes repaired to the point of having nicks with a zzso and zzso zzso during S zzso These nicks represent the zzso of the strand and occur within the replication origins zzso and zzso located 180 degrees apart on the zzso zzso containing a new L strand have a single zzso within either zzso or zzso but not in both origins in the same zzso The zzso zzso H strand contains single nicks within both zzso and zzso in the same zzso zzso that zzso between the zzso Okazaki fragments become repaired except for the fragments initiated within the two zzso zzso in L and H strands at the origins persist throughout S phase and only become zzso as a prelude to network zzso The failure to zzso these nicks until just prior to network division is not due to inappropriate zzso for zzso
