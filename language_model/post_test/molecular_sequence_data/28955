We performed a systematic maximum density zzso zzso detection of zzso sequence regions to discover new, biologically relevant motifs from a set of zzso zzso translated mouse zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso candidate zzso which shared similar regions over zzso zzso acid zzso were screened against known zzso regions listed in zzso zzso and zzso The filtering procedure resulted in 139 zzso sequences belonging to 49 new motif zzso Using zzso and multiple sequence alignment information, we removed by visual inspection 42 candidates whose members were found to be false zzso because of sequence zzso alternative zzso low complexity, transcribed zzso repeat elements contained in the region of the predicted open reading frame, and reports in the zzso The remaining seven motifs have been expanded by hidden zzso model zzso profile searches of zzso from 28 zzso sequences to zzso members and analyzed in detail on sequence and structure level to zzso the possible functions of motifs and zzso The novel and zzso motif zzso is specific for the zzso inhibitor of growth zzso zzso Three zzso zzso are specific for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The motif zzso together with a zzso finger domain constitutes a module for ING zzso zzso motif zzso represents a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso domain that zzso zzso and zzso from all other zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor domain but has been detected only in an zzso loop region of zzso carrier 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso family members, which may regulate the specificity of zzso zzso Our motif discovery not only aided in the functional characterization of new mouse zzso for potential drug targets but also allowed us to predict that at least 16 other new motifs are waiting to be discovered from the current zzso zzso
