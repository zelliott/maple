The response by individuals to nicotine is likely to reflect the interaction of this compound with target zzso However, resolving how different genetic backgrounds contribute to unique mouse zzso responses to this compound remains an important and unresolved zzso To examine this question in detail, expression of the nicotine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured in the zzso zzso using zzso in mouse strains or lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Long Sleep zzso Short Sleep zzso and zzso The zzso in all mice zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso that were zzso into at least four groups based on zzso zzso zzso A notable difference between mouse strains was the expression of zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso whose numbers vary zzso with zzso zzso This novel relationship also correlated with published parameters of strain sensitivity to zzso Attempts to identify the origin of this significant difference in zzso expression among strains included comparison of the entire zzso gene zzso Although multiple zzso were identified, including two that changed zzso zzso acid coding, none of these clearly correlate with zzso differences in cell zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that mouse zzso behavioral and zzso responses to nicotine are likely to be a reflection of a complex interplay between genetic factors that shape differences in expression and cellular architecture of this zzso neurotransmitter system in the zzso nervous zzso
