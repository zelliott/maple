We constructed and tested a series of cloning zzso designed to facilitate protein production and zzso in zzso zzso zzso These zzso carry the origin of replication of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso consisting of the strong, zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso start zzso upstream from a multiple cloning site and sequences for the addition of zzso or affinity tags at the zzso or zzso of any zzso The affinity tag used zzso to 7 zzso zzso or 8 zzso zzso His zzso The zzso tags zzso to an zzso sequence from human zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso sequence zzso by zzso zzso to zzso Both these zzso are commercially zzso The zzso zzso offers a second affinity tag for the zzso of proteins under native zzso The functional competence of the zzso was tested by determining their ability to promote the expression of various zzso zzso zzso High synthesis levels were obtained for each zzso up to 1 zzso of zzso functional protein per g of cells was obtained after zzso of the zzso zzso
