zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso are zzso involved in the modification of cell wall structure by zzso and, often, also zzso zzso molecules in primary plant cell zzso Using a pool of zzso raised against an enriched cell wall protein zzso a new zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso expression library obtained from the zzso zone of the zzso zzso The predicted protein has a putative zzso signal zzso and possesses the typical zzso of this zzso family, such as a zzso domain that is zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso and four zzso zzso in the central and C terminal regions of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals that it belongs to zzso 4, so far only reported from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso but not zzso zzso activity, representing the first zzso belonging to zzso 4 characterized in zzso so zzso zzso data indicate that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso modulated by culture conditions, and induced by zzso zzso expression zzso in onion cells reveal that zzso is directed to the cell wall, although zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso plants expressing zzso show slightly increased zzso zzso activity and zzso in the cell wall structure and zzso
