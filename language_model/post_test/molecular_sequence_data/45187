The zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso zzso distinct outer membrane proteins that mediate adherence to and invasion of human zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso protein expression appeared to be selected for or induced during experimental zzso zzso tract zzso Here we further defined the zzso of recovery of zzso zzso from the lower zzso tracts of female mice and investigated the basis for this initial zzso We found that the recovery of different zzso zzso from mice appears zzso Three zzso of infection were zzso Following zzso zzso with primarily zzso zzso the majority of zzso recovered were zzso zzso zzso A subsequent decline in the percentage of zzso zzso occurred in a majority of mice zzso zzso and was followed by a zzso of zzso zzso in mice that were infected for longer than 8 days zzso zzso We showed the early phase was due to selection for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso by constructing a zzso zzso strain and following zzso zzso populations mixed with a higher percentage of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso spiked with zzso zzso zzso were consistent with selection of zzso zzso Based on the absence in mice of human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso the major class of zzso protein adherence zzso we conclude the observed selection for zzso zzso early in infection is not likely due to a specific adherence advantage and may be due to zzso evasion of innate zzso
