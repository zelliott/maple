zzso a form of zzso zzso are currently under intense investigation as human vaccines for many infectious pathogens and zzso However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso are only partially zzso We have investigated the influence of the zzso content on the zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso zzso synthetic zzso were constructed by zzso attachment to the zzso backbone of either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of mice with the zzso but not with its zzso zzso induced a strong T zzso protective immunity against lethal zzso zzso Analysis of zzso profiles and zzso ratios revealed that a dominant zzso immune response was zzso by the zzso as opposed to a zzso response generated by its zzso zzso The zzso was efficiently taken up in zzso by immature zzso cells zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, and induced zzso maturation and production of zzso zzso by zzso Finally, DC zzso with the zzso induced zzso T cell responses through the zzso zzso zzso These findings have important implications for the development of effective zzso zzso strategies against infectious zzso
