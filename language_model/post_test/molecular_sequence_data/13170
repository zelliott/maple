Previous studies showed that alpha 1 zzso zzso responses change with age in the rat zzso becoming more sensitive to zzso channel zzso and less sensitive to zzso zzso suggesting a change in the alpha 1 zzso zzso that are zzso In this study, alpha 1 zzso density and alpha 1 zzso zzso were measured in the Fischer 344 rat zzso during zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso zzso determined by zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso were 47, 41 and 45 zzso protein in zzso and zzso rats, zzso The zzso zzso zzso completely blocked zzso binding in zzso from zzso rats but inhibited binding only partially in zzso from older zzso Two binding sites were detected for zzso and for zzso in all zzso The zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso were consistent with those for the alpha zzso zzso zzso and this binding site decreased with zzso The zzso constant for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was consistent with that for alpha zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso in 6- and zzso zzso were consistent with those for the alpha zzso zzso zzso At least three alpha 1 zzso zzso appear to be zzso in the rat zzso so the binding affinities may reflect binding to more than one zzso This makes it difficult to identify zzso the zzso based on their zzso binding zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
