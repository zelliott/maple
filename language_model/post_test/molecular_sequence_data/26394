A clone of the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso has been isolated by zzso to the cloned zzso gene of zzso zzso Southern analysis and sequencing of the cloned DNA revealed three regions of similarity to zzso that have been tentatively identified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Introduction of each of the three genes separately into zzso zzso by zzso transformation has demonstrated that zzso encodes an zzso with the same physical properties as zzso 5 in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso encodes a zzso protein and is composed of two zzso separated by a zzso zzso in the same position as the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso coding region with that of zzso reveals an overall similarity zzso at both the zzso and zzso acid zzso that is substantially lower than that for other genes zzso in both of these zzso Total zzso and zzso site differences between zzso and zzso are more abundant in the second zzso than in the first, suggesting differential effects of selection or zzso on these two zzso Comparisons of the zzso DNA of zzso and zzso reveal four short zzso sequence zzso but the remaining upstream sequences show no significant zzso Conservation in the zzso DNA is limited to the presence of two zzso sites that may correlate with the existence of two transcripts from both zzso and zzso The patterns of zzso zzso and zzso acid replacements between zzso and zzso are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso and genetic drift are responsible for the differences between these two zzso
