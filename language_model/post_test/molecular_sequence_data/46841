zzso induction of temperate zzso zzso of zzso zzso is controlled by the action of its zzso and zzso products at the zzso operator zzso Three zzso zzso repeated DNA segments zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the two divergent zzso and zzso promoters were mapped within the zzso operator zzso The zzso zzso product is shown to be the functional zzso of zzso zzso The binding of zzso to the three operator zzso is zzso and yields two discrete zzso complexes of retarded migration in mobility shift zzso The zzso value for the zzso DNA complex was estimated to be 6 zzso zzso shows a slightly higher affinity for zzso than for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, which directs zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso devoid of the last 12 zzso zzso allowed the assignment of the zzso domain to the zzso end of zzso The C end enhances its affinity for the DNA and probably zzso zzso induced by zzso
