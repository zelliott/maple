zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso and skeletal muscle inflammation zzso of farmed Atlantic salmon zzso zzso We have performed detailed sequence analysis of the zzso zzso with focus on putative zzso zzso compared with zzso strains from zzso zzso zzso and avian zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid identities were low for most gene segments but detailed sequence analysis showed that many protein motifs or key zzso acid zzso known to be central to protein function are zzso for most zzso zzso For zzso proteins this included a zzso zzso in zzso which, for zzso has been shown to play a key role in both the formation and structural organization of virus inclusion bodies, and affect zzso signaling and induction of zzso zzso structural similarities in the inner zzso proteins zzso and zzso suggest a zzso core zzso In contrast, low zzso acid identities in the predicted zzso surface proteins zzso zzso and zzso suggested differences regarding cellular interactions between the zzso zzso However, for zzso zzso acid zzso central for zzso binding to zzso zzso and zzso and zzso sites in zzso required for zzso membrane penetration during infection are partially or wholly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the only zzso element found was a zinc finger zzso We provide evidence that the zzso segment zzso zzso also encodes a 124 zzso zzso zzso which appears to be localized to zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene segments are also potentially zzso predicted to zzso a 71 zzso zzso and a 98 zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso has more properties in common with zzso than with zzso
