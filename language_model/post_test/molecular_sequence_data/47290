zzso and resulting zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is found in approximately zzso of human breast and zzso of human zzso zzso To better understand the molecular events associated with zzso of this gene in human breast cancer cells, differential zzso was used to identify genes whose expression levels are altered in cells zzso this zzso Of 16 zzso clones screened from an zzso cell zzso library, a total of 19 zzso clones were isolated including seven whose expression decreases zzso zzso and 12 which increase zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso zzso Of these, five C clones and 11 H clones have been confirmed to be zzso expressed by northern zzso zzso This group includes nine genes of known function, three previously zzso genes of relatively zzso function and four novel genes without a match in zzso zzso of the previously characterized genes indicates that they represent sequences known to be frequently associated with the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso cloning strategy used identified appropriate target zzso In addition, differential expression of 12 of 16 zzso zzso identified in the breast cancer cell lines are also seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells, indicating that they represent generic associations with zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso of two of the identified zzso one novel and one identified but as yet zzso zzso was confirmed in human breast cancer specimens in association with zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of these genes may yield insight into the fundamental biology and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso in human breast and zzso cancer zzso
