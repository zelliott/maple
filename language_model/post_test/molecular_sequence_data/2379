We identify and describe the properties of an zzso within the chicken zzso gene zzso This cluster consists of one gene zzso expressed only in primitive zzso and two zzso A and alpha zzso expressed in both primitive and definitive cell zzso The genes are linked together in the order zzso zzso zzso and occupy a region about 10 zzso pairs zzso The zzso is located at the 3' end of the zzso about 750 base pairs 3' to the alpha A translation stop zzso When zzso by zzso into either primitive or definitive primary chicken zzso this element zzso expression from plasmids containing the alpha zzso or alpha zzso gene zzso Except for sites in the zzso zzso no other zzso activity was observed in DNA taken from other regions of the zzso zzso zzso resolution zzso I hypersensitivity studies as well as zzso I zzso revealed three regions of protein zzso each containing a similar core DNA sequence within the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift studies demonstrated that all three regions bind the recently identified zzso factor, zzso which has binding sites in the regulatory regions of all chicken zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso we have identified may act in zzso only on the alpha A zzso expression of the alpha D gene is affected by another zzso site located in the alpha D zzso Such a mechanism would be consistent with the observed relative zzso of alpha A- and alpha zzso in zzso The simplicity of these regulatory elements may reflect the limited repertoire of expression of these genes during zzso
