A new zzso zzso E zzso zzso was identified in a 43-year-old male with moderate zzso On zzso focusing in an immobilized pH zzso zzso migrated to a position more zzso than zzso zzso On sodium zzso zzso zzso its apparent molecular weight could not be distinguished from that of the three common zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed that zzso had zzso in positions 112 and 158 of the mature zzso suggesting that the zzso accounting for the additional positive charge had occurred in an zzso 4 zzso The third and the fourth zzso of the zzso gene were amplified using the zzso chain reaction and analyzed by temperature zzso gel zzso This suggested that there were two zzso in the fourth zzso of the zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing disclosed that, apart from the exchange of zzso for zzso in position zzso a C to A substitution replaced zzso zzso in position 81 by zzso zzso
