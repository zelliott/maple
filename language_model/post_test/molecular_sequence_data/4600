zzso In order to understand the differences in pH zzso and reaction rates of zzso A towards low molecular weight zzso and zzso zzso the zzso structure of bovine pancreatic zzso A was zzso The kinetic studies of various sizes of zzso acids showed that the size of the zzso is three zzso zzso The kinetic studies on the zzso of zzso X-ray zzso of zzso zzso and zzso complexes, zzso studies on the binding of zzso zzso and zzso showed the presence of zzso zzso and B3 zzso The location of the zzso site was assigned to be zzso by X-ray zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The location of the zzso and/or zzso site was determined by studying the zzso activities of several zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso for zzso and/or zzso coupled with zzso toward various chain lengths of zzso zzso The experiment suggested that zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso zzso Several new zzso base specific zzso were isolated and their primary structures were zzso They were two zzso zzso a bovine liver alkaline zzso a bovine brain zzso and a zzso liver zzso The bovine brain zzso has extra 16 zzso acids at the zzso with zzso zzso The zzso liver zzso was an extremely zzso zzso so far zzso zzso Two new zzso belonging to zzso zzso family were isolated and their primary structures were zzso They were zzso isolated from zzso zzso and a mushroom zzso The former zzso has a similar structure to zzso zzso but it was a base zzso and zzso acid preferential zzso From the results of zzso studies of this zzso we suggested that the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso is zzso a general zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We isolated several zzso plant and animal base zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass about 24 zzso or more, and zzso their primary zzso These zzso contain two sequences containing common zzso zzso acid zzso in common which include most of the zzso acid zzso important for the zzso zzso we proposed to designate these zzso as zzso zzso family zzso On the basis of chemical zzso kinetic studies and protein engineering studies of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso M from zzso zzso we assigned that the zzso site of zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the mechanism we proposed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso work as a general acid and base zzso zzso was a zzso binding site, and zzso and zzso might work to zzso a zzso bond of the zzso or stabilize the zzso zzso However, in the reverse reaction of the transfer reaction step and the zzso step of zzso zzso zzso and zzso work as an acid and base zzso zzso The X-ray zzso studies of zzso zzso an zzso zzso or zzso and the protein engineering studies of several zzso zzso assigned the components of the major base recognition site zzso zzso and the minor base recognition site zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso studies of several zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso is very crucial for zzso base recognition, and the replacement of zzso by other zzso acid, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso makes zzso zzso more zzso acid zzso zzso the replacement of zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso make the zzso more zzso and zzso bases zzso zzso These trials are the first example of marked artificial change in the base specificity of zzso
