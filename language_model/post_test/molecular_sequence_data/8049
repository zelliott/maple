Potential regulatory sequences within the zzso region of the zzso gene promoter zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso promoter was analyzed by zzso zzso mapping of zzso from crown zzso tumors of sunflower zzso using a zzso zzso zzso in expression levels were minimized by the use of an internal reference gene and the pooling of at least 200 tumors per construct zzso This approach identified numerous sequences that influence zzso activity in either a positive or negative zzso Eight regions of positive influence and three of negative were identified from analysis of those zzso that exhibited low zzso in expression zzso zzso zzso and affected activity by at least zzso
