zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso is the avian counterpart of zzso brain zzso implicated in zzso cell differentiation and zzso cell zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso zzso and brain of chick zzso We have previously shown by in zzso studies that the zzso zzso factor binds to a consensus zzso binding site in the zzso promoter zzso Based on the expression pattern of zzso in the developing zzso and on zzso analysis of the zzso binding site in DNA zzso experiments, we proposed that zzso could be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso isolation of two members of the zzso family expressed in the chick zzso zzso and zzso We show that zzso zzso and the zzso factors are expressed in mutually exclusive patterns in the zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso are selectively expressed either in zzso or in zzso and horizontal cells, respectively, zzso zzso found in zzso zzso cells and/or bipolar zzso Furthermore, a decrease in zzso expression is obtained upon zzso of primary retinal cultures with zzso expression zzso and a zzso reporter zzso The early and zzso expression of zzso and zzso in the developing zzso suggest a role for this zzso factor family in the early steps of zzso and horizontal cell zzso zzso of the zzso gene in these cells may be an important component of their zzso zzso
