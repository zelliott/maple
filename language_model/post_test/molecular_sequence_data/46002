zzso Finger zzso 202 zzso is a zzso zzso that binds elements found predominantly in genes involved in HDL zzso We tested the following zzso 1) zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso differ between individuals with low and high HDL zzso and 2) zzso in zzso affect HDL cholesterol levels in the general zzso We screened the promoter and zzso zzso of zzso in individuals with the highest zzso zzso zzso 95) and lowest zzso zzso zzso 95) HDL cholesterol among zzso Danish zzso None of the 10 zzso identified differed in frequency as single sites or as zzso between low and high HDL cholesterol zzso In accordance with this, seven zzso were equally frequent zzso in individuals with low or high HDL zzso Finally, for all five zzso identified in the coding region, we determined the association of zzso with HDL cholesterol in zzso individuals from the general zzso Four zzso were not associated with variation in HDL cholesterol, although zzso zzso was associated with a discrete effect on HDL cholesterol in zzso We show that genetic variation in zzso is common in the general zzso However, zzso in the zzso region of zzso do not make a major contribution to HDL cholesterol zzso
