zzso zzso coli zzso a zzso of zzso toxin zzso producing zzso coli zzso may cause severe zzso and zzso zzso syndrome zzso and is transmitted orally via contaminated foods or from person to zzso The infectious dose is known to be very low, which requires most of the bacteria to survive the gastric acid zzso Acid resistance therefore is an important mechanism of zzso zzso It should also be a relevant characteristic of zzso coli strains used for therapeutic purposes such as the zzso zzso coli zzso 1917 zzso In zzso coli and related enteric bacteria it has been extensively demonstrated, that the alternative zzso factor zzso zzso by the zzso zzso acts as a master regulator zzso resistance to various environmental stress zzso 

Using zzso deletion zzso of a highly virulent zzso zzso patient isolate and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso we investigated the impact of a functional zzso gene for orchestrating a satisfactory response to acid stress in these zzso We then functionally characterized zzso of zzso zzso and five zzso genes selected from zzso zzso zzso for acid zzso 

First, we found out that zzso isolate zzso of zzso zzso has a point zzso in zzso not present in the published zzso leading to a premature stop zzso Moreover, to our surprise, one zzso strain as well as zzso was acid sensitive in our test environment, although their cloned zzso genes could effectively complement acid sensitivity of an zzso deletion zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso zzso might be of importance for anyone planning to do either in zzso or in zzso studies with this zzso zzso zzso our data supports recently published zzso that individual zzso coli zzso are able to significantly zzso their acid resistance zzso independent of their zzso zzso
