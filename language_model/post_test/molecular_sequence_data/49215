zzso strains belonging to zzso zzso can be human opportunistic zzso plant zzso and plant growth promoting and have remarkable zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of several zzso zzso what is now known as the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the zzso system of a zzso I onion rot type strain zzso zzso zzso sensing is a zzso regulatory response which involves the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso locus has been zzso in the zzso and it has been shown that zzso is responsible for the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso locus regulates zzso production as well as onion zzso via the expression of a zzso zzso A zzso sensor zzso has been constructed and used to demonstrate that zzso responded to zzso with only zzso of the zzso efficiency of zzso that a zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso less zzso and that zzso responded best towards zzso zzso In addition, we also report the cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso factor gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso It was established that zzso sensing in zzso zzso has a negative effect on zzso expression as determined by using an zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, zzso zzso displayed no difference in the zzso of zzso signal zzso
