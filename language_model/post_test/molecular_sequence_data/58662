zzso and plasma zzso lines and zzso were analyzed for their ability to use a zzso zzso zzso versus a 3' zzso zzso zzso site, in the absence of a competing zzso from a set of related zzso The zzso zzso site use zzso zzso of the resulting zzso zzso zzso is a measure of zzso site zzso In this context the zzso zzso zzso zzso site showed a zzso ratio of zzso in plasma cells, zzso in zzso zzso and an intermediate value in zzso Meanwhile, a construct with a zzso zzso zzso zzso site produced zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso in all cell zzso zzso in the region downstream of the zzso zzso addition site and at the site itself resulted in changes in the zzso zzso However, these zzso sites, all with a zzso ratio of zzso or zzso zzso were used most efficiently in plasma zzso zzso totally devoid of zzso zzso but containing zzso zzso sites producing zzso with zzso ratios of zzso or zzso zzso were also used more efficiently in plasma zzso We therefore conclude that weak zzso sites, regardless of sequence zzso are used more efficiently in plasma cells than in the other cell zzso
