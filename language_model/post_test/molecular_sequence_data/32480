The zzso sequences of zzso segments 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10, coding for viral proteins zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were determined and compared for 10 strains of zzso virus zzso zzso 4 isolated in the Mediterranean zzso between 1979 and 2004, and the South African attenuated zzso 4 vaccine zzso The sequence data generated for the zzso 4 strains isolated in Greece in 1979, 1999 and 2000 showed that they had a common origin but were distinct from the lineage of the zzso 4 strains isolated from 2003 zzso in the western Mediterranean zzso zzso Morocco, Spain and zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of the zzso 4 strains within each lineage were identical to each other, irrespective of the year of isolation or the geographical zzso Although the sequence of zzso from the Turkish and Greek strains were highly similar, there were sufficient differences in the zzso zzso and zzso proteins to suggest that the Turkish zzso 4 belongs to a third zzso zzso of the zzso sequences from the attenuated zzso 4 vaccine strain and the field strains showed 13 zzso zzso which may, either singularly or together, be responsible for zzso and hence determining the zzso of the zzso
