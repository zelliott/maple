The zzso zzso proteins of viruses in the zzso zzso have a short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The role of this sequence in the zzso processing and function of the zzso disease virus zzso protein was explored by site directed zzso zzso in this region fall into two zzso One set of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a deletion removing zzso acids zzso was defective in zzso These zzso proteins formed little or no mature, zzso linked zzso They had few or no zzso sites found on the mature protein and they were transported to the cell surface poorly or not at zzso The second class of zzso zzso zzso zzso was minimally affected in folding and zzso zzso When zzso to surface zzso this group of zzso proteins had wild type levels of attachment activity, zzso activity, and fusion promotion zzso Thus zzso in this region directly affect zzso processing but not the biological activities of the zzso This sequence may, therefore, be zzso in the zzso proteins of zzso because it is critical to the folding of the zzso
