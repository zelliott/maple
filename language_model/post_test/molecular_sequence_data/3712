zzso zzso and zzso regulate with the help of different interacting proteins the progression through the zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso protocol was applied to determine the core cell cycle genes in the recently completed zzso zzso zzso In total, 61 genes were identified belonging to seven selected families of cell cycle regulators, for which 30 are new or corrections of the existing zzso A new class of putative cell cycle regulators was found that probably are competitors of zzso zzso factors, which mediate the zzso zzso In addition, the existing nomenclature for cell cycle genes of zzso was zzso and the physical positions of all genes were compared with zzso duplicated blocks in the zzso showing that 22 core cell cycle genes emerged through block zzso This zzso analysis illustrates the complexity of the plant cell cycle machinery and provides a tool for zzso the function of new family members in the zzso
