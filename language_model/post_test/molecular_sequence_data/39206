This work was prompted by the need to be able to identify the invasive zzso species, Perna zzso in tropical Australian seas using techniques that do not rely solely on zzso zzso molecular methods utilizing a zzso chain reaction zzso approach were developed to distinguish zzso between the three species in the zzso zzso Target regions were portions of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso between these that occurs in at least two Perna zzso Based on zzso sequence comparisons of the zzso zzso a zzso primer has been designed that can act as a forward primer in zzso for any Perna zzso Four reverse zzso have also been zzso based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso which yield zzso products of different lengths when paired with the zzso forward zzso A further pair of zzso has been designed that will amplify part of the zzso gene of any Perna species, and possibly other zzso as a positive control to demonstrate that the zzso is zzso
