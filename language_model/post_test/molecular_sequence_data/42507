The parallel zzso domain consisting of eight parallel zzso surrounded by eight zzso has been currently identified in crystal structures of more than 20 zzso This type of protein folding motif makes it possible to catalyze various zzso reactions on a variety of zzso zzso it seems to be robust enough so that different zzso zzso could be designed on zzso In spite of many efforts aimed at zzso of evolutionary history of the zzso zzso a challenging question remains zzso How has the parallel zzso fold zzso Although the complete sequence comparison of all zzso zzso acid sequences is not yet available, several sequence similarities have been revealed by using the highly zzso regions of zzso as structural zzso Since many zzso zzso adopt the parallel zzso structure these zzso might be useful in the search for evolutionary relationships of the whole parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso
