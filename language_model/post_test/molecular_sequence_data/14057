A zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso isolate zzso has a deletion in its sequence relative to the highly similar zzso and zzso zzso These insertions in the latter plasmids are 28 zzso in length and are positioned at sites that zzso to their major transcript zzso zzso The zzso sequence is nearly identical to a putative processing site upstream of the zzso gene on the zzso zzso The absence of this zzso sequence in zzso apparently results in transcripts whose zzso zzso zzso to an upstream consensus promoter zzso Two zzso forms of zzso coexist with zzso and have either of two similar zzso zzso positioned exactly as is the zzso insert in zzso These long zzso are zzso partly zzso from a newly discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso has significant similarity to a short region of the zzso satellite zzso zzso Another part of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso derives from the zzso zzso within restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso in many zzso can have several types of zzso plasmids belonging to different zzso zzso We propose that a common ancestral zzso acquired insertions from either the zzso zzso or from other zzso The zzso zzso are the first instance of a zzso zzso zzso in which distinct plasmids have zzso This zzso proves that different plasmids coexist zzso or else did so at some point in their evolution, within a single zzso
