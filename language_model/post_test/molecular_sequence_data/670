The association of zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso arthritis zzso suggests the potential involvement of T zzso in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate this hypothesis by systematic zzso and molecular analyses of zzso T cells in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 

zzso biopsy samples were obtained from 158 zzso zzso zzso was determined zzso and zzso zzso was extracted from peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso zzso obtained from 11 zzso zzso patients, 7 zzso zzso patients, and 10 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso T zzso zzso was studied by combined quantitative and qualitative T cell zzso zzso length distribution zzso analysis and direct sequencing zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso patients were similar at both the clinical and zzso zzso At the molecular level, however, patients with zzso zzso displayed a marked zzso of qualitative zzso zzso zzso as compared with those with zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso These differences in zzso zzso were not observed in the peripheral blood, indicating a selective recruitment and/or local expansion of T cells in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso reflected true zzso or zzso expansions, as confirmed by direct sequencing of the T cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso did not correlate with B cell zzso expansions but were zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso 

The T cell repertoire is specifically restricted in zzso patients with zzso zzso Whereas the origin and role of these zzso zzso remain to be determined, our data suggest the preferential involvement of T zzso in zzso zzso
