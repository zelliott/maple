We have examined the comparative zzso of zzso zzso sites in DNA molecules either free in solution or zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso Sites in the region to which the protein is bound show strongly variable zzso by the zzso The zzso of a zzso site located where the minor groove is narrowed by zzso toward the protein was decreased by about zzso compared to free zzso The zzso of a site placed so that the minor groove is widened by the bend was reduced by about zzso and the zzso of a zzso sequence facing primarily away from the protein was reduced zzso by zzso zzso These results support the view that local DNA structure plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of zzso
