The prion protein zzso zzso sequences of two zzso were determined in order to zzso the differences in zzso to zzso zzso agents in each zzso The zzso sequences of zzso coding regions of the zzso and the golden zzso zzso 771 zzso in zzso The zzso gene sequences of the golden zzso were closely related to those of sheep with one zzso acid zzso The zzso gene sequence of the zzso was identical to that of zzso The similarities between the zzso genes of these two animals and sheep imply that the species barriers between these animals are small or zzso These zzso genes could be used to establish transgenic mice with higher zzso to zzso zzso
