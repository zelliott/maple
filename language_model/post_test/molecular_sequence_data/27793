To isolate genes from zzso coli which regulate the zzso zzso activity, a zzso library was used to transform zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso A single type of zzso designated zzso was zzso This gene also partially restored the zzso activity in zzso zzso (which are defective in all zzso zzso although the low zzso 1 and 2 levels were not zzso zzso zzso apparently zzso specifically, the zzso zzso zzso Restoration of this latter activity in zzso zzso was accompanied by a zzso increase of the zzso zzso activity, suggesting a functional zzso zzso zzso activity was not restored in zzso zzso zzso These latter strains may therefore zzso in addition to the zzso zzso a second component zzso designated component zzso possibly an electron carrier zzso zzso zzso to the zzso respiratory zzso zzso analysis showed an open reading frame of zzso base pairs for zzso It was preceded by a zzso site but apparently lacked a zzso zzso experiments revealed a single zzso of approximately 50 zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequence with a protein sequence data base revealed strong zzso to zzso from zzso pneumoniae, a zzso zzso zzso The 411 base pairs upstream from zzso contained a second open reading frame overlapping zzso by four zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed considerable zzso with the zzso part of zzso This sequence was therefore assumed to be part of a second zzso zzso the zzso zzso and was designated zzso The zzso zzso activity in zzso coli is apparently regulated by a zzso system analogous to the zzso zzso This conclusion is in agreement with the results of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who demonstrated zzso dependence for the zzso zzso zzso
