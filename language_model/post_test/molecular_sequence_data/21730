To clarify the higher zzso initiation factor zzso zzso binding selectivity of zzso protein 2 zzso than of zzso as determined by zzso zzso analysis, the crystal structure of the zzso binding region of zzso in complex with zzso zzso human zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso analysis and compared with that of zzso The crystal structure revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso adopts a L-shaped zzso involving extended and zzso structures and extends over the zzso loop and two different zzso regions of zzso through hydrogen bonds, and zzso and zzso zzso these features were similarly observed for zzso Although the pattern of the overall interaction of zzso with zzso was similar to that of zzso a notable difference was observed for the zzso sequence in relation to the zzso and binding selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso In this paper, we report that the structural scaffold of the zzso binding preference for zzso over zzso is based on the stacking of the zzso zzso side chain on the zzso zzso ring of zzso and the construction of a compact zzso space around the zzso zzso ring by the zzso sequence of zzso
