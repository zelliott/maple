During the last 2 years, several novel genes that zzso zzso zzso proteins have been identified and zzso Because of their sequence similarity with zzso these genes appear to belong to the family of zzso carriers 2A zzso protein symbol zzso zzso comparisons of all 13 family members allow the definition of characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of 12 zzso zzso zzso seven zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso several basic and zzso zzso at the zzso surface of the zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso On the basis of sequence similarities and characteristic zzso the extended zzso family can be divided into three zzso namely class I (the previously known zzso zzso zzso class II (the previously known zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso and class III zzso 8, 10, 12, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics have been reported for some of the novel zzso Like zzso they exhibit a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain, muscle, zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso heart, skeletal zzso zzso and zzso appear to be regulated by zzso zzso because they are targeted to zzso compartments by zzso motifs in a zzso dependent zzso Sugar transport has been reported for zzso 8, and zzso zzso has been shown to be a zzso zzso Thus, the members of the extended zzso family exhibit a surprisingly diverse zzso zzso and the definition of sequence elements determining this zzso specificity will require a full functional characterization of all zzso
