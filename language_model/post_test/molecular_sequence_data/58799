zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso display considerable sequence similarity and structural zzso but differ in the affinity and selectivity of metal binding to their CD site, a zzso site in zzso and a zzso site in zzso In an attempt to identify the structural basis for these differences, zzso were introduced in the previously generated zzso zzso which contains a unique zzso as a zzso fluorescent probe inside the zzso zzso In the present report, we zzso selected zzso acid zzso in the CD site of zzso by those present at identical positions in zzso One zzso zzso named zzso zzso has one new substitution in which zzso at position 66 was exchanged by zzso The second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has four new zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and difference zzso indicated that the zzso do not alter significantly the zzso zzso Both zzso proteins display two zzso sites of identical affinities with intrinsic affinity zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso but not the zzso one, leads to a small decrease of affinity compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite these similarities, the zzso effect on zzso binding is different for the two zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso undergo a parallel shift upon increasing zzso zzso which indicates that the zzso effect on the two zzso sites is the same and zzso very similar to that described for zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the binding of the second zzso zzso at the zzso zzso much more than that of the first zzso zzso the CD zzso According to the competition zzso the two sites display zzso values of 390 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso the single zzso zzso does not modify the zzso binding zzso zzso Multiple modifications in the zzso core still do not change the affinity for zzso and zzso but strongly affect the zzso antagonism and probably the selectivity of the CD zzso
