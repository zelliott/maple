The zzso gene family in humans is implicated in differentiation and cancer, but the zzso mechanisms are zzso Most zzso proteins have zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and the second human zzso zzso also binds to a zzso zzso promoter element through which it activates zzso zzso It is shown here that this DNA binding can result in zzso zzso The DNA breaks occur within repeated sequence elements in the linear zzso duplex and leave staggered ends with zzso zzso The zzso also zzso zzso zzso DNA to yield zzso circular and unit length linear zzso The zzso reaction requires only zzso DNA, zzso and zzso occurs in the absence of zzso conditions, and can be reversed by zzso The zzso DNA strands have free zzso groups, and protein is attached to the zzso zzso Transfer of zzso zzso from DNA to zzso has been observed, and a zzso zzso complex has been isolated and identified by Western zzso as zzso Since zzso zzso complexes are known to serve the role of breaking and rejoining DNA zzso the present findings suggest that zzso is involved in DNA structural transactions necessary for the activity of the zzso zzso
