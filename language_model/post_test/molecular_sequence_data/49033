In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I transcribes the large zzso zzso gene unit and, in addition, zzso surface zzso gene expression sites and zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso pol I in this zzso is unique among zzso but only its largest zzso zzso has been characterized thus zzso We have recently established the zzso cell line zzso which exclusively expresses zzso pol I zzso with the protein C zzso at the zzso zzso In the present study, we prepared zzso cell extracts and zzso zzso pol I using zzso C affinity zzso under high stringency zzso We were able to identify five specific zzso on a zzso zzso gel with apparent molecular weights of zzso 180, 55, 29, and 22 zzso Interestingly, the second largest zzso zzso is zzso zzso larger than counterparts of other zzso We have cloned and zzso the complete zzso zzso and found an open reading frame for a zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains a unique zzso domain of approximately 250 zzso zzso By raising a zzso zzso against a zzso zzso sequence of zzso we could specifically detect this zzso in zzso showing that it zzso with zzso zzso Moreover, we identified the zzso gene sequence zzso in zzso major and found that it encodes a zzso extension zzso zzso the zzso extra domain in zzso zzso zzso may serve a zzso zzso
