zzso of the cellular prion protein is necessary for the transmission and propagation of prion zzso zzso the level of prion protein expression decreases the incubation period for these zzso zzso understanding the regulation of prion protein expression could be critical for treating or preventing these zzso We investigated the regulation of prion protein expression by the promoter and zzso regions of the bovine and zzso zzso zzso We determined that expression is modulated by zzso 1 and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso 1 inhibited activity of the zzso However, zzso 1 demonstrated zzso activity and possessed a zzso zzso In addition, we identified an alternative transcript present in the brains of cattle and mice that lacks zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso 1 and zzso 1 play a critical role in the regulation of prion protein zzso Because switching off prion protein expression has been shown to arrest prion disease, these regions present novel targets for intervention in the disease zzso
