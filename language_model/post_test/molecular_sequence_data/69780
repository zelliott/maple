The zzso sequence zzso the zzso liver E1 beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso was zzso In the region zzso the mature E1 beta zzso zzso both the zzso composition and predicted zzso acid sequence are highly zzso between zzso zzso human, and bovine zzso In contrast, they are less well zzso in the zzso sequence zzso the zzso terminal zzso sequence and 3' untranslated zzso The pattern of zzso expression of three zzso zzso zzso was determined to be similar in both rat and zzso zzso except for that observed in zzso liver, where a higher than expected level of E1 beta zzso zzso was zzso Variation in the levels of this zzso might play a major role in the regulation of the overall ability of the zzso liver to zzso zzso content in response to changing zzso zzso
