The zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso characterized by a relatively large zzso zzso domain responsible for high affinity zzso zzso Based on a model proposed for a major portion of the zzso domain that contains a number of zzso repeats, nine zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected for charge reversal zzso based on their locations in the proposed model and their potential to serve as zzso contact zzso zzso zzso complementary zzso were zzso zzso into zzso cells, and the expressed receptors were characterized by Western zzso analysis, competitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The most interesting zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were present on the plasma membrane zzso as judged by Western zzso but were incapable of binding zzso and, of course, were deficient in zzso zzso zzso Other replacements at these positions, zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to cell surface binding and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso behaved similarly to zzso zzso zzso was trapped zzso but bound zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was not expressed or was rapidly zzso These results, based on 18 point zzso of zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved, either directly or zzso in zzso binding and support the general nature of the proposed zzso
