Cell penetrating peptides zzso can be used as drug delivery systems for different therapeutic zzso In this work two novel zzso zzso and zzso designed from two zzso of the dengue virus zzso zzso zzso were studied for their ability to deliver zzso acids into cells as zzso bound zzso zzso studies were performed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso Combined studies in zzso cells, zzso and zzso cells, at 4 and zzso or using specific zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso use distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directly, while zzso uses an zzso zzso To confirm these results, a methodology was developed to monitor the zzso zzso of both peptides by real-time flow zzso zzso zzso were determined, and the amount of zzso acids delivered was zzso Additional studies were performed in order to understand the molecular bases of the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso membrane interactions were studied zzso based on the intrinsic zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso bound zzso to the same zzso Partition studies revealed that both peptides bind zzso to zzso zzso zzso adopting an zzso zzso However, zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso is deeply inserted into the zzso zzso in contrast with zzso Moreover, only zzso is able to promote the fusion and zzso of zzso composed of zzso zzso Altogether, the results show that zzso zzso protein derived peptides serve as good templates for novel zzso zzso acid delivery strategies, defining different routes for cell zzso
