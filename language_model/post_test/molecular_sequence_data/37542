The zzso protein zzso is the insect zzso of the zzso zzso X zzso zzso Fundamental questions concern the functional role of zzso as the zzso partner of insect nuclear receptors such as the zzso zzso The zzso structures of the zzso binding domain of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso solved recently show that zzso 12 is locked in an zzso zzso raising the question whether zzso could adopt an zzso zzso as observed in zzso In order to investigate this hypothesis, a zzso model for zzso is proposed that allows a structural analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso 12 based on the sequence comparison with zzso For zzso one of the main issues concerns its function and in particular whether its activity is zzso independent or zzso The zzso structures strongly suggest that zzso can bind zzso zzso zzso have therefore been zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Juvenile hormones and juvenile hormone zzso were chosen as target zzso for the zzso zzso The interaction between the zzso and the zzso are examined in terms of the pocket shape as well as in terms of the chemical nature of the zzso lining the zzso binding zzso
