We have cloned a full-length zzso from the higher plant zzso album coding for a single zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso isolated from an actively growing cell suspension culture recognized a zzso zzso transcript on Northern zzso The open reading frame comprises zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 112 zzso A comparison of the protein sequence with those of the two known zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso , reveals extensive zzso between the three zzso with complete conservation of all zzso essential zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso from zzso , as well as zzso sequences from rice and zzso which have been partially zzso lack two zzso zzso regions of up to 176 zzso acids near the zzso present in the two zzso zzso zzso zzso The extreme zzso of the cloned zzso zzso zzso displays features of a potential zzso transit zzso In zzso trees constructed to compare the evolutionary relationships between the different single zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence forms a zzso together with the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso well separating from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso found in zzso of many zzso and some higher zzso
