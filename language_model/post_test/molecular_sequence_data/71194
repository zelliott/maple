The zzso position of the zzso zzso zzso is near the base of the kingdom zzso During the last few years, not only zzso sequences but, more importantly, zzso that code for proteins have been isolated and characterized from zzso in particular from the marine zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences of these proteins allowed a molecular biological approach to the question of the zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as prominent examples, and of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso elements of sensory systems zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of an immune system zzso zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso and short consensus repeats zzso zzso the zzso as true zzso As living zzso provided with simple, primordial molecules allowing zzso and zzso zzso as well as processes of signal zzso as known in a more complex manner from higher zzso sponges also show zzso not known in later zzso In this paper, the zzso molecules presumably involved in the sponge immune system are zzso these are the basic zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso and especially the highly zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso and short consensus repeats zzso zzso In addition, it is reported that in the model sponge system of zzso zzso zzso rejection involves an zzso of zzso zzso an zzso initiating the zzso to zzso zzso
