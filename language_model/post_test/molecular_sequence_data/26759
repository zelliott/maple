zzso of the molecular basis of plant resistance to pathogens in species other than zzso is zzso The function of zzso zzso the first zzso gene isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso an important zzso fruit crop, has been investigated zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso factor and is zzso in zzso following zzso zzso infection, treatments with zzso and zzso Its zzso sequence zzso At zzso has been described as playing a role in regulating zzso zzso zzso However, using zzso zzso zzso a role for the At zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso resistance in zzso is zzso At zzso zzso are more susceptible to virulent and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in At zzso zzso and wild type reverts the enhanced susceptible zzso of the zzso and even increases resistance to zzso strains of zzso zzso The resistance zzso is zzso to zzso zzso gene zzso but it is associated with a strong zzso burst and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that At zzso and zzso zzso act as positive regulators of zzso during compatible and incompatible interactions in zzso and, very zzso zzso zzso is an important element zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, these results provide evidence that zzso can be a useful model for functional studies in zzso species like zzso
