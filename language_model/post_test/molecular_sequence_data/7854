Recent studies have documented incomplete zzso V zzso zzso exclusion and dual V zzso T zzso zzso we show that V beta zzso exclusion is also incomplete, since a significant proportion of peripheral T cells express dual V beta in both zzso transgenic and normal zzso Studies in zzso transgenic mice indicated that although a small proportion of T cells escaped zzso exclusion in the zzso dual V zzso cells expanded dramatically in the periphery with age, and such expanded cells had an activated zzso Although not as zzso age-related increases in dual V zzso cells were also observed in normal zzso These findings may have important implications for zzso selection and zzso age-related repertoire changes, and zzso disease zzso
