zzso cell proliferation is one of the pathological bases of zzso arthritis zzso Several zzso including zzso and zzso and growth factors have been shown to be involved in the zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and acts as a zzso for several cell types through its specific zzso To assess whether zzso is involved in zzso of zzso zzso cells, we measured the concentration of zzso III zzso complex zzso in zzso fluid obtained from patients with zzso or zzso zzso We also examined the effect of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on cell growth of zzso cell clones zzso established from an zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso fluid from patients with zzso were significantly higher than in those with zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso enhanced proliferation of zzso cells in zzso We also characterized the expression of zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso The expression of zzso for zzso zzso was zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected on both zzso and zzso tissue from zzso patients by zzso using a zzso zzso against zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso may act as a zzso for zzso cells through zzso zzso and may play some role in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
