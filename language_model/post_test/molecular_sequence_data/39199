The mechanism of inheritance of the zzso complex is an important problem in cell zzso In this study, we examine the zzso and function of a zzso protein zzso by zzso beautiful sister zzso during zzso in zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso domain that is 57% identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso a dramatic zzso during zzso from the zzso to an association with zzso from late zzso to early zzso by a transport mechanism that requires the zzso domain and zzso the product of the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso remains independent of the zzso zzso throughout zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso expression of the zzso domain, shows that cycling of zzso during zzso is required for the zzso zzso The effects on the zzso cycle depend on zzso concentration and zzso transport from the zzso to zzso When zzso levels are reduced zzso fail to mature, and when zzso transport is zzso by zzso expression of the zzso domain, zzso undergo zzso We propose that, zzso is a zzso protein that links zzso inheritance to the cell cycle and the zzso zzso is more zzso than previously zzso
