Our studies in zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso injury of isolated cardiac zzso requires the presence of zzso on the surface of the zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso In zzso cardiac zzso there is rapid appearance of zzso activity during the first hours of zzso zzso activity is present throughout the first 72 h of zzso and is sufficient to induce zzso on the surface of the cardiac zzso In zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso is found in viable zzso cells on the edge of the zzso zzso within 1 h of zzso zzso protein expression on cardiac zzso is seen after 6 h of zzso and increases zzso zzso tissue demonstrates no early induction of zzso zzso or zzso protein on zzso zzso In our most recent experiments, we have determined that zzso is an absolute requirement for the early induction of zzso zzso zzso in previously zzso zzso zzso To further assess this, we have cloned and zzso a canine zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that early induction of zzso zzso is also zzso dependent as it could be demonstrated in the same zzso and zzso segments in which zzso zzso was zzso Peak expression of zzso zzso occurred much earlier than that for zzso zzso Similar experiments were then performed with a molecular probe for zzso zzso This zzso is a potent zzso stimulant and has a higher degree of specificity for zzso than classic zzso such as zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
