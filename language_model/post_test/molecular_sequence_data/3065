Although chronic zzso is associated with risk factors such as alcoholism, zzso and zzso little is known of the actual zzso of the zzso It is thought that inappropriate zzso of zzso causes zzso and indeed in cases of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso As zzso zzso inhibitor zzso type 1 zzso is a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic zzso activity, we zzso that zzso zzso would be more common than expected among an zzso cohort of adult chronic zzso zzso 

To detect the prevalence of zzso zzso in a cohort of chronic zzso zzso 

DNA was isolated from a cohort of 115 adult patients with chronic zzso of alcoholic zzso zzso zzso idiopathic zzso and zzso zzso zzso We performed zzso analysis for two zzso zzso zzso zzso and four specific zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared the results with a control group of 120 healthy Dutch zzso 

In six of the 10 patients that fulfilled the criteria for zzso zzso but in none of the control subjects, zzso in the zzso gene were zzso In 14 patients we detected a zzso zzso Eleven patients were zzso for the zzso zzso and sequencing confirmed the zzso state of zzso in a brother and zzso Two patients carried the zzso zzso one as a compound zzso with zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not found in our zzso The zzso zzso was detected in only two of 120 controls, while the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were absent in the same zzso Patients with the zzso zzso had a later onset of disease than those with zzso gene zzso but earlier onset compared with the zzso negative zzso 

Identification of zzso zzso in zzso of patients with adult alcoholic and idiopathic chronic zzso suggests an important role for zzso as a zzso factor in adult chronic zzso
