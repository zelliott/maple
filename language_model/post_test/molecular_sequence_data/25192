The zzso gene copy number, determined by zzso zzso analysis of human zzso DNA, is approximately zzso These studies, using several zzso and DNA zzso with several restriction zzso zzso or in zzso show that most of these zzso genes are flanked by DNA of very similar sequence for at least 5 zzso This conclusion is supported by the close similarity of the restriction maps of two zzso zzso zzso of human zzso DNA containing two different zzso zzso
