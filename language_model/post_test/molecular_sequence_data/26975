zzso have reduced zzso that reflect their zzso zzso zzso Despite their different tissue zzso zzso strains share a large number of common genes and have few recognized zzso indicating zzso zzso All of the zzso have zzso of the zzso gene cluster that encodes a functional zzso exchange system in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso strains have a nonsense zzso in their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A and B strains have zzso zzso in their zzso zzso suggesting that relaxed selection may have enabled the evolution of zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed to determine whether the zzso genes from zzso zzso strains were zzso and zzso was used to identify zzso zzso that prevent protein maturation and zzso zzso evolution techniques were applied to determine the relaxation of selection and the scope of zzso gene zzso in the zzso 

The zzso genes were zzso in zzso zzso zzso during the zzso stage of cellular zzso However, a stop zzso in the zzso gene from this strain prevented the zzso production of an active zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso with its ancestral zzso zzso rescued the activity of this zzso zzso The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed as a zzso that failed to cleave and form the zzso zzso zzso This inactive protein could be rescued by replacing the zzso zzso with an ancestral zzso zzso The zzso gene from the zzso strain zzso an active zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso was unexpectedly zzso Yet the zzso of zzso versus synonymous zzso zzso show no signs of relaxed selection, consistent with the recent zzso of these zzso 

The zzso of the zzso had a functional zzso exchange system that is zzso through independent, parallel processes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso metabolism among zzso species may be partly associated with their tissue zzso possibly due to the protection zzso by a functional zzso exchange system against host zzso oxide production and innate zzso The independent loss of zzso activity in all zzso zzso zzso strains indicates continual gene zzso and illustrates the difficulty of recognizing recent bacterial zzso from sequence comparison, zzso profiling or the analysis of zzso substitution zzso
