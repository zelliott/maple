zzso zzso degradation of zzso and zzso within the gut of rats and rabbits was compared using zzso zzso zzso of differential zzso of these two peptides within the zzso were similar within the same species and between the zzso In both rats and zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest zzso activities degrading zzso and zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso had the lowest zzso In both species, patterns of zzso degradation of zzso and zzso agreed with the distribution profiles of zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso The zzso zzso of rats and rabbits has the lowest activities degrading these two zzso The results demonstrate that distribution of zzso within the gut will affect zzso degradation and zzso of zzso zzso
