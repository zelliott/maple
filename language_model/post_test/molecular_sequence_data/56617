The gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found to be part of a temperate zzso with a total size of zzso zzso We have investigated several DNA fragments of this zzso for zzso zzso For zzso integration, the zzso zzso cohesive zzso ends zzso associate with host DNA of strain zzso The zzso ends and the zzso gene are found on a zzso zzso zzso zzso B and are included in the 11 zzso zzso zzso A and the zzso zzso zzso zzso B of the zzso zzso The zzso ends are 20 zzso long and are located at zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso initiation zzso The zzso attachment zzso site is also present on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso site consists of 34 zzso and is located at zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene start zzso zzso of the zzso form of the zzso is increased at 37 degrees C compared to that at 30 degrees C, while zzso production in infected cells is similar at 30 degrees C and 37 degrees zzso It can be concluded, therefore, that the integrated form of the zzso gene is responsible for zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso showed ten proteins in zzso zzso zzso however, zzso could not be detected on Western blots using an zzso zzso zzso
