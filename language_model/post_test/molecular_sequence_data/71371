zzso zzso crucial for zzso requires zzso zzso yet the molecular mechanisms by which localized zzso zzso is zzso are not zzso Here we report the characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso originally isolated from human blood zzso and likely to be involved in the zzso zzso occurring during zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso by zzso affinity zzso and is zzso from zzso affinity columns and extracted from cells with zzso Its presence at the leading edge of zzso spread on glass and in the zzso of zzso zzso suggests a role in zzso zzso Using zzso to obtain clues about function, we stained the sensory zzso of the embryonic inner ear to determine whether zzso is at the barbed end of zzso filaments during their zzso Indeed, zzso was present at the tips of the zzso zzso zzso is novel by DNA sequence and has no identifiable structural zzso Its unusual zzso acid zzso its zzso zzso association and its location at sites of zzso zzso in cells suggest zzso plays a unique role in the zzso zzso that accompany zzso zzso and zzso zzso
