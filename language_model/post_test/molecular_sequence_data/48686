zzso gene zzso containing two or more genes zzso different zzso for the same pathway, are sometimes observed in plant zzso most often when the genes specify the synthesis of specialized defensive zzso Here, we show that a cluster of genes in tomato zzso zzso zzso contains genes for zzso zzso zzso that specify the synthesis of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso that are zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso genes also located within the same zzso The zzso zzso genes in the cluster likely evolved from a zzso zzso gene in the cluster by zzso and zzso In the zzso cluster in zzso zzso a new zzso zzso gene was created by a zzso event of a zzso zzso followed by a localized gene conversion event directed by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes in the zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso zzso are closely related to a tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso uses the zzso zzso zzso which is made from the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene cluster also contains an zzso of zzso but it appears to zzso a zzso zzso Thus, the zzso functional gene cluster evolved by zzso and divergence of zzso zzso together with zzso in zzso specificity to zzso zzso zzso and through the acquisition of zzso zzso
