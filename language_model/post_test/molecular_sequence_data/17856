A DNA zzso zzso to the zzso gene of zzso region 2, was identified on zzso region zzso This sequence is designated zzso It differs from the zzso gene in containing two deletions and a stop zzso The zzso sequence therefore can only zzso a truncated zzso zzso The zzso protein may be a DNA binding protein and functions as a positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso A regulatory function for the zzso is not likely since deletion of the zzso sequence does not affect production of zzso zzso in zzso coli K-12 zzso That the zzso sequence is present on zzso zzso plasmids isolated from zzso strains of different zzso obtained at various geographical locations, suggests, however, that this DNA region is not completely without a zzso
