zzso the topographical orientation of zzso zzso zzso in the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso is of utmost importance for studying the regulation of zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso This was practically impossible due to the zzso of a suitable zzso Recent studies on the specific interaction between a zzso zzso and zzso provided an insight to develop a zzso zzso to zzso which could recognize the zzso complex in order to detect zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We report zzso the successful production of a zzso zzso to zzso The zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and is specific for zzso when analyzed by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso recognizes with equal potency both the native zzso and also mild zzso zzso from which zzso fatty zzso zzso acid has been zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso partially reduced the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, exposure of zzso zzso cells to zzso followed by the zzso zzso to zzso followed zzso by zzso with zzso goat zzso zzso and examination under a fluorescent microscope gives intense zzso at the zzso region of the cell with a structure reminiscent of the zzso
