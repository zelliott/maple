zzso E is an important regulatory zzso that plays a key role in zzso processing and degradation in zzso zzso Internal zzso by this zzso is accelerated by the presence of a zzso at the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the preference of zzso coli zzso E for zzso zzso is an intrinsic property of the zzso active zzso half of the zzso and does not require the zzso zzso This property is shared by the related zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso E zzso derived from zzso indicating that the zzso dependence of zzso E is a general characteristic of members of this zzso family, including those from zzso distant zzso Although it is zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso half of zzso E significantly enhances the ability of this zzso to zzso its synthesis in zzso zzso Despite similarities in zzso acid sequence and zzso zzso zzso is unable to replace zzso E in sustaining zzso coli cell growth or in regulating zzso E production, even when zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso E zzso
