zzso B zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso in zzso the zzso zzso or zzso zzso from peptides and synthetic zzso zzso B was shown to have a consensus sequence found in the zzso zzso We determined the putative zinc binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the essential zzso zzso for the zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso 339, zzso To identify the zzso binding to the zzso basic zzso acid of the zzso rat zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso so that zzso protein was expressed as a zzso fusion zzso Twelve zzso zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso in zzso were replaced with a zzso or zzso using zzso zzso These zzso were isolated to characterize the kinetic parameters of zzso activity toward zzso and compare them to those of the zzso zzso The zzso efficiency zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly decreased compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The replacement of zzso with an zzso zzso resulted in the change of zzso specificity such that the specific activity of the zzso zzso toward zzso was twice that toward zzso (in the case of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, when zzso was replaced with an Ala zzso the zzso ratio was zzso lower than that of the zzso zzso for zzso of zzso in contrast, in the zzso of zzso the zzso ratios of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, the replacement of zzso with a zzso zzso led to the reduction of the zzso ratio for the zzso of zzso by a factor of 6 and an increase of that for the zzso of zzso Then the zzso ratio of the zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso was higher than that for the zzso of zzso as opposed to that of zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that the zzso 405 zzso is involved in zzso binding via an interaction with the zzso zzso group of the zzso side zzso
