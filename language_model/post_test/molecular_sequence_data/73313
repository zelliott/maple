The zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso gene section, which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso sequence presented here includes zzso N of zzso zzso DNA, zzso N of transcribed DNA, and 465 N of 3' zzso zzso The zzso boundaries mapped by comparison of these sequences were confirmed by primer extension and zzso zzso zzso Prior work showed that the zzso produced by this gene is regulated both temporally and zzso during zzso zzso and adult development, and also showed that both zzso zzso and juvenile hormone zzso are important in controlling the amount of zzso present in the zzso zzso et zzso zzso In zzso zzso show that zzso is expressed throughout the zzso in larvae and is zzso restricted in zzso zzso and zzso adult zzso The results presented here zzso the zzso unit and zzso zzso DNA of the zzso gene will facilitate further research to determine the DNA elements necessary for regulation of gene zzso
