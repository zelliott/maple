zzso markers for a complementary DNA zzso map of the mouse zzso should be zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso and they should be zzso for genetic zzso as well as unique for physical zzso In our search for such zzso we did comparative sequencing of zzso zzso zzso derived from 15 zzso strains and found that about 250 zzso of the zzso region zzso of zzso which is the sequence immediately upstream from the zzso tail, was zzso enough to distinguish the zzso of a laboratory strain from that of a wild strain zzso zzso in 14 of 22 zzso zzso Specifically, in 9 of these 14 zzso each zzso was identified by the restriction zzso length zzso This data indicates that about zzso of the zzso of zzso can be automatically transformed into zzso genetic markers named zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso These markers can be easily and precisely mapped by typing of the panels of zzso zzso Because a large number of zzso markers can be efficiently obtained by a zzso automated sequencing of randomly selected zzso these markers will greatly facilitate the construction of high-resolution genetic and physical maps of expressed sequences of the mouse zzso
