zzso is an integral membrane protein of synaptic zzso characterized by four zzso zzso with both zzso facing the zzso Although zzso has been implicated in neurotransmitter release, and decreased zzso levels have been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular mechanism that regulates the degradation of zzso remains zzso Using the zzso C zzso of zzso as bait in a zzso zzso screen, we identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are rat zzso of zzso Seven in zzso We demonstrated that zzso and zzso associate with zzso both in zzso and in zzso and defined the binding zzso of zzso and zzso that mediate their zzso zzso proteins exist in both zzso and zzso pools and zzso with zzso on synaptic zzso and early zzso In addition, zzso proteins interact specifically with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and facilitate the zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso proteins promotes the degradation of zzso via the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso proteins function as zzso zzso zzso to regulate the zzso and degradation of zzso
