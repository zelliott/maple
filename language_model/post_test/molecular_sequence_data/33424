zzso zzso zzso encodes two zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was separately zzso by two zzso zzso and zzso which share only zzso similarity and display different zzso capacities and zzso zzso was zzso more zzso at zzso zzso with zzso while zzso more efficiently zzso the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso was not zzso by either zzso but instead by the combined activity of zzso and zzso which recognized sequence elements absent from zzso zzso were found to contain zzso consistent with its role in translation, but not zzso suggesting a function outside protein zzso zzso of the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso is dependent on zzso recognition of the zzso zzso and the role of zzso in this process was zzso zzso of zzso led to up to a 50 fold drop in zzso zzso which resulted in the loss of differential regulation of the zzso and zzso genes in stationary zzso These findings reveal that zzso interactions with a zzso zzso can be confined to processes outside translation, suggesting a means by which such zzso may evolve zzso zzso
