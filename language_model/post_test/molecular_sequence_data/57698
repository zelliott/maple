zzso is composed of alternating zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a zzso for a zzso zzso cell surface zzso expressed on fetal bovine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To explore the possibility that zzso contains additional zzso zzso for this zzso zzso we have constructed two deletion proteins that are expressed in zzso coli and lack the repeated zzso zzso These proteins supported bovine zzso attachment zzso the presence of a zzso binding zzso zzso using synthetic peptides contained within these proteins identify a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso for the bovine zzso zzso
