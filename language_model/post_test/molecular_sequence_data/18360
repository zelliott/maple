zzso analyses of zzso show that the zzso zzso mediates zzso with other zzso molecules or with the zzso protein and determines the three-dimensional orientation of the adjacent basic region, zzso interaction with zzso The basic region of zzso is the DNA contact zzso zzso of certain basic zzso in this region leads to loss of DNA zzso Some basic region zzso also act as zzso zzso they are able to tie up wild type protein in inactive zzso The definition of zzso zzso with deletion zzso of zzso appears to depend on the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest multiple zzso regions in the zzso third of zzso while in zzso zzso zzso detect a negative regulator of zzso in this zzso Another zzso domain appears to be located close to the basic region in both zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso supports a zzso order of zzso functions in which zzso is a prerequisite for both DNA binding and zzso zzso and DNA binding is needed for zzso zzso
