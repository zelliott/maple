The zzso of marine sponge zzso zzso a member of the most ancient and most simple zzso zzso zzso encodes at least five genes for zzso zzso more than, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were fully zzso The overall zzso zzso among the three zzso zzso zzso zzso is much lower than the sequence conservation between zzso zzso proteins from freshwater sponges zzso It is therefore very likely that several zzso zzso were already present in the zzso of zzso the hypothetical zzso zzso We have identified in the zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso database further zzso zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso zzso that are unrelated to protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from different species are much more zzso than zzso and zzso zzso from different proteins in the same zzso zzso zzso supporting the view that the common, ancestral zzso gene was already a zzso protein composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso genes were fully zzso zzso gene has six and zzso gene only one zzso in front of zzso domain, located at the same position in both zzso All zzso zzso zzso from fish to human, originated from the same ancestral zzso because they all have 10 zzso at zzso zzso However, zzso genes in zzso have fewer zzso that are located at different zzso Only the zzso in front of the zzso domain is present at the absolutely zzso position (and zzso in all known zzso zzso indicating that at least this zzso was already present in the ancestral zzso common to all zzso Our results also suggest that zzso domain in this ancestral zzso was zzso on a single zzso
