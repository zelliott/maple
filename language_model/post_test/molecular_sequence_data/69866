zzso zzso recognize specific sequences of zzso and cleave at a specific zzso In this study, we designed zzso zzso with a zzso stable loop of the sequence zzso to prevent the zzso of zzso with zzso zzso The zzso activities of these zzso were examined using a synthetic zzso with the sequence for the zzso zzso zzso at zzso 12 zzso For in zzso studies, we constructed a zzso which expressed a highly active zzso targeted against the zzso zzso zzso When this zzso gene and the activated zzso gene were zzso into zzso cells, zzso normal cells were zzso We also determined that the expression of the zzso gene was inhibited in these zzso These results show that zzso containing this stable hairpin loop are useful for the regulation of specific gene expression in zzso
