zzso zzso was extracted from plasma samples collected from five individuals during the period of zzso before zzso in primary infection with human zzso virus type 1 zzso and amplified by zzso chain zzso zzso sequence analysis of amplified DNA from the zzso and zzso zzso regions indicated that the initial virus population of each acutely infected individual was completely homogeneous in zzso No zzso zzso was found among the zzso zzso zzso in this region of zzso contrasting with the high degree of zzso normally found in zzso zzso Paradoxically, substantial sequence zzso was found in the normally high zzso gag gene zzso zzso in most of the zzso zzso The diversity of zzso sequences in samples that were homogeneous in zzso and zzso can most readily be explained by the existence of strong selection for specific zzso sequences either upon transmission or in the zzso between exposure and zzso in the exposed zzso Evidence that zzso the selected region upon transmission to zzso is provided by the similarity or identity of zzso loop sequences in five individuals with zzso unrelated zzso infections, while regions zzso the zzso loop and the zzso zzso region were highly zzso The actual zzso sequences were similar to those associated with zzso zzso in primary zzso of zzso irrespective of whether infection was acquired by sexual contact or zzso through zzso of contaminated factor zzso zzso DNA sequences in peripheral blood zzso cells remained homogeneous in the zzso and zzso regions (and variable in zzso for several months after zzso The persistence of zzso sequences in peripheral blood zzso cells identical to those found at primary infection in the absence of continued virus expression provides an explanation for the previously observed differences in the composition of circulating DNA and zzso populations in sequential samples from zzso zzso
