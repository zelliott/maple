zzso zzso tracking proteins zzso are structurally and functionally diverse factors that accumulate at the growing zzso zzso connect them to various cellular structures, and control zzso dynamics zzso zzso zzso and its zzso are zzso that can autonomously recognize growing zzso ends and recruit to them a variety of other zzso Numerous zzso bind to end binding zzso proteins through zzso zzso basic and zzso zzso regions containing a core zzso motif zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso consensus sequence is short, and the surrounding sequences show high zzso raising the possibility that undiscovered zzso containing zzso are zzso in zzso zzso Here, we performed a zzso search for zzso zzso zzso by combining zzso and zzso zzso We have identified a set of previously zzso zzso partners that have the capacity to accumulate at the growing zzso ends, including protein zzso a small zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that one of the newly identified zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso at the zzso and is required for zzso Our study reveals the complexity of the zzso zzso zzso and provides a basis for investigating the molecular zzso between zzso ends and other cellular zzso
