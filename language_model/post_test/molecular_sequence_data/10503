Comparative molecular modeling was performed with zzso protein zzso of the temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso using the known zzso of related zzso in order to obtain zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso presumed to stabilize a zzso but structurally zzso zzso pocket, which was shown to be important for zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Of the derivatives that exhibited various zzso zzso one was shown to hold promise for both fundamental and industrial applications that require the controlled production of zzso proteins in zzso zzso
