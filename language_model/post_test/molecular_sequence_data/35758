As a result of multiple zzso initiation sites and differential zzso involving the first zzso and alternate zzso use, many zzso growth factor I zzso zzso species are zzso In the present study, we have assessed the effect of zzso on zzso start site usage and zzso and have determined the apparent in zzso zzso of zzso zzso with different zzso region zzso sequences by comparing their abundance in total and zzso zzso zzso from control, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the level of all zzso zzso species, but those initiated at start site 3 in zzso 1 and the major start site in zzso 2 were zzso zzso These same zzso were zzso increased by zzso zzso Under all conditions, zzso 1 zzso with shorter zzso sequences were enriched in zzso zzso at the expense of zzso zzso with long zzso zzso in accordance with the scanning model of translation zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, which have short zzso zzso were not enriched on zzso suggesting that some aspect of the zzso zzso zzso other than length influences translation in zzso These results demonstrate that zzso within zzso 1 and between zzso 1 and 2 is zzso regulated by zzso status and that the zzso zzso zzso species resulting from the complex patterns of zzso initiation and zzso in these leader zzso are zzso translated in zzso
