To develop an attenuated vaccine against the highly zzso zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome zzso virus, the zzso virus strain zzso was attenuated by serial passages and plaque cloned every 5 to 10 passages in zzso zzso zzso variation and zzso of zzso strain zzso in the course of zzso were zzso The results showed that the strain zzso sustained various sequence changes during the course of zzso zzso zzso acids changes and a new continuous 120 zzso acids deletion after the zzso 30 zzso acids deletion zzso zzso and zzso occurred in strain zzso passages zzso and the position of 120 zzso acids deletion was between 628 to zzso according to zzso Animal test showed that the zzso of strain zzso passages 20 was attenuated obviously, so we zzso that genetic variation in zzso protein zzso zzso and structural protein zzso during the zzso provides the molecular bases for the observed attenuated zzso
