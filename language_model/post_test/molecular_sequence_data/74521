zzso zzso transfer protein zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to compare the difference in the zzso zzso gene zzso and its association with serum zzso levels between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Han zzso 

A total of zzso subjects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso participants of Han Chinese were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was performed using zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso length zzso and then confirmed using direct zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso were significant differences between smokers and nonsmokers, or between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and between drinkers and zzso in zzso The levels of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not in Han were higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Higher zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso were found only in zzso zzso nonsmokers, subjects with a body mass index of 24 zzso or zzso or zzso in zzso zzso Higher zzso levels in Han were found only in females in zzso zzso and in subjects with a body mass index of 24 zzso or lesser or zzso in zzso zzso The levels of zzso in zzso and zzso individuals in both ethnic groups were higher in drinkers than in zzso 

There were significant differences in the interactions between the zzso zzso zzso and several environmental factors in the zzso zzso zzso and Han zzso The zzso predicted differences in zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso but not in the Han Chinese, even after adjustment for zzso zzso This means that the gene may not be truly involved in regulation of zzso zzso metabolism or that there is an zzso zzso
