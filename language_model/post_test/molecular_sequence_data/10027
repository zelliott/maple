The expression of zzso zzso genes depends on zzso elements in the promoter and zzso regions of light chain and heavy chain zzso In contrast to the complex modular character of zzso zzso the promoters appear to be simple, depending primarily on a zzso zzso box and zzso zzso We have analyzed the role of zzso sequences for zzso promoter zzso zzso promoter zzso critically depends on zzso sequences and on a downstream element located at zzso to zzso relative to the start zzso Replacement of these sequences resulted in strong reduction of promoter zzso In zzso these elements were found to be more effective in extracts of zzso than of zzso zzso zzso of the downstream and initiation site regions had a comparable effect on promoter activity to obliteration of the zzso box or zzso zzso The downstream sequence was bound by two nuclear zzso identical to the previously identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso is found in zzso cells and in zzso cells, zzso is zzso zzso Thus, further specific sequences in addition to the previously characterized zzso the zzso and the zzso box, are required for efficient zzso promoter expression in B zzso
