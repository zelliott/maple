zzso zzso in zzso zzso is expressed in the sensory ray cells and determines the ray identity zzso zzso 221 (2001) zzso Similarly, zzso zzso of this gene have been shown to express in the zzso zzso limb bud and neural zzso We report here the cloning and expression analysis of two zzso zzso zzso Both genes have a zzso open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the two family zzso existed prior to the divergence of zzso Their expression profiles revealed that zzso was turned on in zzso as early as 8 h zzso zzso while zzso was first detected at around 11 zzso In zzso zzso results showed that expression of these zzso genes marked the early zzso zzso bulbs, eye zzso zzso and subsequently the zzso zzso and neural zzso
