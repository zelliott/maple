A recently described three-dimensional structure of the zzso provides a sense of remarkable diversity of zzso zzso We have designed a new class of scaffold for artificial zzso in which a short zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso region form a stable and specific zzso The zzso zzso region was placed next to the zzso Rev response element to enable the formation of zzso pools in the presence of the Rev zzso In zzso selection of zzso zzso from the zzso pool afforded a zzso zzso specific for zzso The zzso zzso did not share the known consensus zzso sequence for zzso zzso and completely lost its zzso ability in the absence of the Rev zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was increased by a substitution of the zzso zzso acid of the Rev zzso These results demonstrate directly that the zzso is incorporated in the functional structure of zzso and suggest that zzso acids outside the zzso region of the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso Our approach would provide an alternative strategy for the design of zzso zzso receptors and zzso
