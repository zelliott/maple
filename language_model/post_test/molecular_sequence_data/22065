The classic role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is to adapt metabolism to environmental conditions such as nutrition, energy, and zzso During pea zzso zzso seed zzso zzso programs of growing zzso are adjusted to changing zzso and zzso zzso To understand regulation of the switch from cell proliferation to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in pea zzso zzso seeds show maturation zzso reduced conversion of zzso into storage products, lower zzso content, frequently altered zzso surface, shape, and zzso as well as occasional precocious zzso Gene expression analysis of zzso using zzso of zzso zzso genes revealed 183 zzso expressed genes in two zzso either delayed zzso or delayed zzso during zzso Delayed zzso genes are related to zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso stress response, and zzso signal zzso This specifies a zzso younger status and conditional zzso Higher gene expression related to zzso is consistent with a role of zzso in zzso zzso processes in maturing zzso under low zzso zzso Delayed zzso genes are mainly related to storage protein synthesis and stress zzso Most of the zzso resembles zzso acid zzso zzso and may be explained by reduced zzso zzso This may cause a reduction in zzso functions and/or a zzso between zzso and zzso signals, suggesting that zzso is a zzso of zzso functions during pea seed zzso zzso repression also zzso gene expression associated with zzso independent from zzso functions, like regulation and signaling of zzso events, zzso zzso cell wall zzso zzso activity of zzso and regulated zzso
