Many zzso important peptides are zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso templates consist of zzso zzso that, in their number and organization, determine the primary structure of the corresponding zzso zzso At the core of each module is an zzso domain that recognizes the zzso zzso and activates it as its zzso zzso Recently, the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso was solved with zzso and zzso illustrating the structural basis for zzso zzso 

By comparing the zzso that line the zzso pocket in zzso with the corresponding zzso in other zzso zzso general rules for zzso zzso specificity were zzso We tested these in zzso zzso by mutating zzso zzso within zzso The zzso specificity of most zzso was altered or zzso zzso of the selectivity zzso also allowed the targeted specificity switch of an zzso zzso domain, the crystal structure of which has not yet been zzso by introducing a single zzso 

In zzso studies and zzso zzso have defined general rules for the structural basis of zzso recognition in zzso zzso of zzso These rules can be used to rationally alter the specificity of zzso zzso and to predict from the primary sequence the specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Such efforts could enhance the structural diversity of zzso antibiotics such as zzso zzso and zzso by allowing synthesis of zzso natural zzso
