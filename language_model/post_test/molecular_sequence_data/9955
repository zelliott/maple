zzso analysis of the zzso zzso major zzso factor zzso shows that it is highly zzso which may be related to the marked diversity of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the rate of divergence of zzso among other zzso bacteria is much greater than that among zzso zzso This suggests that zzso from zzso bacteria is functionally less constrained than that from zzso zzso
