An alcohol zzso was shown to be induced in zzso zzso by periods of zzso zzso This alcohol zzso was shown to zzso to the previously described cryptic zzso alcohol zzso III zzso et zzso zzso by analysis of a zzso in the structural gene of alcohol zzso III, zzso created by gene zzso Survival tests on zzso plates showed that this zzso is required for long-term survival under zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and gene fusion studies showed that the expression of the zzso gene is regulated at both the zzso and zzso zzso Thus there are mechanisms in this zzso fungus allowing survival under zzso stress that are similar to those described in higher zzso
