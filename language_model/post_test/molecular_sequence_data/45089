zzso zzso zzso is responsible for repair of zzso sites, and zzso DNA breaks with 3' blocking groups that are generated either spontaneously or during repair of damaged or abnormal bases via the DNA base zzso repair zzso zzso in both nucleus and zzso zzso cells express only one nuclear zzso 36 zzso zzso which is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso other than zzso have been zzso In order to identify and characterize zzso we zzso the zzso activity from beef liver zzso to near zzso and showed that the zzso which has zzso higher specific activity relative to zzso is derived from the latter with deletion of 33 zzso zzso which contain the nuclear zzso zzso The zzso product could be generated by zzso zzso zzso with crude zzso zzso but not with zzso or nuclear zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for zzso zzso The low abundance of zzso particularly in cultured cells might be the reason for its earlier lack of detection by western zzso
