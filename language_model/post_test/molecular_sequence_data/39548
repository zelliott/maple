zzso protein 3 zzso a member of the vascular zzso growth factor family, was shown to play an important role in regulating zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso promoter activity, reporter zzso were prepared and zzso analysis carried zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso of zzso by zzso a zzso zzso increased the extent of zzso The repression by zzso was lost in zzso plasmids having a deleted or zzso zzso binding site zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso had no effect on zzso promoter zzso zzso did not repress the activity of zzso which activates of zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso of zzso completely abolished the repression of zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso binding enhanced the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso shift zzso also indicated that zzso zzso binding increased zzso of zzso binding to a zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso restored the binding lost by addition of zzso zzso these results suggest that the binding of zzso zzso enhances the affinity between zzso and activated zzso and thus may regulate zzso gene expression through a zzso element by competing with zzso for zzso
