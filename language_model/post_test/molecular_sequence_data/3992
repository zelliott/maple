We investigated the molecular zzso of the zzso gene in a Japanese patient with zzso zzso zzso and identified a novel 16 base pair zzso deletion within zzso zzso This deletion resulted in a zzso zzso and created a premature stop zzso at zzso acid position zzso The same molecular zzso was also identified in his mother and a brother who had symptomatic zzso but not in his father who was zzso The subjects with zzso were zzso for the low expression zzso while his father was zzso for this zzso These results indicate that the combination of a 16 base pair deletion and low expression of the zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso in this zzso
