zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso major zzso complex class I zzso allowed the identification of the zzso of zzso designated zzso zzso of zzso with earlier published human and zzso zzso demonstrated that these sequences share a high degree of zzso both at the zzso and zzso acid level, whereas a New World monkey zzso zzso equivalent is more zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso one of the zzso zzso is absent for all zzso zzso zzso sequences analyzed so zzso In contrast to the human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene seems to have accumulated far more zzso than synonymous zzso
