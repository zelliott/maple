The human, zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are highly zzso in sequence and organization and exhibit strict B zzso zzso In the human and rat zzso the zzso gene is located between the skeletal zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso gene and the zzso growth hormone zzso zzso The human zzso zzso gene is controlled by a zzso locus control region zzso located just upstream of the zzso promoter that mediates zzso enhancement, zzso zzso and an open zzso zzso across the zzso gene in growth hormone zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso is not detected in a zzso zzso cell line and that zzso zzso is not detected in B zzso This differential expression suggests that the zzso gene is insulated or otherwise protected from the regulatory influences of the closely zzso zzso zzso We searched available sequences upstream of the human, zzso and rat zzso genes and found a highly zzso sequence that fulfills the criteria recently established for zzso DNA elements potentially involved in gene zzso This zzso zzso sequence zzso bound zzso expressed nuclear protein zzso zzso I protection analysis of the zzso revealed a central zzso core which was confirmed to bind the zzso zzso factor, zzso However, neither the zzso nor the zzso core motif exhibited zzso or zzso activity in transient zzso or zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso may function as a zzso zzso or zzso zzso specifically countering the influences of the zzso zzso zzso and controlling zzso gene zzso
