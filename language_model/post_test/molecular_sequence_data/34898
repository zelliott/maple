The regional zzso of zzso bacterial community composition and diversity was studied by comparative analysis of four large zzso zzso DNA zzso clone libraries from sediments in different regions of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea zzso Gulf, Cretan Sea, and South zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction analysis of zzso clones from the libraries indicate that the zzso richness and zzso was zzso for example, a zzso relationship among screened clones and number of unique restriction patterns when up to 190 clones were screened for each zzso zzso analysis of zzso bacterial zzso zzso sequences from the zzso libraries demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were represented in all four zzso A few clones also grouped with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and candidate division zzso zzso The abundance of sequences affiliated with zzso was higher in libraries from shallow sediments in the zzso Gulf (30 zzso and the Cretan Sea zzso zzso compared to the deeper South zzso station zzso zzso Most sequences in the four zzso libraries clustered with zzso zzso zzso zzso from marine zzso and many of the closest matches were clones from hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso statistics of zzso zzso gene sequences from the four libraries revealed major differences, indicating either a very high richness in the zzso bacterial communities or considerable zzso in bacterial community composition among regions, or zzso
