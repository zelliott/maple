We have established a highly sensitive and specific zzso system zzso with a specific zzso zzso in which an zzso in a given DNA segment is identified by its ability to remain as a mature zzso after zzso The zzso provides us with the isolation of possible zzso rapidly and easily from DNA fragments in zzso regions of more than 300 zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments were partially zzso and subsequently cloned into zzso zzso an zzso zzso we have zzso These zzso were zzso into zzso cells, and zzso zzso transcripts were spliced in the zzso The resulting mature zzso was harvested and amplified by using reverse zzso zzso zzso can be recognized by the sizes of zzso products and cloned into a zzso zzso The zzso provides a direct means of cloning zzso from zzso DNA of more than 300 zzso pairs within a short period of zzso Using this system, we have screened zzso zzso DNA segments derived from human zzso zzso Human zzso zzso may contain genes responsible for human zzso because DNA amplification is observed in several zzso zzso We have successfully identified zzso 2 of the zzso gene and additional transcribed zzso
