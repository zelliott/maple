A hundred strains of zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from zzso pastures on three different soil types and from a sandy zzso under zzso When crossed with zzso coli zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso gained the ability to form zzso on the roots of white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso probe indicated that they had gained zzso zzso The identities of these 11 strains and 4 others derived from earlier work on zzso root zzso bacteria, were determined by zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso zzso Good agreement was obtained between the three methods, and 11 of the strains were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the remaining four strains were related to the zzso zzso reference zzso The existence of several species of zzso zzso in pasture soil, including species for which the normal host plant was zzso is discussed in relation to the fate of symbiotic plasmids from zzso seed zzso It is also suggested that new species should be named for the geographical region from which they are first isolated rather than the host zzso
