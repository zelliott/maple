The zzso by which zzso C virus zzso enters and zzso cells remains zzso zzso the zzso fusion zzso and understanding the early stages of infection may provide new opportunities for improved zzso zzso The zzso envelope zzso zzso is thought to be a class II fusion zzso Class II fusion proteins are exemplified by the E protein of the zzso encephalitis virus zzso and the E1 protein of the zzso Forest virus zzso Analysis of the zzso profiles of four zzso zzso envelope zzso revealed a region with a zzso three-pronged pattern of zzso termed the zzso zzso zzso The primary sequence of the TD region is highly zzso in all zzso zzso strains currently zzso The known fusion zzso zzso of zzso and zzso share the characteristic TD region zzso profile and significant sequence conservation in the TD region was identified in the E and E1 zzso of members of the zzso and zzso families, zzso The zzso TD region peptides have zzso zzso in molecular dynamics zzso simulations, the zzso TD region peptides insert into in a zzso zzso in a similar manner to the zzso fusion zzso and the peptides induce effective mixing of zzso zzso in a zzso fusion zzso Together these results indicate that the highly zzso TD region of the zzso zzso protein is a fusion zzso candidate and may be an important factor in the class II fusion zzso
