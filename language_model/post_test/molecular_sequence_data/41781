We zzso that tension of contracting muscle originates from zzso force experienced by zzso and zzso We suppose that a zzso state of zzso interacts with zzso transferring the stored energy to zzso and that the zzso excited in this way develops around itself electric field which exerts sliding force against charged zzso zzso To explore the idea, first we zzso how electric charges on zzso produce electric field in the zzso direction, and second we zzso examined zzso circumstances around zzso in solution and in muscle fibers by zzso zzso zzso energy zzso In the experiments, zzso zzso which has a long zzso zzso was used as zzso To introduce zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso As zzso with electric charges zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso B that was zzso with various zzso acids or their derivatives was zzso The zzso energy transfer efficiency zzso was estimated from the zzso in the lifetime of zzso The zzso circumstances around zzso were zzso from the zzso zzso When zzso was introduced at zzso of zzso the zzso was found in negative electric zzso zzso binding to the labeled zzso neutralized the electric potential almost zzso zzso bound to zzso seemed to reside in the vicinity of zzso zzso Electric potential around the zzso site was zzso zzso binding to the zzso slightly reduced the zzso In zzso fibers in the rigor state, the zzso site was again found in negative zzso When fibers were transferred from an zzso solution to an active solution, the negative electric potential was neutralized to some zzso The direction of this change could not be explained by detachment of zzso from zzso since the detachment should have given an opposite direction of changes in the electric zzso Thus, this observation may indicate that electric potential characteristic of the active state occurs at zzso zzso
