We have previously identified in zzso cells a novel zzso gene called zzso zzso presents zzso identity with zzso which, so far, was the only protein found to associate with zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated then that zzso interacts in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and promotes zzso assembly and zzso zzso Since all zzso zzso failed in discrimination of both proteins zzso and zzso a zzso fusion protein was used to specifically zzso zzso zzso was distributed over the zzso in zzso zzso with a scattered zzso Overall, our data show that zzso could be a new member of the zzso family involved in the transport of zzso zzso
