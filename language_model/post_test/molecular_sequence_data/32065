The zzso gene of zzso has been demonstrated to be essential for efficient viral replication in many cell zzso Although the zzso protein of zzso zzso virus zzso displays limited zzso to zzso zzso the role of zzso in zzso replication is not zzso We have examined the requirements of zzso for replication of a zzso strain isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In agreement with others, we find that replication of zzso zzso zzso molecular clones in zzso cells is highly zzso zzso attempts to rescue zzso zzso viruses in trans were limited by lack of zzso zzso zzso expression from DNA zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso expression can be increased by zzso of the gene to remove zzso donor and zzso sites as well as improving zzso usage to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso stable zzso expressing zzso zzso do not restore replication levels of zzso zzso zzso However, in such cell lines, zzso zzso rates in replicating zzso viruses are zzso
