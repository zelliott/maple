zzso one of the major components of zzso is zzso in zzso type zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by which the expression of this gene is regulated (with a view to lowering its expression in zzso zzso we zzso zzso fragments covering zzso of the promoter region in an expression zzso containing the zzso gene as reporter, and used these in zzso zzso We show that the zzso upstream of the zzso start contain the elements required for zzso cell specific expression of the reporter zzso This minimal promoter activity appears to be under the control of a zzso element sensitive to zzso located between zzso and zzso zzso from the start of zzso Computer analysis of zzso of the promoter predicted the presence of zzso factor binding sites, including zzso (which may be involved in the response of zzso expression to zzso zzso and steroid zzso Using zzso with or without the zzso sites, we were able to demonstrate that these sites are involved in zzso the zzso promoter zzso Lastly, we identified a region containing blocks of zzso CA repeats, located close to the zzso binding site, which may further influence the zzso activity of zzso
