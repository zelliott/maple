zzso zzso control cell shape by regulating downstream zzso that influence the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso protein similar to human zzso has previously been implicated in zzso zzso We have discovered the role of zzso as a downstream zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso zzso We show that zzso double zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso displayed synthetic zzso zzso zzso and that loss of zzso function suppressed the formation of zzso plasma membrane extensions induced by zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso can bind to zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an zzso protein that acts downstream of zzso signaling in zzso zzso
