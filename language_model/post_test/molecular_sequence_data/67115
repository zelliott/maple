Here zzso zzso and dynamics were investigated in zzso zzso zzso cultures during growth and zzso Cell biology techniques were used to measure cell growth and death in zzso zzso zzso was investigated in zzso using a membrane potential sensor probe coupled with zzso zzso zzso of a zzso gene zzso was evaluated in different zzso zzso zzso appeared as numerous, punctuate zzso in cells at the beginning of the subculture cycle, while interconnected networks were observed in actively growing zzso In zzso cells, giant zzso were associated with dying zzso The release of zzso c from zzso was detected in different growth zzso of cultured zzso Studies on plant cell cultures allowed us to identify zzso and molecular markers of zzso and cell death, and to associate distinct zzso zzso with cells under different zzso zzso
