We previously reported the zzso of zzso in zzso cells, mouse zzso by zzso zzso with zzso This paper describes the zzso of a factor that prevents zzso zzso zzso from chick zzso zzso The zzso factor has a molecular mass of 16 zzso on zzso gel zzso under reducing zzso This factor prevents the zzso zzso in a zzso manner and also binds zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence revealed that 40 zzso coincide with the sequence of chicken liver zzso
