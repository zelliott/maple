The ratio of genetic diversity on X zzso relative to zzso in organisms with zzso sex zzso could provide fundamental insight into the process of zzso zzso Here we report this ratio for 24 zzso monkeys zzso zzso originating in Indonesia, zzso and the zzso The average zzso diversity ratios in these samples was zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, considerably lower than the zzso expectation of zzso A zzso population supposed to derive from an ancestral population by founding events showed a significantly lower ratio than the parental population, suggesting a demographic effect for the zzso Taking zzso zzso rate bias and demographic effect into account, expected zzso diversity ratios generated by computer simulations roughly agreed with the observed data in the zzso zzso In contrast, silent sites in zzso regions on X zzso showed strong reduction in genetic diversity and the observed zzso diversity ratio in the zzso regions cannot be explained by zzso rate bias and zzso indicating that natural selection also reduces the level of zzso near zzso zzso analysis of a female zzso monkey also supported the notion of stronger reduction of genetic diversity near genes on the X zzso
