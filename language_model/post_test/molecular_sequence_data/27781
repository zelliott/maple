Using the zzso zzso a zzso DNA zzso containing the gene for the surface zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence indicated an open reading frame zzso coding for a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular size of 125 zzso zzso A protein of this size which reacted with zzso to the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso was detected in cells of zzso coli containing the zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence indicated a highly zzso zzso region which had the characteristics of a leader zzso The first zzso acid of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso protein followed the predicted zzso site of the leader zzso in the zzso zzso A sequence characteristic of promoters expressed during zzso growth was found within a zzso region upstream from the zzso coding for the zzso zzso This putative promoter may account for the expression of this gene during the zzso growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gene for the zzso protein was followed by an zzso repeat characteristic of zzso zzso from this gene zzso zzso was an zzso coding for a putative zzso protein having a high sequence similarity to the zzso zzso Evidence was presented indicating that this gene is zzso
