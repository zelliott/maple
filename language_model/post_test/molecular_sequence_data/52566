The G domain of the zzso alpha chains consists of five zzso G zzso zzso and has been implicated in various biological zzso In this study, we identified an active site for cell and zzso binding within the zzso zzso G domain using zzso proteins and synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated using a zzso expression zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were highly active for cell zzso whereas the zzso module alone showed only weak zzso zzso inhibited cell binding to the zzso zzso whereas no zzso was observed with zzso or zzso against the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso module interacts with a cell surface zzso containing zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso demonstrated strong binding of the zzso and zzso zzso to zzso with zzso values in the zzso range, whereas a zzso lower value was determined for the zzso zzso Treatment with zzso demonstrated that zzso carbohydrates on the zzso module are zzso zzso The zzso zzso devoid of zzso zzso exhibited similar binding zzso toward zzso Furthermore, cell binding was unaffected by removal of zzso zzso To zzso active sites on the zzso zzso various synthetic peptides were used to compete with binding of the tandem module to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso whereas a scrambled zzso of zzso failed to compete zzso zzso replacements demonstrated that one zzso zzso within zzso was important for cell and zzso zzso Our results suggest a critical role of the zzso module for zzso zzso zzso binding within the zzso zzso zzso
