The zzso zzso family of zzso terminal repeat zzso is a major force shaping zzso zzso and its members can alter the zzso in many zzso zzso analyses have shown that zzso of functional proteins zzso by the two zzso open reading zzso zzso and zzso is an essential prerequisite for the propagation of zzso elements in the zzso However, all efforts to identify zzso proteins have failed so zzso Here, applying a novel zzso we report the presence of proteins zzso by zzso in a subset of cellular components of human male zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso of fetal zzso in germ cells of adult zzso and in distinct zzso cell types, such as zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso of both proteins in male germ cells is necessary for the observed zzso expansion of the number of zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis of a approximately zzso zzso isolated from cultured human zzso zzso zzso cells led to the identification of zzso zzso An isolated approximately zzso zzso was shown to derive from zzso copies of zzso coding zzso The presence of both zzso and zzso proteins in vascular zzso cells and its apparent association with certain stages of differentiation and maturation of blood vessels may have functional relevance for zzso and/or zzso
