zzso injury is associated with breakdown of zzso collagen and the zzso of inflammatory cells in the zzso In previous studies, we demonstrated that zzso zzso is zzso in part, by zzso factors generated from damaged zzso To determine if zzso zzso also mediate the migration of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso we examined the release of zzso factors from zzso zzso treated with native or synthetic zzso zzso These included fragments of bovine collagen zzso with bacterial zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso as well as small molecular weight synthetic zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the major zzso acids that comprise zzso We found a zzso and zzso generation of zzso zzso activity by collagen zzso zzso The maximum activity was released 72 h after zzso of zzso for 1 to 3 h with zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso or zzso The native peptides derived from zzso collagen were more active than synthetic peptides containing Pro and zzso Neither zzso zzso of bovine serum zzso nor synthetic peptides containing zzso zzso zzso factor release from zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor was found to lose activity when zzso and after heat or zzso zzso The release of zzso factors by collagen zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso medium was found to stimulate zzso production of zzso oxygen zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
