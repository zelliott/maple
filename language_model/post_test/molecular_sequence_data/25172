Multiple regulatory elements in the human zzso virus long terminal repeat zzso zzso are required for zzso of zzso gene zzso Previous zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso linked to the zzso zzso gene indicated that multiple regulatory regions including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions were important for zzso gene zzso To characterize these regulatory elements further, zzso in these regions were inserted into both the zzso and 3' zzso zzso and infectious zzso zzso were zzso These zzso were zzso into either zzso cells, zzso cells or zzso cells in both the presence and absence of zzso zzso which have previously been demonstrated to activate zzso gene zzso zzso gene expression was zzso by the level of zzso gag protein released from cultures zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in all cell lines indicated that zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso loop and stem secondary structure resulted in marked decreases in gene expression while zzso of the zzso motif or zzso primary sequence resulted in only slight zzso However, viruses containing zzso in either the zzso loop sequences or stem secondary structure which were very defective for gene expression in zzso zzso cells, gave nearly zzso levels of gene expression in zzso zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso High level gene expression of these zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells was eliminated by second site zzso in the zzso region or by disruption of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
