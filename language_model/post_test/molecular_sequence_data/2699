zzso zzso sequencing and Northern zzso analysis have been performed on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of mice affected with the zzso zzso The full length zzso has a total of zzso zzso which include 261 zzso of coding region, 121 zzso of zzso and 544 zzso of zzso zzso The latter contains a zzso A tail of 50 zzso The coding region has only one base changed from the normal mouse zzso gamma zzso a C replaced by an A at position 105 zzso and Farber, zzso and zzso zzso with the coding region of the bovine retinal zzso zzso et zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gamma is 900 zzso long in both normal and zzso mouse zzso and codes for a protein containing 87 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso gamma from zzso zzso has zzso zzso with that of the zzso from normal mouse zzso and zzso zzso with that of the bovine zzso gamma suggesting that if this zzso of zzso is properly transcribed and zzso it is not defective in the degenerative zzso mouse zzso
