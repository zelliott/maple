Three of the four independently induced zzso zzso female sterile zzso that identify the zzso zzso zzso originated from a zzso T transition and the concurrent replacement of zzso by zzso zzso CD zzso of representative peptides with Pro or zzso in the crucial position revealed that upon the zzso exchange the zzso zzso protein loses flexibility and attains most likely an open zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of the zzso zzso form of zzso protein and results in increased zzso binding zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso does not exert its zzso effect on nuclear protein import and has no effect on zzso zzso functions and zzso zzso However, it interferes with nuclear envelope formation during zzso transition, revealing a novel function of zzso
