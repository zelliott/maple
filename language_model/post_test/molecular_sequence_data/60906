The zzso boundary zzso has been suggested to act as an organizer in the development of the zzso zzso zzso was cloned as a candidate for regulator of the organizing zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso with the genetic cascade in zzso suggest that zzso may be at a higher zzso position in the gene regulation cascade of zzso zzso To examine this possibility, a zzso experiment on zzso was carried zzso In zzso zzso on zzso chick brain with the zzso expression zzso that encodes chick zzso zzso was zzso Not only was a considerable amount of zzso expressed zzso in the zzso brain, but irregular bulging of the zzso was induced in the zzso and zzso At zzso zzso sites, zzso of zzso was zzso zzso examination of zzso zzso brain revealed that zzso caused zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso In the zzso of the zzso zzso differentiation of zzso structure was zzso when compared to the normal zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in the zzso to zzso Moreover, zzso which is expressed specifically in the zzso with a zzso highest at the zzso end, is suggested to be involved in zzso of the retinal zzso and was induced in the zzso When the mouse zzso expression zzso was zzso zzso and chick zzso were also induced zzso These results suggest that zzso together with zzso hold a higher position in the genetic hierarchy of the zzso organizing center and regulate its zzso
