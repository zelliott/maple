zzso zzso editing of the zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso predicts an array of 24 zzso zzso some of which are characterized by reduced zzso activity and potency to initiate zzso zzso The zzso is integral to anxiety, fear, and related psychiatric zzso zzso of zzso receptors within the zzso is zzso Here, we describe the zzso editing profiles from zzso of two zzso mouse strains zzso and zzso known to be more anxious than a third zzso We confirmed the strain anxiety differences using zzso zzso and we discovered that zzso and zzso are each characterized by a higher functioning zzso editing profile than zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a roughly zzso reduction in C site editing, and a corresponding zzso reduction in the edited zzso zzso zzso is characterized by a relative decrease in the zzso highly functional zzso zzso We estimated the zzso of editing at the C site to be approximately zzso By sequencing zzso DNA, we found complete conservation between zzso zzso zzso and 37 other zzso strains for the zzso edited region of zzso suggesting zzso DNA sequence does not influence variation in zzso zzso editing between zzso strains of zzso We did, however, discover that zzso turnover is reduced in zzso and zzso consistent with emerging evidence that synaptic zzso levels regulate zzso zzso These results encourage further study of the causes and consequences of zzso zzso zzso editing in the zzso of zzso
