The correct wiring of zzso is critical for the normal functioning of the nervous zzso zzso zzso of zzso form zzso with specific zzso zzso zzso with appropriate target cells in culture zzso a significant increase in zzso growth, the number of sensory zzso zzso with release sites zzso the target, and regulates the expression and distribution of zzso zzso zzso proteins such as zzso and the sensory zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization is accompanied by the maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso We report here that specific targets induce the release of zzso from sensory zzso which then regulates synaptic zzso zzso growth associated with zzso formation, the maintenance of synaptic zzso and the specific distribution of zzso Bath application of an zzso zzso during the early phase of zzso formation blocked the expected increase in synaptic strength, the growth and formation of new zzso zzso and the zzso regulation of zzso zzso In contrast, bath application of zzso accelerated the increase in synaptic strength and enhanced the formation of new zzso and zzso regulation of zzso distribution in sensory zzso As zzso zzso zzso zzso declines but is required for the maintenance of synaptic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that a retrograde target signal regulates the zzso and actions of a zzso zzso critical for the formation and maintenance of specific zzso
