A zzso zzso zzso short rod zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from a saline soil sample collected from zzso zzso Forest National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang province, zzso China, and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at zzso degrees C and pH zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The zzso type was zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were the major zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso Major cellular fatty acids zzso of total) were zzso and zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso one unknown zzso and two unknown zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso zzso and the type strain of the only recognized zzso species, zzso zzso was zzso However, the level of zzso zzso of the two strains was zzso The zzso zzso data and differential zzso properties, together with the zzso zzso demonstrated that strain zzso zzso could be differentiated from zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The description of the zzso zzso has also been zzso
