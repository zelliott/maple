A new zzso zzso from zzso complex of Colombian zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso using molecular exclusion zzso and zzso The molecular mass of zzso was determined by zzso approximately 14 zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso optimum pH was zzso and temperature was between 30 and 45 degrees C, and it had a strict requirement of zzso for its zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequence data with other zzso from South American zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso shares the highest sequence identity with zzso an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high content of basic and zzso zzso zzso In mice, zzso presented higher zzso than zzso complex from C zzso zzso Additionally, zzso induced a conspicuous local zzso effect and moderate zzso zzso in zzso it was zzso in doses as low as zzso zzso zzso and it was not zzso on zzso but zzso was able to lyse zzso
