Early zzso factor 1 zzso is a key zzso zzso of zzso differentiation whose zzso domain has no sequence similarity to other zzso factor zzso Here we report the crystal structure of an zzso zzso bound to its zzso recognition zzso The zzso domain adopts a zzso fold with novel zzso but is structurally similar to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso contacts the DNA with two zzso zzso and a unique zzso coordination motif zzso each zzso zzso interacts with both zzso zzso This unusual mode of DNA recognition generates an extended contact area that may be crucial for the function of zzso in zzso
