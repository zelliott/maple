zzso individuals of the green zzso zzso zzso consist of two cell types, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cells are terminally differentiated zzso cells which undergo gradual zzso leading to cell death in every zzso To understand the gene expression programs associated with zzso of zzso cells, we cloned two zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso expressed during this late zzso zzso These two zzso were deduced to zzso zzso motifs characteristic of zzso proteins that are components of the zzso zzso zzso also resembled genes zzso plant zzso protein 1 zzso while zzso showed similarities with genes zzso zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso of zzso We also found that zzso one of the late zzso zzso previously cloned by zzso and Kirk zzso zzso 145 (1991) zzso was deduced to zzso a protein with a composition similar to zzso The expression of zzso and a zzso gene has been shown to be induced during zzso in higher zzso These results indicate that some of the late zzso genes in zzso zzso are related to the zzso genes in higher zzso
