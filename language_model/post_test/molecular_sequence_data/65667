A zzso grouping of 48 different zzso of milky disease bacteria isolated in the United States was determined using zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso sequence zzso A clear distinction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was evident from the results of each zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso into two zzso groups and the zzso zzso zzso zzso into three zzso zzso In the United States, zzso zzso group 1 was generally isolated from insects collected west of the Appalachian zzso zzso zzso group 2 was only isolated from insects collected east of the Appalachian zzso zzso zzso groups 1 and 2 were obtained from insects collected west and south of the zzso zzso zzso group 3 was identified in insects collected east of the zzso From five different locations in Connecticut, 12 milky disease bacterial zzso were classified as zzso zzso and three were classified as zzso zzso Except for one zzso all zzso zzso zzso were of zzso group zzso The three zzso zzso strains were isolated from diseased insects that had been collected from a localized area in the zzso These three strains formed a separate zzso grouping zzso group 3) of zzso zzso and, based on zzso zzso sequence zzso were most similar to the newly identified zzso zzso zzso strain recently isolated in zzso All milky disease bacteria that had been isolated from commercially available zzso preparations were identified as zzso zzso group zzso
