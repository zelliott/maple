The ability to acquire iron from the zzso environment is a key zzso of zzso in zzso zzso tuberculosis acquires iron exclusively via the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of which depends on the production of zzso from zzso zzso production in other bacteria is either a zzso process involving an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso as observed for zzso zzso or a zzso conversion zzso by a zzso zzso as with zzso zzso Here we present the structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso solved by zzso anomalous zzso at a resolution of zzso A, and zzso evidence that it is the zzso zzso necessary for zzso zzso The zzso is critically dependent on zzso for activity and produces zzso via an zzso zzso zzso is structurally similar to zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso and shares the overall architecture of other zzso zzso such as the related zzso zzso zzso Like zzso but unlike zzso or zzso zzso is neither regulated by nor structurally stabilized by bound zzso The structure of zzso is the starting point for the design of zzso of zzso zzso which may make useful lead compounds for the production of new zzso drugs, given the strong dependence of zzso on iron acquisition in zzso zzso
