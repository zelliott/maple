In zzso hydrogen production in zzso zzso involves electron transfer between zzso and zzso Five zzso zzso open reading frames were zzso as coding for putative zzso We focused our zzso and zzso investigations on zzso and zzso which possess the sequence signature and length of classical zzso zzso zzso but differ significantly in theoretical zzso After zzso zzso expression in zzso coli followed by in zzso zzso incorporation and zzso zzso was shown to have a regular electron zzso resonance zzso signal for a classical zzso zzso zzso while zzso displayed an unusual zzso signal and a quite low reduction zzso Both zzso were reduced in zzso by zzso zzso zzso but the zzso reduction rate was zzso lower than that of zzso These results are consistent with the efficiency of zzso electron transfer being dictated by the zzso zzso the contribution of the zzso global charge being only zzso The zzso function of zzso is zzso
