zzso in the rolling zzso zzso gene result in severe defects in zzso zzso Muscle precursor cells are correctly determined, but zzso does not progress significantly beyond this point because recognition and/or cell zzso between muscle precursor cells and zzso zzso is zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso region reveals two zzso transcripts of zzso due to different zzso initiation sites, zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso mainly in the zzso during differentiation as well as in zzso zzso and in the zzso By contrast, zzso expression is restricted to the zzso and later to zzso descendants during zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso starts at the extended germ band stage when zzso cells are determined and persists until stage zzso The proteins zzso by the zzso gene are 1670 zzso and zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso Both forms contain an zzso zzso zzso nine zzso repeats and a zzso repeat eventually zzso by a zzso zzso The longer zzso zzso is characterized by 309 unique zzso zzso zzso while zzso is distinguishable by 79 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in muscle founder cells indicates a function of zzso in these zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso show that zzso is required in muscle precursor cells and is essential to recruit zzso zzso for zzso zzso
