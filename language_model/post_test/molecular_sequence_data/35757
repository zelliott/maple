Although zzso expression of the alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso hormone receptors zzso 1 and zzso 1) suggests zzso function, zzso studies to date have failed to show consistent differences in their ability to regulate gene zzso We here provide evidence that zzso 1 but not zzso 1 regulates the expression of the gene coding for zzso in zzso zzso cells during zzso rat development and that such regulation appears to be both zzso dependent and zzso zzso zzso of zzso rats revealed that the levels of three zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso rise from zzso day 1 to day zzso This rise is preceded by the previously documented surge in brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sharply zzso but does not zzso the rise in these zzso zzso zzso administration zzso the zzso In order to establish more directly the role of zzso 1 and zzso zzso experiments were performed in zzso cells with zzso construct and zzso zzso These studies showed that zzso 1, even in the absence of zzso regulated the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the response to zzso 1 alone by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 had no effect on zzso expression either in the presence or absence of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
