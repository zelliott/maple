A detailed study of zzso B virus zzso surface zzso and their role in breakthrough infections has been conducted in The zzso West zzso zzso from zzso vaccinated subjects were tested for zzso B surface zzso zzso Evidence of infection was found in zzso zzso of subjects with breakthrough infections and 18 zzso were also positive for zzso DNA following zzso zzso A cohort of 58 zzso carriers which also included 11 patients with zzso zzso was also investigated in order to establish the prevalence of surface zzso in the zzso zzso Analysis of the S gene from zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso revealed little variation in the S gene of these zzso zzso S protein sequences zzso were identical and a further 22 sequences differed by only a single zzso zzso The zzso zzso found in previous work was not detected and little variation was observed in the zzso zzso zzso a single change was found in one vaccinated patient zzso and nine changes detected among six zzso zzso This study showed that breakthrough zzso infection in vaccinated zzso is mainly caused by the wild type zzso E strain and that immune escape zzso are zzso However, zzso zzso may play a role in establishing infection later in life when zzso zzso have begun to zzso Further investigation is required to determine the cause of these breakthrough infections and whether they contribute to the establishment of the carrier zzso
