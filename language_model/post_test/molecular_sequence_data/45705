zzso zzso zzso factor zzso also known as zzso zzso factor zzso contains nine zzso type zinc finger zzso zzso zzso is localized to the nucleus, where it zzso the zzso activity of a large number of zzso genes in zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso contains a nuclear zzso signal zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso However, our studies showed that zzso a zzso zzso zzso which contains the zzso 5 of 9 zzso efficiently localized to the zzso On the other hand zzso another zzso zzso zzso which contains 4 of the 9 zzso localized to the zzso In this study zzso which contains 8 zzso with the zzso zzso deleted, was found to zzso to the nucleus in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Complete deletion or zzso of zzso zzso still permitted zzso to be localized to the nucleus in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast zzso zzso which contain a deletion of zzso zzso to the zzso A point zzso in the zinc finger structure that zzso its zzso remains zzso These data suggest that zzso contains a zzso around zzso while the putative zzso at zzso zzso is zzso
