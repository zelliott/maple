The large zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso consists of three zzso and has two known DNA binding zzso In this study random and zzso zzso was used to identify other regions of zzso that were required for biological zzso zzso and zzso analysis of these zzso led to the identification of important zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, another region of zzso zzso zzso which is zzso within large zzso zzso was shown to be essential for both zzso and zzso zzso of charged zzso within this region led to a loss of biological activity and zzso DNA zzso This zzso was zzso by interaction with the zzso DNA binding region zzso zzso In these zzso removal of zzso zzso resulted in loss of DNA zzso despite the presence of the primary DNA binding region zzso zzso Analysis of zzso within the zzso zzso region indicated that different protein zzso were involved in the zzso and the zzso zzso In zzso we have shown that zzso is a complex protein that has multiple zzso and zzso interaction sites, providing insight into the structural and functional complexity of this important zzso zzso
