zzso zzso is regulated by protein zzso We have recently shown that a zzso zzso system is involved in zzso zzso Two of the components of the zzso system, zzso and zzso are regulated by zzso zzso During our investigation of zzso zzso proteins we discovered a zzso protein whose zzso zzso zzso closely to the zzso state of zzso This protein is zzso zzso to a much higher degree in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso or by zzso calcium overload led to the virtual disappearance of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso of the zzso The protein was present in the soluble 100 zzso zzso g zzso of zzso extracts and was heat zzso zzso through zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that this zzso protein is not a regulatory zzso of zzso or zzso Our results represent the identification of a soluble protein whose zzso zzso varies directly with zzso and suggest that zzso regulation may involve cross talk between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
