zzso motif zzso zzso zzso complementary to a 21 base pair zzso run were zzso at one or both ends to zzso These zzso were incubated with several synthetic duplexes containing the targeted zzso run flanked by different zzso The extent of zzso and zzso zzso was compared with the level of binding at zzso zzso modification took place within a zzso complex and usually occurred at zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso was dependent upon the sequence of the zzso duplex, the solution conditions, and the rate of triplex formation relative to the rate of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso as parallel duplexes was demonstrated and this did not interfere with triple strand zzso With an optimal target, zzso of the triplex was very efficient when incubation was carried in a zzso buffer supplemented with the triplex selective zzso zzso
