To examine the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso trafficking, zzso zzso trafficking was characterized in Chinese zzso zzso cells in which zzso zzso was blocked by treatment with the specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH slowed the zzso zzso rate to approximately one-half of control but did not affect zzso zzso zzso The slowed zzso zzso required the zzso zzso domain and was largely eliminated by zzso replacing either of two aromatic zzso acids within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results zzso using a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso that proper zzso zzso is necessary to maintain rapid recycling of zzso receptors back to the plasma zzso Moreover, zzso return to the plasma membrane is slowed in the absence of proper zzso zzso by a zzso mechanism involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results, in conjunction with results from other studies, suggest that the mechanism for zzso receptors in plasma membrane zzso pits may be an example of a more general mechanism that determines the dynamic distribution of membrane proteins among various compartments with zzso zzso playing a crucial role in this zzso
