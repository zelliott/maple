zzso in the zzso family are important zzso zzso They recognize zzso DNA zzso with a zzso preference and account for more than zzso of all proteins that interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso protein family expressed zzso in the zzso was generated zzso and its interactions with zzso DNA were investigated in zzso The binding affinities of the two individual zzso zzso of zzso to DNA carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso are weaker than those of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso however, has a zzso stronger binding affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso compared to that of zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso presumably because the former lacks a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso plays a critical role in stabilizing the binding complex of zzso with the zzso DNA, as it does for zzso zzso radical zzso analysis of the zzso DNA complex reveals a zzso pattern very different from that of zzso however, revealing very little binding asymmetry with respect to the zzso zzso An in zzso repair zzso revealed that zzso at 1 zzso interferes with repair of zzso zzso zzso damage by zzso compared to control, whereas zzso at the same concentration zzso repair by zzso This repair zzso capability is highly dependent on both the binding affinity and the size of the zzso The putative role of zzso in the mechanism of action of zzso and especially its potential relevance to the hypersensitivity of zzso germ cell tumors to zzso are zzso
