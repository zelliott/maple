The reaction of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Treatment with the zzso leads to loss of the zzso activity of zzso in a zzso zzso this can be prevented by inclusion of zzso in the reaction zzso zzso of the zzso of the reaction indicate that the loss of activity zzso to the incorporation of about one zzso per zzso of zzso From analysis of the sequences of modified peptides it is proposed that the reaction probably occurs with one or both of the two zzso zzso and zzso although the instability of the zzso makes a zzso identification of the zzso of reaction zzso The involvement of zzso side chains in the reaction with zzso was confirmed by using zzso zzso to estimate zzso groups in both modified and unmodified zzso
