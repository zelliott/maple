In the present study, we used an expression cloning strategy to identify zzso factors that bind specifically to a limited region of the zzso zzso early zzso zzso promoter and regulate zzso zzso zzso embryonic factor zzso was isolated and was shown to bind to a site located at zzso zzso to zzso from the zzso start zzso zzso expression of reporter zzso containing either a consensus zzso or the zzso binding site demonstrated that zzso zzso correlated with relative binding zzso zzso the consensus zzso bound zzso more tightly and was more responsive to zzso than the zzso Because the zzso overlapped a zzso response element, the responsiveness of these sequences to either zzso or zzso was zzso Although zzso expression had no effect on the zzso zzso response of the zzso promoter, zzso did zzso calcium responsiveness to these zzso zzso also modestly increased the zzso zzso from a consensus zzso Additional studies using zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso may be zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, studies with the zzso in a zzso zzso cell line demonstrated that these cells were zzso unresponsive to zzso however, responsiveness was restored by zzso of the active zzso zzso These studies are the first to demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso factor, and they suggest that there are two classes of zzso zzso One class, represented by a consensus zzso is regulated by zzso in the resting zzso the second class, represented by zzso is regulated by zzso in the zzso zzso
