The zzso gene from zzso zzso strain zzso is required for the synthesis of bacterial magnetic particles zzso This gene has been zzso zzso and found to zzso a protein which is zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso gene zzso cloned downstream of the zzso promoter, the effect of iron on regulation of zzso expression was investigated, and zzso of zzso was found to be enhanced by low zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein was studied using zzso fusion zzso The zzso gene was cloned downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in the zzso cell zzso and magnetic particle membrane zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso fusion protein was localized in the cell zzso The fusion protein was also detected on the surface of the zzso zzso covering the magnetic zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso the expression of which is enhanced at low iron zzso
