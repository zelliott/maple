We have previously identified zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso complement zzso by binding to zzso and preventing zzso zzso to zzso and zzso The structure of zzso consists of a zzso bridge and a type I zzso located at opposite sides to each zzso The zzso bridge is part of a zzso zzso and the zzso is part of a polar zzso We present the design of zzso zzso in which we have introduced a series of zzso in key structural elements of their parent zzso zzso We have examined the consistency of the structures of the designed zzso compared with zzso using zzso and we have used the resulting structural information to make zzso zzso activity zzso We propose the zzso 1) Even in the absence of the zzso bridge, a linear analog has a propensity for structure formation consistent with a turn of a zzso or a zzso 2) The type I zzso is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for zzso 3) Our zzso outside the type I zzso of zzso have altered the turn population but not the turn zzso 4) zzso of the zzso is essential for zzso 5) The type I zzso introduces zzso and sufficiently separates the two sides of the zzso whereas the zzso bridge prevents the zzso from drifting apart, thus aiding in the formation of the zzso zzso 6) The zzso cluster at the linked zzso is involved in binding to zzso and activity but alone is not sufficient for zzso 7) zzso zzso zzso zzso are specific for the turn formation, but only zzso zzso are specific for zzso 8) zzso is likely to be involved in direct interaction with zzso possibly through the formation of a hydrogen zzso Finally we propose a binding model for the zzso zzso
