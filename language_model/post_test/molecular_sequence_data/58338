We analyzed the functional and binding properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type I, zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso The binding properties of the three receptors were investigated using three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The three zzso labeled very different zzso zzso zzso labeled more receptors than either zzso or zzso in the three cell zzso Analysis of the competition zzso suggested that the three zzso labeled in a different manner three zzso I zzso states, two zzso zzso zzso states, and three zzso zzso zzso states in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso The previously described zzso and zzso zzso which differ by their affinities for zzso and zzso actually zzso to different zzso I zzso zzso The three receptors were able to increase zzso zzso activity when activated by zzso zzso or zzso In contrast with the two parent zzso the zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso at lower zzso than zzso suggesting that the zzso and core zzso zzso influence each other and that the zzso of one or both zzso was altered in the zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of the binding and functional properties of three clones expressing different zzso zzso receptors zzso indicated that zzso was necessary to correctly estimate the zzso number and that zzso or zzso labeled only a fraction of the functional zzso We suspect (but could not zzso that this might also be true for zzso I and zzso zzso zzso
