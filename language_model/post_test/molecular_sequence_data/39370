zzso sequences of the zzso regions and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso beta adult zzso zzso and zzso and of the zzso zzso region were determined for mouse strains representing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso defined by protein zzso zzso The hypothesis of zzso of the zzso and zzso genes between the d and zzso zzso previously reported in the zzso zzso sequences was confirmed by zzso analyses of the zzso regions and zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that all of the structures of zzso beta adult genes support the hypothesis that the p zzso was established by zzso between d and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the p zzso was found to have a zzso zzso gene and a zzso zzso zzso In addition to the possible zzso a break point was suggested around 2-3 zzso downstream of the zzso gene within the zzso zzso region, despite the absence of clear properties that could stimulate the zzso zzso Some large insertions or deletions zzso specific to the p or d zzso were located within the zzso zzso region, in which the zzso zzso specific to the p zzso was shared by all examined strains representing the p zzso
