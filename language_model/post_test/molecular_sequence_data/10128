zzso homocysteine zzso levels are observed in two apparently unrelated zzso zzso defects zzso and premature vascular zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso could result in elevated zzso zzso We zzso the coding region of zzso in 8 zzso patients (4 zzso patients and 4 patients with zzso complicated by spiral zzso disease, zzso We identified only one zzso resulting in an zzso acid zzso an zzso transition at zzso zzso converting an zzso acid zzso into a zzso zzso We screened zzso DNA for the presence of this zzso in 56 zzso patients, 69 mothers of children with zzso 108 zzso patients and 364 zzso There was no increased prevalence of the zzso and AG zzso in zzso patients, their mothers or zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not seem to be a risk factor for zzso or vascular zzso We then examined the mean zzso levels for each zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is thus a fairly zzso and probably benign zzso This study, though zzso provides no evidence for a major involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso diseases such as zzso or vascular zzso
