zzso of expression of the zzso zzso plays an important role during infection with zzso zzso We have examined the effect of manipulating the level of expression of zzso one of the components of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in elevated zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with an increase in the cellular content of nascent and unfolded zzso zzso There was also an increase in zzso of genes zzso the origin of zzso zzso suggesting an important role for zzso in controlling interaction of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no zzso effect on zzso of other zzso zzso in combination with zzso profiling provides a complementary approach to gene deletion for exploring the function of essential genes in zzso zzso
