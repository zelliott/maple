In the zzso zzso zzso zzso there are two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously isolated two genes zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso In order to compare the expressed products of zzso I zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso I was first zzso from zzso zzso zzso in which the proliferation of zzso and the expression of zzso zzso I were zzso zzso zzso I was virtually identical to zzso zzso I in molecular mass, kinetic and zzso properties, and primary structure at the zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed that zzso zzso I was the mixture of products of two genes zzso and zzso as in the case of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed independently in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso proteins were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited practically identical zzso properties to zzso and zzso zzso Is from zzso zzso These results revealed that zzso zzso I and zzso zzso I were zzso not by different zzso but by the same genes zzso and zzso and are present as a mixture of products expressed by both zzso although their zzso zzso are zzso
