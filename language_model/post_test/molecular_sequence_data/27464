zzso virus zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso has reservoirs in small zzso and may cause disease in humans, zzso and other zzso In this study we compared zzso isolated from humans and cats in zzso by restriction zzso and DNA sequence zzso The zzso restriction profiles clearly distinguished geographically distinct zzso zzso whereas only minor differences were found between the profiles of geographically linked zzso The complete gene sequences zzso the zzso response modifier B, the zzso and the Chinese zzso zzso host range protein were determined for the same zzso and included in zzso zzso By including representative zzso sequences from zzso detailed comparative analyses were performed showing pronounced zzso among zzso compared to members of other zzso zzso However, a close relationship between the Norwegian (3 of 4 zzso and Swedish zzso was zzso whereas the isolate from Finland was more closely related to a Russian isolate for all three genes zzso We zzso that the investigated zzso have distinct evolutionary histories in different zzso zzso
