In the zzso nervous system, the zzso cells missing gene zzso is zzso expressed in zzso precursors to switch their fate from the zzso default to zzso It encodes a novel zzso acid protein with a nuclear zzso zzso We report here that the zzso protein is a novel zzso protein and that its zzso activity is localized in the zzso 181 zzso zzso It binds with high specificity to the zzso zzso zzso which is a novel sequence among known targets of zzso zzso Eleven such zzso sequences are found in the zzso upstream region of the zzso zzso whose expression in early zzso cells is dependent on zzso This suggests that the zzso protein is a zzso regulator directly controlling zzso We have also identified zzso genes from human and mouse whose products share a highly zzso zzso region with zzso zzso At least one of these was shown to have zzso activity similar to that of zzso By comparing the deduced zzso acid sequences of these gene products, we were able to define the zzso zzso an zzso zzso motif with zzso zzso By zzso amplification, we obtained evidence for the existence of additional zzso genes in mouse as well as in zzso The zzso therefore, forms a family of novel zzso zzso and may function in various aspects of cell fate zzso
