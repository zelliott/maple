The zzso zzso zzso zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso in Lewis rats by blocking zzso cell responses to zzso zzso of zzso basic protein zzso However, it has yet to be resolved how zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso T cell zzso This study revealed that zzso profoundly inhibited zzso proliferation by zzso zzso zzso cells but only partially inhibited the respective response of zzso and cloned lines of zzso T zzso That is, low zzso of zzso blocked 30 to zzso of zzso zzso but zzso higher zzso did not result in additional zzso zzso also inhibited zzso acquisition of zzso transfer activity, but only in cultures of freshly isolated zzso zzso cells and not in cultures of continuously zzso T zzso Studies focusing on the zzso T cell line revealed that the lack of sensitivity to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was nevertheless associated with an effective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso but not zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analyses revealed that zzso zzso T cells produced zzso for both zzso and zzso and that zzso selectively inhibited zzso of zzso as compared to zzso zzso Thus, zzso T cells apparently express a zzso zzso that zzso resistance to the zzso activity of zzso Studies focusing on two zzso T cell zzso revealed that zzso profoundly inhibited zzso zzso production but did not affect the alternative response of zzso growth zzso Several other hybrids also zzso zzso zzso production but did not express zzso and were not affected by zzso These results indicate that: 1) interactions of zzso with zzso do not necessarily block class II zzso recognition of zzso and 2) expression of zzso is not necessary for zzso recognition by several zzso of zzso T zzso Rather, the results of this study are consistent with the concept that zzso zzso zzso of zzso signals that are required specifically for initiation of zzso zzso These findings may have important implications for understanding the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
