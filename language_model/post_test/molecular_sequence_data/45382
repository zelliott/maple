It is widely accepted that zzso DNA zzso control region zzso faster than protein zzso genes with few zzso In the present study, we zzso the zzso zzso b gene zzso b) and control region zzso and compared their rates in 93 specimens representing 67 species of zzso and some related zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The results showed that sequence zzso of the zzso were broadly higher than those of the zzso b (about zzso zzso However, in considering only closely related species, zzso sequence evolution was slower than that of zzso b gene zzso of zzso b is zzso a pattern that is found to be very common in zzso Combined data of the zzso b and zzso were used to estimate the zzso relationship of the zzso by maximum zzso zzso and zzso zzso With zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso three analyses identified the same four lineages representing four zzso of zzso with zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso relationship of the zzso was zzso which indicated that zzso zzso (including zzso and zzso was not zzso Our molecular zzso analyses are in very close agreement with the zzso results based on the zzso data proposed by zzso and zzso wherein these four zzso were elevated to the family level as zzso zzso zzso and zzso
