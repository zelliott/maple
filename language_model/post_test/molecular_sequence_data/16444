A zzso protective zzso coats all primary aerial plant zzso Its synthesis requires extensive export of lipids from zzso cells to the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso had reduced stem zzso wax loads and accumulated zzso inclusions in the zzso of zzso zzso These inclusions represented abnormal deposits of zzso wax and resembled inclusions found in a human disorder caused by a defective zzso zzso zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso We found that the zzso gene encodes an ABC zzso localized in the plasma membrane of zzso cells and conclude that it is required for wax export to the zzso
