The large zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is thought to be responsible for the majority of zzso activities involved in viral zzso and zzso In order to gain insight into this zzso role we compared the deduced zzso acid sequences of five L proteins of zzso zzso zzso virus and rabies zzso or zzso zzso virus, zzso disease virus and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that they share an zzso zzso acid zzso outlining the uniqueness of the zzso virus life zzso zzso studies between L proteins traced evolutionary relationships in partial disagreement with the present zzso arrangement of this group of zzso The five L proteins exhibit a high degree of zzso along most of their zzso with strongly zzso zzso acids embedded in zzso blocks separated by variable regions, suggesting a structure of zzso functional zzso The most highly zzso central block contains the probable active site for zzso zzso We tentatively identified some other functional sites, distributed around this central core, that would naturally work together to assure the zzso zzso This provides detailed guidelines for the future study of L proteins by zzso zzso
