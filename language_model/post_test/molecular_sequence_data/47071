zzso B zzso is the zzso regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso Point zzso to zzso sites in zzso were generated to zzso individual zzso sites and evaluate contributions from each site to zzso zzso zzso zzso properties of four zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by flow dialysis confirming that each zzso zzso binds three zzso and that zzso zzso binds four zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso sites have lower affinity for zzso than the zzso zzso Each zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to produce zzso with specific disruption of one zzso zzso zzso containing zzso with a zzso in zzso sites 1 or 2 have a lower ratio of zzso to zzso and a lower zzso activity than those containing zzso zzso or zzso in sites 3 or zzso zzso of zzso formation on zzso binding were assessed by monitoring zzso exchange by flow zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso in sites 1 and 2 exchange zzso slowly from two sites whereas zzso in sites 3 and 4 exchange zzso slowly from a single zzso These data indicate that the zzso bound to sites 1 and 2 is likely to vary with zzso concentration and may act in dynamic zzso of zzso function, whereas zzso sites 3 and 4 are saturated at all times and that zzso bound to these sites is zzso
