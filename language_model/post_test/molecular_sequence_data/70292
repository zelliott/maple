The bovine zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso was coupled to the coding sequence of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso gene and introduced into mouse zzso A full-length zzso transcript was found in the zzso and zzso In the zzso an additional truncated version of zzso zzso was also zzso Two sets of primer extension fragments were identified, one corresponding to zzso initiation at or near the cap site of the zzso zzso the other to zzso initiation within the zzso zzso Furthermore, the latter, shorter transcript contained a 227 zzso zzso Only the long transcript was translated into zzso zzso in the later stages of developing zzso The zzso protein was also functional in the zzso since zzso was either arrested or the zzso zzso almost completely destroyed in transgenic males treated with the zzso zzso If the zzso zzso also functions zzso in the zzso these mice will provide a useful model for studies on zzso
