To develop a zzso in combination with zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso for prenatal diagnosis of the five most common zzso zzso in zzso 

The human zzso gene zzso was amplified by zzso followed by a multiple zzso reaction specific for each five zzso Then the zzso product zzso were separated for zzso of zzso gene zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

In a blind study, prenatal diagnosis was performed on zzso zzso families for zzso zzso zzso dot zzso zzso analysis was used to validate each result, showing an accuracy rate of zzso for zzso in a total of 108 samples zzso Overall, by zzso analysis, the authors could identify the zzso involving the five zzso and normal zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and actually make final decision for prenatal diagnosis covering zzso zzso 

The zzso protocol can be a simple, zzso and highly accurate zzso in the prenatal detection of common zzso zzso
