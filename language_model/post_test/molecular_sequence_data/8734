zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that zzso the first common step of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of two molecules of zzso acid zzso to form zzso Chemical modification data zzso zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso from both plants and zzso zzso may participate in the abstraction of two zzso zzso from each zzso zzso at the active zzso Only one zzso is zzso among 17 known sequences of zzso which have high overall sequence zzso In zzso coli zzso this zzso is zzso We performed zzso zzso on zzso replacing it with zzso The zzso protein zzso is zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso and zzso region of the sequence that is implicated in metal zzso The apparent zzso for zzso binding to zzso is about an order of magnitude higher than for the wild type zzso zzso coli zzso also contains zzso which is zzso through the zzso zzso and some bacterial zzso We zzso zzso to zzso and both zzso and zzso simultaneously to zzso All zzso proteins are zzso zzso the zzso values for zzso (44 zzso zzso (75 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were similar to wild type zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of metal zzso The apparent zzso for zzso of zzso and zzso is not appreciably different from wild zzso The activity of wild type and zzso proteins are all zzso by an zzso zzso the zzso proteins all have a reduced affinity for zzso We observe a zzso of approximately zzso in the wild type zzso zzso pH profile as well as in those of zzso and zzso suggesting that this zzso is not the result of zzso of one of these zzso zzso and zzso have a significantly increased zzso value for the zzso zzso This is consistent with a role for one or both of these zzso as a zzso to the required zzso of zzso coli zzso which is known to participate in zzso zzso Past chemical modification may have zzso the zzso by blocking zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the decreased zzso for zzso coli zzso at basic pH allows for the zzso of active sites at four per zzso
