zzso tissue plays a critical role in zzso storage, and release of fatty acids in zzso Construction of a full-length zzso library is an effective way to understand the functional expression of genes in zzso zzso and in addition, novel genes for further research can be found in the zzso In this study, zzso tissue zzso was extracted from three zzso zzso zzso The zzso was isolated, reverse zzso and used to construct a zzso zzso After zzso zzso clones were selected and zzso zzso analysis was performed, and the assembled zzso of each cluster was subjected to search against DNA sequences in the zzso databases zzso These sequences were clustered into 1,527 unique zzso zzso of the sequences were zzso as known zzso and zzso of the sequences were zzso as unknown zzso In this zzso tissue zzso library, approximately zzso of the genes contained full-length sequences with start and stop zzso Gene zzso analysis was performed to indicate the possible functions of these zzso Genes associated with zzso function were abundant and represented zzso of the zzso Several fatty acid transport genes and zzso zzso A zzso were among the most abundant genes zzso zzso distribution of several abundant genes was analyzed by northern analysis, and many of these genes were transcribed in zzso zzso tissue in high copy zzso Our full-length sequence data and tissue distribution data can be used to decipher the functional roles exhibited by the zzso under various zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
