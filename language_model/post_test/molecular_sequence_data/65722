Using two forest soils, we previously constructed two zzso libraries containing zzso members in zzso The libraries were screened to select active zzso clones using zzso zzso as a target zzso One clone from the zzso pine tree zzso soil library, zzso showed zzso zzso growth zzso Despite an intensive effort, active chemicals were not zzso DNA sequence analysis and zzso zzso of zzso revealed 39 open reading frames zzso and indicated that eight zzso probably in one zzso unit, might be directly involved in the expression of zzso activity in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of eight zzso were similar to those of the core genes zzso type II family zzso zzso such as the zzso carrier protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gene cluster involved in zzso activity was similar in organization to the putative zzso production locus of zzso zzso zzso although we could not select a similar active clone from the zzso zzso DNA library in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding cassette zzso and membrane proteins were located at both ends of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso family response regulator and a zzso family response regulator were involved in the positive regulation of zzso gene zzso Our results suggested the zzso approach as an alternative to search for novel zzso antibiotics from zzso soil zzso This is the first report of an zzso gene cluster obtained from a soil zzso using zzso zzso as a target zzso
