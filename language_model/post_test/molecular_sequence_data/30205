The coordinate expression of genes during development and differentiation is thought to be accomplished by common zzso factors operating on the promoters of families of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor involved in the expression of genes in the liver and was originally defined as playing a major role in zzso the expression of the linked zzso zzso We have isolated zzso clones for zzso using zzso prepared to the sequence of the zzso zzso The sequence of zzso shares zzso domain, as well as short zzso and basic sequences with the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso from the protein interacting with the zzso zzso element, or B box zzso and the factor interacting with the alpha zzso promoter zzso are found in the predicted sequence of zzso zzso zzso is not present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but reappears upon selection for zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso Finally, the zzso is not present in zzso cell hybrids in which zzso gene expression is zzso In contrast to earlier published results, we find that in addition to being present in the liver, zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso but not in other zzso This pattern of expression mirrors the complex pattern of expression of many zzso such as zzso alpha zzso and zzso whose promoters contain zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is a more broadly acting zzso factor than has been indicated by previous zzso
