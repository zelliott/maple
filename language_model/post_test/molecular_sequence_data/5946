In this report we investigate the expression and relationship of zzso zzso a transformation and zzso sensitive zzso zzso protein found in zzso and smooth muscle zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1993: zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso a smooth muscle protein of unknown function zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To clarify their relationship we have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso from cultures of rat zzso zzso The sequences of zzso zzso and the smooth muscle zzso zzso are identical zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso Shanahan et zzso 1993: zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso These data, coupled with our zzso analysis and previous observations zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso expression is not restricted to smooth muscle since this protein is also present in normal zzso zzso However, we also show that zzso although present in secondary cultures of mouse and rat zzso zzso is absent in many apparently normal zzso cell zzso zzso zzso may therefore be an early and sensitive marker for the onset of zzso A functional role for zzso is unlikely to directly involve zzso since it neither contains a functional zzso hand nor binds zzso
