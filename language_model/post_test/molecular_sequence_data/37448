The live, attenuated vaccine zzso zzso virus zzso efficiently protects zzso zzso against infection with zzso zzso but occasionally causes zzso zzso depletion and progression to zzso AIDS zzso zzso recovered from a vaccinated zzso zzso that progressed to zzso had acquired an additional deletion in the zzso zzso resulting in a zzso that restored the original zzso open reading frame zzso zzso Connor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ho, zzso zzso Dailey, and zzso zzso Marx, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso viral isolate into four zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso depletion and disease in three out of four animals within 2 years, indicating a restoration of zzso A DNA zzso encompassing the truncated zzso gene amplified from the zzso isolate was inserted into the genetic backbone of zzso The resulting zzso zzso expressed a zzso protein of approximately 23 zzso while the original zzso clone expressed a shorter protein of 8 zzso The zzso form of zzso did not cause zzso of zzso zzso or major zzso complex class zzso The zzso of zzso was similar to that of zzso in zzso zzso using indicator cell zzso In contrast, zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso in peripheral blood zzso cell zzso cultures infected under zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cultures were still lower than those obtained with zzso zzso consistent with a partial recovery of zzso zzso The zzso activity of long terminal repeat zzso zzso containing the zzso deletions did not differ markedly from that of zzso zzso Introduction of a premature stop zzso within zzso abolished the zzso advantage in zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso rather than the structure of the zzso region of the zzso was responsible for the increase in viral zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso with a deletion in the zzso gene can zzso to zzso and that expression of a form of zzso with multiple deletions may contribute to this process by increasing viral zzso
