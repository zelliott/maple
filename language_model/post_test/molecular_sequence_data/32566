zzso zzso receptors belong to the zzso of zzso channels as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the structural similarity between zzso channels of the zzso receptors and zzso channels is a matter of zzso The aim of this study was to analyze differences between the structures of zzso channels and zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, zzso models of zzso and zzso zzso channels zzso and zzso zzso were built using X-ray structures of zzso channels as zzso The models were zzso and used to reproduce specific data on the structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso attention was paid to the data of the binding of channel zzso and to the results of scanning zzso The modeling demonstrates that properties of zzso zzso channel can be reproduced assuming only local structural zzso of the zzso channel zzso The most valuable differences were found in the zzso region, whereas zzso parts of zzso and zzso segments could have similar spatial organization with zzso segments in zzso zzso It is concluded that the current experimental data on zzso zzso channels does not reveal global structural differences with zzso zzso
