zzso for discovery of local similarities and zzso of evolutionary distance by identifying zzso zzso zzso of length zzso common to two sequences are zzso Given zzso sequences of length zzso these methods have zzso time zzso The ability of compressed zzso acid zzso to extend these techniques to zzso related proteins was zzso The performance of these zzso was evaluated for different zzso and choices of k using a test set of 1848 pairs of structurally zzso sequences selected from the zzso zzso zzso measures derived from zzso counting were found to correlate well with percentage identity derived from sequence zzso zzso zzso were seen to improve performance in local similarity discovery, but no evidence was found of improvements when applied to distance zzso The performance of our local similarity discovery method was compared with the fast zzso transform zzso used in zzso which has zzso log zzso time zzso The method for achieving comparable coverage to zzso is revealed here, and is more than an order of magnitude zzso We suggest using zzso distance for fast, approximate zzso tree construction, and show that a speed improvement of more than three orders of magnitude can be achieved relative to standard distance methods, which require zzso
