zzso dynamics simulations are used to investigate dynamics and zzso interactions of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The calculations are based on the zzso force field with particle mesh Ewald treatment for long-range zzso The zzso structure exhibits a large flexibility, consistent with its absence of secondary structure zzso From an analysis of the correlation zzso and of zzso interactions we suggest that segments expressed by the two zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso exhibit rather separated dynamic and energetic zzso We also identify zzso interactions of importance for structure zzso In particular, significant zzso interactions are recognized between the zzso and the basic domain of the zzso consistent with zzso zzso performed in this zzso
