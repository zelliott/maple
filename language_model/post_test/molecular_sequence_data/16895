Chemical modification of a zzso zzso zzso zzso surface has been explored to zzso zzso chip zzso A craft zzso was designed and zzso to introduce the zzso functional groups onto the plastic surface zzso Furthermore, it has been found that, through a zzso bridge that formed by zzso to these functional groups, a stable patterning network of gel zzso could be zzso Thus, zzso of proteins could be realized onto the zzso zzso zzso with zzso preserved as far as zzso The protein homogeneous patterning in a zzso channel has been demonstrated by performing microchip zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection and zzso zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of zzso zzso within stable zzso zzso zzso the suggested scheme was employed to the construction of immobilized zzso zzso The zzso activity of immobilized zzso has been demonstrated with the zzso of zzso c and bovine serum zzso at a fast flow rate of zzso zzso which zzso the short residence time less than 5 zzso The zzso products were characterized using zzso zzso with sequence coverage of 75 and zzso observed, zzso This research exhibited a simple but effective strategy of plastic microchip surface modification for protein zzso in biological and zzso zzso
