zzso brain zzso function may be characteristic of several zzso zzso Thus, it is important to identify zzso genes and screen for functional zzso at zzso coding for genes that control normal zzso zzso zzso beta is a terminal zzso zzso which may play a role in regulating zzso synthesis and zzso Using an zzso technique we screened for zzso beta coding sequence zzso in zzso interviewed zzso which included controls, zzso and alcoholic zzso and alcoholic violent offenders with low zzso zzso of the main zzso zzso zzso A common zzso was identified in the zzso beta gene with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was caused by a silent G to C substitution at zzso zzso of the coding zzso This zzso could also be detected as a zzso zzso of amplified zzso zzso from zzso zzso families were typed for the zzso zzso and analyzed with respect to 20 linked markers on zzso zzso zzso analysis placed the zzso beta zzso gene between markers zzso and zzso A maximum zzso zzso score of zzso was obtained to zzso which had been previously localized on zzso zzso aberrations involving this region have been previously shown to cause retinal anomalies, zzso zzso and abnormal brain zzso This region also contains the gene for North zzso zzso zzso
