Six types of zzso signal DNA sequences of the zzso Gateway cloning system were investigated as to their specificity and efficiency in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso reaction to generate an zzso clone by zzso between zzso and zzso signals which are contained in the zzso clone and the Destination zzso respectively, the zzso of various zzso and zzso pairs on six types of respective signal sequences was zzso In the zzso reaction to create an zzso clone by transferring the target DNA segment in the zzso clone or the zzso zzso product into a zzso zzso various combinations of zzso and zzso pairs were tested for their zzso in zzso The results obtained indicate a markedly higher specificity and efficiency of zzso with only the matched zzso signal pairs, such as zzso zzso and so on, compared to zzso signal pairs, such as zzso zzso and so on, thus zzso a zzso production of the positive clones in the Gateway system in which multiple zzso signals exist together in one reaction zzso Examples of rapid construction of a three or four zzso structure in the zzso are zzso
