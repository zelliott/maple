zzso respiratory zzso virus zzso is one of the major causes of bovine respiratory disease zzso In order to study the molecular epidemiology of the virus, samples from 30 zzso outbreaks in cattle zzso located in different parts of Sweden were collected from 2007 to zzso The samples were analyzed by zzso and the zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso was detected in outbreaks of respiratory disease in both dairy and zzso zzso most often during the winter period but also during the summer months zzso to zzso This indicates that circulation of the virus between zzso occurs throughout the zzso Comparative sequence analysis revealed a high degree (more than zzso of sequence identity among the collected zzso zzso analysis showed that 29 out of the 30 strains formed a unique zzso zzso sequences found in zzso sampled within a few months' time suggested that these zzso were part of a common transmission zzso One strain from a single outbreak in a zzso in southern Sweden clustered with Danish strains and showed a distant relationship to the rest of the Swedish zzso Further studies are highly warranted to clarify the zzso transmission routes of zzso Such knowledge is essential for the control of the spread of this virus between zzso regions and even zzso
