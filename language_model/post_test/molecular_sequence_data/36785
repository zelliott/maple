The segmented zzso of the adult zzso arise from a set of five, zzso paired embryonic stem cells via a stereotyped sequence of cell zzso Individual segments exhibit unique patterns of cell zzso and previous studies have suggested that each stem cell lineage establishes at least some aspects of its own zzso specificity zzso In this paper, we describe a putative zzso segment identity zzso zzso and examine its expression in the various stem cell zzso Both sequence analysis and the zzso pattern of zzso expression suggest a specific zzso to the zzso segment identity genes zzso and zzso In zzso zzso reveals a cellular zzso of zzso zzso over a zzso domain of 16 zzso segments zzso including zzso zzso muscles and the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were not detected at the stage when segment identities are first established, suggesting that zzso gene products may not be part of the initial zzso zzso Individual stem cell lineages were labeled by zzso injection of fluorescent zzso and single cell zzso of lineage zzso and zzso reaction product revealed expression of zzso zzso in the progeny of four different stem zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso was very similar in the various stem cell zzso despite the fact that some stem cells generate one founder zzso whereas other stem cells generate two founder zzso
