zzso chamber zzso were performed to test the zzso effect of different bacterial products on the migratory activity of zzso zzso The results indicate that these blood cells exhibit zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso the migration of cells through the membrane of the zzso chamber when zzso was present in the lower compartment zzso In contrast, addition of zzso to the lower as well as to the upper chamber did not increase the rate of zzso zzso Thus, zzso seemed to act as a zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that complete zzso molecules are required for cell stimulation because this did not occur when either the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso were tested zzso Unlike zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso random cell zzso The zzso which is released by bacteria, induced a higher zzso zzso when present in both zzso of the zzso chamber than in tests where it was added to the lower compartment zzso This zzso response was not zzso by the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that bacterial products may elicit zzso and/or zzso reactions in zzso from an zzso and that the type of reaction that occurs is dependent upon the nature of the molecules zzso
