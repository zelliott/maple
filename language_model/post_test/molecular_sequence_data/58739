The expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene is highly tissue zzso In order to identify zzso elements which regulate the expression of this gene in the liver, multiple deletion zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene fused to the human growth hormone gene were zzso in zzso cells, which normally produce zzso zzso expression zzso indicated the presence of negative (at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and positive (at zzso zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso cells, which do not produce zzso with the same deletion zzso resulted in a similar pattern of promoter zzso However, additional negative zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso elements were zzso zzso I footprint analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso sequences with zzso and zzso cell nuclear extracts identified seven protected zzso A, zzso zzso B, zzso C, zzso D, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and G, zzso zzso Sites A, B, C, D and E were located within regions containing negative regulatory zzso In order to determine which nuclear factor interacts with the negative zzso sites B, D and E were zzso and the effects of zzso on competition in a gel zzso zzso and on promoter activity were zzso When the binding motif for zzso in sites B, D and E was zzso the specific zzso complexes were not zzso with the zzso zzso and promoter activity increased zzso The magnitude of the increase is less than expected from the deletion analysis, and simultaneous zzso did not cause further increase in promoter activity, which suggests that other sites are involved in this negative zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the zzso in zzso cells is zzso modulated by multiple zzso negative elements and zzso nuclear factor may play some role in this zzso
