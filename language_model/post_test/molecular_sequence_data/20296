zzso zzso zzso channels play a central role in regulation of neurotransmitter zzso The zzso zzso of zzso calcium channel zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso contains synaptic protein interaction zzso site, which plays a pivotal role in efficient zzso Using zzso analysis of rat zzso and zzso spinal zzso zzso the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso which were detected in this study, have been investigated, and they showed zzso zzso The new zzso contains a large deletion in zzso zzso that produces a stop zzso which is predicted to produce a zzso zzso To study the effect of inflammatory pain on the expression pattern of these zzso animals were treated with zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso in zzso spinal zzso was zzso The results showed that chronic inflammatory pain increases the zzso zzso levels lacking zzso zzso and decreases the amount of full-length zzso which do not have any zzso zzso different zzso zzso zzso in rat nervous system and the impact of inflammatory pain on the zzso pattern suggest a possible regulatory role for calcium channel alternative zzso
