New human and mouse zzso which are zzso to human zzso gene zzso mapped on a zzso region of human zzso 21 have been zzso zzso gene structure has been determined using zzso sequences of human zzso 21 presented in zzso data zzso The analysis of human and mouse zzso gene transcripts revealed that their zzso zzso could occur in different zzso New form of zzso gene transcripts with alternatively spliced zzso domain zzso 25 and 26) was detected in different human and mouse zzso The other zzso form with absence of zzso zzso that results in reading frame shift and zzso formation was identified in the mouse adult lung and zzso In addition, we showed alternative zzso of zzso 20, 25 and part of zzso zzso
