The aim of the present study was to assess performance, feasibility and relevance of a Standard zzso zzso zzso for large-scale use in the microbial analysis of children's indoor zzso We analyzed dust settled on zzso Dust Fall Collectors zzso by using zzso which targeted 6 zzso 3 bacteria and 1 zzso chosen for their involvement in allergic or inflammatory zzso Six types of zzso zzso zzso were tested for their releasing capacity of zzso DNA from zzso spores captured by the zzso zzso zzso and detection limits of the zzso procedure were tested using zzso microbial zzso The feasibility and relevance of this sampling and analysis method were assessed in a zzso pilot zzso Our result showed that one specific make of wipe was more effective than the others in releasing zzso zzso zzso procedure showed good zzso The zzso limit was about 5 zzso zzso for all species except zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso No zzso was zzso DNA zzso in the zzso homes participating in the pilot study were between 0 and 24 zzso 0 and 69 zzso equivalent cells per zzso for the zzso and bacteria, and between 0 and 1 equivalent zzso per zzso for zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso we were able to zzso the 53 dwellings from the least to the most contaminated according to the quantity of DNA measured for each zzso Our zzso measured zzso bacteria and zzso using a cost-efficient, discreet and zzso sampling method with just one zzso zzso The whole procedure can be used for microbial analysis in large cohort studies such as the zzso study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and could help improve our understanding of the interactions between the environment, allergic diseases and child zzso
