Many human genes zzso zzso intermediate filament proteins are clustered on zzso 17 (the type I zzso and 12 (the type II zzso Some have not yet been zzso notably the genes for the primary embryonic zzso 8 and 18, normally expressed in simple zzso this is because the numerous zzso for these zzso have made it difficult to identify the true functional gene in each zzso Through the use of zzso zzso from within zzso of the published gene sequence for human type I zzso 18, human zzso DNA has been specifically amplified using the zzso chain zzso A single reaction product was zzso DNA from a characterized series of zzso zzso cell hybrid lines was tested for the presence of sequences able to initiate the chain reaction from these zzso and the presence or absence of this zzso DNA zzso product allowed us to assign a gene for human zzso 18 to zzso 12 zzso This differs from the location of other human type I zzso on zzso 17 and may indicate the early divergence of the genes for zzso cell zzso from that of simple, or zzso zzso zzso
