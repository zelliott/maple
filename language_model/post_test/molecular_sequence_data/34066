The visual zzso zzso zzso constitutes the first step in the sensory zzso cascade in the rod zzso of the zzso eye, forming the basis of vision at low light zzso In most zzso zzso is a zzso gene whose function in rod zzso is highly zzso We found evidence for a second zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso This novel gene was not the product of a zzso gene zzso event and contains a number of unique zzso acid zzso Despite these differences, expression of zzso in zzso yielded a protein that not only bound zzso producing an zzso spectrum in the visible range zzso zzso 500 zzso but also activated in response to zzso Unlike zzso zzso is not expressed during the first 4 days of embryonic zzso it is expressed in the zzso of adult fish but not the brain or zzso Similar zzso sequences were found in two other zzso species, as well as a more zzso related zzso zzso zzso While sequences were only identified in zzso fish, zzso analyses suggest an older origin for this gene zzso Our study suggests that zzso is a functional zzso gene that is expressed in the zzso later in zzso The discovery of a new previously zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso is surprising given its status as a model system for studies of zzso vision and visual zzso
