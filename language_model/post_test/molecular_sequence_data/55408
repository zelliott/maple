Our study reports the collection, zzso zzso isolation and identification of zzso from different zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were the most dominant zzso groups recorded, with the highest number being recorded for zzso zzso zzso followed by 44 zzso zzso zzso Island, zzso recorded the greatest number of algae, and zzso green algae were present in all the zzso Shannon's Diversity Index was highest in zzso zzso followed by zzso River, zzso Selective enrichment, zzso through serial dilution followed by zzso and regular observations led to the isolation of zzso zzso Identification was done by using microscopic zzso supported with standard zzso and classified as belonging to seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequencing was undertaken for four zzso The set of zzso strains were screened under standard cultural conditions for their growth zzso and Chlorella zzso zzso followed by Chlorella zzso zzso exhibited the highest growth zzso The strain zzso zzso zzso recorded highest zzso while zzso ranked highest for zzso The study aided in identifying the dominant zzso in the diverse zzso and characterizing their growth rate and zzso content, providing a valuable zzso for further zzso in agriculture and zzso
