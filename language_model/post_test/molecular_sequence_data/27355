zzso zzso play an important role in structural diversity of small zzso zzso in higher zzso We isolated a zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso zzso catalyzing zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for the first time from zzso zzso zzso exhibited a unique zzso chain zzso activity forming not only zzso but also zzso and zzso in a sequential zzso We investigated the functional properties of zzso using zzso modeling and zzso zzso and identified zzso acids positioned in the zzso pocket as crucial for providing enough space to accommodate zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso These results provide basic information for understanding and engineering the zzso functions of zzso zzso involved in zzso of plant zzso
