In order to find new drug target to eliminate the zzso resistance, the in zzso progress of zzso zzso zzso resistance was zzso and then zzso analysis was applied to comparing different protein profiles during the resistant zzso The results show that the expression of a zzso zzso component of zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso existed in zzso and zzso zzso but not in sensitive zzso In addition, the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which were obtained from the progress of zzso zzso zzso resistance, were determined by means of zzso the results show that the decrease of the zzso concentration of drug and the expression of this new protein nearly take place zzso The changes of zzso levels of the probable zzso component of ABC zzso were detected by virtue of zzso and showed that this protein did not express in the sensitive strains but expressed increasingly in the intermediate and resistant zzso In order to determine the relationships between the development of zzso resistance and this protein further, a zzso was designed to aim at the zzso of the probable zzso component of ABC zzso zzso the zzso resistance of zzso zzso was partially reduced in zzso by zzso the expression of this zzso This zzso has no effect on sensitive zzso And the comparison of drug zzso zzso between zzso strains and its control strains shows that this protein may be included in the course of active drug zzso
