It has been known that zzso zzso has an zzso requirement for zzso or selected zzso or zzso compounds for its zzso In addition, the influence of zzso on the expression of several putative zzso factors produced by this zzso has also been recently zzso however, the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso are poorly zzso We succeeded in cloning the gene coding for the zzso zzso which was specifically expressed in zzso zzso and seemed to zzso colonizing zzso Recently, we have constructed the zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in the zzso protein by zzso zzso The beige zzso exhibited little zzso and the zzso was also zzso Based on these results and zzso search analysis, we focused on assessing the zzso zzso and found the zzso regulatory motif zzso as a zzso direct binding zzso The zzso protein did possess the binding ability of selected zzso involving the zzso These results demonstrated that zzso protein is one of the zzso binding proteins in zzso zzso and suggested that zzso binding ability of zzso protein is important for the expression of zzso in zzso zzso
