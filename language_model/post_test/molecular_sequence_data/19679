zzso gene expression directly at the zzso level represents a novel approach to control cellular processes in all zzso In this respect, an zzso protein plays a key role by targeting the zzso to regulate the expression by zzso or an zzso mechanism only in the presence of their zzso zzso Although many proteins are known to use these mechanisms to regulate the gene zzso no structural insights have been revealed to date to explain how these proteins trigger the zzso for the recognition of zzso This review describes the activated zzso of zzso brought by the coordination of zzso and zzso zzso based on our recently solved crystal structures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Once the zzso is zzso the protein binds specifically to bases within the zzso region, without undergoing further structural zzso Also, a high resolution zzso zzso crystal structure of the zzso complex containing the three zzso motifs is zzso This analysis clearly demonstrates that the first base in the zzso motifs is not important for the function and is consistent with our previous zzso
