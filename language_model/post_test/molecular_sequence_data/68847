zzso zzso of human zzso zzso receptors zzso by zzso zzso using zzso zzso specific zzso zzso revealed zzso acid sequences of both zzso and insulin zzso Since this finding indicated the presence of zzso zzso hybrids, hybrid receptors were further zzso by zzso zzso using insulin zzso specific zzso zzso The molecular size of the zzso hybrid zzso was approximately zzso indicating that the zzso and insulin zzso alpha beta halves were zzso The ratio of zzso binding activity of zzso hybrid receptors was approximately 25 when measured using zzso amounts of radioactive zzso zzso binding to these receptors was inhibited by zzso and insulin with zzso of approximately 2 and approximately 1000 zzso zzso zzso binding to these receptors was similarly inhibited by zzso and insulin with zzso of approximately 3 zzso zzso and zzso activities of the hybrid zzso were zzso by zzso more effectively than insulin in a zzso zzso Thus, the present studies indicate that hybrid receptors zzso from human zzso have the functional properties of an zzso zzso
