Two zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso zzso directed against zzso protein 60 zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso also reacted with the zzso zzso previously established in this laboratory, which zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso sequence analysis, the zzso zzso sequence of the protein zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso was confirmed as the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso reported zzso Both zzso reacted with nine strains of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso reacted with extracts of other bacteria including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso reacted only with strains zzso zzso These results suggest that both the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and the common zzso zzso by zzso zzso exist on zzso of the bacterial zzso Both zzso also reacted with the zzso protein in the zzso of human gastric zzso zzso zzso It was shown by zzso zzso that gastric zzso cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with zzso zzso These results suggest that there is a common zzso in zzso zzso zzso and human gastric zzso zzso
