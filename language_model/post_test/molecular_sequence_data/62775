The zzso agent of zzso disease, zzso zzso is capable of zzso the immune defense of a variety of potential zzso zzso Previous work has shown that interaction of zzso complement regulators, factor H and factor zzso protein 1 zzso with up to five complement zzso surface proteins zzso expressed by resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complement zzso In addition expression of zzso is directly correlated with complement resistance of zzso zzso This work describes the functional characterization of zzso as the dominant factor H and zzso protein of zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso is located on the linear zzso zzso and is different from factor zzso zzso proteins that are zzso by genes localized on circular plasmids zzso zzso zzso of zzso were generated, and a high affinity binding site for factor H and zzso was mapped to the C zzso of zzso Similarly, the zzso binding site of factor H and zzso was localized to the short consensus repeat zzso Factor H and zzso maintain their zzso activity for factor zzso zzso zzso when bound to zzso and factor H is up to zzso more efficient in zzso zzso conversion than zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso binds the host complement regulators factor H and zzso with high zzso zzso is the key zzso of the complement resistance of zzso and zzso is distinct from the zzso protein zzso Thus, zzso most likely contributes to persistence of zzso zzso and to zzso of zzso zzso
