A zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso sample of an zzso slightly zzso hot spring (78 degrees zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and stained zzso at all stages of zzso It grew at zzso degrees C, with an optimum growth temperature around 78 degrees zzso At 70 degrees C, growth occurred at pH zzso with an optimum near pH zzso At the optimum temperature and zzso with 2 g zzso zzso as zzso strain zzso had a generation time of 2 zzso During growth on zzso strain zzso produced zzso hydrogen and carbon dioxide as major zzso products together with small amounts of zzso acid and zzso The strain fermented many zzso including zzso zzso starch and zzso but did not grow with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso extract and did not reduce zzso to zzso The zzso ratio of the cellular DNA was 35 zzso Comparative zzso zzso analysis placed strain zzso among species of zzso The closest relative was zzso zzso zzso of total DNA showed zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso A new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
