zzso cells can recognize and destroy a broad range of cells, including many tumor cells and zzso infected cells, yet spare most normal zzso Identification of the target structure recognized by these cells has proved zzso An attractive hypothesis is that, unlike B cells and T cells that recognize a specific foreign marker, zzso cells respond to the absence of a zzso zzso Class I zzso molecules have been implicated as the self markers whose absence can trigger zzso We show here that normal cells are zzso on incubation with zzso zzso cells if peptides that can bind to the class I zzso molecules of the normal cells are also included in the zzso and speculate that this binding is somehow removing a self marker that normally protects a cell from zzso zzso cells were derived from zzso of young (5 to 8 zzso old) zzso nude zzso zzso or nude zzso zzso mice incubated with 1000 zzso zzso and target cells were derived from zzso of normal zzso or zzso mice incubated with Con zzso zzso were from zzso zzso self, and zzso self protein sequences and included sequences specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso All peptides increased zzso of those targets to which they could zzso
