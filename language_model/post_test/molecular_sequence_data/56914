The zzso zzso zzso binding zzso extracted from zzso by affinity zzso was comprised of large molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso preparation revealed it to contain 2 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These zzso had similar zzso acid profiles, possessed identical zzso sequences and reacted equally to a bank of zzso zzso zzso By zzso Western blots with various zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso contains complex zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso is the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was distinct from other zzso zzso binding zzso Light zzso in combination with zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso class of zzso zzso of these cells resulted in the release of the zzso zzso incorporation studies followed by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the fat body was the major site of zzso zzso Similar studies with zzso zzso did not result in the production of zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso
