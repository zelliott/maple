We have used a differential cloning approach to isolate zzso frontier sequences from zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso was cloned and shown not to be physically linked with the zzso zzso This zzso zzso contained the zzso sequences found immediately downstream of the zzso gene and included an array of zzso repetitions and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was flanked by a member of the novel zzso low copy repetitive element zzso Three individual zzso repeats were zzso and all members of this family were shown to lie clustered at two zzso sites, one of which contained the zzso zzso One of the zzso elements contained an zzso of 297 zzso that showed extensive zzso to sequences within at least three other zzso zzso Each zzso region was flanked by members of the zzso family of short zzso repetitive zzso zzso and by its target zzso zzso suggesting multiple zzso zzso The data are discussed in terms of the evolution of the zzso gene zzso
