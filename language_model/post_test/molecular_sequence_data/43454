We have previously observed that zzso a ubiquitous zinc finger zzso factor, is zzso during terminal differentiation in the whole animal, and this results in decreased DNA binding activity zzso zzso zzso Armstrong, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Mueller, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso II zzso is able to zzso the C zzso of zzso and results in a decrease in DNA binding zzso This suggests that zzso may be responsible for the observed regulation of zzso zzso of a consensus zzso site at zzso acid zzso within the second zinc finger, eliminates zzso of this site and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis confirms the presence of a zzso site at zzso as well as additional sites within the C zzso No gross changes in zzso zzso levels were seen during zzso associated with liver zzso The zzso zzso zzso was identified as the zzso liver nuclear protein able to zzso zzso but again no gross changes in activity were observed in the zzso zzso zzso acid treatment of zzso cells increases zzso zzso and zzso its DNA binding activity suggesting that steady state levels of zzso zzso are established by a balance between zzso and zzso zzso
