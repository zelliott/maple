The hydrogen exchange zzso of 68 individual zzso zzso in the native state of zzso zzso have been measured at pH zzso and 30 degrees C by zzso zzso zzso These constitute the most protected subset of zzso with exchange half lives some zzso times longer than anticipated from studies of small model zzso The observed distribution of rates under these conditions can be rationalized to a large extent in terms of the hydrogen bonding of individual zzso and their burial from bulk zzso Exchange rates have also been measured in a zzso zzso state of zzso this was made possible under very mild conditions, pH zzso 35 degrees C, by lowering the stability of the native state through selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this state the exchange rates for the majority of zzso approach, within a factor of 5, the values anticipated from small model zzso For a few zzso however, there is evidence for significant zzso (up to nearly zzso relative to the predicted zzso The pattern of protection observed under these conditions does not reflect the behavior of the protein under strongly native conditions, suggesting that regions of zzso structure do not persist significantly in the zzso state of zzso zzso The pattern of exchange rates from the native protein at high temperature, pH zzso 69 degrees C, resembles that of the zzso state, suggesting that under these conditions the exchange zzso are dominated by transient global zzso The rates of folding and unfolding under these conditions were determined independently by zzso transfer zzso methods, enabling the intrinsic exchange rates from the zzso state to be deduced on the basis of this model, under conditions where the zzso equilibrium species is the native zzso Again, in the case of most zzso these rates showed only limited zzso from those predicted by a simple random zzso zzso This reinforces the view that these zzso states of zzso have little persistent residual order and contrasts with the behavior found for compact partially folded states of zzso including an intermediate detected zzso during the zzso of zzso zzso
