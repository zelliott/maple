zzso zzso associated protein zzso is a zzso protein that zzso to zzso arms and zzso zzso during zzso and to the nucleus, with enrichment in the zzso during zzso The critical function of zzso is underscored by the finding that its depletion in zzso cells results in various zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is found zzso in multiple zzso and its expression levels often correlate with the aggressiveness of zzso Due to its zzso on zzso arms and combination of zzso and zzso properties, zzso takes a special place within the extensive group of zzso assembly zzso In this study, we identify a zzso domain that shows DNA binding in zzso with a preference for zzso zzso of the zzso domain zzso zzso arm binding of zzso during zzso but is not sufficient to abrogate its zzso zzso after zzso zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso experiments revealed the highly dynamic nature of this zzso interaction during zzso In zzso cells, zzso also interacts with zzso through its zzso domain, as evident from its enrichment on dense zzso regions and zzso mobility, measured by zzso correlation zzso The obtained results are in agreement with a model where zzso zzso zzso newly formed zzso on zzso zzso to enhance zzso positioning without zzso these zzso zzso zzso interaction suggests additional functions for zzso as recently identified for other nuclear zzso assembly factors with a role in gene expression or DNA damage zzso
