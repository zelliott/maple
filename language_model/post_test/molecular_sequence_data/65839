One of the mechanisms of functioning for viral zzso zzso enhancers zzso located in 3' zzso regions zzso is 3' zzso leader long-distance base zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that the zzso 3' zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso which must base pair with the zzso zzso to facilitate zzso Here we compared translation strategies employed by zzso zzso and zzso by using zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso reporter zzso in plant zzso zzso mechanisms, based on 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso base pairing and zzso zzso were found zzso between zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso entry at the zzso leader occurred, at least partly, via an internal zzso entry site zzso Two zzso leader segments complementary to plant zzso zzso enhanced zzso A model for zzso zzso translation, involving zzso zzso zzso recruitment and long-distance zzso zzso zzso base zzso is zzso
