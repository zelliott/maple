zzso acid interactions are crucial in the regulation of many fundamental cellular zzso The nature of these interactions is susceptible to analysis by a variety of methods, but the combination of high zzso power and technical simplicity offered by the gel zzso zzso zzso technique has made this perhaps the most widely used such method over the last zzso This procedure is based on the observation that the formation of zzso complexes generally reduces the zzso mobility of the zzso acid component in the gel zzso This review attempts to give a simplified account of the physical basis of the behavior of zzso acid complexes in gels and an overview of many of the applications in which the technique has proved especially zzso The factors which contribute most to the resolution of the complex from the naked zzso acid are the gel pore size, the relative mass of protein compared with zzso acid, and changes in zzso acid zzso zzso induced by zzso The consequences of induced zzso on the mobility of zzso DNA fragments are similar to those arising from zzso zzso and the latter can be used to help characterize the angle and direction of zzso zzso Whether a complex formed in solution is actually detected as a retarded band on a gel depends not only on resolution but also on complex stability within the zzso This is strongly influenced by the composition and, particularly, the zzso strength of the gel zzso We discuss the applications of the technique to analyzing complex formation and stability, including characterizing cooperative zzso defining binding sites on zzso zzso analyzing DNA zzso in complexes, assessing binding to zzso DNA, defining protein complexes by using cell zzso and analyzing biological processes such as zzso and zzso
