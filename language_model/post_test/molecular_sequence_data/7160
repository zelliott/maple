Dynamic regulation of zzso transport is essential for zzso as cells confront changes in their zzso The gene zzso encodes a novel component of this regulatory circuit in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso improves growth of zzso cells exposed to toxic zzso of sodium and zzso and suppresses the salt sensitivity zzso by zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso display salt zzso The sequence of zzso gives little clue to its zzso However, zzso in zzso zzso zzso associated with changes in zzso expression suggest that zzso activity may directly increase zzso zzso and decrease zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso a putative plasma membrane zzso pump whose expression is salt zzso Acting in concert with zzso zzso is necessary for full zzso of zzso zzso This functional zzso is also reflected in the participation of both proteins in recovery from zzso growth zzso Recently, zzso was isolated as a gene (named zzso which when zzso partially zzso loss of zzso of zzso zzso in zzso lacking the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso influences cell cycle control and zzso zzso acting in parallel to the protein zzso zzso and zzso
