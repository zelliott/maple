The zzso zzso agent zzso forms zzso zzso zzso between the zzso positions of zzso zzso on opposite strands of the zzso For zzso zzso these zzso predominate within zzso zzso where N is any zzso We used zzso zzso gel zzso zzso to examine the role of zzso in the zzso reaction, subjecting a restriction zzso to zzso with zzso zzso or zzso DNA zzso generated by each zzso were isolated by zzso and the sites of zzso were identified by sequencing gel analysis of DNA fragments generated by hot zzso zzso We found that the zzso consensus sequence of zzso zzso is zzso but the efficiencies of zzso vary, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results help explain the observed differences between the biological activities of zzso zzso
