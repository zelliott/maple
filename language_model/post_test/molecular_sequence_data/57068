The specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso induced by the zzso loop zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso of zzso was clarified by analyzing their zzso with various avian zzso and their reaction with synthetic peptides zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso for the zzso acid at certain zzso The zzso zzso of zzso plays a dominant role in the zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso also contribute to the binding of two zzso zzso zzso zzso number 125 and zzso These zzso although remote in zzso are grouped together in the crystal structure of zzso and may form an area of contact with the zzso Contributions by zzso zzso and zzso to the binding of the two zzso to zzso were zzso These results support the idea that the zzso zzso zzso recognize a zzso type of zzso which is similar to that of native zzso The zzso of the reduced and zzso form of zzso zzso was also tested, but it failed to induce an zzso zzso
