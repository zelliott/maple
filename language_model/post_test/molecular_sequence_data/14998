zzso import into zzso depends on a complex and dynamic network of zzso zzso zzso is a central component of the zzso import machinery and binds the soluble receptors zzso and zzso which have important function in the assembly of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that the zzso domain of zzso zzso adopts a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind competitively to the same surface in zzso albeit with opposite zzso The molecular recognition involves zzso aromatic side chains in the zzso zzso motif and a newly identified zzso sequence in zzso The zzso complex structure reveals molecular details for a critical interaction in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso located in the zzso binding region disrupt zzso and/or zzso binding in zzso The corresponding full-length zzso zzso are impaired in zzso membrane zzso in zzso showing that the molecular interactions zzso by the zzso domain zzso zzso targeting of zzso
