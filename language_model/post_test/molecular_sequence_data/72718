The human blood group zzso zzso are expressed by proteins zzso by a pair of highly zzso genes located at zzso zzso One of the genes zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso while the other zzso the D zzso Point zzso in the zzso gene generate the zzso and zzso zzso while it has been shown that an zzso gene deletion can generate the zzso zzso We have analyzed zzso 4 of the zzso and zzso genes and have defined the site of an zzso deletion located in this zzso Using a multiplex zzso typing zzso which combines a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso which zzso this zzso zzso and a pair of zzso located in zzso 10 of the zzso zzso we have analyzed zzso different zzso DNA samples derived from individuals expressing zzso zzso weak D, and partial D zzso Of these, we have noted a significant zzso with our multiplex zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso (which have been previously zzso and weak D zzso Our results suggest that in five zzso zzso individuals we have identified an apparently intact zzso zzso zzso analysis of transcripts obtained from one of these individuals (of zzso zzso illustrates the presence of full-length zzso zzso which have a point zzso at zzso 121 zzso zzso zzso which generates an zzso stop zzso zzso Thus, we describe a different molecular basis for generating the zzso zzso to the complete zzso gene deletion described zzso We also show that there are zzso with zzso and the multiplex zzso in weak D and partial D zzso indicating that the underlying molecular basis can be zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso assume the complete absence of the zzso gene in zzso zzso We describe a different molecular basis for generating the zzso zzso to the complete zzso gene deletion described zzso
