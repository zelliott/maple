In the ecologically important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a functional zzso that zzso increased tolerance to zzso stress and that is zzso inside the roots during early steps of the zzso with host zzso It is still unclear whether its expression is directed at scavenging zzso oxygen species zzso produced by the host, if it plays a role in the zzso dialogue, or if it is a consequence of zzso stress from the surrounding zzso All these possibilities are equally zzso and molecular variation at the zzso locus can possibly have zzso implications for one or all of the three mentioned zzso In this paper, we analyzed the diversity of the zzso gene in six zzso species, as well as 14 zzso zzso zzso from a single natural zzso By sequencing this zzso we identified a large amount of zzso and zzso acid molecular diversity both among zzso species and individuals, suggesting a rapid divergence of its zzso The zzso gene was zzso within each isolate we zzso and quantitative zzso strongly suggest this locus is present as a single copy in zzso zzso zzso analyses performed using a variety of models for zzso evolution indicated that a number of zzso acid sites most likely evolved under the regime of positive selection among zzso zzso In addition, we found that some zzso of zzso zzso from a natural population harbor very divergent zzso zzso zzso and our analysis suggested that diversifying selection, rather than zzso was responsible for the persistence of this molecular diversity within the zzso zzso
