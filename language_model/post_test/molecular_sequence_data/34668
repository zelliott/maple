zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso or inflammation through binding to their specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have previously reported zzso and cell zzso synthetic zzso which were designed based on the crystal structure of a zzso complex and the zzso of the zzso acid sequence among the death zzso family zzso Here we show that, among these death zzso zzso the zzso zzso specifically arrested cell proliferation and promoted cell zzso of fetal rat zzso zzso cells, and promoted zzso outgrowth from zzso zzso cultured with the addition of the zzso or cultured on a zzso zzso Furthermore, among these death zzso zzso marked zzso outgrowth was observed only when the zzso were cultured on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso from the zzso positively zzso with an zzso against zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso promotes zzso differentiation of the zzso neural stem cells and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel may be a useful material for assisting neural stem cell zzso
