The avian acute leukemia virus zzso zzso a mixed zzso leukemia in chicken and carries two distinct zzso zzso and zzso It was shown that there exist two zzso zzso in humans, zzso and zzso which were mapped to human zzso 11 and 21, zzso The human zzso zzso locus was shown to zzso from zzso 11 to 9 or 4 in certain patients with acute zzso zzso In order to understand the functional role of zzso zzso we have made a zzso library from zzso cells and isolated seven zzso positive zzso zzso Analysis of two zzso clones revealed a complete open reading frame of the zzso zzso Except for 81 zzso at the zzso zzso of initiation zzso and 39 zzso at the zzso zzso of termination zzso the zzso zzso is approximately zzso zzso to zzso zzso sequences and encodes a zzso protein zzso which contains zzso zzso and 3' regions of the zzso zzso as in the case of zzso zzso analysis also revealed alternative zzso giving rise to another related zzso zzso zzso lacking 87 zzso zzso Our results suggest that differential zzso zzso allows the synthesis of at least two related zzso zzso from a single zzso zzso
