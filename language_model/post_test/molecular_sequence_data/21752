Marine zzso undergo a wide range of environmental zzso especially high and variable zzso which may induce zzso stress through the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso While light and zzso could act zzso on the impairment of photosynthesis, inducing zzso and zzso zzso II repair, zzso to high zzso is also thought to zzso resistance to other zzso To identify the respective roles of light and zzso in the zzso process and detect a possible zzso tolerance to zzso stress, we compared the zzso and zzso responses of zzso zzso zzso zzso to low light zzso or high light zzso to zzso stress, induced by hydrogen zzso zzso or zzso While zzso activity was much more affected in zzso than in zzso cells, only zzso cells were able to recover growth and photosynthesis after the addition of 25 zzso zzso Depending upon light conditions and zzso zzso the latter zzso agent induced zzso II zzso through both direct damage to the reaction centers and zzso of its repair zzso Although the global zzso response appeared similar in zzso and zzso cells, some processes were specifically induced in zzso cells that seemingly helped them withstand zzso stress, including enhancement of zzso and zzso detoxification, repair of zzso damage, and regulation of zzso zzso zzso of putative zzso binding sites allowed the identification of the putative zzso zzso which was zzso in zzso compared with zzso cells but zzso by zzso stress under both growth zzso
