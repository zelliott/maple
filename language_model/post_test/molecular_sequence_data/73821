The cardiac zzso zzso of the zzso zzso C zzso gene contains five protein binding regions, four of which bind zzso specific zzso We screened a stage 11 chick zzso expression library with a zzso zzso probe consisting of one of these regions, zzso One of the clones obtained was the chicken high mobility group zzso zzso An zzso gel mobility shift zzso zzso showed a specific binding interaction between the zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso contains at least one possible zzso binding region and it is in the zzso sequence overlapping a known zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of this zzso binding region diminishes its protein binding ability and markedly decreases its cardiac specific zzso zzso zzso is a DNA zzso protein that is predominantly found in the nucleus in zzso cells and in the zzso of terminally differentiated zzso It is an integral and stabilizing factor in the zzso zzso zzso complex and is often described as an zzso zzso zzso It markedly stimulates the zzso of many zzso often in association with zzso zzso zzso We believe that the presence of zzso in the zzso binding protein complex of zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso the DNA binding and interaction of other zzso factors zzso zzso which also binds to this zzso This would result in increased zzso of the zzso gene during the proliferation phase of embryonic cardiac zzso zzso
