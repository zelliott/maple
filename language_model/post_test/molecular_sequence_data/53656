A novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso scaffold protein zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso cells using a zzso screening zzso zzso was found to be highly expressed in brain and exhibited lower levels of expression in zzso heart, zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso is characterized by several putative zzso interaction zzso suggesting that zzso may be a component of a larger protein complex in the zzso Although zzso does not harbor a predicted membrane spanning zzso the protein was observed to be associated with the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso screening revealed that zzso zzso strongly with the General zzso for zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor for the zzso factor family of zzso zzso zzso interactions were also demonstrated in zzso and in zzso cells in which zzso was shown to enhance zzso association with the plasma zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso zzso factors at the plasma membrane in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso may zzso signaling by this family of small zzso
