zzso has been widely used for zzso treatment of gastric zzso however, intrinsic and acquired zzso remains an obstacle to successful zzso The mechanisms underlying zzso resistance are still not well zzso Here we report the construction and application of a partially zzso zzso library of 4 zzso zzso small interfering zzso to identify novel genes whose suppression zzso zzso resistance in gastric cancer cells zzso From 12 resistant cell zzso two small interfering zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were identified and zzso We identified a previously zzso zzso role for zzso zzso suppression resulted in significant zzso resistance and zzso to zzso and zzso in various gastric cancer cell zzso zzso suppression promoted zzso resistance through zzso zzso partially by zzso the zzso ratio that was abolished by zzso zzso zzso suppression induced zzso partially by increasing drug zzso in an zzso cassette zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer resistance zzso but not zzso were zzso and targeted zzso of zzso and zzso could partially reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso could reverse zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance in zzso gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso could partially reverse zzso but not zzso resistance induced by zzso suppression, suggesting zzso but not zzso was a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might be a target to overcome zzso resistance and provide a novel approach to identifying candidate genes that suppress zzso of gastric zzso
