We have studied the zzso of zzso of zzso vinyl zzso and zzso zzso by four zzso of the zzso family, namely zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and protein zzso from zzso zzso The kinetic properties of zzso of the zzso family have been compared to those of a series of zzso and zzso zzso including human pancreatic zzso guinea pig pancreatic zzso related protein 2, zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso liver zzso and zzso A from zzso zzso zzso indicate that human zzso together with other zzso zzso are active on short chain zzso and zzso water zzso zzso vinyl zzso and olive oil, whereas the action of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso is restricted to solutions of short chain zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be differentiated by their respective value of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of short chain zzso Among zzso zzso those possessing a lid domain display higher activity on zzso zzso and olive oil zzso then, that the lid structure contributes to zzso binding to zzso Progress reaction zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso with lid domain show a zzso phase which is not observed with human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso devoid of a lid structure as zzso
