A full-length zzso for a rat type II zzso zzso was cloned by zzso from a rat zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso containing a single zzso domain and an zzso zzso domain with predicted zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence is zzso and zzso identical in the coding region with the previously cloned mouse and human type II zzso zzso and only zzso identical in the coding region with the previously cloned rat type zzso zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso on the zzso level of type II zzso zzso in immature rat zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
