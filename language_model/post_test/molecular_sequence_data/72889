We have isolated a novel, high Mr protein from human retinal zzso zzso cells and zzso cells by affinity zzso on zzso zzso Two zzso are present on zzso of the 8 M zzso zzso with apparent molecular mass of approximately 210 and 47 zzso In the absence of zzso the two zzso migrate as one protein band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 550 zzso zzso as this zzso is tentatively named, is present in retinal zzso zzso and zzso cells of several species, but could not be detected in the zzso cells we zzso zzso zzso using an zzso to the zzso zzso revealed a zzso network in the zzso of cultured zzso This zzso was used to identify a zzso for zzso in a bovine zzso zzso cell expression zzso zzso data indicate a high degree of identity with zzso zzso II heavy zzso We subsequently found that zzso had an zzso zzso activity, zzso with zzso in cells, and reacted on Western blots with a zzso zzso II heavy chain zzso The protein was also recognized by zzso specific for zzso heavy chain zzso A, but did not react with zzso B zzso Although zzso has several features in common with known forms of zzso zzso II, the distinctly unconventional features it displays suggest that it is a novel zzso
