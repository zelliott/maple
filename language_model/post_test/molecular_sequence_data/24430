Using a fluorescent differential display zzso technique, a novel zzso was identified by screening for gene expressed zzso between the zzso zzso cell line and the zzso cell line, an isolated zzso of the zzso cell line that has high zzso potential to the zzso zzso cloning of the zzso revealed the clone has similarity to a bacterial zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and competitive reverse zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso of the gene in the zzso cell zzso An zzso Master zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed abundantly in zzso heart, liver, and zzso A human expressed sequence tag zzso database search suggested that a similar zzso is expressed in zzso A gene with identical sequence is located on zzso 13 in the zzso database zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that a zzso zzso zzso may exist in zzso including zzso
