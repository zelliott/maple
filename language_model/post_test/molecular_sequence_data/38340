A complete DNA copy of the zzso of a zzso Lynn strain of zzso virus zzso zzso was assembled from zzso fragments such that an exact zzso zzso could be generated following zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso delta virus zzso The zzso containing the zzso zzso together with support plasmids which express zzso virus zzso zzso and L proteins under control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter, were zzso into zzso cells previously infected with zzso zzso virus zzso that expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso of infectious virus from the zzso zzso was demonstrated by amplification of zzso virus from zzso cultures and by subsequent consensus sequencing of reverse zzso products generated from zzso zzso to verify the presence of specific zzso tags introduced into the zzso zzso zzso The only coding change zzso zzso A to zzso in the zzso clone relative to the consensus sequence of the zzso Lynn plaque isolate from which it was zzso resulting in a zzso substitution at zzso acid 22 of the L zzso did not prevent rescue of zzso virus, even though an zzso acid alignment for the L proteins of zzso indicates that zzso is highly zzso at that zzso This system may provide the basis of a safe and effective virus zzso for the in zzso expression of zzso and biologically active zzso zzso and zzso
