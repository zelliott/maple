zzso relationships in the zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso were zzso by genetic selection techniques in zzso zzso As described in the preceding paper, zzso require a functional zzso (or zzso to grow on a zzso carbon zzso zzso of zzso that could not grow on zzso were subjected to selection for spontaneous zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso proved amenable to this approach, yielding colonies on zzso plates at modest zzso All zzso analyzed were single point zzso within the zzso gene at a different site than the zzso zzso zzso gave the largest number (11) of unique zzso while zzso gave only four and zzso gave none, thus, there was a zzso of effect in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 14 of the 15 zzso zzso affected 13 different zzso acids in a narrow sector of the zzso zzso map, near the zzso zzso These zzso are proposed to be in, or very near, the membrane on the opposite side from the zzso zzso zzso zzso wheel projections of the zzso segments show, with one exception, that zzso and charged zzso fall within half of each zzso These zzso appear either to line the throat of the membrane channel, or to be involved in zzso contacts near the zzso face of the inner zzso zzso These zzso place further limitations on the organization of the zzso zzso We present a model of the zzso zzso channel based on these zzso The region defined by these zzso is zzso linked to the zzso cluster through the function of the zzso zzso zzso structures defined by multiple zzso zzso will likely be a common feature of similar zzso schemes, especially when applied to membrane transport zzso We propose these functionally mapped regions of proteins be named zzso units or zzso for zzso
