zzso is an important ornamental plant but the study of its functional zzso is zzso zzso zzso is a fast-growing zzso zzso Several characteristics including low zzso number, small zzso size, short growth period, and its ability to complete its life cycle in zzso make zzso zzso a good model candidate and parent for zzso for zzso Although genetic information remains zzso systematic molecular analysis of its zzso zzso might provide useful genetic zzso By combining bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones and next-generation sequencing zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso accurately, efficiently and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso shares 89 and zzso similarity with zzso zzso Ramsey and zzso zzso zzso Comparing these 3 zzso zzso 5 regions have been identified as showing zzso Using zzso analysis of 19 species belonging to the zzso zzso a zzso deletion was found in the zzso region of the zzso zzso Because commercial zzso varieties in Taiwan are zzso identification of potential parents using molecular breeding method has become very zzso To demonstrate the relationship between zzso position and hybrid zzso of zzso zzso 4 DNA regions of 36 zzso adapted zzso varieties have been zzso The results indicated that zzso and zzso were suitable for zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be zzso closer to zzso and zzso than zzso despite its similar floral appearance to zzso These results indicate the hybrid zzso of zzso zzso its zzso zzso providing important information for zzso zzso
