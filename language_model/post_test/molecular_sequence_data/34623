Regulatory elements of the zzso region of the zzso gene zzso were zzso to zzso pathological zzso of zzso zzso expression during zzso zzso 

Various fragments of the zzso promoter were cloned into the zzso reporter zzso and the respective promoter activity was determined by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso factor binding was identified using zzso zzso 

The region encompassing base pairs zzso to zzso was identified as crucial for zzso gene zzso Down regulator sequences are present upstream zzso to zzso and downstream zzso and zzso of this core promoter zzso zzso activity is significantly enhanced by substituting G at the zzso positions zzso and zzso for C and zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as relevant for regulating expression of zzso 

We identified three separate zzso elements within the zzso zzso promoter, one ensuring zzso levels of expression and two elements limiting expression to relatively low zzso The zzso of zzso factor binding might help to explain high-level expression of zzso in a variety of solid zzso The zzso sites appear important for the increased risk of breast and/or zzso cancer for zzso zzso zzso
