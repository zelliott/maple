The B chain of zzso zzso contains appropriately spaced zzso acids that predict recognition by T zzso However, all T cell clones from an zzso zzso diabetic donor recognize zzso associated with the A chain, and the B chain was found to inhibit these zzso zzso zzso competition at the level of the zzso not a direct effect on the T cell, is responsible for the zzso zzso B chain contains two clusters of zzso acid zzso with the zzso beta chain and B chain peptides lacking these clusters do not compete for zzso zzso A hole in the repertoire for T cells that recognize this portion of the insulin zzso may arise in the zzso by deletion of T cells that recognize similar zzso
