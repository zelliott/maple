zzso zzso is one of the key properties in functional zzso of zzso Support zzso machines zzso have been widely used for automated prediction of zzso zzso zzso methods differ in the protein zzso schemes zzso In this study, we present two methods for protein zzso to be used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compositions with reduced zzso acid zzso for larger values of zzso and zzso sequence similarity scores based on whole sequence and zzso zzso We tested the methods on a common zzso data set that consists of zzso zzso proteins with four zzso zzso As a result of zzso zzso tests, the zzso with zzso compositions provided the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso percent for zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso where the overall accuracy was zzso zzso The second method provided zzso zzso zzso and zzso percent zzso for individual locations and zzso percent overall zzso A hybrid system, which we called zzso makes a final decision based on the results of the two presented methods which achieved an overall accuracy of zzso percent, which is better than the achievements of many of the existing zzso The new system also outperformed the recent methods in the experiments conducted on a zzso zzso test zzso
