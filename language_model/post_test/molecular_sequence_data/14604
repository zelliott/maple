zzso systems dedicated to DNA end zzso in preparation for zzso zzso zzso are present in all zzso of zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cooperate with the highly zzso zzso and zzso proteins during zzso DNA zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso must interact in a complex with specific zzso zzso to process DNA ends zzso We determine zzso that zzso folds in a zzso zzso of intertwined zzso zzso The central channel of the zzso zzso is too narrow for zzso DNA but appears well suited to accommodate one or two strands of an zzso zzso We map a critical interface of the complex to an exposed zzso zzso of zzso abutting the active zzso Based upon the presented evidence, we propose alternative mechanisms of DNA end processing by the zzso zzso
