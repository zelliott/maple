zzso have been studied in zzso and bacteria, but their biological significance to zzso organisms is virtually zzso However, there is increasing evidence that specific, timed transcript degradation is critical for regulation of many cellular zzso including early development and zzso zzso In this report we have investigated the effects of the zzso zzso zzso on the development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso interference results in zzso that fail to complete zzso zzso where the outer layer of cells normally closes over the zzso in a zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is involved in a critical aspect of zzso movement and reveal an unexpected link between zzso stability and zzso Because zzso is highly zzso in all zzso it is possible that it plays a role in similar zzso processes such as zzso or zzso closure in zzso and wound healing in zzso In contrast to work in human tissue culture cells, where the zzso zzso has been shown to be the most important for degradation of zzso our work shows that the zzso degradation zzso is zzso important at a critical stage of development in zzso zzso We have also investigated whether zzso can influence the response of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso plays a zzso but not crucial role in this zzso
