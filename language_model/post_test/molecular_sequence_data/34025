zzso zzso is a bulk degradation system for zzso components and is zzso found in zzso zzso zzso is induced under zzso conditions and plays a zzso role by degrading unwanted zzso zzso The zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and acts to introduce zzso in the host zzso via zzso zzso particles zzso localized in the zzso Here we show that selective zzso zzso zzso zzso by eliminating zzso zzso from the zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso are targeted to zzso by an interaction with zzso We propose that selective zzso safeguards zzso integrity against excessive zzso zzso caused during zzso zzso by zzso elements in zzso zzso
