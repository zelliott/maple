zzso relationships underlying zzso properties are very limited that makes these zzso interesting for protein engineering zzso Therefore in the current study, a zzso zzso that was isolated from zzso zzso zzso with the ability of zzso zzso besides its zzso and zzso activity is zzso The extensive application of this zzso is limited by its low expression level in zzso zzso Based on sequence alignments and structural studies, three single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso are introduced using zzso zzso to evaluate the role of zzso located in the zzso segment close to the zzso copper zzso zzso of zzso acid with less zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso increase zzso zzso zzso and total activity zzso zzso which is accompanied by a significant increase in the expression level up to 3 zzso zzso characterization and structural studies using zzso CD and zzso zzso reveal the importance of zzso zzso loop in the zzso functional expression and zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows that zzso specificity is left zzso
