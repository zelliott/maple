zzso zzso receptors zzso mediate a variety of responses to zzso in the central nervous zzso A primary role for zzso zzso is to inhibit neurotransmitter release from zzso zzso but the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso trafficking and activity of zzso zzso are not well zzso Here, we describe the interaction of zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso alpha zzso The zzso zzso terminal zzso region was expressed as a zzso fusion protein and incubated with rat brain extract to purify potential zzso zzso These studies yielded a single prominent zzso zzso protein of 55 zzso which subsequent zzso analysis revealed to be alpha zzso zzso zzso confirmed that full-length zzso and alpha zzso interact in rat brain as well as in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso a zzso zzso of zzso In addition, protein overlay experiments showed that the CT domain of zzso binds specifically to zzso zzso and zzso but not to bovine serum zzso Further pull-down studies revealed that another zzso zzso zzso also interacts with alpha zzso indicating that the binding region is not localized to the zzso regions of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Indeed, deletion zzso experiments revealed that the alpha zzso site is located within zzso acids zzso of the zzso CT domain, a region known to be important for regulation of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso in cells results in an immediate and significant decrease in alpha zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso interaction may provide a mechanism to control access of the CT domain to regulatory zzso or zzso that this interaction may lead to zzso changes in the zzso membrane in response to zzso zzso
