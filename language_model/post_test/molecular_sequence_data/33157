Two recently reported bacterial strains that are able to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were further characterized to clarify their zzso zzso The two zzso designated zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and strictly zzso zzso were irregular zzso zzso zzso in zzso The two strains were resistant to zzso and zzso zzso was zzso as an electron zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strains zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the strains cluster within the zzso zzso but are related only zzso to all recognized zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso traits as well as zzso analysis support the conclusion that these two strains represent a novel species of a new zzso in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
