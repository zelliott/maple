zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis is best zzso by detailed characterization of the associated D zzso 

zzso D types were characterized using molecular zzso zzso sequencing, extended zzso D zzso zzso and flow zzso D zzso zzso 

We discovered three novel weak D types termed weak D zzso zzso 75, and 76 with zzso zzso zzso coding for zzso acid exchanges in predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso and 240 D sites per red blood cell were found, zzso zzso zzso D zzso mapping of these three weak D types demonstrated the expression of all tested D zzso zzso molecular typing of the three investigated samples by zzso gene zzso scanning zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso yielded a negative reaction for zzso located in zzso 9 and could be explained by specific zzso for weak D zzso zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso and 76 zzso 

All novel weak D types expressed all tested D zzso It is of interest that for weak D zzso zzso 75, and 76, similar zzso with a zzso divergence of one zzso acid only, that is, weak D zzso 45, 41, and 68, respectively, have been reported so zzso
