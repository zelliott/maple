Human zzso 8 zzso zzso displays zzso zzso acid identity with human zzso zzso and shares an overall zzso structure and zzso zzso protein zzso signaling with its cellular zzso However, zzso is distinct in that it can signal through zzso alone, in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso To investigate the structural requirements for zzso independence of zzso a series of expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins was zzso The replacement of zzso zzso with three zzso zzso implicated in zzso independence from zzso studies or the A and C zzso containing these zzso did not zzso zzso independence to zzso The zzso and zzso regions of zzso could be zzso with zzso sequences with the retention of zzso zzso but zzso of other regions of zzso zzso A, zzso loop, zzso B, zzso C, and zzso half of zzso zzso with equivalent sequences of zzso abolished zzso zzso Interestingly, the B zzso of zzso was absolutely required for zzso independence, despite the fact that this region contains no zzso zzso Point zzso analysis of zzso C, which contains zzso involved in physical and functional interactions with zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso that was able to signal and zzso zzso only in the presence of zzso zzso was also found to stabilize zzso zzso induced by a zzso D zzso zzso of zzso that was nonetheless able to signal independently of zzso Together, our data reveal the crucial importance of overall zzso structure and zzso for zzso signaling and provide functional and physical evidence of the stabilization of zzso zzso signaling complexes by zzso
