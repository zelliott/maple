The zzso zzso 2 zzso is important for embryonic primitive zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso in human is zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso In this study, we generated a zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and examined its relevance as a model of human zzso 

zzso zzso at zzso stage were injected with zzso zzso zzso In some experiments, the zzso were treated with a specific zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso stimulation on zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling were evaluated at zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso significantly increased zzso as zzso by flow zzso based on zzso population in zzso zzso zzso The response was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso These responses were also ameliorated by zzso zzso zzso or treatment with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso model shared many features with human zzso and might provide us with zzso insights of this zzso
