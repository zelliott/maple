The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso envelope inner membrane protein whose transit zzso has structural properties typical of a zzso zzso To study the zzso transit zzso in more detail, we constructed two zzso genes encompassing the zzso transit zzso and either 5 or 23 zzso zzso of the mature zzso both linked to the reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso The precursors were zzso in zzso and zzso to and processed in zzso plant zzso However, this import was not specific since both precursors were also imported into isolated zzso To extend this analysis in zzso the zzso genes were introduced into tobacco by genetic zzso Analysis of zzso distribution in zzso zzso of transgenic plants did not confirm the data obtained in zzso With the construct retaining only 5 zzso of the mature zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso Extension of the zzso transit zzso to 23 zzso of the mature zzso allowed specific import and processing of zzso into zzso These results indicate that, despite its unusual structure, the zzso transit zzso is able to target a passenger protein specifically into zzso provided that zzso zzso of the mature zzso are still zzso The zzso between the in zzso and in zzso data suggests that the zzso machinery is more stringent in the latter case and that sorting of proteins might not be addressed adequately by in zzso zzso
