The fragile X syndrome, the leading cause of inherited mental zzso is due to the zzso of the fragile mental zzso 1 gene zzso and the subsequent absence of its gene product zzso This zzso protein is thought to control zzso translation and its absence in fragile X cells leads to zzso in protein zzso In zzso zzso is thought to repress specific zzso during their transport as silent zzso zzso from the cell body to the distant zzso which are the sites of local synthesis of zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso sorts out its different zzso targets might be tuned by the intervention of different zzso Using a zzso zzso system, we identified zzso zzso 58 zzso as a novel zzso zzso In cell cultures, we found that zzso is predominantly present in the nucleus where it interacts with the nuclear zzso of zzso However, in zzso but not in zzso cells, zzso is also present in the zzso zzso as well as in zzso where it zzso with zzso zzso evidence is given that zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso similar to zzso is present on zzso prepared from zzso and that it behaves as an zzso protein with a high affinity to the zzso zzso We propose that this novel cellular partner for zzso escorts zzso zzso from the nucleus and zzso to the zzso compartment where it might participate in zzso translation zzso
