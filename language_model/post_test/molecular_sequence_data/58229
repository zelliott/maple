zzso sequence data from the Internal zzso zzso 1 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster were used to determine the utility of molecular data to discriminate species and zzso of zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso and 415 zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to give an aligned sequence for this region of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso of zzso zzso differed from that of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and from that of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that sequence data from the zzso will be a useful zzso tool to discriminate zzso zzso
