A goat zzso library was screened by Southern zzso zzso at reduced stringency with a bovine zzso type 5 zzso 5) DNA probe in order to identify potential cellular and viral sequences related to the zzso zzso A zzso clone with an zzso zzso zzso insert was found to contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso that zzso with the DNA of zzso 5, two zzso zzso and human zzso types 5 and 8, but not with DNA from another eight human and bovine zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso of the goat zzso DNA probe was restricted to a single zzso zzso zzso within the E1 open reading frame zzso of zzso 5 but produced multiple bands ranging between zzso and zzso zzso when zzso under stringent conditions with zzso DNA obtained from different goat zzso The zzso sequence of zzso has direct repeats of 10 and 13 zzso zzso 153 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso respectively, and an zzso repeat sequence of 11 zzso zzso a major zzso potentially coding for zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso and donor sites capable of joining with upstream and downstream zzso are present within the major zzso zzso similarity between zzso and zzso 5 DNA at the zzso and zzso acid level was limited to a stretch of 58 zzso which includes an zzso zzso This region of similarity contains a predicted zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence is a novel repetitive element within the goat zzso that is unrelated in sequence to zzso DNA and to zzso sequences of mouse and zzso
