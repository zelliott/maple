zzso learning and zzso replacement have been studied extensively in zzso but until recently, few molecular and zzso tools for zzso research zzso Here we describe new zzso resources developed in our zzso We made zzso libraries from zebra zzso zzso zzso brains at different zzso zzso A total of 11,000 zzso clones from these libraries, representing zzso unique gene zzso were randomly picked and zzso from the 3' zzso A zzso database was established for clone zzso sequence analysis, and functional zzso Our zzso libraries were not zzso zzso zzso without zzso produced many zzso zzso zzso yielding insights into patterns of gene expression at different stages of brain zzso In particular, the zzso library made from brains at zzso day zzso corresponding to the period of rapid song system development and song learning, has the most diverse and richest set of genes zzso We also identified five zzso whose sequences are highly zzso between zebra zzso and other zzso We printed zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in the high vocal center of both adult male zebra zzso and zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso expressed in the high vocal center were identified from the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were validated by in zzso zzso Networks among the regulated genes were also zzso These resources provide zzso biologists with tools for zzso zzso comparative zzso and zzso gene expression zzso
