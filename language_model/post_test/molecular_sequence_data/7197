zzso zzso from many sources display zzso kinetic behavior suggestive of zzso interaction among the six zzso of the zzso A three-dimensional structure now potentially offers a framework for explaining the basis of such behavior in zzso zzso zzso and this paper offers evidence of extreme, zzso zzso in the binding of zzso by this zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which zzso in the zzso binding site is replaced by zzso displays a markedly zzso dependence of reaction rate on zzso concentration zzso zzso 200 zzso with a Hill zzso of zzso when zzso at pH zzso with 1 zzso zzso Under the same conditions the zzso zzso gave no measurable rate with zzso zzso in the range normally used for zzso zzso zzso but gave a steep rise in reaction rate from 600 to 1200 zzso zzso At pH zzso where the zzso zzso has previously been shown to be zzso in a standard zzso a study extending to much higher zzso zzso again revealed a zzso zzso with a Hill zzso of zzso and an zzso at 150 zzso zzso With the zzso zzso the apparent zzso was less, with a Hill zzso of zzso and the affinity for zzso was higher, with zzso of 7 zzso Both proteins gave normal zzso dependence on zzso concentration at pH 7 and pH zzso At pH 9 and with zzso zzso both zzso showed a zzso dependence of the rate on zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, affected the observed degree of zzso with varied zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
