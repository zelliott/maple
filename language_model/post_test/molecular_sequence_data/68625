DNA zzso perform essential roles in DNA zzso gene transcription, and zzso zzso Recently, we identified a new type of zzso II zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso When its action is not prevented by zzso zzso the zzso protein is a potent zzso In this paper, using zzso zzso zzso and zzso we show that zzso protein efficiently traps zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso protein not only prevents the zzso poisoning activity of zzso but also reverses its effect on zzso The mechanism by which the zzso protein zzso DNA strand breakage is closely related to the action of zzso zzso However, the zzso dependence of the zzso zzso process zzso the zzso mechanism from zzso reactions because the zzso antibiotics stimulate efficient DNA zzso whether or not zzso is zzso We previously showed that bacteria resistant to zzso antibiotics are sensitive to zzso and vice zzso zzso of the mechanism of action of zzso protein may permit the design of drugs targeting zzso so as to take advantage of this new poisoning zzso
