DNA spanning a zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the human T cell line zzso established from an acute zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the point of crossover on zzso 7 occurred immediately adjacent to joining segment J beta zzso within the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso resulted from an error in zzso gene zzso On zzso 19, the zzso occurred within a previously zzso zzso unit for which we propose the name zzso An approximately zzso zzso is transcribed from this gene in a wide variety of zzso cell zzso The zzso results in zzso of the zzso gene and production of zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the zzso of this zzso
