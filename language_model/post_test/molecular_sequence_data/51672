The solution structure of human zzso Y has been solved by conventional two-dimensional zzso techniques followed by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso obtained is composed of two short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso linked by a hinge inducing a 100 degree zzso The first zzso zzso is connected to a zzso stretch zzso zzso by a tight hairpin zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso stretch are packed together by zzso zzso This structure is related to that of the zzso avian pancreatic zzso and bovine pancreatic zzso The zzso and zzso known to be involved in the biological activity for respectively the zzso binding and zzso are close together in zzso The side chains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the one hand, and zzso and zzso on the other, form a continuous zzso surface of zzso zzso which is supposed to interact with the zzso for zzso zzso
