zzso with true branching are classified in zzso V (formerly order zzso in the zzso zzso They exhibit a high degree of zzso complexity and are known from particular zzso Only a few zzso zzso have been zzso and therefore the high zzso of zzso found in nature is zzso in zzso zzso cultures of zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso were, to date, the only representatives of this zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis data in this report confirm that zzso zzso are a zzso zzso However, unlike previous studies have suggested, these zzso zzso data on new zzso strains show that the true branching zzso are zzso and can be separated into at least two major groups defined by their branching type, the first group being characterized by zzso and the second group by zzso zzso with zzso zzso and either no branching or zzso also formed separate zzso In consequence, our zzso data do not correlate with the zzso and traditional zzso which distinguish zzso zzso zzso with or without true branching zzso
