zzso sequences were determined and analyzed for two human zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso E virus zzso zzso from Beijing, zzso The zzso of the three strains were composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, excluding the zzso zzso tails, and were zzso identical to each zzso All were classified into zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the 2 human zzso have up to zzso zzso identity in full length zzso with zzso strains isolated in China, while the zzso isolate share zzso identity with the human strain zzso from zzso At the zzso acid level, the three strains share zzso zzso and zzso identity in the zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso The human strains zzso and zzso have the highest identity, zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso respectively, to zzso strains zzso and zzso from zzso China, while zzso strain zzso has highest identity with the human strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso acid zzso were found at a single site in all three zzso by sequences zzso and zzso specific short sequences zzso in zzso were found in zzso and the zzso of zzso However, no difference was found at any zzso acid position that discriminates between human and zzso zzso within zzso 4 for any of the three zzso These results indicated that the zzso 4 zzso strains from humans and pigs in China may evolve from the common zzso
