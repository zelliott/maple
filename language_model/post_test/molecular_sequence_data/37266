X-ray studies on zzso have been reported on zzso grown under conditions of high (about zzso zzso and low salt (about zzso zzso The zzso zzso were grown in water, whereas the zzso zzso were prepared in zzso zzso solutions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics of zzso in these two environments differ zzso In salt solutions, zzso binds oxygen with a zzso value of about 5 zzso of oxygen and in a cooperative manner characterized with an zzso value of Hill varying from two to zzso In zzso zzso solutions, zzso zzso are zzso with a zzso value of about zzso zzso of zzso without exhibiting a cooperative zzso I report on a detailed study of the X-ray data defining the zzso interface zzso of these two forms of zzso The study reveals that the main difference between the two structures lies in the number and arrangement of the water molecules and in distances between zzso side chains in the zzso zzso I propose that these differences lead to significant shifts in the zzso values of the zzso groups in the zzso zzso
