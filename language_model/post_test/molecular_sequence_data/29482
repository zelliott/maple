zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso in zzso The genetic zzso of the zzso zzso cam, from a strain of zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso DNA from zzso 19 strain zzso was used to construct a gene library in zzso II zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso The clones containing zzso plasmids were screened for the zzso reaction with zzso zzso Those that showed zzso were chosen for further analysis by zzso One of these zzso zzso was zzso to identify the smallest possible DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso which was located on a zzso zzso zzso which specified a zzso open reading zzso zzso containing zzso plasmids carrying cam obtained by zzso cloning into zzso coli zzso strain zzso an active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and Western zzso analyses confirmed that the zzso strain expressed a protein with a molecular mass of 37 zzso and that strains from zzso 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 19 expressed the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high zzso to those of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso A confirmed that Cam is a zzso
