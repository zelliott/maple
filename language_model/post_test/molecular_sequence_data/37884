A molecular screen for a mouse zzso of a zzso zzso binding zzso called zzso yielded a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By in zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibits differential expression in neural and zzso zzso Although expressed by all zzso in the central nervous system, zzso populations that contribute their zzso to zzso zzso projections, such as zzso zzso cells and spinal zzso demonstrate the highest zzso zzso When stained with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso display an elaborate zzso apparatus, frequently extending into one or more zzso zzso The extended spatial distribution of the zzso zzso apparatus, particularly in spinal zzso allowed the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with markers for zzso but not the zzso or zzso network, consistent with previous observations suggesting that zzso zzso are enriched in late zzso zzso Among zzso zzso liver and zzso demonstrate zzso specific zzso zzso In liver, zzso cells lining a ring of zzso concentric with the central zzso express zzso zzso cells are also stained with zzso zzso but zzso expression is zzso In the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is found in zzso zzso zzso and early zzso cells zzso and primary zzso the zzso zzso exhibits intense zzso zzso Since zzso is a precursor for the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso the range of zzso zzso expression among various cell populations indicates that certain cell types possess greater reliance on zzso function than zzso
