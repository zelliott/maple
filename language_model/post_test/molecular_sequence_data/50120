The zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced in zzso cell lines has been characterized by a combination of zzso and mass zzso techniques, including both zzso laser zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso mapping methods have been developed for the three zzso that allow separation of the zzso according to either their charge or zzso level or their zzso A method was also developed for zzso that permits the complete resolution of the zzso from the zzso zzso Whereas the structure found for the zzso of the zzso was in agreement with the complex type model, the structure for an zzso of zzso not yet zzso has been zzso determined using zzso zzso trap mass zzso Using these two zzso mapping methods, the high level of zzso consistency achieved for the zzso of the three zzso zzso in commercial production has been zzso These data demonstrate the tight control that can be achieved in the manufacturing of complex zzso therapeutic zzso which is a prerequisite to the delivering of a guaranteed dose of drug from vial to zzso and in turn to ensuring the clinical efficacy of the zzso
