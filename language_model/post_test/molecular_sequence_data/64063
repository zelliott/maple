Increasingly, scientists have begun to tackle gene functions and other complex regulatory processes by studying organisms at the global scales for various levels of biological organization, ranging from zzso to zzso and zzso Meanwhile, new zzso methods have been developed for zzso protein function using zzso analysis of functional properties to complement the traditional sequence zzso zzso To fully exploit the value of the zzso system biology data and to facilitate protein functional studies requires zzso zzso that support both data integration and zzso zzso The zzso database, designed to serve as a framework for data integration in a distributed networking environment, provides comprehensive descriptions of all zzso with rich links to over 50 databases of protein family, function, pathway, interaction, zzso structure, zzso zzso literature, and zzso In particular, the database is organized with zzso family zzso and maps to other family, function, and structure zzso zzso zzso with the underlying zzso information for complete zzso the zzso system zzso supports zzso studies of protein family, domain, function, and zzso A case study of the zzso zzso illustrates a systematic approach for protein family and zzso zzso Such studies may serve as a basis for further analysis of protein functional evolution, and its relationship to the zzso of zzso zzso cellular networks, and zzso
