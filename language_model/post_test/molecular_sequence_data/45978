Central issues surrounding the basic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors concern how specificity of partner selection and DNA binding are zzso zzso proteins bind DNA through the basic sequence that is zzso with a zzso zzso zzso For the two zzso within the family, zzso is further regulated by an adjacent zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that for the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso the DR zzso A domain has a unique interaction with the zzso region that zzso both zzso strength and affinity for an zzso zzso DNA zzso A zzso swap zzso where the DR zzso domain was fused to zzso zzso A and the zzso zzso fused to DR zzso A, gave strong DNA zzso but zzso was only effective with the native arrangement, suggesting the zzso A domain is critical for each process via distinct zzso zzso zzso which regulate zzso for the zzso family members zzso and Max, could not replace the zzso zzso for either zzso or DNA binding in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso influence the zzso of target DNA in a manner consistent with DNA zzso These results provide the first insights for understanding mechanisms of selective zzso and DNA interaction that distinguish zzso proteins from the broader zzso zzso
