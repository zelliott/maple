The zzso chain reaction zzso was evaluated in a trial which, with respect to the zzso ratio, zzso the situation of a diagnostic laboratory in a zzso zzso Three hundred zzso samples were included in the study, of which one-third were known to contain zzso as judged by direct zzso The repetitive zzso sequence zzso of zzso tuberculosis was used as a zzso The samples were spiked with DNA from a modified zzso zzso which gives rise to zzso products easily distinguished from zzso products amplified from zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso This allowed identification of samples that contained substances zzso to the zzso zzso The detection limit of the zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso tuberculosis DNA, corresponding to 10 to 100 zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso was compared with that of conventional zzso and zzso It was concluded that this method is fast and sensitive, but that culture currently is crucial for assessing viability and thus zzso
