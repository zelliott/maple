Fish farm sediments receive a large amount of organic matter from zzso food and zzso zzso This zzso enrichment, or organic pollution, causes the zzso of zzso in the zzso from the action of zzso bacteria zzso We investigated the effect of organic enrichment around coastal fish farms comparing the zzso community structure in these zzso zzso samples with different levels of organic pollution classified based upon the contents of zzso zzso and chemical oxygen demand were collected at three stations on the coast of western zzso The zzso community composition was assessed using zzso amplification, zzso sequencing and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso fragments using directly extracted zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso products of zzso showed the existence of different zzso groups in the zzso The majority of zzso sequences were associated with the families zzso and zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso were also detected from all zzso zzso zzso comparison of sequences revealed that community compositions of zzso from zzso sediments significantly differed from those of moderately zzso sediments and unpolluted sediments zzso zzso showing a different distribution of zzso in the fish farm zzso There is evidence showing that the organic enrichment of sediments influences the composition of zzso communities in sediments at marine fish zzso
