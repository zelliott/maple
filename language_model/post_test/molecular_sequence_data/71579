In zzso dosage compensation is achieved by X zzso and is regulated in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso controls zzso zzso choice of X to zzso and initiation of zzso zzso action culminates in a change in zzso zzso property from a scarce, unstable zzso to highly expressed zzso zzso that coats the future inactive zzso zzso a zzso region downstream of zzso results in zzso zzso expression and X zzso zzso the presence of a zzso zzso In this region, we now report the discovery of a gene zzso to zzso zzso is a zzso zzso originating 15 zzso downstream of zzso and transcribed across the zzso zzso zzso sequence is zzso at the human zzso zzso zzso has no zzso zzso is seen exclusively in the nucleus and is localized at zzso Before the onset of X zzso zzso is expressed from both X zzso At the onset of X zzso zzso expression becomes zzso is associated with the future active X and persists until zzso is turned zzso zzso is not found on the inactive X once cells enter the zzso zzso zzso has features suggesting a role in regulating the early steps of X zzso but not the zzso zzso
