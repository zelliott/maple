A method is described for the highly selective modification of the zzso groups at the zzso of unprotected peptides to form stable, modified zzso zzso which can be zzso coupled to other molecules or to a solid zzso zzso with zzso zzso at pH zzso occurs with zzso selectivity for the zzso group, depending on the zzso zzso (as shown with a series of model zzso containing a competing zzso zzso Although zzso zzso must be protected zzso or zzso before the zzso reaction, there are no zzso side reactions of the zzso zzso the zzso or of modified zzso the side chains of zzso Met, or zzso The reaction works well in zzso so that zzso effects of zzso structure can be zzso In a second step the zzso can be reacted with a zzso group on a zzso on a solid zzso zzso on a zzso probe, zzso This is illustrated by reaction of a series of N zzso with zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso zzso Data are presented which suggest that this zzso zzso scheme is superior in selectivity for zzso groups to conventional chemical approaches to zzso such as use of zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso The reaction is zzso suited for zzso zzso fragments, as pure species or as zzso derived from zzso or chemical fragmentation of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso for example via zzso DNA techniques, can be zzso in this zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
