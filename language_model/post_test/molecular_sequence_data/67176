The neutral zzso zzso gene is zzso regulated by zzso in prostate cancer zzso We previously identified in the zzso gene an zzso responsive element zzso and an zzso responsive region zzso that together conveyed only moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso 170 zzso zzso zzso we characterized the entire zzso structure of the zzso gene and identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are located in the zzso region and in zzso 17, zzso zzso enhancement of zzso was zzso by zzso the zzso reporter zzso containing three copies of zzso or zzso into zzso zzso zzso activities were increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sequences completely zzso zzso We next showed that both zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso demonstrating in zzso and in zzso binding with zzso as determined by zzso mobility gel shift and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso mediate coordinated zzso in both an zzso promoter and the native zzso type 1 zzso These data indicate the newly identified zzso and zzso together with the previously identified zzso function as zzso response zzso and that zzso regulation of the zzso gene is regulated by the coordinated action of multiple zzso in prostate cancer zzso
