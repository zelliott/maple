The treatment of human zzso leukemia cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is associated with growth arrest and appearance of a differentiated zzso zzso While previous studies have reported that the zzso zzso blocks zzso characteristics of zzso zzso we demonstrated in the present work that zzso delays the effects of zzso on the loss of zzso cell zzso We also demonstrated that this zzso zzso zzso increases in expression of the zzso early response zzso The results of nuclear zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicated that this effect of zzso is regulated at the zzso zzso Similar studies were performed for the zzso B zzso While zzso treatment was associated with transient increases in zzso B zzso levels, this induction was blocked by zzso In contrast, zzso had no significant effect on the zzso of pre-existing zzso B protein as determined in zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the activated zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways which include expression of the zzso and zzso B genes and that such effects may contribute to a block in zzso zzso zzso
