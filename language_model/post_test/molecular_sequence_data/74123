zzso have provided invaluable tools for identifying both zzso genes and zzso associated with zzso human diseases, but zzso human zzso are rare and few mouse models zzso Here we report progress on analysis of a collection of zzso zzso generated by treatment of mice with specific chemicals or radiation during late zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibit a range of visible zzso reflecting the disruption of coding sequences or the separation of genes from essential regulatory zzso The zzso of both zzso and chemically induced zzso in these mice are remarkably clean, with very short zzso zzso or zzso in some cases, and zzso zzso by zzso suggesting zzso end joining as the major path of zzso These zzso provide new tools for the discovery of novel genes and regulatory elements linked to human zzso disorders and new clues to the molecular basis of human genetic zzso
