In the present study, we have extended earlier zzso zzso and experimental investigations to characterize zzso zzso from various hosts in Iran utilizing DNA regions zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso c zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso An emphasis was placed on the characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from humans, zzso zzso cattle and zzso and on assessing their genetic zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso derived from individual zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed five zzso and nine zzso zzso profiles, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso representing unique zzso profiles demonstrated that each profile was linked unequivocally to a particular sequence and that single point zzso were readily zzso by zzso zzso analyses of zzso and/or zzso zzso sequence data were conducted using zzso zzso and maximum likelihood zzso zzso Following the zzso analyses of zzso zzso sequence data, including representatives of all presently recognized zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso (as the zzso the majority of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from humans, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and camels were assigned to the zzso complex of zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas some zzso zzso zzso (6 of zzso zzso from camels were assigned to the zzso complex (or zzso zzso The present study reinforces the advantages of the zzso zzso approach to explore variation in multiple zzso zzso within and among zzso zzso which provides a platform for future, detailed studies of the molecular epidemiology of zzso zzso in Iran and other zzso zzso The sequences determined in the present study have been deposited in the zzso database under zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
