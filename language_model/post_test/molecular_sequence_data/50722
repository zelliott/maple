We have evaluated the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection zzso with respect to its suitability to establish a zzso mapping database that would enable zzso structural analysis by mere comparison of retention zzso The suitability of zzso for zzso structural analysis was zzso by validation zzso The retention times of distinct zzso prepared and measured on different days, were shown to be highly zzso with a zzso of variation zzso of less than zzso requiring less than 100 zzso of zzso per injection for reliable zzso Including appropriate internal zzso standards, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso method fulfills the zzso requirements with respect to zzso precision, zzso and zzso The zzso mapping database was established, using two zzso linear zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 different zzso of known structure, which have thus far been measured and zzso have entered our zzso zzso mapping zzso The efficiency of the database for structural zzso was tested, using the zzso carbohydrates isolated from zzso expressed in zzso zzso Nine different zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be assigned with a zzso of less than zzso zzso using zzso zzso and six of the eight zzso zzso of zzso zzso detected with zzso A could be assigned with an accuracy of less than zzso zzso three of them even with an accuracy of less than zzso providing the reliability of the established zzso mapping zzso
