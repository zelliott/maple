zzso repeats are zzso in normal zzso zzso repeats in the zzso zzso zzso gene were counted by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso A region of approximately two hundred zzso containing the repeats was amplified by zzso chain reaction, then measured after a simple zzso zzso The zzso molecular zzso species was detected using zzso zzso of DNA sample and the number of repeats was determined from the molecular zzso The results indicated that zzso is a zzso alternative to zzso gel zzso for precise determination of zzso zzso zzso
