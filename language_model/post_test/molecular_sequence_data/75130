The complete zzso acid sequence of the human complement system regulatory zzso factor zzso has been derived from sequencing three overlapping zzso zzso The sequence consists of zzso zzso acids arranged in 20 zzso units, each about 60 zzso acids long, and an zzso leader zzso The zzso repetitive units are zzso with those found in a large number of other complement and zzso zzso Two basic zzso zzso deduced from the zzso zzso are absent from factor H isolated from outdated zzso A zzso zzso was observed within the seventh zzso repeat unit of factor zzso This is likely to represent a difference between the two major zzso zzso of factor zzso The nature of the zzso clones indicates that there is likely to be an alternative zzso zzso resulting in the formation of at least two species of factor H zzso
