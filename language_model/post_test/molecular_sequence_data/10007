zzso acid and zzso hormone are important regulators of zzso growth, zzso and zzso zzso acid is extensively used in the treatment of many zzso disorders ranging from wrinkles to skin zzso zzso acid and zzso hormone directly control the zzso of zzso genes including zzso Their effect is zzso through nuclear receptors zzso and zzso We have previously identified the response element in the zzso zzso zzso to which these receptors zzso and found that it consists of a cluster of five zzso with variable spacing and zzso To determine whether this specific structure is found in other zzso zzso we have mapped and analyzed the zzso elements in three additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We used three different approaches to identify these zzso zzso of promoter deletion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We localized the zzso elements relatively close to the zzso box in all three zzso All three zzso elements have a similar structural zzso they consist of clusters of 3-6 zzso with variable spacing and zzso This means that the clustered structure of the zzso is a common characteristic for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter are adjacent to each other whereas in the zzso promoter they zzso All three zzso zzso bind specifically both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, addition of zzso to the zzso changes the binding pattern zzso zzso from zzso to zzso reflecting the change in regulation from induction to zzso
