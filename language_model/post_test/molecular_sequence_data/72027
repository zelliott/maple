DNA binding activity and nuclear transport of zzso in zzso zzso are zzso zzso Two distinct sequence elements in the zzso portion of the protein are responsible for these different zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso the DNA binding activity of the zzso repeats in zzso indicating that zzso folding may result in masking of the DNA binding zzso zzso zzso contains two separate nuclear zzso signals zzso which, in zzso zzso function only outside the context of the full-length zzso Fusion of an additional zzso to the full-length protein overcomes the zzso of nuclear import, suggesting that masking of the zzso function rather than zzso zzso is responsible for the negative regulation of zzso zzso nuclear zzso During zzso zzso when zzso of nuclear import is zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the developing nervous system and neural crest zzso Within the developing neural tube, zzso zzso gene zzso occurs zzso in proliferating, zzso zzso
