zzso regulator zzso directs the expression of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso gene cause an zzso zzso disease called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is mainly expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells, thus zzso a strict control over its expression zzso To date, only limited information is available on mechanisms responsible for the regulation of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso factor family members zzso zzso and zzso have positive effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed that two of the three zzso binding sites in zzso promoter are functional and this finding has been confirmed by the zzso mobility shift zzso The zzso promoter activity could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and this zzso was further enhanced by zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time that zzso gene is a downstream target for the zzso family of zzso zzso
