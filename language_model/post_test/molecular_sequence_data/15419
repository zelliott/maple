zzso zzso protein plays a major role in viral zzso modulating surface expression of several immune zzso altering signal zzso zzso and enhancing viral zzso among other zzso zzso also exhibits great zzso diversity, but most studies have been focused only on zzso proteins from zzso zzso Thus, little is known about the functional capacities of zzso B zzso proteins in host zzso Here, we investigated cell surface regulation of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cells zzso or infected with five different zzso zzso including one zzso zzso C and F zzso No significant difference among the zzso proteins regarding zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso showed a slightly, yet zzso diminished capacity to zzso zzso in all cells, as well as to zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso the two zzso from zzso and zzso were unable to zzso the zzso chain both in zzso and infected zzso Moreover, the zzso rate of the surface zzso chain was only slightly affected by zzso and zzso whereas it was drastically reduced by zzso zzso zzso known to be involved in zzso chain zzso were zzso among the five zzso analyzed zzso In zzso we identified two primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are selectively impaired for zzso zzso and that may help to zzso the mechanism of this zzso function in the zzso It will be important to determine whether the observed differences are zzso zzso dependent and influence viral zzso
