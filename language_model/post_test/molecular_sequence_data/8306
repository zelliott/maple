zzso As from zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to antagonize the zzso effects of zzso A and zzso from zzso zzso We have biologically characterized a series of synthetic zzso zzso including the proposed structures of the zzso A and zzso zzso containing fatty acid side chains zzso to the zzso zzso as well as an analog of zzso zzso zzso A containing zzso zzso side chains zzso In zzso zzso utilizing zzso human zzso or whole blood demonstrated that low zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cellular zzso as indicated by decreased release of the zzso zzso and zzso 6, and zzso zzso also inhibited zzso release of zzso and zzso oxide from zzso zzso zzso zzso at up to 100 zzso were devoid of zzso activity in zzso and human in zzso zzso In zzso zzso blocked induction of zzso by zzso and reduced zzso zzso in zzso These in zzso and in zzso results indicate that zzso may have clinical therapeutic utility as an zzso of zzso morbidity and zzso
