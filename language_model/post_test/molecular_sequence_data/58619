zzso a major zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the pathology of tropical pulmonary zzso zzso a pulmonary syndrome thought to result from hypersensitivity to zzso 

zzso zzso to zzso from patients with zzso was used to identify a complementary DNA zzso from a zzso zzso expression zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed a zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein using zzso of patients with zzso determined its zzso zzso zzso to human lung zzso cell proteins was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso and serum from patients with zzso 

The predicted protein is a zzso of the entire precursor of the zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the synthesis and degradation of zzso The zzso precursor encodes both the heavy zzso and the light zzso chain zzso and shares structural similarities with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified as the zzso of the zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the human zzso present in human airway zzso cells, and human zzso is a target of zzso present in the serum of patients with zzso 

zzso mimicry between the zzso zzso zzso and the host zzso zzso present in lung zzso cells likely contributes to the zzso observed in tropical pulmonary zzso
