The zzso zzso zzso is coupled to G protein zzso and becomes zzso into zzso compartments after zzso To more closely define the zzso sequences involved in these processes and their functions, we systematically zzso all three zzso zzso zzso either as point zzso or in groups of three to five zzso acids to Ala, obtaining a total of 14 zzso All zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells and, with the exception of triple zzso zzso zzso zzso retained the ability to specifically bind zzso The binding affinities at 4 or 37 degrees C of several zzso differed considerably from those determined for the zzso zzso indicating an zzso connection between the zzso of the binding site and that of the zzso zzso in zzso strongly reduced surface expression without affecting G protein signaling or zzso zzso Two cluster zzso in the middle of zzso containing basic zzso displayed considerably reduced zzso whereas two zzso in zzso resulted in zzso zzso that were considered to be zzso based on the observation that they responded with zzso zzso to compounds normally considered to be zzso This, and the fact that a cluster zzso at the zzso end of zzso was signaling incompetent, hint at the involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso albeit with different zzso None of the zzso displayed reduced zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso are not essential for this zzso No conclusion could be drawn, however, with regard to the role of the zzso zzso as the corresponding zzso zzso lacked binding zzso
