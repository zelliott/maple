zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a probable zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso A crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by the zzso anomalous zzso zzso The core domain has an zzso structure formed by a zzso parallel zzso flanked by six zzso and three zzso One zzso bond, zzso forms a bridge between an zzso and a zzso although zzso seems to be an zzso zzso The zzso inserted into the core domain has a zzso bundle zzso The crystal packing suggests that zzso exists as a zzso A structural zzso search revealed that zzso resembles the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the active sites suggested that zzso probably has zzso zzso activity, but its zzso specificity may be zzso In addition, the zzso bond in zzso probably zzso the structural stabilization of the neighboring region in the zzso form, although the corresponding regions in zzso zzso and zzso may be stabilized by zzso Since zzso zzso can be used for the zzso of zzso zzso compounds, zzso will be a useful target for zzso zzso
