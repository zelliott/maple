zzso between zzso budding cells of the zzso fungus zzso zzso results in the formation of a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is governed by two zzso zzso called a and zzso transformation of genes from these zzso zzso zzso and zzso into a zzso strain of different mating type zzso zzso zzso allows zzso growth and establishes a zzso cell zzso Several zzso with a zzso colony zzso were isolated after zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso region in one such zzso was recovered by zzso rescue and employed to isolate a gene involved in conditioning the zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso acid open reading frame is present at the zzso zzso the predicted zzso is rich in zzso zzso and contains short regions with similarity to zzso domain zzso Construction of zzso disruption and deletion zzso in zzso strains confirmed that this gene plays a role in zzso growth and zzso
