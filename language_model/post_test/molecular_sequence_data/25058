The zzso and zzso genes from a zzso cell line producing mouse zzso against zzso of zzso zzso type A were amplified by zzso The zzso and zzso genes were connected thought a flexible zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene was cloned into a zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of 726 zzso zzso 242 zzso acid zzso Both zzso and zzso genes were confirmed as functionally rearranged mouse zzso variable zzso According to zzso zzso method, the zzso and zzso gene segments belong to mouse zzso heavy chain zzso II zzso and zzso light chain zzso III zzso The zzso gene was amplified inserted the expression zzso zzso and transformed into E coli zzso The zzso protein was highly expressed in zzso strain zzso zzso and the expression level of the zzso was about zzso of total bacteria protein by zzso The zzso zzso showed that the expressed zzso protein could neutralize the zzso C activities of zzso
