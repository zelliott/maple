zzso growth factor zzso zzso proteins constitute an expanding family of proteins involved in several cellular activities such as blood zzso zzso cell zzso and neural and zzso zzso By using a zzso approach, we have identified a new member of this family named zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene symbol and gene zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso encodes a zzso protein characterized by the presence of five zzso repeats, three of which display a zzso consensus zzso In addition, a zzso domain is also present at the zzso of the predicted protein zzso The human and zzso full-length zzso were identified and mapped to human zzso and to the mouse zzso zzso Northern analysis indicates that zzso is expressed early during zzso Taken together, these data render zzso a candidate for human and zzso zzso zzso
