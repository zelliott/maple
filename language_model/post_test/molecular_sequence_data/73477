The zzso receptors zzso which primarily couple to zzso of zzso production, have been reported to have a stimulating effect on zzso zzso activity in certain zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells the zzso zzso showed only zzso of zzso zzso production when activated by zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso displayed a zzso zzso curve with zzso at low zzso of zzso and a zzso at higher zzso To further investigate the zzso zzso we expressed a set of zzso zzso at similar expression levels in zzso cells to determine the structural domain responsible for the difference between the two zzso When the third zzso zzso were zzso between zzso and zzso zzso the zzso specificity remained zzso indicating that this loop does not zzso selectivity toward a stimulating zzso A zzso zzso curve, typical for the zzso zzso could be seen when the second zzso loop of the zzso zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso suggesting that this loop is important for determining the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids in the second zzso loop of the zzso zzso indicated that several zzso are involved in the zzso zzso
