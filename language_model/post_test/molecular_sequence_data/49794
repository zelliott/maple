The molecular markers that distinguish primary zzso large zzso zzso zzso from zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso remain to be zzso Using zzso zzso difference analysis to compare zzso and zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso zzso to the mouse zzso zzso 4 zzso gene zzso zzso zzso gene 1) zzso The human zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein that comprises a signal zzso and a large zzso zzso zzso domain, and shares significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Northern zzso studies showed that zzso zzso expression is mainly restricted to zzso zzso It is expressed at low levels in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and is highly zzso in zzso zzso B zzso Interestingly, in human zzso lines, zzso zzso expression appeared restricted to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Using real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso we demonstrated that all but one zzso zzso displayed high zzso zzso levels, whereas most zzso zzso and all zzso zzso zzso tested zzso exhibited low zzso zzso zzso The difference between zzso and zzso was statistically significant zzso zzso P zzso Southern zzso studies did not show zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene expression might be due to a zzso zzso of a zzso signaling zzso in zzso
