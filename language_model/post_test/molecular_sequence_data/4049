In this study, we established rat zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso and zzso as fusion proteins zzso zzso with the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso to the fusion proteins resulted in their nuclear zzso After zzso administration, zzso growing cells expressing zzso and to a lesser extent zzso underwent zzso zzso from the flat zzso shape to an extended bipolar shape, and ceased zzso Such zzso zzso was also induced in zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso after one round of cell division triggered by zzso zzso The cells expressing zzso changed shape zzso and the content of zzso in the zzso detected by binding of Alexa zzso significantly decreased after the zzso zzso By two-dimensional gel zzso analysis of cellular proteins from the cells expressing zzso we identified several proteins whose expression either increased or decreased after zzso zzso Two of these proteins were identified from their zzso acid sequences as novel processed form of zzso
