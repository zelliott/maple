The zzso zzso was isolated from liver zzso of zzso rabbits and its complete zzso acid sequence zzso zzso sequence analysis of intact zzso as well as characterization of the peptides obtained from zzso and chemical zzso led to the zzso of the primary zzso The protein is a single zzso consisting of zzso zzso and molecular weight zzso The active site zzso is zzso and another zzso binding site is at zzso zzso zzso chains are attached at zzso zzso 61 and zzso Although zzso treatment zzso this zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence of the induced zzso is identical to that of the zzso isolated from liver zzso of zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso is zzso identical with the sequences of human serum zzso and the zzso from zzso zzso There is also a close zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso domain of bovine zzso
