To zzso and express the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and study its immune protection against challenge infection in mice vaccinated zzso 

The zzso gene was amplified by zzso and zzso into the zzso of zzso 2 of the zzso zzso The positive zzso was screened by zzso restriction zzso zzso and sequence zzso The positive zzso was transformed into zzso coli zzso The soluble zzso fusion protein zzso 2) was expressed in zzso coli by induction of low zzso concentration under low temperature, and analyzed by zzso and Western zzso Mice were zzso zzso with zzso using zzso as zzso Two weeks after the third zzso challenge infection with zzso zzso zzso was carried zzso zzso and eggs collected from the zzso of mice were counted at 42 days after the zzso zzso of specific zzso were detected by zzso before zzso 

zzso was successfully zzso into zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso In mice vaccinated zzso with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso reduction rate was zzso and the reduction rate of eggs per gram liver tissue zzso was zzso As compared with the control groups, levels of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in saliva increased zzso 

The expressed zzso can induce partial protective immunity against zzso zzso infection in mice when they were vaccinated zzso with zzso as zzso
