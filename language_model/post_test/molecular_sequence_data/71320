To study the molecular mechanism of zzso cell death, we carried out the screening of genes which were induced during the zzso cell death of zzso zzso We cloned the zzso of rat zzso the third member of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed in the zzso cell death caused by depletion of zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in superior cervical zzso zzso caused cell zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso cell zzso
