Nuclear respiratory factor 1 zzso was first discovered as an zzso of the zzso c gene and was subsequently found to play a broader role in zzso zzso We have now cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso sequences for zzso zzso The zzso protein was indistinguishable from the authentic zzso cell factor on zzso gels, displayed the expected zzso zzso zzso and made the same zzso zzso contacts as zzso zzso on binding known zzso recognition zzso zzso raised against the highly zzso zzso protein recognized the identical zzso complex formed using either a crude nuclear fraction or nearly homogeneous zzso zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso through specific sites from several zzso zzso confirming both the zzso activity and specificity of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso are closely related to sea zzso zzso and the erect wing zzso protein of zzso Both are recently identified zzso regulatory zzso The region of highest sequence identity with zzso and zzso was in the zzso half of the zzso which was found by deletion mapping to contain the zzso domain, whereas the zzso half of zzso was highly divergent from both zzso The zzso domain in these molecules is unrelated to motifs found commonly in zzso zzso thus, zzso zzso and zzso represent the founding members of a new class of highly zzso zzso regulatory zzso
