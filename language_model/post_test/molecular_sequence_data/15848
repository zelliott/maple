The zzso zzso is capable of producing tumors in zzso and transforming cells in culture; in contrast, the zzso zzso is zzso In this report we present the complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of this sequence with that of zzso shows that the proteins zzso by these two genes differ by nine zzso acid zzso and the replacement of 50 zzso zzso acids present in zzso by 11 unrelated zzso in zzso Using zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso we have determined that the zzso modification present in zzso is sufficient to generate a partially transforming zzso but that zzso at zzso acid positions 301 and 374 are required (in addition to the zzso zzso to generate a fully transforming zzso zzso
