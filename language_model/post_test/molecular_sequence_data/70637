Two zzso zzso consisting of the B zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso with different peptides fused to the zzso ends, have been zzso and their three-dimensional structure zzso The two extensions zzso to zzso a zzso representing the zzso sequence of the small zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso and zzso a zzso acid long zzso corresponding to the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso from the same zzso Both proteins crystallize in the zzso space group with one zzso zzso per zzso unit, corresponding to a zzso content of about zzso The overall zzso of the B zzso zzso in the two zzso zzso which consists of five identical zzso zzso is very similar to that in the native AB complex and zzso strictly to zzso zzso On the contrary, the zzso extensions are essentially zzso in the case of the zzso only 5 and 6 zzso acids were, respectively, positioned in two zzso while in the other three only 2 zzso are zzso The extension is fully confined to the surface of the zzso opposite to the face that interacts with the membrane and consequently it does not interfere with the ability of the B zzso to interact with membrane zzso Moreover, the zzso flexibility of the two zzso extensions could be correlated to their propensity for zzso processing and zzso release of a biologically active zzso into cultured zzso
