The zzso basis of zzso zzso natural product zzso has not been zzso Here, we characterize a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first characterized representative of the zzso protein family, which is responsible for both zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso peptides known as zzso We show that zzso reverse zzso zzso in zzso zzso Based upon these results, we propose that the zzso family zzso mature zzso zzso from which the leader sequence and other zzso recognition elements have been zzso This differs from the common model of zzso zzso zzso in which a leader sequence is required to direct zzso zzso In addition, we find that reverse zzso zzso derivatives undergo a facile zzso zzso at zzso temperature in zzso zzso leading to forward zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso route to natural products has been chemically anticipated for at least 40 years, it has not been demonstrated as a route to zzso natural zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso drives zzso zzso in at least one case, suggesting that this route should be reconsidered as a mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
