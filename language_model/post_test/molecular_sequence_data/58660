We cloned and zzso a DNA zzso from the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso B12 that includes the gene zzso zzso the reverse zzso The zzso of the reverse zzso gene was characterized indicating that the zzso gene is fully functional in zzso We showed by primer extension analysis that zzso of zzso zzso 28 zzso downstream from a consensus zzso zzso In order to understand how this particular type I DNA zzso introduces positive zzso into the DNA, we compared the zzso acid sequence of reverse zzso from zzso with the two other known reverse zzso This comparison indicates a common organization of these zzso the zzso domain is related to the type zzso zzso family while the zzso domain possesses some motifs of proteins described as zzso or DNA zzso By using local zzso we showed that zzso reverse zzso constitute a new and rather zzso group within the type zzso DNA zzso family; zzso a careful sequence analysis of the zzso domain allows us to relate the presence of some motifs with an zzso binding and zzso reaction coupled to a DNA binding and unwinding zzso
