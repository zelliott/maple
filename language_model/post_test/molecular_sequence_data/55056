The genetic basis of most zzso heart defects zzso especially zzso and zzso conditions, remains largely zzso 

DNA samples were collected from immortalized cell lines and original zzso of 256 zzso zzso patients with cardiac zzso tract zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso essential for heart development, were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of proteins with identified sequence variations was analyzed using a zzso zzso A novel sequence zzso zzso in zzso was identified, in addition to 4 zzso zzso sequence zzso in 3 known zzso genes zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso in 5 zzso None of these was found in 500 controls without zzso In zzso functional zzso showed that all proteins with identified sequence variations exhibited significant changes in zzso activity and/or synergistic activity with other zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in a fish system disturbed early cardiac zzso 

New zzso in the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso that affect their protein function were identified in zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso Our results provide the first demonstration of zzso zzso and suggest that disturbances in the regulatory circuits involving these cardiac zzso factors may cause a subset of zzso and zzso zzso
