zzso an zzso soluble zzso derived from the zzso zzso segment of the zzso zzso channel found in zzso zzso of the central nervous system, has previously been shown to increase zzso zzso and fluid zzso of zzso zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso exerts these effects via formation of a novel zzso zzso pathway, zzso of zzso zzso channel activity, or a combination of these zzso zzso currents were recorded from isolated zzso cells before and after treatment with the zzso using the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso currents in all zzso cell lines that were zzso zzso zzso canine kidney cells, a human zzso zzso cell line zzso and airway zzso cells derived from a human zzso zzso patient zzso No evidence was found for zzso of zzso zzso channels by zzso based on both the zzso properties of the observed currents and the pharmacological profile of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso increases zzso zzso in zzso cells directly, by forming a distinct zzso zzso in cell zzso
