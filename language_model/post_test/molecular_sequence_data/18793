We recently identified a gene zzso required for zzso zzso that seemed likely involved in zzso zzso However, the molecular function of this zzso zzso was zzso Here we show that this protein named zzso is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that determines the chain length of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso allows growth of an zzso zzso strain on zzso zzso indicating functional zzso of zzso to the paradigm zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso shown to be zzso and capable of zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the precursor required to begin formation of the fused zzso rings of zzso zzso analyses confirmed that distinct from zzso zzso represents a novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso mapping combined with zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and zzso all of which are essential for activity and zzso The zzso synthesis zzso was zzso reaction in zzso and the zzso role of zzso directly zzso To the best of our knowledge, these data represent further evidence linking zzso synthesis to bacterial zzso
