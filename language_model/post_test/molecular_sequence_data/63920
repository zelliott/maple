To seek the genes involved in the development of zzso cancer, we analyzed the zzso gene expression profiles of human normal and zzso colon zzso using the zzso database zzso Through the analysis we found one gene named zzso that was zzso in colon zzso The full-length zzso of the zzso cloned by zzso chain reaction zzso encodes a protein with zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso and contains a zzso target signal at zzso The gene product expressed in zzso cells was localized in zzso and processed at the predicted signal zzso site, supporting the idea that zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso the colony zzso These results suggest that zzso may participate in the progression of zzso cancer by zzso growth advantage and could be a new molecular target for cancer zzso
