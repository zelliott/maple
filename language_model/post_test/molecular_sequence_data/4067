Many zzso factors regulate specific zzso events during cardiac zzso however, the mechanisms that regulate such events are largely zzso Using a modified zzso zzso method to identify specific genes that influence early cardiac development, we found that Bop is expressed specifically in cardiac and skeletal muscle precursors before differentiation of these zzso Bop encodes a protein containing zzso and zzso zzso which have been shown to regulate zzso by zzso distinct zzso zzso We show that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of Bop in mice disrupted maturation of zzso zzso and zzso with formation of the right zzso zzso expression of zzso a zzso factor essential for right zzso development, in zzso precursors is dependent upon zzso These results indicate that zzso is essential for zzso differentiation and cardiac zzso
