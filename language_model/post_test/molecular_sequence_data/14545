zzso zzso zzso is a rich zzso of large number of zzso active secondary zzso known as zzso Though the plant has been well characterized in terms of zzso profiles as well as pharmaceutical activities, but there is sparse information about the genes responsible for zzso of these zzso In this study, we have cloned and characterized a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso A rich variety of zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso molecules into zzso a key precursor for zzso and zzso A full-length zzso consisting of 1765 zzso was isolated and contained a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of 411 zzso zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso with optimum expression induced with zzso zzso at zzso after zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso expressed in all tested zzso including roots, stem and leaves with the highest level of expression in zzso The promoter region of zzso isolated by zzso walking presented several zzso elements in the promoter zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by different zzso components including zzso salicylic acid and 2, zzso which was consistent with the predicted results of zzso promoter zzso This work is the first report of cloning and expression of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and will be useful to understand the regulatory role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
