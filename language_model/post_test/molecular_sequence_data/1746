The bovine respiratory zzso virus zzso fusion zzso protein is zzso at two zzso zzso sites, which results in generation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and release of an intervening zzso of 27 zzso zzso A series of zzso open reading frames zzso F proteins that lacked the entire zzso that contained an arbitrarily chosen 23 zzso sequence instead of zzso or in which zzso was replaced by the zzso acid sequences for the bovine zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 4 zzso or gamma zzso zzso was zzso zzso expression experiments revealed that the sequence of the intervening zzso influenced zzso zzso maturation of the F protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in place of zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso into the culture zzso All zzso F proteins except the zzso zzso could be expressed by and were functional for zzso zzso zzso of the cell culture properties of the zzso demonstrated that the zzso acid sequence between the two zzso zzso sites affected entry into target cells, direct spreading of zzso from cell to cell and virus zzso zzso of zzso and zzso into the medium of cells infected with the respective zzso demonstrated that the F protein can be used to express zzso zzso zzso peptides or zzso which might be of interest for the development of novel zzso zzso
