The zzso zzso degradation of zzso acid to zzso has recently been demonstrated to proceed via two unstable zzso and requires three separate zzso zzso The second step of this reaction, the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso The high-resolution crystal structure of zzso from the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso is a zzso protein that, based on sequence and structural zzso belongs to the zzso protein zzso In addition, the zzso kinetic parameters for this zzso and four zzso zzso have been zzso These data provide valuable insight into the functional roles of the zzso zzso Based upon the structural and kinetic data, a mechanism is proposed for the zzso zzso
