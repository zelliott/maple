Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from immature seeds of rice zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a deduced protein of 323 zzso acids that was zzso identical to previously characterized plant zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso a deduced protein of 336 zzso acids that shared only zzso zzso acid identity with zzso The deduced proteins both possessed an zzso motif and putative zzso recognition site sequences that were previously identified in bacterial zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis also revealed that each zzso gene exists as a single copy in the rice zzso The identity of zzso and zzso as zzso was confirmed by the expression of zzso activity in zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso only zzso activity was strongly inhibited at a high zzso zzso The zzso corresponding to zzso accumulated at high levels in developing rice zzso whereas there were only low levels of zzso transcripts in immature zzso These results indicate that zzso in rice zzso is zzso by two divergent zzso which play different roles in rice grains for starch storage based on their sensitivity to zzso zzso and level of transcripts in zzso
