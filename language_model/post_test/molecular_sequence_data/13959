zzso We have zzso three zzso from the liver of the zzso zzso guinea pig in order to evaluate the role of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of guinea pig increased the zzso zzso conversion of the PA zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso product, and zzso zzso a zzso product by 224 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso guinea pig zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso mass zzso in a zzso system zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso at rates of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A second zzso guinea pig zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso mass zzso produced zzso zzso from zzso at the rate of zzso zzso but zzso little zzso zzso The third guinea pig zzso an apparent 3A type zzso zzso zzso by zzso lost its zzso activity towards zzso during the final zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso metabolism by rabbit zzso raised against the guinea pig zzso zzso and 3A zzso indicated that the zzso played the most important role zzso zzso of the total zzso in zzso of zzso in both the zzso or zzso guinea zzso whereas zzso and 3A seemed to exhibit little zzso zzso PA zzso zzso along with zzso zzso also contributed to the zzso of zzso in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso guinea zzso zzso This study suggests that the putative zzso form plays the most important role in zzso zzso in guinea zzso
