Clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were studied to establish whether the expression of zzso resistance may be zzso or zzso By growth curve analysis, strain zzso exhibited the same lag period zzso 1 to zzso zzso whether it was zzso to zzso brain heart infusion broth or broth containing 6 zzso of zzso per zzso a growth pattern typical of zzso expressed zzso Use of zzso liquid zzso zzso to separate zzso precursor extracts substantiated this finding because the zzso zzso precursor zzso was produced in the presence and absence of zzso whereas no zzso was zzso In contrast, results with strain zzso were consistent with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a lag time that was 3 to 4 h longer when it was zzso to zzso broth than when it was zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that in the absence of zzso only zzso was zzso but in the presence of drug only zzso was zzso zzso expression of zzso resistance in zzso zzso is consistent with recent findings suggesting the presence of at least two zzso in this zzso Although zzso may be intrinsic to zzso zzso our findings raise doubt regarding the natural mechanism of this zzso zzso
