zzso and zzso clones zzso portions of a putative zzso zzso hormone zzso 2 zzso zzso led to the isolation of a zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso zzso The zzso shared 63 and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with human and rat zzso respectively, zzso identity with zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso and less than 37% with other members of this family of G zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso a zzso zzso zzso that lacked 17 zzso acids in the zzso zzso domain, showed zzso zzso when challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not when zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also failed to activate the human zzso but had similar efficiency and efficacy as zzso and zzso when tested with cells expressing the human zzso zzso zzso of zzso was less efficient than that of zzso and both zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso when zzso with either zzso growth zzso hormone, or zzso The zzso thus has zzso specificity similar to that of the human zzso which raises the possibility that a zzso zzso exists in zzso species which lack zzso zzso
