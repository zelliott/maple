zzso zzso regulatory zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso and controls the zzso of the zzso zzso in response to aromatic zzso zzso Secondary structure and fold recognition prediction of zzso A domain of this protein (210 zzso zzso was performed in zzso zzso and zzso The consensus result from these servers suggested zzso as a zzso Three zzso structures were generated from the sequence structure alignments of the template and target protein with zzso The results suggested that the zzso A domain of zzso belongs to zzso zzso zzso domain zzso The binding interaction sites of the known zzso were predicted using zzso zzso The proposed active site of zzso A domain of zzso comprises of key zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The findings provide some direction to the experimental studies that aim to broaden the range of zzso zzso which can be sensed by zzso in order to improve the zzso zzso
