zzso structures of a series of consensus sequence peptides with zzso and zzso capping interactions have been determined by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and a simulated zzso zzso All peptides are found to be stabilized by a zzso interaction and a capping box structure zzso at the zzso whereas several different capping motifs are discerned near the zzso zzso Among these, the zzso side zzso main chain zzso zzso capping structure is most stabilizing and highly populated in the simulated zzso zzso A zzso zzso capping motif zzso the zzso zzso which otherwise tends to zzso but this is occupied only a fraction of the time in the trial structures zzso Our experimental search over several models for a second type of zzso capping structure, the so-called zzso zzso which is seen in native zzso is zzso indicating this structural element contributes less to zzso stability in solution and most probably populates only zzso
