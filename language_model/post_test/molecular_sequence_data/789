Human zzso the gastrointestinal infection caused by two genetically different groups (or zzso of zzso zzso is very common worldwide, and its prevalence is higher in developing zzso However, few surveys in these regions have been performed to include a genetic characterization of the zzso which is necessary to unravel the complex epidemiology of the zzso In this work, we screened 120 zzso samples collected from zzso children in zzso and found 41 zzso of them to be positive, using zzso zzso for the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso was performed by zzso and/or sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The results disclosed an unexpectedly high genetic zzso among zzso of both zzso A and B, and a large percentage of the sequences zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso from zzso B zzso characterized by the presence of overlapping zzso zzso at specific positions in the zzso which can be attributed to mixed infections or to zzso sequence zzso of single zzso zzso this phenomenon was not observed in sequences from zzso A zzso These results suggest that the genetic structure is different in zzso of zzso A and zzso
