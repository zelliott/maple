Here we report two novel zzso zzso linear peptides zzso and zzso whose structures were deduced from zzso cloned from a zzso zzso library of the Brazilian yellow zzso zzso zzso Both mature peptides were zzso following their location in zzso zzso of zzso and synthetic replicates of each were subjected to a range of biological zzso The peptides were each active against model test zzso but with different zzso zzso was of low potency against all three test organisms zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso was of high potency against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso activity of zzso was low zzso at 160 zzso and in contrast, that of zzso was considerably higher zzso at 20 zzso zzso of four neutral zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso in each zzso had dramatic effects on their zzso zzso and zzso activities, particularly those of zzso The zzso of the enhanced zzso analogue zzso were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso for zzso coli but with an associated large increase in zzso activity zzso at 5 zzso The same zzso zzso zzso in zzso produced a dramatic effect on its zzso for zzso coli lowering this from zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso was ineffective against three of the five human cancer cell lines tested while zzso inhibited the growth of all zzso zzso zzso substitution of both peptides enhanced their potency against all five cell lines with zzso being the most potent with zzso values ranging between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are novel scorpion zzso peptides with broad spectrum zzso and zzso cell activities the zzso of which can be significantly enhanced by increasing their zzso
