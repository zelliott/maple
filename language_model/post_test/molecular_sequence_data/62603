The interaction between the zzso motif zzso of the human zzso virus zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso and viral zzso Two related zzso bovine zzso virus zzso and zzso disease virus zzso also require zzso zzso interactions to mediate zzso but the viruses have evolved different zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso can act as a zzso adopting both the zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso To examine how zzso interactions may evolve in a viral context and possibly to identify peptides that recognize zzso zzso in novel ways, we devised a zzso system based on zzso replication to amplify and select for zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso library based on the zzso zzso zzso and identified peptides that, like the zzso zzso zzso also function through zzso zzso revealing unexpected sequence characteristics of an zzso zzso The results suggest that a zzso screening approach may help identify zzso zzso zzso and may provide new insights into the evolution of zzso zzso
