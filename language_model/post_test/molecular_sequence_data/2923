In zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present as zzso and zzso formed from three distinct zzso of identical molecular weight, zzso zzso and zzso We report the cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso the beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso acid sequence shows greater than zzso zzso with the beta zzso from chicken obtained by protein sequencing and with alpha and gamma zzso from rat and mouse deduced from cloned zzso In contrast, there is no zzso between the 3' untranslated regions of mouse zzso zzso and gamma zzso zzso which also differ greatly in zzso The short 3' untranslated region of beta zzso zzso accounts for its distinct zzso 1600 zzso It is known that a progressive transition from alpha alpha to beta beta zzso occurs in developing skeletal zzso We show that this transition mainly results from a differential regulation of alpha and beta zzso zzso Analysis of zzso cell lines shows that beta zzso gene is expressed at the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso shows that the initial expression of beta transcripts occurs during the very first steps of the zzso pathway, suggesting that it could be a marker event of zzso lineage zzso
