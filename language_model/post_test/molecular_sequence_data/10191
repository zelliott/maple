zzso exchanges often muddle the typing of zzso class I zzso this is also the case for zzso zzso and molecular DNA class I typing report a zzso type for cell zzso whereas DNA sequencing finds zzso zzso differs by no more than four zzso acids from other zzso zzso a comparative analysis of the zzso and zzso families was therefore performed to determine why zzso and molecular DNA approaches report a zzso type for zzso Comparisons demonstrate that limited differences zzso the zzso and zzso molecules such that the genetic zzso of zzso 145 and zzso in the class I heavy chain's alpha 2 alpha zzso prompt zzso to exhibit a zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso DNA class I typing approaches are also swayed by genetic zzso to type zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lead zzso to exhibit a zzso zzso amplification zzso Thus, genetic exchanges zzso key zzso acids in the class I heavy chain lead molecular and zzso typing approaches to categorize zzso as a member of the zzso zzso
