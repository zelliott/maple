zzso zzso Y zzso has been proposed to form an zzso stabilized structure characterized by zzso and zzso zzso regions arranged zzso due to a central turn zzso zzso based on this structural model that have the central turn region and various amounts of the zzso regions removed, yet retain the N and C zzso in a similar spatial orientation were zzso The gap formed by removal of the central zzso zzso zzso or zzso was spanned with a single zzso acid zzso zzso and the structure was further stabilized by the introduction of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and found to have zzso binding affinities of zzso zzso and 150 zzso respectively, in mouse brain zzso zzso affinity is zzso zzso in this zzso It is proposed that the central region zzso zzso of zzso serves a structural role in the zzso and is not involved in direct zzso zzso
