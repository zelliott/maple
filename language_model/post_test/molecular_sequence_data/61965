The protein zzso has a large number of sequence zzso most of which are zzso as unknown and a few as belonging to the zzso zzso zzso but has no known biological zzso Using a combination of zzso acid sequence analysis, three-dimensional crystal structure information, and kinetic analysis, we have characterized zzso as zzso zzso from zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso revealed two distinct zzso a larger core domain and a smaller cap zzso The large domain is composed of a centrally located zzso parallel zzso with strand order zzso zzso zzso S1, zzso and a small zzso strands zzso and zzso This central sheet is flanked by a set of three zzso on one side and two zzso on the zzso The smaller domain is composed of an open faced zzso represented by three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso flanked by two zzso oriented zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of the large domain is zzso however, structural variation is observed in the smaller domain among the different functional classes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso revealed that this zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso with similar kinetic properties seen for zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso especially zzso and competitive zzso behavior with zzso zzso are similar between zzso and zzso zzso The experimental evidence presented for zzso is indicative of zzso zzso
