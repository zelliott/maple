zzso zzso is a zzso human pathogen that zzso the gastric zzso and causes an inflammatory process leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins often play an important role in zzso interactions and are thought to be selective zzso for the pathology of the zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso represent a large family of zzso proteins that seem to be specific for zzso from the zzso of zzso Although significantly elevated levels of zzso zzso were observed in many patients infected with zzso details on the biological functions of zzso proteins are zzso zzso belong to a large family of zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso was refined at zzso A resolution and revealed a zzso zzso composed of seven zzso bridged zzso an zzso capping zzso and an extended zzso zzso consisting of alternating zzso and zzso zzso In the crystal zzso the zzso zzso interacts with the zzso surface of a zzso zzso zzso A zzso pocket and a cluster of zzso charged zzso recognize the zzso of zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso nitrogen atom of zzso forms a short hydrogen bond with the zzso of zzso The interactions seen in this crystal contact are zzso similar to the zzso modes of the zzso organizing protein and the zzso zzso The conservation of the zzso mode suggests that zzso might recognize its binding partner in a similar zzso
