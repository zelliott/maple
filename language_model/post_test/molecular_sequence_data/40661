The crystal structures of the proteins zzso by the zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been determined at zzso and zzso resolution, zzso These proteins are members of a novel family of bacterial proteins that adopt the zzso zzso fold found in zzso and zzso zzso Despite sharing zzso sequence identity, these two proteins adopt distinct zzso arising from different zzso of their zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso these zzso are zzso apart, leading to the creation of a deep zzso zzso In the zzso structure zzso the zzso partially unfold and zzso zzso the cavity and decreasing the zzso zzso zzso These two complementary structures are reminiscent of the zzso switch in zzso carriers of zzso zzso It is suggested that both proteins may associate with the zzso zzso in their zzso zzso state by inserting their zzso zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso These bacterial proteins may function as carriers of zzso substances or as zzso activated zzso
