To examine the role of zzso zzso in zzso pregnancy by detection of DNA in archival zzso zzso and in their preceding cervical specimens and zzso zzso by using the zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso zzso embedded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from 37 women with zzso pregnancy were examined for the presence of C zzso zzso and zzso DNA by zzso In addition, preceding cervical specimens zzso zzso zzso stored either as cervical cell suspensions or as archival cervical zzso and preceding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso taken zzso years before the zzso pregnancy, were examined by zzso for the presence of C zzso 

C zzso DNA was detected in only one of the 48 zzso specimens from 37 zzso However, in six of the 37 women, C zzso DNA was detected in the zzso specimens zzso and/or zzso taken before zzso C zzso infections were mostly found in zzso or cervical specimens taken more than three years before zzso zzso No zzso DNA was found in zzso or cervical specimens taken at the same time of the zzso zzso 

Although no C zzso DNA was found in zzso zzso several women with zzso pregnancy had C zzso infections in zzso and cervical specimens in the zzso This suggests that at least in these cases the zzso pregnancy is a late zzso complication of an ascending C zzso infection resulting in a scarred zzso zzso
