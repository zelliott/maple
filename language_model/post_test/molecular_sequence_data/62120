In most zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso are clustered in long tandem zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso have indicated that zzso copy number is maintained through zzso events associated with zzso zzso of replication zzso zzso Here, we describe two zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso of a novel type of zzso that maintains zzso copy zzso The zzso zzso introduces zzso cuts in duplex DNA on the 3' side of junctions with zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso DNA zzso provokes zzso contraction, whereas simultaneous elimination of zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso associates with zzso at two zzso characteristic of the two zzso repeat zzso in zzso zzso We propose a model in which the zzso complex is involved in the control of the expansion and contraction of the zzso zzso by initiating zzso events at stalled zzso
