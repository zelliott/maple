zzso zzso which belongs to the order zzso is an zzso zzso zzso and causes an emerging, zzso and zzso infectious disease, zzso in humans and other zzso This zzso expresses a variety of zzso zzso proteins zzso by the zzso zzso family on the surface for the purpose of avoiding the host immune defense due to the zzso zzso In Japan, little is known about the molecular and biological features of zzso zzso In this study, we tried to characterize in detail the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso from two tick species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso A total of 174 zzso acid sequences from the zzso zzso clones after zzso cloning of the zzso obtained from the ticks were zzso zzso The results showed that most of the clone sequences from zzso zzso were very similar to each other, but the sequences from zzso zzso were diverse, and the sequences from the ticks were distinct from those from a wild deer that was previously zzso These findings suggest that zzso ticks are probably responsible for the transmission of certain genetic zzso of zzso zzso and that additional zzso selection might occur in zzso zzso
