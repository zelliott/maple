We hypothesized earlier that zzso T cell zzso and those unique to mouse zzso zzso contributed to its total zzso in zzso zzso zzso Recent studies of synthetic peptides from human zzso zzso revealed no zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso considered by some to render zzso zzso became zzso since only one zzso zzso contained zzso zzso positioned at zzso site zzso It primed T cells for zzso transfer, but zzso zzso containing zzso zzso was not zzso To determine 1) whether other primary zzso sites were likewise zzso and 2) whether zzso was requisite for this and other sites to be an zzso we zzso three pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso or T4 at positions 5, zzso or zzso zzso The six peptides were used to stimulate zzso cells in zzso and to zzso zzso None directly induced zzso zzso zzso were the lowest in mice given zzso or zzso Of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso T cells in zzso with zzso being the zzso Comparing zzso with zzso both activated zzso or zzso T cells to transfer zzso The marked zzso of zzso zzso and the poor zzso of zzso and zzso demonstrate that zzso of a zzso zzso site is dependent more on its zzso acid sequence than on T4 zzso zzso may enhance zzso and/or binding zzso but it is not required for a zzso zzso site to be an zzso
