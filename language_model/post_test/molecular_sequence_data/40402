As part of an ongoing effort to understand the biological response of wild and domestic zzso to different environmental pollutants such as zzso compounds, zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were cloned and zzso Four novel zzso zzso fragments from the zzso of four wild zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Three fragments from zzso zzso and deer were classified as zzso and the other zzso from elephant was designated as zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these zzso zzso showed identities ranging from 76 to zzso with other animal zzso The zzso analysis of these fragments showed that both elephant and zzso zzso made separate zzso while zzso and deer zzso were located beside that of horse and cattle respectively in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso ratio among the identified zzso indicated that odd zzso zzso zzso were exposed to different selection zzso
