To explore the possibility of using gene transfer to provide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity for treatment of Hunter syndrome, an zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the human zzso coding sequence was constructed and studied for gene expression in zzso zzso cell lines zzso from patients with Hunter syndrome were zzso with zzso and expressed high levels of zzso zzso activity, zzso to zzso higher than normal human peripheral blood zzso or zzso Such zzso zzso failed to show zzso of zzso into zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso participated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso from patients with Hunter syndrome reduced the zzso of zzso These results demonstrated zzso zzso gene transfer into zzso cells and the ability of such cells to provide zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso
