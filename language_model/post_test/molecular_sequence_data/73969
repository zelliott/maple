Isolation of the smooth zzso zzso of zzso zzso a suspected oral zzso is sometimes accompanied by isolation of a rough zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso type readily changes to a zzso zzso zzso in broth zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared to determine whether these three types are the result of phase zzso The zzso zzso resembled the zzso zzso in colony zzso zzso the zzso type and the zzso type did not have the zzso surface structures characteristic of the zzso type, and the zzso and zzso types were more zzso than the zzso zzso However, when we compared the sodium zzso zzso gel zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso data, zzso mass zzso data, zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso activities, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were very similar and were clearly distinct from the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso types form a cluster distinct from the zzso type and thus provide evidence that zzso zzso can be differentiated into two groups, one consisting of the zzso type and the other consisting of the zzso and zzso zzso
