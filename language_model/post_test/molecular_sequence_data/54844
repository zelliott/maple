This study examined the association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their adaptation to resistance training in older zzso Volunteers zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso strength assessment using zzso and zzso mass by dual energy X-ray zzso 79 volunteers performed 24 weeks of resistance training and 75 were studied as zzso zzso were identified by standard zzso No associations were observed for muscle strength for either zzso but volunteers carrying the zzso zzso presented higher zzso zzso mass compared to the zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso carriers presented higher relative zzso mass when compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso mass variables were significantly greater for carriers of both zzso and zzso zzso In response to zzso only the zzso carriers significantly increased zzso mass and a significant training zzso zzso interaction was zzso These findings do not support a pivotal role for the studied zzso in determining muscle strength in older women, but suggest a modest role in zzso mass zzso Of note, the results provide a novel insight that these genetic variations may interact to determine muscle mass in older zzso
