Four new zzso zzso strains were isolated from the zzso of zzso plants zzso zzso and zzso zzso known to exude high amounts of zzso in the zzso zzso were designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso In addition to their ability to tolerate and zzso high amounts of zzso of either up to 800 or up to 1,400 zzso zzso without apparent zzso in growth, all four strains were also able to degrade a broad range of aromatic zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to grow in pure culture and in defined mixed culture on zzso and on the mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compounds as a sole source of carbon and zzso zzso culture of zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso higher biomass amounts in comparison to mixed culture, under all zzso zzso successfully zzso zzso in the soil model system (2 g zzso within 6 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected and analyzed from the crude cell extract of the zzso While all four strains use zzso degradation pathway, zzso indicative of zzso degradation zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation activities were induced 2 h after supplementation by zzso but not by zzso zzso slightly inhibited activity of zzso zzso in strains zzso and zzso
