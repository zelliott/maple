The zzso gene family of zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso surface zzso zzso These highly zzso proteins are important zzso factors that mediate zzso to a variety of host zzso causing zzso of zzso red blood cells in vital zzso including the brain or zzso Acquisition of zzso zzso zzso with protection against severe zzso zzso however, understanding the relationship between gene expression and infection outcome is complicated by the modular genetic zzso of zzso genes that zzso varying numbers of zzso zzso with differential binding zzso By analyzing the domain zzso of fully zzso zzso gene zzso we reveal a zzso zzso association between the number of zzso zzso a zzso gene and their sequence zzso As such, zzso genes can be grouped into those that are short and diverse and genes that are long and zzso suggesting gene length as an important characteristic in the zzso of zzso zzso We then use an evolutionary framework to demonstrate how the same evolutionary forces acting on the level of an individual gene may have also shaped the zzso gene zzso The observed associations between sequence zzso gene architecture and repertoire structure can thus be explained by a zzso between zzso zzso fitness and minimizing zzso immune selection zzso Our results demonstrate how simple evolutionary mechanisms can explain zzso gene structuring on multiple levels and have important implications for understanding the multifaceted epidemiology of zzso zzso zzso
