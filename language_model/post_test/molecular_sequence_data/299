Several crystal structures of zzso a novel zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with various zzso have been determined at about zzso A zzso This zzso has optimal activity in the temperature range of zzso degrees C and pH zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso fold domain, a small lid domain, and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain consists of a zzso zzso flanked by seven zzso four on one side and three on the other zzso The zzso zzso binding domain consists of a zzso of 14 strands and a zzso covering motif on top of the highly zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso forming the zzso hole zzso and zzso are in positions similar to those of other zzso zzso zzso is located across the two zzso in the zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso domain of zzso with a zzso zzso from zzso zzso reveals an opposite zzso binding orientation in the two zzso zzso has a higher preference toward zzso zzso whose binding site is provided by a zzso tunnel in the zzso zzso The unusually large interacting surface area between the two zzso may contribute to zzso of the zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are identified as hinge zzso regulating movement of the lid zzso The zzso pattern associated with these two zzso is pH dependent, which may account for the optimal zzso activity at high zzso Further engineering of this novel zzso with high temperature and alkaline stability will find its use in industrial zzso
