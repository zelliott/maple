The zzso variation of influenza virus represents a major health zzso However, the zzso domain of the minor, zzso zzso protein is nearly zzso in all influenza A zzso We genetically fused this zzso domain to the zzso B virus core zzso protein to create fusion gene coding for zzso this gene was efficiently expressed in zzso zzso zzso or zzso administration of zzso zzso particles to mice provided zzso protection against a lethal virus zzso The protection was zzso by zzso as it was zzso by zzso The enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso domain exposed on zzso particles allows zzso long-lasting protection against influenza A zzso
