The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the G zzso zzso family involved in zzso and zzso of zzso cells, as well as in host zzso against infection by zzso zzso Upon challenge by zzso the zzso zzso zzso a rapid zzso on zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In this study, we used cells zzso zzso with either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso affected in their capacity to be zzso to examine the role played by zzso in the zzso trafficking of the zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso the zzso zzso was rapidly zzso into zzso that cluster near the nucleus after 10 zzso zzso of a zzso zzso was severely impaired relative to zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso on zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso showed a rate of zzso intermediate between that of zzso zzso and that of the zzso zzso Under continuous exposure to zzso and in the absence of protein zzso the zzso zzso was maintained in a highly zzso state but was not zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies indicated that zzso receptors were recycled to the plasma zzso During this process, receptors were zzso with zzso that correlated with the zzso of zzso recovery on the cell zzso Altogether, our data suggest that zzso plays a key role in the zzso trafficking of the zzso zzso zzso receptors might be recognized by an zzso protein that interacts with the zzso zzso
