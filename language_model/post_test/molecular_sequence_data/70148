zzso zzso is a zzso intermediate in the zzso zzso of zzso An zzso catalyzing the reduction of zzso is thought to prevent the damage to protein by the formation of zzso The zzso zzso activity was detected in the extracts of various monkey zzso among which kidney exhibited the highest specific zzso One zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and two zzso zzso with zzso of 38,000 and zzso were zzso from monkey zzso The zzso zzso exhibited high zzso zzso activity and was zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso of monkey zzso The two zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity, but were clearly distinct from each other in zzso zzso inhibitor sensitivity, and effect of zzso zzso One zzso was zzso zzso with human liver zzso zzso whereas sequence data of zzso peptides from the other zzso revealed zzso zzso identity with human zzso zzso zzso zzso of kinetic zzso among the monkey kidney zzso and zzso zzso from several zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited higher zzso efficiency for zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
