The zzso root rot disease caused by the zzso pathogen zzso zzso is one major yield reducing factor in zzso crop zzso A comparative zzso approach was carried out in order to identify proteins of the model zzso zzso zzso which are regulated after an infection with zzso zzso zzso Several proteins were identified by two zzso gel zzso to be zzso expressed after pathogen zzso zzso evaluation of expression values showed different regulation during the zzso zzso zzso regulated during the infection were identified by zzso assisted laser zzso of zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso expressed zzso two zzso putative cell wall proteins and two were designated as small heat shock zzso Furthermore, an zzso of the zzso was found to be increased in infected zzso The majority of induced proteins belonged to the family of class 10 of zzso related proteins zzso Previously, various zzso proteins have been shown to be regulated by general stress or zzso acid zzso zzso these proteins were further investigated concerning their regulation in response to drought stress and zzso zzso Complex regulation patterns were zzso three of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were also induced by zzso zzso but none of them is induced after drought zzso In contrast, three of these proteins are zzso by drought zzso zzso the strong expression of different zzso members and their regulation profiles indicates that this set of proteins plays a major role during root adaptations to various stress zzso
