zzso and zzso initiation factors 2 zzso are zzso proteins zzso zzso the small zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso This study reports the zzso structure of an zzso zzso from zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso is in a closed zzso with the G domain packed on zzso II and zzso The zzso domain of zzso interacts with domain II of zzso zzso of the two switch regions involved in zzso binding are similar to those encountered in an zzso zzso zzso with the zzso structure suggests that only the gamma zzso of the zzso zzso contacts zzso Because the alpha zzso markedly reinforces the affinity of zzso for the gamma zzso a contribution of the alpha zzso to the switch movements observed in the gamma structure is zzso
