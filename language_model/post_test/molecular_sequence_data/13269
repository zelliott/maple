zzso coli zzso which is resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but is susceptible to zzso zzso zzso and zzso was isolated from the urine of a patient treated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso from the bacteria had a zzso of zzso had a molecular weight of about zzso and zzso zzso antibiotics such as zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso zzso such as zzso acid and zzso Resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was transferred by zzso transfer from zzso coli zzso to zzso coli zzso and the transferred zzso was about 58 zzso belonging to zzso group zzso The zzso resistance gene for zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso by transformation of zzso coli zzso The sequence of the gene for zzso was determined, and the open reading frame of the gene consisted of 873 or 876 bases zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the gene zzso zzso number zzso was found to be about zzso zzso to the sequence of the gene zzso a class A zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso According to the zzso acid sequence deduced from the DNA zzso the precursor consisted of 290 or zzso zzso acid zzso which contained zzso acid motifs common to class A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was about zzso zzso to the zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso the newly isolated zzso zzso produced by zzso coli zzso is similar to zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso rather than to zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso has shown the highest degree of similarity to zzso zzso class A zzso zzso comparison of zzso with other zzso implied that replacement of zzso by zzso with the zzso substitution of zzso for zzso is an important zzso in the extension of the zzso zzso
