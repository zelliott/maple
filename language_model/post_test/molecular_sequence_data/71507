We have used zzso I zzso to examine the formation of zzso zzso on DNA fragments which have been zzso with zzso core zzso We have prepared five DNA fragments, based on the zzso zzso zzso which contain different length zzso tracts (up to 25 zzso at two different positions along the fragment, and have examined their availability for zzso formation after zzso onto zzso core zzso These results are compared with the formation of shorter zzso in the same zzso In general we find that increasing the length of the complex does not facilitate zzso triplex formation and that the most important factor affecting triplex formation is the position of the target site within the zzso zzso In some instances we find that longer zzso inhibit triplex zzso Although successful triplex formation was achieved on the longest zzso zzso zzso this was accompanied by changes in zzso pattern that suggest zzso changes in zzso zzso
