zzso of zzso muscle zzso receptors zzso requires association with zzso zzso a protein with an intrinsic ability to zzso Previous studies on sofa potato zzso an zzso zzso line of zzso have suggested that zzso may play an active role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso To test this proposal directly, we identified and cloned the gene responsible for the zzso zzso and then attempted to rescue zzso zzso of the zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso to zzso zzso at position 28, near the N zzso of the zzso zzso delta zzso zzso expression of zzso delta zzso in zzso fish was unable to restore surface expression of muscle zzso In contrast, expression of zzso delta zzso restored the ability of muscle to assemble surface receptors along with the ability of fish to zzso Most importantly, the ability of zzso clusters to zzso effectively to zzso sites also was rescued in large zzso Our results point to direct involvement of the zzso zzso in restricting zzso clusters to the zzso
