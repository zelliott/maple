zzso of DNA sequences found upstream of zzso and all zzso genes displays zzso zzso This identity continues 19 zzso into the zzso gene such that the first 6 zzso acids of zzso and zzso are the zzso Furthermore, the percent zzso content zzso of zzso is considerably lower than that of zzso and the zzso within the zzso structural gene changes dramatically after the first 19 zzso This is unequivocal evidence that zzso is a zzso
