zzso zzso zzso constitute approximately zzso of the human and mouse zzso Some zzso diseases are attributed to the altered expression of zzso In this study, we examined the zzso expression profiles in zzso zzso and analyzed their biological zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso mice were analyzed for differential zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso examination of zzso zzso zzso Each tissue had a unique profile of zzso zzso A zzso map identifying 60 putative zzso was established using 22 unique zzso as zzso and their biological properties zzso binding site, coding potential, zzso regulatory element, zzso zzso event, and integration zzso were zzso Interestingly, 12 putative zzso retained intact coding zzso for all three zzso essential for virus assembly and zzso We suggest that zzso expression is zzso regulated in conjunction with the zzso environment of individual zzso zzso
