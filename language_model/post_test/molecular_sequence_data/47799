zzso are zzso proteins that form a parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso type are located zzso to the rod and unique sequence elements are found in the zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso revealed that the zzso zzso are not responsible for the strong zzso bundling activity of zzso zzso The strongest activity resides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses this bundling activity by binding to a zzso zzso zzso These data define a new zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso motif enhances zzso of a zzso zzso I zzso to the cell zzso and improves the rescue of zzso This motif is not required, however, for zzso to the zzso zzso A model is presented proposing that zzso zzso is based on a zzso cycle of polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso
