Rapid synaptic transmission depends on the zzso of zzso channels by zzso The molecular characterization of these membrane proteins has provided a valuable framework for investigating basic synaptic mechanisms and for developing zzso strategies for the manipulation of neural zzso This chapter begins with a summary of present molecular knowledge about different classes of zzso channels, including the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso mechanisms of zzso channels are discussed in terms of detailed zzso models that involve zzso transitions coupled with the occupation of binding sites by zzso In addition to providing a quantitative understanding of the zzso aspects of synaptic transmission, these zzso models have been used to clarify the action of drugs that serve as valuable tools for the investigation and management of zzso Relating these physical theories of zzso function to molecular structure represents a growing field of research on the nervous zzso
