The X protein of zzso B virus zzso plays a major role on zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso in the liver is an important zzso for transportation of very low density zzso and low density zzso Although zzso zzso in the liver is known as one of the factors for the zzso the relationship between zzso and zzso during the zzso development is poorly zzso To better understand the biological significance of zzso in zzso liver Chang cells that specifically express zzso were established and zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso of zzso significantly zzso the expression of zzso zzso an zzso that functions as a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and increases zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression levels of zzso cells appeared to be higher than that of zzso cells as well as zzso cells, indicating that zzso may has a strong zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso which contained the increased zzso zzso were accumulated in zzso liver zzso These cells as well as zzso liver cells revealed the zzso of zzso zzso and the increased zzso of zzso zzso and cholesterol compared with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso in liver cells was shown to zzso the zzso level of zzso zzso transfer zzso which regulates the assembly and zzso of zzso zzso our study strongly suggested that the zzso increase in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso by zzso the expression of zzso
