zzso zzso by the zzso method can be efficiently zzso in a single immobilized metal affinity zzso step based on interaction with the zzso group if, after zzso of each zzso acid zzso zzso zzso groups are zzso blocked by zzso and if no strongly zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso are present in the zzso A difference in zzso for zzso and zzso functions of zzso 2 pH units is sufficiently large to allow selective binding of peptides to immobilized metal zzso via the zzso zzso zzso The binding is zzso on zzso and zzso supports most peptides are zzso retarded at pH values around zzso and zzso zzso The decreased binding strength at lower pH values is due to zzso of the zzso function, whereas the reduced affinity at higher pH is caused by metal zzso transfer from the zzso to the zzso The metal zzso is captured in a zzso zzso where, in addition to the zzso group, up to three adjacent zzso zzso zzso are coordinated to the zzso If the pH is raised further, additional metal zzso may be bound in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to its higher selectivity and zzso is the preferred zzso support if slightly basic conditions can be zzso
