In mice undergoing a zzso zzso reaction, donor T cells responding to the zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso of the zzso B cells and zzso of their zzso and zzso zzso a zzso B zzso that arose in the zzso zzso tissue zzso of a zzso zzso zzso F1 hybrid mouse that had been injected with parental zzso zzso is of particular interest because it produces zzso heavily zzso but, zzso zzso zzso zzso bears and contains zzso but switches to zzso zzso The zzso zzso variable region is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso juxtaposed to zzso 16 and zzso and by a zzso gene of the zzso zzso group juxtaposed to zzso Both zzso and zzso are heavily zzso The zzso binds to zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and to human zzso but not to zzso human zzso or any of several other zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso sites do not zzso The switched zzso and heavy load of zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso suggest that T zzso zzso selection of the zzso precursor B cell may have been superimposed on zzso B cell zzso originally associated with the zzso
