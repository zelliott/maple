Iron regulatory proteins zzso are zzso zzso binding proteins that are central components of a sensory and regulatory network that zzso zzso iron zzso zzso regulate iron metabolism by binding to iron responsive zzso zzso in the zzso or 3' untranslated region of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso have been identified zzso zzso exhibits two mutually exclusive functions as an zzso binding protein or as the zzso zzso of zzso We demonstrate that the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso represents the first example of a zzso cell line that fails to express zzso protein or zzso First, all of the zzso binding activity in zzso cells is attributable to zzso Second, synthesis of zzso but not of zzso is zzso in zzso zzso Third, the zzso family of cells express zzso zzso at a level similar to other zzso cell lines, but zzso zzso is not zzso In the zzso family of cells, zzso in iron status modulated zzso zzso and zzso zzso level over as much as a zzso and zzso range, zzso We conclude that zzso is not essential for regulation of zzso or zzso expression by iron and that zzso can act as the sole zzso zzso of cellular iron zzso
