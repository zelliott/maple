Two genes from the total zzso DNA of dairy starter culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modification zzso have been cloned and expressed in zzso zzso No zzso between the two zzso genes was zzso and inverse zzso chain reaction of zzso zzso DNA indicated that both were linked on the zzso zzso Neither clone zzso the zzso zzso The DNA sequence of one of the zzso genes zzso by zzso was determined and consisted of an open reading frame zzso zzso long, which could zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence contained the highly characteristic motifs of an zzso zzso zzso regions of zzso were observed with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
