zzso zzso the N protein of the bovine zzso zzso strain zzso have been cloned in zzso zzso using zzso produced by zzso with zzso on zzso viral zzso zzso Some 265 zzso clones were zzso zzso of these zzso with zzso zzso extracted from infected cells led to the conclusion that they were located at the zzso of the zzso After zzso in zzso zzso DNA, clones were zzso by the zzso zzso A zzso sequence corresponding to the gene coding for the viral zzso was zzso It shows 2 overlapping open reading frames zzso The zzso end of the gene has an zzso sequence in common with the zzso zzso areas of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This sequence may represent the zzso zzso binding zzso An upstream sequence surrounding the first zzso of the smaller zzso zzso to a potentially functional initiation zzso The sequence of the primary translation product deduced from the DNA sequence predicts a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso with a high zzso zzso content, possessing a zzso zzso zzso The larger zzso has a coding capacity of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso molecular zzso The deduced protein possesses 43 zzso zzso zzso of the total zzso acid zzso which may be zzso and involved in zzso zzso zzso also has 5 regions with a high basic zzso acid zzso One of them is also zzso and has a strong zzso site with zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the first part of the zzso a zzso sequence zzso is highly zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strain and zzso have only minor differences in their zzso zzso
