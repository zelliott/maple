Nuclear importing system and nuclear factors play important roles in zzso nuclear zzso and zzso gene zzso However, the components and mechanisms that mediate zzso specific targeting of the nuclear proteins during nuclear zzso and zzso gene zzso remain largely zzso Here, we identified a novel member of the zzso family, zzso which is predominantly expressed in mouse zzso and zzso and zzso to the nucleus or zzso zzso of zzso gene caused zzso reduction and sex imbalance by inducing preferential fetal zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that the cell cycle of activated zzso zzso is loss of control and ahead of schedule but finally failed to develop into zzso zzso Further zzso and zzso modification analysis showed that knocking out of zzso induced abnormalities of gene expression zzso zzso and zzso and zzso modifications zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso interacts with zzso zzso In zzso we identified a novel zzso gene that is required for normal fertility and zzso
