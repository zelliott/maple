zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso and is involved in zzso zzso As a part of a study to determine biological functions of zzso we used molecular modeling to identify zzso as a zzso that is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in tandem with zzso generates a zzso form of the zzso zzso Mice that were engineered to express two copies of this zzso zzso protein died in zzso Additionally, zzso mice expressing zzso with zzso activity that is moderately reduced when compared to zzso activity appear zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso zzso activity is essential for normal zzso zzso
