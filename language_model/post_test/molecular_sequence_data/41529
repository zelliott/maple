As the killer toxin produced by zzso zzso zzso could kill many sensitive zzso zzso including the zzso ones, the zzso killer toxin in the zzso of cell culture of the marine zzso strain was zzso and zzso The molecular mass of the zzso killer toxin was estimated to be zzso zzso according to the data from zzso The zzso killer toxin had killing activity, but could not zzso zzso The optimal conditions for action of the zzso killer toxin against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were the zzso medium with zzso zzso pH zzso and temperature 16 zzso The gene zzso the killer toxin from the marine killer zzso zzso was cloned and the zzso of the gene was zzso zzso The deduced protein from the cloned gene zzso the killer toxin had 125 zzso acids with calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso It was also found that the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso killer toxin had the same corresponding sequence deduced from the cloned killer toxin gene in this marine zzso confirming that the zzso killer toxin was indeed zzso by the cloned zzso
