zzso a zzso zzso of zzso acid induced a zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso was inhibited by protein zzso C zzso zzso C and zzso but not by the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso The role of zzso zzso alpha v beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1 in zzso induced zzso zzso was zzso In zzso zzso cultures, alpha v beta 3 is localized to focal zzso at both the cell body and zzso borders and is zzso with zzso focal zzso In contrast, alpha 5 beta 1 is primarily enriched at the zzso borders, demonstrating zzso with cell cortical zzso and zzso zzso Both receptors were functional in zzso zzso or zzso interactions based on the observations that specific zzso inhibited zzso zzso to intact zzso zzso and disrupted the zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso temporally defined zzso of the alpha v beta zzso focal zzso leading to an eventual decrease in alpha v beta 3 plaques in the zzso zzso This effect of zzso was inhibited by zzso C but not by zzso The zzso of alpha v beta zzso focal zzso preceded the development of zzso zzso zzso also enhanced zzso alpha v beta 3 surface expression as revealed by zzso flow zzso and digitized image zzso zzso alpha v beta 3 zzso zzso decreased focal zzso zzso and enhanced surface zzso did not result from altered zzso zzso (as revealed by zzso zzso zzso or protein translation (as revealed by Western zzso In contrast to its effect on alpha v beta 3, zzso did not demonstrate a temporally zzso zzso effect on the distribution pattern and the surface expression of alpha 5 beta 1, although the zzso border zzso pattern of alpha 5 beta 1 was disrupted due to zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso decrease of alpha v beta 3 zzso to focal zzso may contribute to the development of zzso zzso and that zzso induced increase in alpha v beta 3 surface expression may promote zzso of inflammatory zzso as well as tumor cells to zzso
