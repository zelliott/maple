The type II and type III collagen zzso chain zzso are a 27 zzso with the sequence zzso and a zzso zzso Their zzso have been studied in zzso zzso solution by means of two-dimensional zzso zzso and CD zzso Based on zzso and zzso experiments, all zzso were assigned and the zzso properties were analyzed in terms of zzso zzso alpha zzso constants, sequential and medium range zzso and zzso zzso temperature zzso The zzso of the type II zzso is essentially zzso Evidence from CD zzso suggests that a very minor proportion of the zzso might be zzso zzso but the zzso data show no evidence for a zzso zzso The observation of reduced zzso zzso temperature dependence zzso in certain sections of the zzso can, in view of the absence of any other supporting evidence, only be interpreted in terms of local shielding from zzso for zzso reasons zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the type III zzso is mostly extended except for a zzso ranging from zzso to zzso which is stabilized by a zzso between zzso of zzso and the zzso group of zzso The low temperature zzso of zzso and, in particular, the observation of a medium range zzso between H alpha zzso and zzso corroborate the existence of a zzso in this zzso Although spectral overlap prevents a precise conclusion with regard to the type of zzso present, there is some evidence that it might be type zzso
