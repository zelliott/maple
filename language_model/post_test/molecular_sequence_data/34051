DNA mismatch repair zzso is a highly zzso zzso avoidance mechanism that zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso In initial steps in zzso zzso binds zzso and small zzso zzso and zzso binds larger zzso zzso The zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso domain I of zzso does not dramatically affect zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso show strong defects in zzso zzso Interestingly, several zzso identified in patients with zzso zzso zzso cancer map to domain I of zzso none have been found in zzso To understand the role of zzso domain I in zzso we examined the consequences of combining the zzso zzso with zzso in two distinct regions of zzso and those that increase cellular zzso load zzso and zzso These experiments reveal zzso zzso in zzso repair, with significant effects on zzso zzso In zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso DNA binding is less specific for DNA zzso and produces an altered footprint on a mismatch DNA zzso Together, these results provide evidence that, in zzso multiple factors insulate zzso from defects in domain I of zzso and provide insights into how zzso in zzso domain I may cause zzso zzso zzso zzso
