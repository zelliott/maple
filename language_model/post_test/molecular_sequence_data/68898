zzso In zzso zzso zzso has revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely expressed in unique although overlapping patterns in the central and peripheral nervous zzso In addition, an intricate regulation of expression is apparent during zzso This raises the question of the zzso control of these complex zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso control elements of one zzso zzso zzso alpha 3, which is expressed both in the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as in zzso cells, is presented zzso zzso Overlapping zzso clones containing the rat beta 4, alpha 3, and alpha 5 gene cluster were isolated and a restriction map of this region was zzso zzso The zzso start sites of the alpha 3 gene were mapped by zzso protection zzso Surprisingly, there is no consensus zzso box upstream of these zzso This is consistent with the finding of multiple initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso were done in zzso cells using the bacterial zzso zzso gene as a reporter zzso Several restriction fragments from the region located zzso and including the zzso start sites were shown to promote zzso of the reporter gene and thus contain at least part of the alpha 3 zzso In addition, a region further upstream, within the beta 4 zzso unit, appears to reduce zzso activity and thus could be a zzso zzso It is proposed that this putative zzso is a selective force in maintaining the tight linkage of these three zzso
