zzso stem cell transplantation zzso is performed for treatment of a broad spectrum of zzso zzso of an intact immune system is crucial after transplantation to avoid infectious zzso and above all, the establishment of T cell zzso zzso diversity is the most important goal in the zzso Until recently, little has been known of the mechanism of T cell zzso in the very early period after zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso zzso in four patients with severe combined zzso zzso before and after zzso In all patients, the zzso zzso were extremely abnormal before zzso whereas after transplantation there was progressive improvement in zzso diversity, based on analysis of the zzso zzso repertoire and zzso size zzso zzso unexpectedly, there was a significant but transient expansion of zzso diversity 1 month after transplantation in all zzso zzso analysis of zzso performed in one case showed that many T cell clones shared identical zzso sequences at 1 month and that the shared fraction decreased zzso These results indicate that early expansion of zzso diversity may reflect transient expansion of pre-existing mature T cells from the donor blood, independent of de zzso T cell maturation through the zzso
