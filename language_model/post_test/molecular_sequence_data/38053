zzso zzso zzso channels are important in cellular zzso of many excitable zzso zzso acid sequence alignment of different zzso inward zzso zzso channels revealed two absolutely zzso zzso zzso in the putative zzso face, suggesting a possible zzso zzso Replacement of these zzso zzso in the zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso with either zzso or zzso abolished current in zzso zzso zzso although Western zzso established that the channels were fully zzso The zzso pattern of channels treated with zzso zzso combined with Western zzso under reducing and zzso conditions confirmed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and single channel current recordings of zzso expressing tandem zzso zzso with one or two of the zzso zzso suggested that zzso of one zzso zzso is sufficient to eliminate channel zzso zzso studies confirmed that the zzso zzso channels eliminate zzso zzso currents in a zzso zzso Despite these results, zzso reduction did not alter the functional properties of zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso with the two zzso zzso predicted that the zzso loop between the first zzso domain and the pore zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso structure, the zzso bond together with the zzso structure is expected to zzso and stabilize the zzso and selectivity zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso bond exists between zzso and zzso of zzso channel and this zzso might be required for proper channel zzso
