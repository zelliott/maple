We describe a class of human repetitive DNA, called beta satellite, that, at a most fundamental level, exists as tandem zzso of zzso approximately equal to zzso zzso repeat zzso The zzso units are organized as distinct subsets, each characterized by a zzso zzso repeat unit that is zzso reiterated and represents a recent unit of zzso We have zzso zzso and determined the sequence of two beta satellite zzso repeat zzso one located on zzso 9, the other on the zzso zzso (13, 14, 15, 21, and zzso and perhaps other sites in the zzso Analysis by zzso gel zzso reveals that these tandem zzso are localized in large zzso zzso zzso zzso that are marked by restriction zzso length zzso In total, beta satellite sequences comprise several million base pairs of DNA in the human zzso Analysis of this DNA family should permit insights into the nature of zzso and zzso modes of satellite DNA evolution and provide useful tools for probing the molecular organization and concerted evolution of the zzso zzso
