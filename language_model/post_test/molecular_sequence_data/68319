zzso studies of primary processes of zzso ordering in zzso zzso have suggested that a change in mechanism from zzso to zzso zzso formation occurs on lowering the concentration of zzso We report here zzso observations consistent with zzso double zzso in a zzso zzso zzso by arresting this process of primary zzso ordering by an zzso freeze fixation zzso zzso transmission electron zzso zzso revealed isolated zzso chains showing a range of zzso zzso zzso and zzso consistent with zzso zzso Control experiments in which zzso was frozen in the zzso form revealed longer and thinner zzso
