Further genetic evidence is provided here that zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso having zzso c zzso zzso were obtained and zzso zzso zzso was defective in a novel zzso named zzso which was responsible for the synthesis of a zzso zzso with an Mr of 20,000 zzso This zzso zzso c appeared to zzso electron transport from the zzso zzso complex to the zzso terminal zzso and, unlike zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was localized in zzso the structural gene for zzso I of zzso zzso This finding also led to the cloning and sequencing of the corresponding zzso zzso gene that zzso a zzso protein with a predicted Mr of zzso The zzso protein shared about zzso sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso I of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to fix nitrogen in zzso with soybean zzso In contrast, zzso described previously which lacked the zzso complex did not develop into zzso zzso and were thus zzso The data suggest that a zzso respiratory chain exists in zzso zzso in which the electrons branch off at the zzso zzso
