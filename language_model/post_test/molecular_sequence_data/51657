To study mechanisms for dominance of zzso eight zzso and four zzso zzso at the alcohol zzso zzso locus were analyzed for partial dominance in their interaction with normal zzso All zzso and one of the X-ray zzso were single base zzso the other three X-ray zzso were zzso base zzso All but one of the 12 zzso zzso were selected for this study because they produced zzso zzso zzso but seven of the 11 producing a zzso could not form zzso with the normal zzso and the zzso activity of zzso was about half that of normal zzso Four zzso formed zzso with a decreased zzso efficiency and two of these were near the limit of zzso these two also inhibited the formation of normal zzso The zzso zzso therefore show multiple mechanisms leading to partial zzso expression in zzso and a wide range of dominance ranging from almost complete zzso to nearly zzso All zzso acid changes in zzso peptides that form zzso are located between zzso acids 182 and zzso so this region is not critical for zzso It may, however, be an important surface domain for zzso
