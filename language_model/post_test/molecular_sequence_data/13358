zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and full length zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed an identical form of zzso This zzso zzso zzso for a protein of zzso zzso zzso two zzso acids shorter at the zzso end than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, the two zzso exhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with each other, and both were highly zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, to human and bovine zzso also zzso zzso acid zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence further suggested that the regions of the zzso corresponding to presumed zzso III, V and IX, assuming conservation of zzso boundaries with the human zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso while sequence zzso occurred in all other putative zzso In zzso expression indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was almost zzso more active in the synthesis of zzso from zzso than was the zzso zzso which zzso more zzso than zzso Western analysis of zzso zzso cells suggested that the differences in activity were not due to levels of expression of the zzso since similar levels of zzso protein were observed in cells zzso with each zzso Both zzso were sensitive to zzso of activity by the specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, activity of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso but the zzso zzso zzso was zzso These functional differences were consistent with observations made in similar experiments involving zzso activity in freshly zzso zzso These data provide evidence of the existence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso the first described in any species and suggest that pigs possess a unique mechanism for regulating zzso zzso
