The bovine zzso zzso zzso was zzso by Southern zzso zzso using the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso DNA zzso gene as a zzso A zzso zzso region which zzso specifically to the zzso DNA zzso gene was identified within the zzso III G zzso at approximate map units zzso In order to provide further evidence that this is the location of the zzso DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso region was cloned and part of it zzso An uninterrupted stretch of over 800 zzso was obtained and an open reading frame spanning the entire sequence was zzso The zzso acid sequence that it encodes shows striking zzso to a region within the zzso half of other zzso DNA zzso
