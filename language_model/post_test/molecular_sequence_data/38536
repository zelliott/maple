The complete DNA sequence of the nuclear zzso zzso gene complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Biology 29, zzso The complete sequence of the nuclear zzso DNA gene complex of the zzso fungus zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso repeated unit was zzso zzso long and appears to be the shortest zzso cluster described so far among zzso zzso zzso pairs were designed for amplification of the region spanning half of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso end of zzso zzso of a number of zzso zzso isolated from various hosts and geographic zzso Great zzso was detected in the amplified products of the zzso region resulting in fragments varying from zzso to zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso were classified into two groups with zzso and zzso amplified products, zzso The former group included 31 zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso whereas the latter included 10 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of representative zzso products of the above groups identified a zzso region harboring most of larger zzso whereas most of the small changes were due to transitions and zzso One zzso zzso isolate with a zzso zzso product contained 13 perfectly zzso tandem repeats of 39 zzso zzso The presence of similar incomplete sequences in the corresponding regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a particular standard motif of insertions in the zzso region of the zzso and is zzso
