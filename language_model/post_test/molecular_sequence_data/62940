The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of large zzso zzso zzso DNA for 76 strains of 46 species of zzso zzso zzso and related zzso were zzso zzso sequence diversity of medically important zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were extremely small; as few as 0 changes were detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso species, 1 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 2 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity between most species was zzso These data suggested that the zzso domain is sufficiently variable for identification of zzso zzso zzso and relevant zzso The zzso trees constructed from the sequence data revealed that most human zzso species formed a single cluster and that zzso and zzso species were distributed zzso into several zzso
