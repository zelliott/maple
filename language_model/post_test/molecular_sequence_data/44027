Fourteen analogue DNA sequences containing the zzso operator sequence and a single zzso zzso linkage are each prepared from the zzso pure zzso zzso zzso building block, prepared as a zzso The analogue sequences are shown to be single zzso on the basis of zzso analysis of the zzso zzso in each case, only a single zzso zzso is zzso These analogue sequences can be used effectively to probe for interactions to either of the zzso zzso zzso as illustrated by their use to identify critical interactions in the zzso zzso zzso In a number of cases, the pairs of zzso analogue sequences exhibit variable binding affinities that can be used to identify one of the zzso zzso zzso as a critical site for zzso zzso Upon the basis of zzso constants, apparent incremental binding energies are assigned to specific zzso In all but one example, these identified sites for interactions to the zzso backbone can be correlated with contacts implicated by the crystal structure analysis of the zzso zzso zzso
