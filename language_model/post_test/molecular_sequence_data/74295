One of the options enabling more economic production of zzso compared to pure cultures is the application of mixed zzso The use of a microbial community in a sequencing batch reactor has a few zzso a simple process control, no necessity for sterile processing, and possibilities of using cheap zzso as a source of zzso Nevertheless, while zzso methods to achieve high zzso biomass concentration and high productivity in wild and zzso strains are zzso knowledge about the zzso strategy for zzso production by mixed culture and species composition of bacterial communities is still very zzso The main object of this study was to characterize on the molecular level the composition and activity of zzso producing zzso in activated sludge cultivated under oxygen limitation zzso zzso producers were detected using a zzso technique and the created zzso zzso gene library was analyzed by DNA zzso The obtained results indicate that zzso belonged to zzso zzso and possessed genes coding for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso expression was relatively estimated using real-time zzso technology at several zzso Performed quantitative and qualitative analysis of total bacterial activity showed that there were differences in total activity during the process but differential expression of various groups of zzso examined by using zzso was not zzso
