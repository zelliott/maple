The social zzso zzso zzso expresses five zzso genes at different stages of zzso One of them, zzso is expressed during zzso development and zzso is induced by zzso zzso A zzso of zzso the zzso zzso is expressed exclusively during zzso zzso We cloned two zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the primitive species zzso zzso which show high zzso to zzso and zzso and less zzso to the other zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso and zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso genes are expressed during the entire course of zzso The expression levels are low during growth, increase at the onset of zzso and do not decrease until zzso bodies have zzso zzso of neither zzso or zzso is regulated by zzso So even though the high degree of zzso between the zzso genes of different species suggests conservation of function, this function is apparently not associated with a specific zzso zzso
