The complete zzso sequences were determined for three transcripts each zzso a different zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was determined also for a transcript zzso a fourth zzso but this was zzso The data obtained confirm absence of the zzso zzso zzso lack of zzso sequence elements in the 3' untranslated region, and zzso in the zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso transcripts zzso A comparison of the zzso acids deduced from the zzso sequences of the four zzso and those of other zzso published previously reveals a strong conservation of several structural zzso particularly zzso zzso located throughout most of the zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso analyzed in this study resemble most the zzso zzso zzso domain type B of zzso zzso characterized by a zzso zzso located toward the zzso end, a cluster of zzso zzso in the central region, and at least three zzso zzso between positions 250 and 300 of the zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso did not fit into any of the zzso schemes proposed for the zzso so far zzso and thus may represent a different class of these surface zzso Unlike zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso have no zzso zzso at the zzso zzso These data now make it possible to predict general primary structural features of zzso zzso zzso
