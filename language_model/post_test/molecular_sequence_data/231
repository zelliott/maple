Heat shock protein 90 zzso is a highly zzso essential protein in zzso Here we describe the molecular zzso of zzso from three zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso worms zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These molecules were functionally zzso by rescue of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show a zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene provided full rescue of the zzso zzso while zzso provided partial zzso In contrast, no rescue could be obtained using a variety of zzso zzso despite the fact that zzso was transcribed and translated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso interference zzso experiments were carried out to determine whether zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso worms could be zzso by expression of either zzso zzso However neither zzso gene could rescue the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that factors other than the level of sequence identity are important for determining whether zzso genes can functionally complement in zzso zzso
