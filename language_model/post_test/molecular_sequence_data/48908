zzso resistance zzso has been suggested to comprise an zzso branch of zzso plant innate zzso To unveil the feature of resistance zzso by zzso zzso required for zzso resistance 1 zzso a recently isolated zzso gene against zzso we analyzed the zzso zzso to find the viral component involved in zzso We employed zzso zzso a zzso virus zzso method, to obtain zzso virus X zzso zzso that can overcome zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso suggested that a single zzso acid in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso by zzso is responsible for this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso substitution to zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to overcome the zzso zzso These results suggest that viral zzso is involved in zzso zzso The zzso that determines the zzso properties was highly zzso among zzso suggesting a general role of the zzso in zzso zzso
