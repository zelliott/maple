The zzso zzso a novel protein was constructed from the cellular zzso isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso banded zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this novel protein contains 68 zzso acid zzso with 10 zzso zzso Comparative sequence analyses show that it is structurally related to zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso Eight out of the ten zzso zzso in this protein are located at the zzso positions as those in the zzso However, instead of the fifth zzso linkage appearing in loop II of zzso and zzso the other two zzso zzso in this novel toxin are situated at the zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that it probably represents a small evolutionary divergence between the long and short zzso
