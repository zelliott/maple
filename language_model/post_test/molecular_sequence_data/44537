We previously showed via electron microscopic zzso that a 73 zzso zzso was an authentic zzso membrane protein zzso integrated exclusively into the boundary membrane of zzso in cucumber zzso In this paper we test the hypothesis that this zzso is a member of the zzso 70 protein zzso family by comparing zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments, zzso on protein zzso and microscopic zzso within zzso zzso tobacco zzso A sequence of eight zzso acids zzso in zzso showed a high degree of similarity (up to zzso with sequences in the same zzso region of four plant zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso to zzso recognized on blots a zzso zzso (in pea zzso zzso and a cucumber zzso the latter shown by zzso zzso to be a zzso but zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso specific for tomato zzso zzso zzso recognized cucumber zzso and zzso specific for cucumber zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized cucumber zzso In zzso cells, cucumber zzso zzso localized only to zzso zzso raised against portions of tomato zzso also localized to the zzso zzso (as well as to zzso zzso zzso the data show that authentic cucumber zzso and 61 are zzso to each another, and that both exhibit selective zzso to zzso from two classes of molecular zzso namely zzso proteins and plant zzso zzso They appear to be unique zzso zzso that likely function as part of the zzso protein zzso zzso
