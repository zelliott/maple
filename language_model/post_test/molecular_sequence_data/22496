We have investigated whether zzso sequence zzso of an zzso zzso zzso can initiate protein synthesis using reporter genes carrying zzso in the initiation zzso zzso zzso was used as the model zzso and the zzso gene zzso which encodes the precursor of the protein component of the purple membrane protein zzso zzso was chosen as the zzso We demonstrate that a zzso to zzso zzso sequence zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso can initiate Bop protein synthesis using zzso as the initiation zzso in zzso zzso We generated four zzso bop zzso each carrying the zzso to zzso initiation zzso zzso with or without a zzso zzso to maintain a predicted zzso structure at the zzso of the bop zzso and with or without zzso to test translation initiation at a site corresponding to the zzso zzso of mature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing these zzso genes were zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso Upon transformation with a zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso only strains designed to maintain the bop zzso zzso structure produced Bop and were zzso zzso as indicated by purple colony zzso and zzso and spectral analysis of cell zzso Thus zzso can serve as an initiation zzso in zzso and the zzso structure in the bop zzso is important for zzso Interestingly, for the same zzso zzso only zzso that produce Bop protein contain bop zzso These results suggest either a strong zzso between translation and zzso stability or strong zzso polarity in zzso zzso
