Class I zzso genes code for zzso factors that play an essential role in plant growth and development as central regulators of zzso cell zzso Based on the analysis of new zzso sequences from various zzso and zzso DNA zzso we identified a highly diversified group of class I zzso genes in zzso zzso analyses of complete zzso acid sequences from various seed plants indicated that all conifer sequences formed a zzso zzso Within zzso four zzso here named genes zzso to zzso were well zzso each zzso pine and spruce zzso zzso was sister group to zzso which was sister group to zzso and zzso zzso mapping on the zzso of two divergent zzso species indicated that zzso and zzso are located close to each other on the same linkage group, whereas zzso and zzso mapped on different linkage groups, zzso the more ancient divergence of these two zzso The proportion of synonymous and zzso zzso suggested intense zzso selection for the four zzso However, rates of substitution per year indicated an evolution in two steps: faster rates were noted after gene zzso followed subsequently by lower zzso Positive directional selection was detected for most of the internal branches harboring an accelerated rate of zzso In addition, many sites with highly significant zzso acid rate shift were identified between these zzso However, the tightly linked zzso and zzso did not diverge as much from each zzso The implications of the correlation between zzso zzso and functional information are discussed in relation to the diversification of the zzso gene family in zzso
