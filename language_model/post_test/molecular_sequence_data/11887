The interaction between B cell zzso and its zzso zzso on activated zzso cells provides a critical signal necessary for T zzso zzso zzso Previous studies suggest that this signal might be important in regulating zzso switching at the level of zzso zzso zzso To assess the effects of the zzso interaction on zzso zzso transcript expression in zzso B cells, a zzso form of mouse zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso We show that stimulation of resting zzso B cells with zzso zzso cells zzso zzso gamma 1 and zzso transcripts independently of zzso The zzso induction cannot be blocked by zzso zzso and is not zzso by other zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso stimulation with zzso and zzso together has a significant synergistic effect on zzso transcript zzso zzso of zzso does not activate the zzso 1 DNA binding factor believed to be required for zzso zzso gamma 1 zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso 1 DNA binding site in a zzso gamma 1 zzso reporter gene construct completely zzso zzso responsiveness but has no effect on responsiveness to zzso in transient zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso interaction and zzso activate zzso zzso gene zzso by distinct but synergistic mechanisms and suggest that multiple signals may be required to induce sufficient zzso zzso and/or zzso transcript levels necessary to target switch zzso
