A study was performed in Israel to determine the rate of zzso zzso transmission in newborns at zzso A group of 22 zzso mothers and their 23 newborns were followed up from early after birth by testing their serum for the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso against zzso was detected in the blood of all newborns immediately after birth, but dropped to low or zzso levels by 7 months of zzso zzso was detected 2 days after birth in the blood of five infants zzso but fell to zzso levels by 6 zzso zzso sequence analysis performed in one zzso pair on the second day after birth revealed two zzso zzso Two months later the same sequence was detected again in the zzso suggesting a very low replication zzso Thus, the study showed that vertically transmitted zzso was eliminated in all newborn infants by 6 months after delivery, with zzso disappearance of zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso elimination in newborns at risk remains to be zzso
