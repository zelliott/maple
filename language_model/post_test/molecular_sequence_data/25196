Two clones zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library screened with rabbit muscle zzso alpha and zzso alpha zzso The deduced protein sequences are very similar to those of zzso zzso alpha and zzso alpha zzso and zzso overall identity, zzso indicating that they are the plant zzso of zzso alpha and zzso zzso This high degree of similarity provides a molecular explanation for the remarkable conservation of the zzso and regulatory properties between animal and plant protein zzso and supports the concept that zzso and zzso may be the most highly zzso of known zzso
