zzso muscular zzso zzso is a lethal zzso zzso disorder with a high spontaneous zzso rate and no effective treatment, hence development of genetic based therapies is an important zzso We report that expression of a zzso human zzso zzso compatible with current viral zzso can significantly reduce the zzso zzso in transgenic zzso mice, even when expressed at only zzso of zzso zzso levels at the zzso To the extent that data obtained in mouse studies are zzso to zzso the virtual elimination of zzso and zzso abnormalities in the zzso mouse supports the use of this zzso in zzso gene therapy protocols for zzso
