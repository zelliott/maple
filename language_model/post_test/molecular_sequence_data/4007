The full-length zzso of zzso zzso fever virus zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was expressed as a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was efficiently expressed in insect cells and zzso by zzso column zzso Using this zzso an zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso using serum samples previously determined to be zzso positive or negative by zzso tests on zzso zzso E6 zzso We found very good correlation between the two zzso zzso for the positive zzso (13 of zzso and zzso for the negative zzso zzso of zzso These results indicate that the new zzso zzso using zzso zzso has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting zzso zzso The zzso patients' zzso with high zzso reacted only with the zzso zzso containing zzso acid zzso between 201 and zzso in Western zzso It is known that zzso acid zzso are high in this region among various zzso Thus, it is expected that this zzso can detect zzso not only for Chinese strains of zzso but also for other strains circulating in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso system developed with the zzso zzso zzso is a valuable tool for diagnosis and zzso investigations of zzso zzso
