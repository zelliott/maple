A zzso locus in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to comprise two genes which mediate zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso with zzso insertions in either gene showed zzso in the zzso patterns of both zzso and zzso zzso forms, which suggested defects in the zzso of the core zzso zzso On gel zzso core zzso of the zzso were of apparently lower molecular weight than those from the wild zzso Furthermore, the content of zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of the core zzso were significantly lower in the zzso zzso of the zzso Because of their role in zzso core zzso the two genes were called zzso and zzso zzso zzso show altered behavior in a range of host and zzso plants such that the number of zzso bacteria drop within the first 24 h after zzso In contrast, the behavior of zzso zzso only differed from the wild type in zzso a zzso plant in which the growth of the wild type is severely zzso The predicted protein zzso showed significant sequence zzso to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso factors which are involved in zzso zzso
