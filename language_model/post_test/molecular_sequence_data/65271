zzso zzso species interact to their mutual benefit, is extraordinary in a competitive zzso To recognize general patterns of origin and maintenance from the plethora of zzso associations proves a zzso zzso The simplest situation is believed to be that of a single zzso specific to a single host, vertically transmitted from one host generation to the zzso We characterized zzso zzso associates cultured for nest architecture by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso probably manage their zzso zzso by protecting them against zzso zzso The zzso zzso display different zzso specificity patterns, zzso and zzso and we zzso vertical transmission, in the latter case zzso by horizontal zzso zzso evolutionary zzso include a reversal from zzso by other zzso zzso and inheritance of zzso through life cycle interactions of the zzso zzso The mosaic indicates how specificity patterns can be shaped by an interplay between host zzso and transmission zzso
