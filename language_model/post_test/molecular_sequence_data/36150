zzso are a class of proteins with specific zzso properties found in a wide variety of plants and zzso zzso zzso are presumably zzso proteins in plants that exert their effect by binding to zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso with an zzso signal sequence for entering the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso necessary for proper targeting to the zzso To analyze the three-dimensional structure of barley zzso with the zzso extension and to investigate whether the conversion of the zzso into the mature zzso leads to a zzso change, the precursor and the mature forms of barley zzso were expressed in zzso zzso Both proteins accumulated in zzso form in inclusion bodies were zzso in 8 M zzso and zzso in a zzso buffer zzso Active zzso and mature barley zzso were zzso to zzso by affinity zzso
