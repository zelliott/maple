A multiplex real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was developed to simultaneously detect the DNA of three rice zzso that is, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso brown zzso in the gut of their zzso The sets of zzso and zzso zzso were targeted to the regions of internal transcribed zzso 2 zzso genes in nuclear zzso DNA zzso The sensitivity, specificity and interference test for the multiplex real-time quantitative zzso zzso were zzso The zzso detection limits were 100, 1000 and 100 copies for the zzso zzso the brown zzso and the small brown zzso zzso The specificity tests showed no zzso with zzso DNA from 30 other dominant zzso zzso insects and predators from rice zzso for each zzso zzso The zzso was used in a preliminary study of zzso events on the three zzso by three major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso and zzso zzso zzso which each differ in their preferred zzso as well as their predatory habits in rice field, and the results showed their zzso on each zzso species could be well evaluated using this zzso zzso the multiplex real-time quantitative zzso zzso provides a new tool to study the mechanisms of prey shifting and natural regulation of the three rice zzso by zzso predators in rice zzso
