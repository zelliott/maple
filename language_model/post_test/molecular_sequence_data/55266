Box zzso small zzso zzso zzso catalyze zzso zzso zzso in two of the three zzso of zzso Recent structural studies have led to a controversy over whether box zzso zzso functionally assemble as zzso or zzso zzso The zzso box zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been shown by zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso native gel analysis, and zzso electron zzso zzso to adopt a zzso architecture, containing four copies of each box zzso core protein and two copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso investigators used a zzso artificial guide zzso zzso to assemble a box zzso zzso from zzso zzso with a short zzso zzso zzso yielding a crystal structure of a zzso To more closely examine box zzso zzso architecture, we investigate the role of the omnipresent zzso loop as a structural zzso of zzso zzso We show through zzso zzso native gel zzso and zzso zzso that a zzso is the near exclusive architecture obtained when zzso box zzso zzso with natural or artificial zzso containing an internal zzso Our results span three zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that the zzso architecture is broadly zzso across the entire zzso zzso
