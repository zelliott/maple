The human zzso harbors 25 to 50 zzso copies of the zzso zzso type K zzso some of which code for the characteristic zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso For a zzso cloning approach of full-length and intact zzso zzso a human zzso gene library was screened with a zzso zzso Both zzso type 1 and 2 clones were zzso Sixteen zzso type 2 zzso zzso were characterized by direct coupled in zzso zzso zzso translation zzso to analyze the coding potential of isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso from individual zzso zzso After determination of long terminal repeat zzso sequences and adjacent zzso integration sites by inverse zzso techniques, two zzso type 2 zzso displaying long zzso open reading frames zzso were assigned to zzso 7 zzso and 19 zzso by using a zzso zzso cell hybrid mapping zzso zzso shows an altered zzso motif in the reverse zzso zzso zzso is truncated in the zzso zzso and harbors a defective zzso gene due to a point zzso zzso amplification of zzso structures from single zzso by using zzso zzso zzso was performed by long zzso for zzso and zzso and for type 1 zzso zzso and zzso from zzso 5 and 1, zzso zzso in contrast to zzso bears no intact gag zzso and shows close zzso to zzso In zzso experiments, zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso yielded the proteins zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso The data suggest that the human zzso does not contain an zzso intact zzso copy of zzso
