In a previous experiment a group of 15 specified pathogen free zzso cats were zzso infected with a Swiss isolate of zzso zzso virus zzso A group of 15 SPF cats served as zzso negative zzso Nine cats of each group were vaccinated with a zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso six cats in each group with a zzso zzso All vaccinated cats developed high zzso zzso to zzso and were protected against subsequent zzso challenge zzso In both control groups five of six cats became persistently infected with zzso zzso the primary immune response to the vaccine zzso was significantly higher in the zzso positive group than in the zzso zzso The secondary response was stronger in the zzso negative zzso The goal of the present investigation was to further study the immune response in these 30 zzso They were zzso twice with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 days zzso Blood samples were collected on four occasions during the zzso zzso They were tested for zzso to zzso complete blood cell counts and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The following observations were made: zzso in contrast to the zzso vaccine experiment, the primary immune response to zzso was not significantly stronger in the zzso positive cats when tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso The absolute size of the zzso zzso population was distinctly smaller in the zzso positive than in the zzso negative zzso The lowest zzso values were found in the zzso zzso infected zzso zzso A population of zzso zzso was identified that was characterized by a distinctly weaker zzso The size of this population increased in zzso positive and decreased in zzso negative cats during the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio increased in zzso negative cats during zzso zzso from zzso to zzso In contrast, in zzso positive animals the zzso ratio decreased significantly from zzso to zzso during the same zzso From these and earlier data it was concluded that in short-term zzso infection the immune response to zzso dependent zzso may be increased over that of the zzso zzso suppression develops gradually with duration of the zzso The significant drop of the zzso ratio over a 5 week zzso period suggests that zzso stimulation may accelerate the development of immune suppression in zzso positive zzso If this is a general feature, zzso infection may provide a particularly interesting model for studying the zzso of zzso
