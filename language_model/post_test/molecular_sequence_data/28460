A current limitation in the use of fast atom zzso zzso mass zzso mapping of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso of zzso is that most of the zzso peptides are not zzso However, it has been demonstrated from previous work that zzso of the zzso mixture results in the detection of almost all peptides in zzso mass zzso This strategy of zzso mapping was applied to the protein zzso isolated from an Italian variety of zzso zzso Two of the 12 zzso peptides in zzso mass zzso did not exhibit molecular zzso predicted from the known sequence of zzso isolated from the New Zealand variety of zzso zzso The two peptides were isolated by zzso liquid zzso subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Nine changes in zzso acid composition were detected using the rapid and powerful combination of zzso mass zzso mapping and zzso zzso
