A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from the soil of a zzso field of zzso in South Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at zzso and at pH zzso and in the absence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso activity that was responsible for its ability to transform zzso zzso (one of the dominant zzso of zzso to compound zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso zzso was shown to belong to the family zzso and was related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The major zzso zzso and major fatty zzso zzso and zzso zzso and/or zzso supported the affiliation of strain zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso values between strain zzso zzso and its closest zzso neighbors were below zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests enabled strain zzso zzso to be differentiated zzso from the recognized species of the zzso zzso Therefore the isolate represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
