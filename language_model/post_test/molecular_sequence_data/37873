Nuclear receptors are zzso zzso factors that are zzso of the action of zzso hormones and other zzso zzso and are the targets of drugs useful in a variety of therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso that, acting as a zzso with zzso mediates a variety of cellular effects including zzso Due to its role in modulating insulin sensitivity, it is the target of zzso active zzso agents such as zzso We have assigned the chemical shifts of the backbone atoms of the 32 zzso zzso domain of zzso in the presence of bound zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso have less than half the expected number of zzso The missing zzso are restored upon binding strong zzso such as zzso The zzso results indicate that the zzso of zzso is in a zzso mobile state, and that zzso binding is associated with a marked stabilization of the zzso zzso the missing zzso to the zzso X-ray zzso structure indicates the region of mobility is extensive and includes the zzso region and the zzso zzso This leads to the conclusion that zzso of this nuclear zzso is a result of a population shift of a dynamic ensemble of zzso rather than a two-state switch from an inactive to an active zzso Our results have important implications for the mechanisms by which antagonists, partial zzso and zzso of nuclear zzso function zzso
