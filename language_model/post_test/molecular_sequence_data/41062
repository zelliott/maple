Loss of function of the zzso gene causes a zzso translation zzso leading to zzso The zzso protein is thought to play a role similar to that of zzso in rescuing stalled zzso during zzso Both proteins belong to a family of Class I zzso release factors zzso all characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso Here, we determined the solution structure of the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso from mouse by zzso zzso and examined the effect of zzso zzso of zzso on zzso in zzso cells using flow zzso The zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso full-length zzso forms a structure with a zzso zzso zzso that resembles the zzso domain structure of zzso more closely than that of zzso Thus, the zzso domain structures of this protein family can be divided into two types, depending on the region linking zzso and zzso the zzso type having a zzso zzso turn and the zzso type having an zzso zzso of zzso resulted in increased zzso production and zzso leading to zzso of cell zzso zzso changes in zzso membrane potential and mass in the zzso cells were observed compared with the control zzso These results indicate that the function of zzso is essential for cell vitality and zzso zzso Although similar effects were observed in zzso cells, there were significant differences in the range and pattern of the effects between zzso and zzso cells, suggesting different roles of zzso and zzso in rescuing stalled zzso
