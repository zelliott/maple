Human zzso an zzso zzso zzso expressed in the zzso of the brain and the sweat zzso displays zzso activity against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso production of a 48 zzso acid zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coding sequence was cloned downstream of a 125 zzso acid zzso zzso gene and upstream of a zzso sequence in zzso zzso and transformed into zzso zzso The fusion protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, zzso on His zzso zzso and zzso by zzso to release zzso zzso zzso of zzso was achieved by zzso extraction that yielded zzso amounts of zzso with more than zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activities against zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The application of this zzso approach represents a fast and efficient method to prepare zzso quantities of zzso in its biologically active zzso
