A zzso chain reaction product zzso was amplified from potato zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso with sequences which are highly zzso in the plant zzso zzso 1 zzso protein zzso gene zzso Southern zzso analysis showed the presence of zzso zzso genes in the potato zzso zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso library and a zzso library, and one zzso and five zzso clones were zzso The zzso sequences of a portion of all five zzso clones were shown to be identical and only one, zzso was zzso zzso The zzso was found to be truncated at the zzso end but the zzso and zzso sequences contained only 15 zzso two of which resulted in changes in the derived zzso acid zzso zzso was shown to zzso an Mr zzso protein with zzso sequence similarity with other plant zzso protein zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed some zzso differences in zzso transcript levels, the lowest being detected in leaves and the highest in zzso However, much greater differences were found in zzso activity, which was measured using a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso which has been shown previously to be zzso by plant zzso protein zzso zzso decreased by almost zzso during development from zzso to mature zzso but it increased about zzso during the first seven days of storage after zzso before decreasing zzso However, activity was highest in zzso where the levels were 37 times greater than those in mature zzso from a zzso zzso zzso levels in these zzso were approximately equal, clear evidence that zzso protein zzso activity in potato is zzso in part, zzso
