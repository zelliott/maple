The zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso II filaments is regulated by zzso of the regulatory light zzso Four deletion zzso zzso which lack different parts of zzso 2 zzso showed zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso in the activity was also achieved by a double point zzso to replace zzso zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso These results suggested that zzso interactions involving the head and zzso are required for efficient zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not affected by zzso with a zzso deletion zzso zzso in the same zzso Furthermore, the activity zzso correlated with the fraction of zzso molecules in zzso zzso These latter two results suggest that the zzso zzso interactions are primarily zzso
