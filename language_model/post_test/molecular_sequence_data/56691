The zzso virus zzso gene product is a dual specificity protein zzso with activity against both zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the potential presence of zzso zzso in other zzso zzso and sequence data indicated that a zzso related to the zzso zzso is highly zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso virus and other zzso The open reading frames from the zzso virus and the zzso zzso virus Bangladesh major strain zzso zzso the zzso zzso were zzso and found to be highly zzso with the zzso virus zzso An open reading frame from the zzso zzso zzso has sequence similarity to the zzso zzso The viral proteins appear to be structurally related to the cell cycle control protein zzso A zzso zzso expressed from the zzso gene was found to share with the zzso zzso the ability to zzso zzso that contained both zzso and zzso
