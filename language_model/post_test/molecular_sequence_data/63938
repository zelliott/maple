Among the several zzso cloned and expressed from zzso zzso zzso f 4 is a major one associated with allergic zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationship of zzso is important in understanding the zzso diagnosis, and treatment of allergic zzso These include the zzso zzso or zzso deletion of the N or C zzso or both N and C zzso and zzso or zzso all of which affect immune zzso Similarly, the role of zzso zzso present in zzso may yield useful information regarding the zzso structure of zzso and the zzso E zzso zzso zzso Such information may help in developing new strategies towards zzso In order to define the role of zzso in the interaction of the zzso with zzso f 4, we have constructed zzso by selectively deleting zzso zzso from the zzso region of the zzso f zzso zzso evaluation of these engineered zzso zzso was conducted by using zzso from patients with zzso zzso skin zzso zzso and healthy zzso The results demonstrate strong zzso binding with zzso f 4 and two truncated zzso zzso f zzso zzso acids zzso 1 to zzso and zzso f zzso zzso 1 to zzso while another zzso zzso f zzso zzso 1 to zzso showed zzso with fewer zzso The result suggests that deletion of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso end resulted in zzso changes, which may have a potential role in the zzso of the zzso
