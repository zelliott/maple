We analyzed zzso T helper responses to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein in normal and zzso zzso In normal mice, we observed that although some zzso zzso induced negative selection of zzso zzso T cells, other zzso zzso zzso were zzso Next, zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso tumor cell line expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso mice mounted potent zzso T cell responses to two formerly cryptic peptides on zzso This response was characterized by massive production of zzso a zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that T cell response was induced by different zzso peptides depending upon the stage of zzso zzso zzso gene was shown to contain a single zzso resulting in the substitution of a zzso by a zzso at position 231 of the zzso Two peptides corresponding to zzso and zzso sequences of this region were zzso Both peptides bound to the zzso class zzso zzso zzso with similar zzso However, only zzso zzso induced T cell responses in normal zzso mice, a result strongly suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells had been eliminated in these zzso Surprisingly, zzso T cell responses to both zzso and zzso zzso peptides were recorded in zzso zzso mice, a phenomenon attributed to the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso T zzso
