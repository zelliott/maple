A zzso and zzso with zzso motif zzso zzso degrades zzso one of the major zzso zzso zzso components in zzso zzso zzso cartilage differs from primary cartilage, such as zzso and growth plate cartilage, in its metabolism of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cartilage acts as both zzso and growth plate cartilage in the growing period, while it remains as zzso cartilage after zzso We hypothesized that functional and zzso differences between zzso and primary zzso give rise to differences in gene expression patterns and levels of zzso and zzso zzso and -5 during growth and zzso We employed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify zzso expression for these molecules in zzso cartilage and primary zzso during growth and zzso All of the zzso presented zzso zzso expression patterns and levels among the zzso tested in this zzso zzso mainly contributed to zzso metabolism in growth plate and zzso cartilage during zzso zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso turn over in zzso zzso The results of the present study reveal that zzso metabolism and expression of related zzso zzso in primary and secondary zzso may be zzso regulated during growth and zzso
