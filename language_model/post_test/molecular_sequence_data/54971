zzso binds zzso complement regulatory factor H zzso to evade complement zzso However, binding affinities between zzso zzso of zzso and zzso from various hosts are zzso zzso performed to unfold the underlying molecular basis of this disparity revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso neither zzso with sushi 6-7, nor with sushi zzso zzso of zzso in cattle and zzso however, showed binding affinity to both sushi zzso of human zzso sushi zzso of mouse and sushi zzso of zzso Further, zzso zzso revealed three major binding sites zzso zzso sushi zzso and sushi zzso in human zzso that can form zzso zzso while zzso zzso in sushi 6 are crucial for rigid zzso complex zzso zzso acid stretches zzso in zzso sushi zzso and zzso in mouse sushi 7 were important sites for zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso acid sequences of sushi 6 of zzso pig and human revealed that bovine and zzso zzso lack zzso and zzso in zzso pocket, that may impede formation of zzso zzso zzso numbers of zzso from animal and human pathogens are being discovered, thus results presented here can be important benchmark for study of other zzso zzso
