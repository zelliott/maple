In this study, we have mapped and characterized a B cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a step toward the development of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed by random zzso fragments of zzso zzso were screened for binding to zzso a zzso zzso to zzso zzso Positive clones contained zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso When normal or zzso female mice were zzso with three overlapping peptides that span this region of zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso that reacted with mouse zzso zzso indicative of the presence of native B zzso and helper T cell zzso in zzso To more finely map the zzso B cell zzso a random zzso display library was screened with the zzso zzso and a consensus zzso sequence zzso that matched the zzso sequence zzso was zzso Competitive zzso analysis with single zzso zzso peptides ranked the relative contribution of the three critical B cell zzso zzso as Y zzso V zzso zzso A zzso zzso was constructed that contained the zzso motif of zzso and a bovine zzso T cell zzso Although zzso F1 zzso female mice zzso with the zzso zzso developed zzso zzso response, this zzso zzso zzso only in mice of the zzso complex zzso zzso or b) zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice with three additional mouse zzso zzso Moreover, although zzso contained a T cell zzso no zzso was observed after zzso of zzso mice with zzso in complete zzso zzso zzso In a preliminary trial, female zzso mice zzso with zzso in zzso had reduced litter sizes as compared with mice injected with zzso zzso
