Human zzso virus zzso individuals can be zzso with different virus zzso zzso who control an initial zzso infection are therefore still at risk for subsequent infection with divergent zzso but the barriers to such zzso remain zzso Here we tested long-term zzso zzso zzso to zzso using Indian zzso zzso that express the major zzso complex class I zzso zzso zzso 17, which is associated with control of the zzso AIDS virus zzso The zzso zzso zzso T cell repertoire is focused almost entirely on 5 zzso We engineered a series of zzso zzso bearing zzso in 3, 4, or all 5 of these zzso and used them to serially challenge 2 zzso zzso zzso None of the escape zzso caused breakthrough replication in zzso although they readily infected zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso competing zzso zzso and examination of viral evolution in hosts lacking zzso 17 suggested that the zzso viruses had negligible defects in zzso zzso Both zzso maintained robust immune responses, including zzso zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso T cells and zzso zzso Our results suggest that escape zzso in zzso bound by zzso zzso molecules may not be sufficient to establish zzso in zzso
