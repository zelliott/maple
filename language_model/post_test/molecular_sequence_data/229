This study was to investigate the clinical significance and zzso factors of zzso zzso B virus zzso infection in zzso zzso zzso patients without zzso B surface zzso zzso or zzso C virus zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso was detected in 90 of 222 zzso zzso zzso patients and 24 of 300 zzso zzso controls without zzso Of 90 zzso zzso zzso patients, the sequences of zzso zzso X and zzso zzso zzso genes were analyzed from 40 zzso zzso sequencing of such genes was also performed in 24 zzso zzso controls without zzso and 40 zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso controls without zzso zzso zzso subjects with zzso had significantly higher prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso in zzso gene and zzso were more common in zzso zzso patients with zzso than in those without zzso Compared with the zzso zzso controls, zzso zzso zzso patients had higher zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in surface zzso zzso and zzso in X zzso and zzso in zzso II zzso and had lower rates of zzso deletions and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in core zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were independent factors for zzso zzso zzso Our study suggested that the zzso factors of zzso related to zzso were different between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso in zzso gene may be useful viral markers for zzso in zzso zzso zzso
