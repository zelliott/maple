The zzso consists of two zzso surrounded by the zzso material zzso In late zzso phase, zzso enlarge by recruiting extra zzso and zzso its zzso nucleation activity increases zzso The regulatory mechanisms of this dynamic change of zzso are not well zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso is known to zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso An involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso assembly has been implicated in zzso but in zzso functions of zzso in other organisms are largely zzso Here we characterize two zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso and zzso zzso of the function of each gene by zzso interference zzso revealed that zzso was essential for zzso but zzso was zzso More specifically, zzso was required for the formation of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso However, this zzso was apparently zzso for female zzso zzso which do not depend on zzso In the cell depleted of zzso activity, zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso was severely zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was present at zzso from zzso to zzso but not during zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso protein involved in the recruitment of zzso components to the zzso and is essential for the zzso of zzso nucleation potential of the zzso Furthermore, zzso between zzso zzso were often absent in zzso that lacked zzso zzso Thus, besides promoting zzso formation, zzso appears to play a role in either the establishment or the maintenance of zzso during zzso zzso zzso
