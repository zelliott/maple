zzso zzso from zzso animals continue to provide compounds with therapeutic zzso zzso zzso often results in removal of zzso bridges or critical zzso zzso To address this zzso challenge, we explored the concept of zzso scaffolds consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso were used to replace zzso constrained parts of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso hybrids, zzso were designed based on zzso identification of zzso zzso in related zzso After zzso zzso the zzso appeared to be better zzso of sodium currents in zzso root zzso and zzso nerves in zzso Moreover, the zzso appeared to be significantly more potent and zzso analgesics in the inflammatory pain model in mice, when compared to zzso The resulting zzso provide a promising strategy for transforming zzso peptides into zzso
