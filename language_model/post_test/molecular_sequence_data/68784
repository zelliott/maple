The zzso bacteria capable of obtaining energy from the zzso of zzso form a zzso group that includes both zzso and zzso zzso and representatives of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhabit such diverse zzso as soil, zzso and hot zzso The zzso of zzso in these bacteria is zzso by zzso zzso called zzso The zzso studied so far belong to two families: zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to electron transport chains and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of the active site contained in the large zzso of the zzso zzso The genes for the zzso zzso are located in zzso clusters of accessory zzso some of which zzso maturation functions and zzso zzso zzso zzso of both types of zzso is apparently complex, involving specific zzso incorporation and zzso processing zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is regulated by zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso
