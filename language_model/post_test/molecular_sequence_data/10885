zzso C is a zzso acid protein that is found in zzso cells as a positive regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso II zzso factor zzso zzso and as a component of a zzso complex containing the von zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso As a zzso of the zzso complex, zzso C interacts directly with the zzso active zzso A zzso and zzso zzso its zzso zzso in addition, zzso C interacts with the zzso zzso B zzso which regulates the interaction of zzso C with zzso zzso As a component of the zzso complex, zzso C interacts directly with both zzso B and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein to zzso C was found to prevent zzso C from interacting with and zzso zzso A in zzso leading to the proposal that one function of the zzso protein may be to regulate zzso zzso II zzso by zzso regulating the zzso zzso In this report, we identify zzso C sequences required for its interaction with the zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that the ability of zzso C to bind and activate zzso A is sensitive to zzso in the zzso half of zzso C, as well as to zzso in an zzso zzso C region needed for formation of the zzso BC zzso Here we show that interaction of zzso C with the zzso tumor zzso protein depends strongly on sequences in the C zzso of zzso C but is independent of the zzso zzso C region required for binding to zzso B and for binding and zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our results are consistent with the proposal that the zzso protein zzso regulates zzso C zzso of the zzso complex by zzso blocking the interaction of zzso zzso C sequences with zzso zzso In addition, our finding that only a subset of zzso C sequences required for its interaction with zzso A are critical for binding to zzso may offer the opportunity to develop zzso that selectively interfere with zzso and zzso zzso
