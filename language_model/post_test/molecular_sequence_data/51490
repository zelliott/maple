X zzso zzso in zzso females results in the zzso zzso zzso of most of the genes on one X zzso The zzso gene is unique among zzso genes in being expressed exclusively from the inactive X zzso Human zzso zzso containing at least eight zzso and totaling 17 zzso have been isolated and zzso within the region on the X zzso known to contain the X zzso zzso The zzso gene includes several tandem repeats, the most zzso of which are zzso zzso The gene does not contain any significant zzso zzso and thus does not appear to zzso a zzso suggesting that zzso may function as a structural zzso within the zzso zzso with this, zzso in zzso zzso experiments demonstrate zzso of zzso zzso within the nucleus to a position indistinguishable from the X zzso zzso zzso
