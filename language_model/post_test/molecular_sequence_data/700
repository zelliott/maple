A zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 33 zzso was isolated from the zzso fluid of the Pacific zzso zzso zzso zzso by ammonium zzso zzso followed by conventional column zzso This zzso named zzso in the present study, zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso with the optimal temperature and pH at 50 degrees C and zzso zzso zzso possessed zzso activity, a characteristic property of zzso zzso that split zzso linkage with a retaining zzso By the zzso reaction of zzso the zzso unit in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was transferred to a free zzso zzso zzso resulting to zzso and zzso The resulting zzso was subsequently zzso by zzso into 2 zzso of zzso and 1 zzso of zzso The primary structure of zzso was analyzed by the zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso showed zzso zzso identity with those of other zzso zzso which have been identified as zzso zzso family 16 zzso
