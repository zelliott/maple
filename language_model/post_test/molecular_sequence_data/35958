The zzso gene family codes for a group of zzso zzso zzso which are zzso expressed in the developing zzso and are possibly involved in cellular zzso Here, we describe the zzso chain reaction based cloning and embryonic expression patterns of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso One of these zzso zzso is a potential zzso of zzso zzso while the other three genes most likely represent new members of the zzso zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso transcripts of zzso are confined to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso lips and the zzso portions of the spinal zzso zzso is expressed in the tail bud and at considerably lower levels in the zzso of the zzso zzso transcripts are present within the zzso and the zzso zzso whereas zzso shows a surprisingly similar expression pattern to zzso zzso By zzso to zzso it is likely that the members of the zzso zzso gene family play an important role in zzso zzso during pattern formation in the neural tube and the tail zzso
