When subjected to drought conditions, some organisms enter a state of suspended animation known as zzso surviving for indefinite periods until zzso allows them to resume normal zzso We have identified a gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in response to zzso stress and whose zzso protein shares sequence similarity with a zzso gene that is induced in many plants when they are deprived of zzso This finding suggests that animals and plants that undergo zzso may use common protective strategies against dehydration, and provides a unifying insight into the mechanism of zzso
