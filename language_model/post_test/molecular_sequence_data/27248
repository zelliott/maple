The complex life cycle of zzso zzso includes zzso stages in the bovine host and other stages occurring inside its common tick zzso zzso zzso In related zzso changing environmental conditions affect the expression of zzso zzso but it remained unknown whether the zzso A, B, and C zzso coding units of zzso zzso are zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coding units are zzso Then, zzso transcript expression profiles were compared by analyzing zzso libraries generated from total zzso extracted from in zzso cultured zzso zzso zzso infected zzso zzso zzso larvae and egg zzso The zzso and zzso expression profiles indicate that zzso unit B is almost exclusively expressed in cultured zzso while units A, B, and C are zzso in the in zzso total zzso zzso zzso the data indicate that differential zzso of zzso occurs in zzso depending on the life stage of the zzso and on the zzso
