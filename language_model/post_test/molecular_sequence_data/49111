zzso of zzso zzso the zzso agent of anthrax, are enclosed by a prominent zzso zzso layer called the zzso Although the zzso serves as the source of surface zzso and a primary zzso barrier of the zzso its molecular structure and function are not well zzso In this study, we identified five major proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One protein was the recently identified zzso zzso zzso which appears to be a structural component of the zzso zzso zzso Using a large panel of unique zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso is the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso spore zzso We also showed that the zzso protein and not a zzso constituent directs the dominant immune zzso In addition, the length of the central zzso repeat region of zzso appears to be strain zzso Two other unique zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso is unusually rich in zzso and Pro zzso and contains several different tandem repeats, which also exhibit zzso zzso In addition, zzso was found to be zzso approximately in zzso zzso appears to be zzso or associated with zzso material and is zzso by a gene that (along with zzso may be part of an zzso zzso zzso The other two proteins identified were zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which were reported to be associated with the surface of other zzso zzso zzso functions of the newly identified proteins are zzso
