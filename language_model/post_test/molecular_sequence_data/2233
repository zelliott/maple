The zzso of zzso zzso genes differs from that of other genes in several zzso the use of a specialized zzso the generally high level of transcription, and the tandem arrangement of the zzso In the zzso zzso zzso we identified a zzso sequence in the zzso zzso region that had many characteristics of an zzso of zzso zzso More recently, it has become apparent that zzso of this sequence occurs zzso and that it may also be involved in some aspect of termination of 35 S zzso zzso The likelihood that there are protein factors involved in termination and zzso of zzso and that these may participate in the zzso of the zzso of adjacent zzso genes led us to search for proteins that might bind to the zzso We have identified two such zzso termed zzso and zzso that bind to the zzso and protect specific sequences from attack by chemical and zzso zzso It is noteworthy that there is a second zzso binding site approximately 210 base pairs upstream of the origin of zzso of zzso and that binding of zzso to this site alters the zzso of DNA adjacent to the site of zzso
