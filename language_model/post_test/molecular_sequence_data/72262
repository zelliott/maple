Our group demonstrated recently that the 3' ends of several families of zzso zzso (short zzso repetitive zzso originated from the 3' ends of zzso zzso zzso repetitive zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two fully characterized examples of such organization were provided by the tortoise Pol zzso and the zzso zzso family of zzso and two probable examples were provided by the tobacco zzso family of zzso and the salmon zzso family of zzso This organization of zzso can explain their potential to zzso in the zzso since it appears reasonable that the sites for recognition of zzso by reverse zzso should be located within the zzso sequences of zzso We now add another example to this category of zzso In the bovine zzso there are zzso zzso which belong to the zzso of zzso families of zzso and zzso zzso which were recently demonstrated to belong to a LINE zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso share the same zzso zzso We propose a possible scenario zzso the composite structure of the bovine zzso family of zzso might have been generated from the zzso family of zzso during zzso
