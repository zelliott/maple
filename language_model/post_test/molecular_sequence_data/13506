Human T zzso virus type II zzso originally isolated in 1982 from a patient with a zzso zzso cell zzso has not yet been proven to be the zzso agent of any specific zzso zzso In order to screen for such an event, and because zzso has a preferential zzso for zzso zzso T cells (both in zzso and in zzso we searched for the presence of zzso in zzso diseases zzso of zzso T zzso We report a zzso and/or molecular study of 169 patients with a T zzso zzso including 76 patients with zzso or zzso T zzso LP zzso zzso 27 large zzso zzso three zzso zzso one zzso cell zzso 11 zzso T zzso zzso and 93 zzso patients with a T zzso peripheral zzso ( zzso zzso from a prospective zzso cohort involving zzso zzso In the first series, the 40 zzso available were all zzso negative, except a zzso French zzso man, with a zzso large T zzso cell lymphoma, zzso Furthermore, the molecular analysis of the 69 available DNA samples by zzso failed to detect any zzso zzso zzso except for the zzso zzso The zzso study of the 93 zzso individuals with zzso zzso showed that three patients were zzso but none was zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso whose zzso role in adult T cell leukemia is now well established, there is neither zzso nor molecular evidence that zzso zzso may be zzso associated specifically with any of the zzso T cell LP investigated in this zzso
