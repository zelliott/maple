Two zzso proteins (His zzso and His zzso zzso were zzso by specific zzso utilizing zzso zzso composed of: zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The generated zzso containing bound zzso proteins are washed with zzso zzso zzso and then zzso in relatively high purity zzso or zzso devoid the zzso Three different zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso capacities zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as the recovery yields of zzso proteins obtained with them zzso zzso The data demonstrate that capacity is dependent on the zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso used during the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be significantly superior to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso could be zzso in moderate yields zzso by zzso them at 88 degrees C in the presence of zzso (10 zzso at pH zzso The absence of zzso leads to formation of small zzso zzso zzso and zzso of minute volumes of zzso buffer zzso zzso zzso concentrated preparations can be zzso and a zzso step may be zzso
