zzso zzso patients in zzso areas have been described with zzso zzso the DNA of which contains specific zzso viral zzso We have looked for the presence of zzso DNA sequences in 27 zzso zzso patients with peripheral zzso zzso distinct from adult zzso leukemia zzso and four zzso zzso patients, three with an ATL and one with a tropical zzso zzso Using zzso pol specific zzso the zzso DNA from peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso infiltrated by tumor cells was analyzed by the zzso gene amplification zzso In contrast to the peripheral blood zzso from the four zzso zzso patients, the peripheral zzso zzso samples did not harbor zzso pol zzso The data show that the detection of zzso zzso sequences by the zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso analysis in this zzso
