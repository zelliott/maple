zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso class switch zzso and zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso in B zzso However, AID also produces zzso DNA damage, including zzso in zzso and zzso breaks that can serve as zzso for zzso zzso zzso AID is strictly regulated by a number of mechanisms, including zzso at zzso 38 and zzso zzso which increase zzso Here we show that zzso can also suppress AID activity in zzso zzso 3 is a novel zzso which, when zzso to zzso leads to increased class switching and zzso zzso without affecting AID levels or zzso zzso zzso increasing AID zzso specifically on zzso 3 by interfering with zzso protein zzso 2A zzso leads to decreased class zzso We conclude that AID activity and its zzso potential can be zzso by zzso of zzso 3 and that this process is controlled by zzso
