An zzso zzso complex zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso has been shown to be essential for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport zzso formation from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Crosby, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Here the zzso is identified as a regulatory zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso activity is zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso and is specific for zzso zzso as zzso and is sensitive to zzso at zzso zzso The direct role of this zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso formation is indicated by the finding that both zzso zzso activity and the formation of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso are inhibited by zzso with similar zzso zzso and 50% zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso is required for the formation of zzso zzso transport zzso and that the zzso zzso and an activated zzso are the essential molecules that drive production of this zzso
