zzso display technique was used to study the gene expression of zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed genes were obtained through Northern zzso The result of zzso analysis shows that two of these genes zzso zzso number zzso and zzso are zzso to the zzso protein family member, which can regulate diverse cellular zzso including cell cycle transition, zzso regulation and signal zzso by playing roles in zzso protein zzso complexes or zzso zzso zzso protein plays a very important role in plant zzso zzso One gene zzso zzso number zzso is highly zzso to the translation initiation factor zzso which regulates the proteins translation and is an important zzso of sodium tolerance in zzso and zzso Additionally, two genes zzso zzso numbers zzso and zzso that are zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were identified, zzso are familiar proteins expressed in plant under zzso Five new genes closely related to salt and zzso resistance were zzso which were expressed quite zzso when treated by zzso zzso Seven zzso expressed genes were obtained which have highly or some zzso to the known zzso their function in stress need to be further zzso These zzso genes were accepted as novel zzso sequences by zzso and were given them new zzso numbers, their zzso numbers were zzso zzso and zzso
