zzso proteins zzso have been shown to bind zzso and other structurally related zzso in particular, the zzso zzso zzso protein has been previously cloned and functionally zzso To determine putative human zzso zzso analysis using the bovine zzso sequence identified a human established sequence tag zzso with significant zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso we cloned a zzso human brain zzso zzso which possessed zzso zzso zzso zzso binding studies with zzso human zzso protein demonstrated the ability of this protein to bind zzso with low affinity and high zzso The full-length human zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends zzso chain reaction, while Northern zzso zzso suggested that human zzso is an alternative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso heat shock zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells treated with the antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, exhibited a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso expression compared to zzso control cells, while other zzso zzso also altered zzso expression and zzso In conclusion, these results show that we have cloned a zzso zzso of zzso with a novel zzso binding function and that this zzso protein may be zzso in zzso central nervous system zzso
