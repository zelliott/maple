The zzso zzso essential for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was zzso almost to zzso from zzso expression strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso through several steps of zzso The proteins zzso from both organisms had identical zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or native zzso was used to conduct zzso zzso by gel zzso analysis, and the results showed no significant difference in the zzso activity of native or zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to DNA segments containing the zzso regions separating the putative zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso indicated that the zzso sites for zzso extended from upstream of the zzso to zzso regions of the zzso or zzso promoters to include about 65 zzso of the zzso zzso region and about 80 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Both binding sites contain imperfect zzso repeat sequences of 6-10 zzso with a zzso consensus sequence that was present in 4 out of 10 other promoter regions in the cluster of zzso zzso zzso
