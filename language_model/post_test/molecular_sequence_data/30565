zzso of nuclear proteins with zzso elements are involved in the programmed zzso expression of the zzso zzso hormone zzso Three zzso control elements within 300 base pairs of the zzso region of the rat zzso gene interact with regulatory cellular proteins and direct zzso only in zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso elements zzso zzso act together with the zzso promoter (including the zzso zzso which zzso A cell specificity of zzso gene zzso In the present study, the zzso element was analyzed in detail by protein binding and in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that the sequence of the zzso element comprises two distinct zzso zzso a more upstream domain A zzso and a more downstream domain B zzso zzso of proteins to these two zzso is mutually zzso zzso A, but not domain B, is responsible for both functional protein binding and the enhancement of zzso from the zzso or zzso zzso gene promoter zzso zzso reporter gene zzso in zzso into zzso zzso cells zzso and transcribed in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso the zzso zzso technique labeled a protein of 45 zzso binding to domain A within zzso We conclude that although the zzso sequence contains two zzso zzso the organization of the zzso zzso element is not zzso The zzso cell specificity of the zzso element is zzso by a zzso zzso factor or protein complex interacting with domain A of zzso This protein or protein complex recognizes different DNA sequences and provides promoter as well as zzso activity because it binds also to the apparently unrelated sequence of the zzso promoter zzso
