zzso but not zzso zzso regulates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells at zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso activity, whereas zzso is zzso zzso zzso prevents the zzso of cell growth and of zzso activity caused by zzso The negative regulation by zzso of zzso activity appears to be the cause and not the effect of smooth muscle cell growth zzso zzso does not act by binding to zzso directly but presumably by preventing zzso zzso It is concluded that, in vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso acts specifically through a zzso mechanism and exerts a negative control on a signal zzso zzso regulating cell zzso
