zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso pathogens which commonly cause urinary tract zzso Based on the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been classified into 60 zzso Studies on the chemical structure and zzso specificity of the zzso aim at the zzso of the molecular basis and improvement of the zzso zzso of these zzso 

The zzso was prepared by zzso acid degradation of the zzso isolated from dried bacterial mass of each strain by hot zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used for structural zzso zzso studies were performed with rabbit zzso using zzso zzso zzso passive zzso test, and the zzso of reactions in these zzso as well zzso and Western zzso 

Four zzso strains belonging to zzso zzso and zzso were found to possess similar zzso structures, in particular having the same zzso backbone built up of zzso repeating zzso However, they differ in the presence or absence of additional zzso such as zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso as well as in the pattern and degree of zzso of various zzso zzso zzso studies also showed close relationships between the zzso zzso 

Based on these data it is proposed to zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso formerly representing the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso system of zzso
