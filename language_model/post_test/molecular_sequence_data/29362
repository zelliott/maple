Marine sponges frequently contain a complex mixture of bacteria, zzso zzso algae and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was zzso fragments cloned and zzso using amplified zzso gene restriction zzso The nearly complete zzso zzso gene of distinct clones was zzso and aligned using zzso The zzso analysis indicated the presence of four closely related clones which have a high zzso sequence divergence from known zzso zzso zzso being the zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso All belong to the order zzso The lack of zzso evidence prevents us from proposing a new zzso
