zzso of expression of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli is a consequence of a unique form of positive feedback superimposed on a poorly defined zzso repression zzso The zzso zzso consists of two zzso transcribed zzso The zzso zzso contains only a single zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso The rightward zzso contains zzso which together with zzso and the 218 base pairs separating the two zzso comprises the primary regulatory circuit, and the five structural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are required for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso is zzso by binding of the zzso coli zzso gene product to the sequence zzso upstream of the presumed zzso zzso of pure zzso coli zzso protein in a zzso reaction to the zzso zzso zzso regulatory region has been demonstrated by in zzso zzso The zzso gene product is an zzso which zzso a zzso reaction of zzso zzso to yield the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is freely zzso results in formation of a complex with zzso The complex binds to the sequence zzso upstream of zzso to stimulate zzso of the rightward zzso Increased zzso from zzso should yield increased levels of zzso and higher levels of zzso which would further activate zzso The zzso binding site is also a zzso binding site, as demonstrated by in zzso zzso zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso is zzso by sequences within the zzso coding zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
