zzso zzso are zzso genetic elements frequently found inserted into reading frames of essential zzso Their association and zzso restore host protein function through a protein zzso zzso They have gained an increasingly important role in the chemical modification of proteins to create zzso zzso labeled, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso would seamlessly zzso zzso together with no remnant sequences and at high zzso Here, we describe experiments that identify the zzso zzso a transient step in the overall zzso reaction, as a key zzso of the zzso efficiency at different zzso zzso To alter zzso zzso we developed a zzso selection scheme to evolve split zzso that zzso with high efficiency at different zzso junctions and at higher zzso zzso within these evolved zzso occur at sites distant from the active zzso We present a hypothesis that a network of zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso mediates these long-range zzso
