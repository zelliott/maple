A zzso group of zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso were isolated from zzso coli cells carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso were due to the zzso zzso at zzso 220 of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso value of the zzso transport zzso by the zzso zzso protein was about zzso higher than that of the zzso indicating that the zzso is a low affinity zzso A zzso and zzso double zzso constructed by zzso zzso showed the same properties as the zzso confirming that the zzso of zzso is solely responsible for the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in a lower level of restoration of the zzso resistance and the transport activity than in the case of the zzso zzso A single zzso replacing zzso with zzso or zzso caused about a zzso decrease in the zzso resistance, but no crucial change in the transport zzso It is not likely that zzso is required for a zzso salt bridge because an zzso negative charge in a zzso or zzso single zzso did not cause a serious change in the zzso An alternative explanation is zzso zzso directly contributes to the binding of a zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, or zzso and an zzso zzso at position 220 can take over the role of zzso
