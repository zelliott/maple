The zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso A set of zzso constructions carrying fragments of the zzso cluster that lie downstream of zzso were used to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is blocked in zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this cluster revealed three zzso open reading frames zzso that were designated zzso zzso and zzso Only those zzso zzso that expressed zzso were able to complement zzso zzso shows similarity to zzso a zzso catalyzing the zzso of zzso to zzso The putative zzso protein is similar to zzso involved in zzso zzso The deduced product of zzso is a zzso acid zzso It is similar to the product of zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso However its function is still zzso Based on the zzso experiments and sequence analysis, this part of the zzso cluster is suggested to be involved in the zzso of the sugar portion of zzso Interestingly, zzso a zzso zzso for the zzso minimal zzso zzso is also needed to express this zzso
