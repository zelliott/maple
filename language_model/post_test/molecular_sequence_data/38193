The zzso zzso system of zzso zzso controls resistance to the zzso zzso zzso B and to several zzso proteins from human zzso zzso of zzso genes is induced by high iron, but can also be promoted by growth in low zzso in a process that requires another zzso system, zzso Here, we define the genetic basis for the interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso We have identified zzso as a zzso gene that mediates the zzso zzso of zzso genes during growth in low zzso When zzso of zzso is driven from a zzso promoter, expression of zzso genes occurs even at zzso zzso zzso and becomes independent of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect is specific for zzso genes and requires functional zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso if grown in low zzso but resistant if grown in high zzso The zzso protein controls the activity of the zzso system at a zzso zzso
