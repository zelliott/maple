zzso zzso data on zzso infections in a hospital setting, including both zzso and transplanted patients, are limited and rarely contain the application of molecular zzso 

To describe the clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of zzso infections in Bordeaux University Hospital from 2008 to 2010 zzso data, viral load and zzso species zzso 

zzso DNA zzso zzso and typing zzso of zzso and protein VI genes and protein VI zzso chain reaction zzso product zzso were applied zzso to 215 clinical samples from 105 zzso patients zzso Bordeaux University zzso Clinical data were recovered and zzso for 73 children and 25 zzso 

zzso loads were measured in stools, upper and lower respiratory zzso blood, urine and zzso tract zzso the highest values were observed in stools and respiratory zzso zzso viral loads were comparable whatever the immune zzso zzso was typed in 57 zzso species Human zzso zzso C dominated zzso followed by B zzso F zzso and D zzso We could demonstrate no association between zzso species and load or clinical severity zzso in most zzso In the zzso in contrast to zzso patients, zzso infections presented no seasonal zzso zzso were zzso mostly bacterial in zzso children zzso and viral in zzso people zzso 

The species zzso C dominates the local zzso in both respiratory and zzso tract infections, independently of the patient's immune zzso zzso infections, often associated with zzso of bacterial or viral agents, frequently lead to severe clinical consequences in hospital zzso
