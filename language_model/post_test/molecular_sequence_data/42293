Various aromatic zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso zzso and their effects were markedly affected by the species of substitution on the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a representative of various zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso and DNA, zzso and protein zzso in the zzso The growth zzso was preceded by zzso effect of zzso on DNA zzso These results suggested the possible involvement of a zzso zzso in DNA zzso A zzso zzso was partially zzso from zzso zzso zzso by zzso column zzso ammonium zzso zzso and successive zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The properties were compared with those of zzso zzso which momentarily appears just before the onset of DNA synthesis and seems to participate in the initiation of DNA zzso and which was zzso from zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso The properties of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso were similar to zzso zzso however, the molecular mass zzso was different from that of the latter zzso Various zzso zzso strongly inhibited the zzso activity and the order of the effects was closely correlated with that on the cell zzso The zzso was tentatively called zzso zzso zzso
