The zzso interaction potential between DNA duplexes in solution is a basis for the statistical mechanics of zzso DNA zzso It may also play an important role in zzso of zzso zzso We develop a theory of this interaction that includes zzso zzso fluctuations of DNA using zzso methods and zzso Carlo zzso The theory extends and zzso the earlier suggested zzso approach which was developed in the context of a ground state theory of interaction of zzso zzso It shows that the zzso zzso theory is equivalent to the zzso zzso field zzso By comparison of the zzso approximation with an exact solution based on the zzso zzso of path zzso as well as zzso Carlo simulations, we show that this easily zzso approximation works very well in most zzso zzso fluctuations do not remove the ability of DNA molecules to attract each other at favorable zzso zzso neither do they wash out the possibility of zzso zzso recognition of zzso zzso considered earlier on the basis of ground state zzso At short distances DNA molecules undergo a zzso alignment zzso which is first order for zzso DNA and weaker order for zzso zzso
