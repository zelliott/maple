Very few natural zzso involving zzso zzso zzso are known in zzso even in zzso In this study, thirty three zzso including zzso individuals of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso examined using zzso stain or zzso Five different zzso were zzso The observed zzso was zzso but not zzso as the same zzso zzso were found both in males and zzso Our results indicated that the zzso zzso resulted from a mutual interchange occurring between zzso 1 and zzso The occurrence of a nearly zzso zzso between zzso zzso 1 and zzso 6 gave rise to a high frequency of alternate segregation and probably resulted in the maintenance of the zzso zzso in a few zzso The zzso zzso is explained by different zzso of segregation modes of the zzso zzso during zzso zzso nine zzso should be investigated, however, four expected zzso were not zzso The absent zzso may result from zzso lethal zzso position effects, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso proved that all populations of zzso zzso grouped into a zzso zzso The mutual zzso likely evolved just once in this species and the zzso of the one zzso zzso zzso can explain the zzso variations among zzso
