zzso zzso exhibits the ability to grow in either a zzso or a zzso form in response to different environmental zzso The zzso form, found in infected zzso is important as a zzso factor in the adherence of the zzso to the host zzso In zzso the zzso transition can be induced by environmental shifts in the growing conditions, or by a variety of zzso factors, including ambient zzso nutritional status and zzso The zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso is a powerful technique for comparing gene expression between cell types, stages of development or zzso zzso related genes were identified and characterized using a zzso differential zzso zzso zzso formed a germ tube when cultured in rabbit serum, zzso zzso medium or 39 degrees zzso zzso We gained 21 zzso bands showing a different expression pattern from that of the zzso zzso DNA was extracted from the same location of the isolated bands, and zzso was performed under the same conditions, which zzso the zzso product, showing the specific expression patterns according to the culture zzso We cloned 18 germ zzso zzso clones zzso average size is 80 - 700 zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the 18 clones were identified through in the present study from zzso and were found to have the zzso number zzso We could not find any zzso sequence having a high zzso with these zzso This study could form a part of the projects in the search for genes related to the germ tube formation of zzso zzso
