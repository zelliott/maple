zzso reproduction is tightly regulated by zzso zzso hormones produced by the zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso in zzso and zzso hormone I zzso in zzso are zzso zzso hormones that control the timing of egg production and the number of eggs zzso zzso a well-established genetic model for zzso biology, also offers potential advantages for studies of zzso zzso especially for modeling the impact of pollutants on fish zzso zzso To facilitate these studies we have identified, zzso and characterized the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso strong sequence similarity to the zzso zzso receptors and to zzso from salmon and zzso Human zzso cells zzso with zzso exhibit increased zzso levels after treatment with carp zzso extracts or human zzso but not when treated with a zzso to a related zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and zzso analyses indicate that zzso is expressed in zzso from sexually mature fish, but not in immature zzso Several alternative zzso zzso of the zzso affecting putative zzso 2-4 that zzso dramatically shortened zzso fragments lacking the zzso domain as well as regions previously implicated in zzso binding were identified by zzso The zzso sequence opens the way to study effects of genetic zzso or chemicals on zzso zzso expression and function in zzso
