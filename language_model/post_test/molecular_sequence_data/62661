zzso zzso in the skins of frogs of the zzso zzso a widely distributed group with over 250 species, zzso and zzso a remarkably diverse array of peptides with zzso activity that are believed to have arisen as a result of multiple gene zzso zzso Almost without exception, these components are zzso zzso and form an zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The peptides can be grouped into families on the basis of structural zzso To date, zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides have been found in zzso frogs of both zzso and North American zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides only in zzso American zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides only in zzso zzso It is generally assumed that this structurally diversity serves to protect the zzso against a wide range of pathogens but convincing evidence in support of this hypothesis is still zzso The possibility that zzso zzso fulfill additional or alternative biological functions should not be zzso The molecular zzso of the zzso families, particularly zzso zzso and zzso may be exploited for the purposes of unequivocal identification of specimens and for an understanding of zzso zzso between zzso The zzso zzso and zzso activities of certain zzso for example zzso zzso and zzso together with their relatively low zzso activity, make them candidates for development into zzso useful zzso zzso
