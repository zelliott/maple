The loss of linear zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso variation zzso is associated with reduced zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso shuttle zzso zzso which includes the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and restores zzso to readily zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso and zzso was used to determine the effect of trans expression of zzso on zzso zzso lacking zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso containing both zzso and zzso zzso protein produced by this construct was expressed and surface accessible in in zzso zzso zzso as determined by surface zzso and zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso but containing zzso and either zzso or zzso were zzso consistently from zzso mice 8 weeks after zzso In contrast, a clone lacking both zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso was isolated from only a single tissue of one of six zzso mice 8 weeks zzso These results indicate that either an intact zzso zzso variation locus or another zzso on zzso is required to restore complete zzso In addition, an zzso clone that retained zzso was zzso with the zzso shuttle zzso and was examined for zzso sequence variation and zzso zzso variation was not observed for the shuttle zzso indicating that the zzso arrangement of zzso and the zzso silent zzso in zzso facilitate zzso gene zzso Lack of zzso sequence variation on the shuttle zzso thus did not result in clearance of the zzso strain in zzso mice under the conditions zzso
