We have cloned and characterized members of a gene family zzso zzso constituents of the zzso zzso zzso protein complex, a zzso complex associated with zzso II of zzso and brown zzso Three zzso clones zzso proteins associated with this complex in the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso As deduced from the zzso zzso these zzso proteins show zzso to the zzso zzso binding zzso of higher zzso Specifically, the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso to the zzso zzso binding proteins in both the third zzso domain and the zzso region between zzso zzso 2 and zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso have three zzso zzso zzso which could span the membrane zzso The similarities between the two zzso proteins might reflect the fact that both bind zzso molecules and/or might be important for maintaining certain structural features of the zzso There is little similarity between the zzso sequences of the primary translation products of the zzso zzso zzso proteins and any transit sequences that have been zzso Instead, the zzso sequences have features resembling those of signal zzso Thus either transit peptides used in zzso zzso show little resemblance to those of higher plants and green algae or the zzso zzso proteins enter the zzso via a mechanism different from that used in higher zzso
