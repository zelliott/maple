zzso factor zzso is expressed in numerous zzso zzso including zzso zzso cardiovascular and zzso systems, and yet it plays important roles in the regulation of zzso gene zzso The zzso gene itself is also under stringent zzso control and multiple zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso In this study we sought out and then examined in detail the zzso that regulate zzso in the zzso We identified two discrete zzso in the zzso promoter that direct zzso zzso these zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulatory zzso are located zzso and zzso zzso respectively, upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso both zzso contain zzso factor binding zzso Our analyses further revealed that zzso is essential for zzso gene expression in the zzso whereas zzso is zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso have the independent ability to activate zzso gene expression in the zzso superior zzso whereas the zzso domain is additionally capable of zzso zzso zzso in the inferior zzso These results demonstrate that two distinct regulatory zzso contribute to the zzso gene expression in the mouse zzso and that zzso zzso zzso is under positive zzso
