zzso is an zzso protein that plays an important role in iron metabolism and resistance to bacterial infection in a variety of zzso A comparison of zzso coding sequences from four zzso species shows that the rate of evolution at zzso sites is significantly higher than the rate at synonymous sites, suggesting that positive natural selection for new zzso has played an important role in the evolution of zzso in some salmon zzso We zzso that the selective agent driving rapid divergence is interactions between host zzso and the zzso proteins of zzso zzso
