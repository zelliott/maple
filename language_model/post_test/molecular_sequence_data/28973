A synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso split zzso gene was constructed for the in zzso zzso of zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso The system was used to zzso the zzso domain of zzso coli zzso the structure of which had been determined previously by zzso zzso zzso was found to proceed zzso with little zzso of zzso and the product was zzso in high zzso The solution structure of zzso zzso is not significantly different from that of linear zzso and it unfolds zzso at temperatures approximately 14 degrees C zzso zzso hydrogen bonding was observed in the first and last zzso and the length of the last zzso was increased, while the zzso acid zzso used to join the zzso and zzso zzso was found to be highly zzso The measured zzso stabilization of the structure zzso Delta G approximately 2 zzso agrees well with the value estimated from the reduced zzso zzso in the unfolded zzso zzso zzso theory can be used to predict likely free energy changes resulting from protein zzso and how the stabilization depends on the size of the protein and the length of the zzso used to connect the zzso
