A cloned zzso termed zzso zzso that is unusual because it detects two variable zzso in human DNA has been zzso One zzso zzso located in the terminal region of the short arm of human zzso 6, is also present in great zzso The second zzso zzso zzso is located zzso on zzso zzso and is absent both from zzso primates and from some zzso Physical mapping and sequencing show that the second locus has arisen recently in evolution by zzso of a large zzso than 15 zzso segment of zzso 6 DNA containing a zzso and zzso onto zzso 16 into a member of a novel zzso repetitive DNA zzso This unusual zzso event appears to represent the first example of a human DNA zzso arising through zzso rather than zzso transfer between zzso
