The mixed lineage zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso in acute zzso is fused to at least 16 identified partner genes that display diverse structural and zzso zzso Using zzso pull down and the zzso two hybrid system, we show that two different zzso fusion partners with zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso and zzso both of which are involved in zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family that has recently been shown to regulate cell proliferation and survival, is also known to bind to zzso the mouse zzso of zzso another fusion partner of zzso zzso studies show that zzso is strongly expressed in bone zzso and immature zzso cell lines, very zzso in peripheral blood zzso and absent in zzso a mature B cell zzso We found that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso interact with different zzso zzso of zzso while the zzso zzso of zzso interact with the zzso motifs of zzso In zzso competitive binding zzso demonstrate that zzso displays stronger binding affinity than zzso and may compete with it for zzso These findings suggest a potential link between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
