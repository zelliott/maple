zzso is an essential trace element which forms an integral component of many zzso While trace amounts of copper are needed to sustain life, excess copper is extremely zzso An attempt is made here to present the current understanding of the normal transport of copper in relation to the zzso zzso transport and zzso Wilson disease is a genetic disorder of copper transport resulting in the zzso of copper in zzso such as liver and brain which leads to progressive zzso and neurological zzso The gene responsible for Wilson disease zzso is predicted to zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso An important feature of this zzso is the presence of a large zzso domain that contains six repeats of a zzso motif which is thought to be responsible for binding this metal prior to its transport across the zzso We have zzso expressed and zzso the zzso domain zzso 70 zzso of Wilson disease zzso zzso properties of the domain showed the protein to bind several metals besides zzso however, copper has a higher affinity for the zzso The copper is bound to the domain in zzso form with a zzso protein ratio of zzso X-ray zzso studies strongly suggest zzso atoms are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso spectral analyses suggest both secondary and zzso structural changes upon copper binding to the zzso zzso studies suggest some degree of zzso in binding of zzso These studies as well as detailed structural information of the zzso domain will be crucial in determining the specific role played by the zzso zzso in the zzso control of copper in the body and how the transport of copper is interrupted by zzso in the zzso zzso
