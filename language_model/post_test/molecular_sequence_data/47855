The zzso coiled zzso motif is among the first characterized and widely found architecture of protein zzso We report here a fast and reliable approach of simulated zzso molecular dynamics zzso for predicting the three-dimensional structures of various zzso coiled coils of zzso zzso One key element of our simulation involves a geometric restraint requiring zzso occupying the first and fourth positions of the zzso to orient to the angle of their respective statistical average derived from a survey of zzso structures deposited in the zzso Data zzso Another is the incorporation of zzso rotation and inversion operations for generating zzso protein zzso during the dynamics zzso The procedure is fully automated and can be applied to different zzso states of identical zzso as well as both parallel and zzso zzso Despite zzso the formation of five zzso zzso systems driven by the zzso zzso approach shows that the level of prediction accuracy achieved previously by more elaborate procedures can be zzso The present work thus provides validation of a simulation approach that can be employed to zzso a wide variety of zzso geometric restraints for structural prediction of symmetrical or zzso protein zzso
