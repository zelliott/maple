The full sequence of the heavy chain of zzso M zzso and a partial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The complete transcript of zzso zzso consisted of 1865 zzso and translated into a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was 1776 zzso and was identified as the core region of zzso These two immune genes were used in expression studies as markers of early development in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was used in zzso in zzso zzso zzso A zzso signal for zzso was first detected in larvae at 25 days zzso zzso in two bilateral zzso regions of the head identified as the zzso Further expression studies were carried out by zzso analysis of zzso and zzso on zzso samples obtained during early development, zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression was detected after 21 days zzso zzso whilst zzso transcripts were not detected until 40 zzso equivalent to day 29 zzso These results suggest that the immune system in zzso starts to develop in larvae of zzso zzso in length zzso zzso
