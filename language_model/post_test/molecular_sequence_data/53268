The mouse zzso zzso release zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso coding sequence was cloned from a mouse zzso zzso zzso It shows zzso and zzso zzso with the corresponding rat and human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present at low levels in the adult mouse brain, with significant expression in a few zzso only, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso very few signals were observed in the zzso zzso and zzso (except the zzso motor nucleus of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the zzso zzso cell line zzso which zzso the zzso reporter gene driven by the serum responsive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in a zzso manner, but defined different zzso zzso zzso 495, 540 and 144 zzso zzso zzso sites displayed the following rank order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso sites displayed a different profile: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The pharmacological profiles determined with zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated highly significantly zzso zzso whereas zzso binding was rather divergent zzso zzso Also, human and mouse zzso zzso profiles are very different, zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso reporter gene in zzso zzso The profile was consistent with a zzso zzso effect although apparent potency in the zzso zzso was much reduced compared to zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and D zzso zzso zzso behaved as full or nearly full zzso in comparison to zzso whereas the other compounds had relative zzso of 40 to zzso The present study shows that zzso zzso define apparently different zzso populations in terms of number of sites and pharmacological profile in cells expressing a single zzso zzso These variations suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso complex may vary depending on the zzso Further, the zzso zzso although primarily coupled to zzso zzso is able to stimulate zzso gene expression driven by the serum responsive zzso Finally, it is suggested that putative zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso show similar or higher potency at zzso receptors than zzso
