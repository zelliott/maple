The light and truncated heavy chains of human factor VIII, expressed separately in zzso insect cells, exhibited different zzso zzso when compared with each other and with a biologically active fusion zzso of the truncated heavy and light zzso The light chain was very efficiently zzso into culture zzso as judged by high zzso protein levels and the absence of evidence for light chain retention within zzso zzso proteins containing the heavy chain sequence were poorly zzso and appeared to be zzso within cells, suggesting that regions within the heavy chain are responsible for the low levels of zzso protein which have generally been observed for zzso factor zzso
