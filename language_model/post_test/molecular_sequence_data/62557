zzso zzso zzso zzso and their hybrid zzso zzso zzso are widespread zzso of open zzso in North zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso DNA sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resolved zzso zzso as a zzso zzso but found zzso zzso to bear zzso zzso from highly zzso evolutionary zzso This raised the question of a possible zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be of recent and zzso origin, a result consistent with its presumed hybrid zzso One hundred and three zzso zzso were detected within zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso were estimated to have arisen prior to the Wisconsin zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso analysis, suggested for zzso zzso zzso past fragmentation events, zzso genetic variation in several instances between the Sierra Nevada, the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Colorado zzso on the one hand and the Central to Northern Rockies of the United States and adjacent Cascades on the zzso and for both parental species zzso zzso of major areas formerly covered by the Wisconsin zzso by three zzso and zzso restricted gene flow indicating isolation by distance in areas south of the last glacial zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely zzso with its parental species and zzso their zzso The highest genetic diversity was found in the Rocky Mountains from Idaho and Montana south to Utah and zzso This area was further hypothesized to have played a major role in the origin of both parental species and probably represented an important glacial zzso However, evidence for glacial zzso was also found in arctic and zzso regions of Alaska and near the Great zzso In comparison to nuclear zzso internal transcribed zzso data, zzso DNA divergence was very high and evidently predated the origin of zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso zzso of major zzso lineages dates back to the middle of the zzso at zzso zzso zzso is the most likely evolutionary factor working on zzso zzso to explain the revealed zzso in nuclear DNA and zzso DNA zzso
