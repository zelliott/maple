zzso in the water zzso zzso zzso is a process that reaches completion 11 h after dry zzso are immersed in an zzso medium at 20 degrees zzso Each zzso produces 32 zzso and each zzso has a coiled cell body and approximately 140 zzso The zzso make zzso bodies de zzso from a structure known as a zzso From the onset of development, the spores contain a large quantity of protein and stored zzso We have found previously that zzso a protein involved in the function of zzso organizing centers and present in association with zzso bodies in zzso cells, is made in large quantity approximately 4 h after the zzso are placed into liquid zzso In this paper, we show that a zzso zzso zzso we isolated from zzso zzso closely resembles zzso zzso from other zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli as a zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso zzso on zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso is present in the dry zzso at the time of zzso at levels that remain constant over 10 h of development and are unaffected by treatment of spores with zzso The zzso zzso stored in dry zzso cannot be translated in zzso for at least 30 zzso after zzso
