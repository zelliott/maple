zzso regulates cell zzso by providing a zzso connection between both classical and zzso zzso and their respective zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and the related protein zzso are zzso zzso in response to zzso in cultured zzso zzso of zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso and tumor zzso To investigate the role of zzso in these functions we expressed a full-length zzso and an zzso truncated form of zzso zzso in mouse zzso and hair zzso zzso which undergo continuous and easily observed zzso renewal and zzso zzso of these zzso results in stunted hair growth, a zzso that has also been observed in transgenic mice expressing zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso from PG and zzso mice show premature termination of the growth phase zzso of the hair cycle, an event that is regulated in part by zzso zzso et zzso zzso The zzso rate of the zzso cells was reduced and zzso changes, which are associated with entry into the zzso phase of the hair zzso cycle zzso occurred earlier than zzso
