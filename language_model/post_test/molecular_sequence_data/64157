The zzso coli zzso system has unusual capacity of zzso folded proteins across the zzso zzso The zzso protein is the most abundant known zzso component and consists of a zzso segment followed by an zzso zzso and a zzso C zzso To study the operation mechanism of the zzso apparatus, we analyzed the zzso of zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso were obtained at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are all located at the zzso C zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, replacing zzso with zzso at zzso led to positive zzso fusion, zzso zzso location of the zzso C zzso To further determine cellular zzso of the zzso C zzso we deleted the zzso gene and left 46 zzso zzso including the tobacco etch virus zzso zzso zzso site zzso after zzso yielding zzso Unlike the zzso and zzso zzso which abolished the zzso function, the zzso construct was able to restore the growth of zzso zzso on the minimal zzso zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso site of zzso was accessible from both the zzso and zzso indicating a dual zzso of the zzso C zzso zzso growth conditions seemed to influence the protein level of zzso and the zzso accessibility of the zzso site of zzso A zzso change of the zzso zzso is suggested, and its implication in protein transport is zzso
