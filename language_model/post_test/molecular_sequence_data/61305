The human zzso gene zzso located in zzso band zzso is amplified and zzso in pancreatic zzso It encodes a protein consisting solely of ten zzso zinc finger zzso We report here the isolation and the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences between zzso human and bovine zzso revealed a strong identity zzso A closely related zzso zzso was also isolated and zzso It encodes a putative protein consisting of three vestigial zinc finger motifs followed by ten zzso zinc fingers sharing zzso identity and no gap zzso with the zzso zinc zzso In zzso zzso of both genes led to synthesis of proteins of the predicted zzso zzso was observed at the zzso level in eight adult mouse zzso zzso FISH revealed zzso of both genes on mouse zzso 7 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso together with the close similarity of their zinc finger zzso suggests that both participate in the same regulatory zzso
