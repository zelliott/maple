In this study, for the first time, two distinct genetic lineages of zzso virus zzso were found within a small sampling area and within a single host genetic lineage zzso zzso at zzso northern zzso Lung tissue samples of zzso bank zzso zzso zzso trapped in September 1998 were screened for the presence of zzso zzso zzso and 25 were found to be zzso zzso sequences of the zzso small zzso medium zzso and large zzso zzso segments were recovered from these samples using zzso zzso analysis revealed two genetic groups of zzso sequences that belonged to the Finnish and north zzso zzso This presented a unique opportunity to study zzso zzso in zzso indeed, 32 % of the studied bank zzso appeared to carry zzso virus zzso Thus, the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso was comparable to that of zzso zzso observed previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso J Gen zzso 89, zzso Of six possible zzso zzso combinations, only two were found at zzso and, notably, in all zzso both S and L segments originated from the same genetic zzso suggesting a zzso pattern for the zzso These findings are discussed in connection to zzso evolution in zzso
