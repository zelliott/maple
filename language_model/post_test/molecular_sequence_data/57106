zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recently shown to contain two very similar zzso each of which bears a functional active site zzso zzso or zzso I zzso The zzso specificity of the two active sites of zzso was compared using zzso zzso zzso and zzso where one active site is suppressed by deletion or zzso by zzso of 2 zzso zzso an essential zinc zzso Both active sites converted zzso zzso to zzso and zzso with similar zzso and with zzso at least 30 times lower and zzso 10 times higher than for zzso The zzso active site, but not the zzso site, was activated by zzso however, zzso zzso was minimal compared with zzso Both zzso also zzso substance P and zzso a zzso protected zzso and zzso The zzso active site was more readily activated by zzso and zzso substance P zzso zzso releasing hormone was zzso by both active sites, but zzso by the zzso active site was zzso It performed the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso at least 30 times faster than the zzso active zzso Both active sites zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Thus, both active sites of zzso possess zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, only the zzso active site can undergo a zzso zzso that greatly enhances the zzso of zzso or substance zzso and the zzso active site possesses an unusual zzso zzso specificity for a natural zzso This suggests zzso important differences between the zzso of the two active centers, and different zzso zzso despite the high degree of sequence zzso
