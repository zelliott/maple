zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso 20 of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are virtually zzso during zzso and S zzso of the cell cycle but increase in late S and in zzso We identify zzso as the principal zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso degradation in the S phase of the cell cycle, which requires zzso zzso zzso of the zzso degradation axis results in zzso DNA damage and the induction of tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso delayed progression through zzso phase of the cell cycle due to zzso of the zzso checkpoint, zzso specific repression of zzso gene zzso and depletion of the zzso zzso and zzso repression of zzso gene zzso These results demonstrate a central role of zzso zzso regulation of zzso for the maintenance of a stable zzso state essential for cell zzso
