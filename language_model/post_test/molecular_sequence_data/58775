zzso acid zzso zzso is an essential zzso in most organisms, zzso an inaugural step in the zzso zzso pathway, the zzso zzso reaction of two molecules of zzso acid zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso separated into two main groups: those requiring zzso for activity zzso here by the zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso and those requiring zzso zzso here by the zzso from zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a detailed comparison of these two zzso zzso zzso influential zzso were identified by using zzso zzso Groups with zzso values of zzso 7 and 10 zzso to zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the free zzso and zzso states of all three zzso and a further zzso group with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso was found to be additionally important to the zzso zzso The importance of these zzso was confirmed by using protein zzso zzso Shifts in the zzso values of the pea and zzso coli zzso zzso on zzso complex formation suggest a change to a less zzso zzso when zzso zzso Studies with zzso revealed that the three zzso exhibit differential zzso and, in the case of zzso this is reflected in Ki values that vary by three orders of zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso raising the possibility of an zzso three-dimensional structure of this zzso
