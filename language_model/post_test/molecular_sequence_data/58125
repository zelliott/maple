A previous report showed that the zzso response of helper T cells to class II major zzso complex zzso zzso can be inhibited by zzso of the zzso which act as T cell zzso zzso zzso Here we define and analyze zzso zzso that antagonize various functions of class I zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso Of 64 zzso at individual zzso contact sites of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a very high proportion zzso antagonized zzso by three zzso zzso zzso This effect was highly clone specific, since many zzso for one T cell clone have differential effects on zzso We show that this zzso of zzso function is not a result of T zzso cell interaction, zzso zzso phenomena as a mechanism for zzso Moreover, we present evidence for direct interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso In further analysis of the T cell response, we found that zzso zzso release and zzso production are susceptible to zzso antagonism similarly to zzso zzso zzso an early event in zzso is also inhibited by zzso but may be more resistant to the zzso effect than downstream zzso
