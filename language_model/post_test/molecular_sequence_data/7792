A zzso zzso rat mast cell zzso zzso was successfully zzso and zzso from zzso cells of Lewis rats infected with zzso zzso by the reverse zzso chain reaction and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The zzso was zzso zzso long, and included zzso zzso of an open reading zzso As judged from the deduced zzso acid zzso zzso is highly zzso to mouse mast cell zzso and is considered to be translated as a zzso with a zzso acid signal zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso and a zzso acid mature zzso The zzso zzso was not detected in zzso cells of mast zzso zzso rats, though it was strongly detected in ones of zzso zzso and Lewis zzso In addition to in zzso mast cells, the zzso zzso was detected in the zzso However, zzso signals were not detected in the small zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso Nor were zzso signals detected in zzso rat zzso leukemia zzso In the zzso the zzso zzso was strongly detected after infection with zzso zzso though it was only faintly detected before zzso These results suggest that the zzso is basically specific for zzso tissue mast cells, but not for zzso mast cells and that it is zzso in the lung during the inflammatory process of a zzso zzso
