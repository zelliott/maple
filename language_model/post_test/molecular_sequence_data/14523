Store operated calcium entry zzso is a principal cellular process by which cells regulate zzso zzso refill zzso zzso stores, and execute a wide range of specialized zzso zzso and zzso proteins have been identified as the essential components enabling the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso channels that mediate zzso Here, we report the molecular identification of zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and site directed zzso combined with zzso zzso and imaging techniques we show that zzso is an zzso zzso membrane resident protein that associates with zzso to facilitate slow zzso zzso of zzso zzso plays a key role in shaping zzso zzso signals and determining the content of the major zzso zzso stores, a role that is likely to be important in protecting cells from zzso zzso
