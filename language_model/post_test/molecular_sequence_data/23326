zzso zzso is the zzso of choice for promoting zzso zzso in zzso The population biology of zzso zzso is poorly understood and remains zzso For a better understanding of the mode of genetic variation within this species, we investigated by using zzso sequence typing zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes the genetic diversity and genetic relationships among 18 zzso zzso strains isolated in various years from wines of the United States, France, Germany, Spain, and zzso These strains have also been characterized by zzso and restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso region zzso zzso grouped the strains into two zzso however, the zzso analysis of the zzso showed no differences in the strains zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso had a good zzso ability, and we have found a higher genetic diversity than indicated by zzso zzso All sequence types were represented by a single strain, and all the strains could be distinguished from each other because they had unique combinations of zzso zzso assumed to be identical showed the same sequence zzso zzso analyses indicated a zzso population structure in zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for evidence of zzso by split decomposition analysis and analysis of clustered zzso All results indicated that zzso plays a major role in creating the genetic zzso of zzso zzso A low standardized index of association value indicated that the zzso zzso genes analyzed are close to linkage zzso This study constitutes the first step in the development of an zzso method for zzso zzso and the first example of the application of zzso to a zzso food production zzso
