Gene expression in zzso zzso zzso significant changes in each zzso stage, but the zzso factors zzso regulating these changes have not been zzso We report here a zzso zzso zzso that activates gene expression in zzso the zzso form, and has a zzso domain structurally related to that of a plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso female zzso and translated later during zzso development in the zzso The zzso zzso activates a set of zzso including all genes reported to be required for zzso invasion, by binding to specific zzso sequences on the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso family zzso have important roles in zzso gene regulation in zzso zzso
