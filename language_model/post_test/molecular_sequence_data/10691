In order to study zzso interactions in zzso the effects of small zzso zzso on zzso activity and zzso formation have been zzso It has been shown previously that active zzso is formed by zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso with a delta 86 form (21 zzso of the small zzso zzso for the full-length zzso zzso acid zzso zzso rat zzso small zzso has now been zzso both with and without an zzso zzso tag zzso The full-length small zzso zzso yielded active zzso on zzso with the large zzso and the small zzso was zzso to 20 zzso on exposure of these zzso to zzso A series of deletion zzso of the small zzso zzso 86, zzso 99, zzso zzso and zzso zzso gave active zzso zzso with unchanged specific activities, although in decreasing yield, and with a progressive decrease in zzso zzso 125 formed a zzso which was inactive and zzso zzso of 25 zzso zzso from delta 86, leaving zzso zzso abolished both activity and zzso zzso The results show that: zzso generation of active zzso in zzso coli requires zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso between 94 and 116 contribute to the stability of the active zzso but do not directly affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the region zzso are essential for zzso zzso Finally, it was shown that an inactive zzso zzso 86 zzso used in order to zzso zzso did not zzso in the presence of zzso a result which does not support the proposal that zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso
