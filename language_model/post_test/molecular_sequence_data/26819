zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso is zzso resistant to many zzso resulting in high mortality rates of zzso in Australia and even 50% in zzso zzso peptides zzso possess potent zzso zzso activities and are regarded as promising therapeutic alternatives in the fight against resistant zzso Moreover, these peptides may also affect zzso immune zzso and wound zzso In this study, the in zzso activities of 10 zzso including zzso 5 and zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso against 24 zzso of zzso zzso were zzso The results showed that the zzso activities of the individual peptides depended on zzso dose and bacterial zzso Among the 10 peptides tested, zzso exhibited the most effective killing zzso The smooth type A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to be more susceptible than those expressing the smooth type B zzso and the rough type zzso Four zzso of zzso zzso shown to be resistant to zzso and zzso were also highly susceptible to zzso These data indicate that zzso possesses zzso activity against all zzso independent of the zzso zzso and is therefore a promising zzso to combat zzso zzso zzso
