We reported previously that the human factor B precursor is a zzso acid zzso the first 40 zzso acid zzso of which function as a zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 277 (2002) zzso zzso zzso of live zzso cells, zzso zzso with factor B zzso zzso at the zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso revealed that either a zzso or zzso zzso localized factor B to zzso zzso zzso labeling of zzso zzso zzso cells that were zzso zzso with a construct lacking a zzso showed zzso zzso zzso that was consistent with targeting of zzso expressed factor B to cellular compartments distinct from the zzso zzso in which either zzso or both zzso zzso of the zzso were deleted exhibited decreased or zzso levels, respectively, of the zzso factor zzso The factor B zzso alone was shown to target a reporter zzso zzso to zzso Our studies, therefore, demonstrate that a zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso factor B to zzso and suggest that the human factor B precursor is a zzso acid zzso
