The zzso approach has been proposed for high zzso analysis of the microbial community by providing snapshots of the microbial diversity under different environmental zzso For this purpose, a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed and evaluated for assessing bacterial community zzso The zzso zzso is composed of 122 zzso that target bacteria at various zzso levels from zzso to species zzso zzso The zzso zzso was first validated using bacteria in pure zzso zzso in the sequences of zzso and potential target zzso were zzso as weighted zzso zzso in order to evaluate zzso zzso As a general feature, zzso having a zzso zzso 2 with target DNA displayed only zzso false zzso The zzso zzso was subsequently tested with an environmental sample, which consisted of an zzso zzso chain reaction zzso from a zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso results were compared to results obtained by zzso with the same zzso zzso analysis enabled the detection of all zzso zzso gene sequences found by zzso zzso representing only zzso of the clone library were zzso In conclusion, this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be a promising tool for the analysis of zzso in complex zzso
