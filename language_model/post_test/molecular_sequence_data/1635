A novel method was developed to isolate pure cultures of zzso zzso zzso and related species from plant roots, even roots washed free of adhering zzso The method uses zzso zzso zzso zzso media that promote rapid zzso growth zzso zzso zzso or zzso surface film formation zzso zzso zzso of zzso species at 40 degrees zzso zzso from the tips of surface growth on zzso leads to zzso and zzso on CM zzso plates zzso zzso and high zzso leads to characteristic colony zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that most root zzso obtained by this method are zzso zzso species, with enrichment for zzso zzso and its close zzso Of particular interest is the finding that the majority of these zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso strain also form adhering zzso on zzso zzso Thus the methods presented may be useful in isolation of zzso zzso and investigation of their role on plant zzso
