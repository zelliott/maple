In zzso coli, the formation of zzso complexes has a direct effect on zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of this interaction was evaluated and defined using controlled zzso equilibrium dialysis at low temperature, and kinetic analyses of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso data indicate that zzso and the zzso zzso analogue zzso induce similar zzso changes in zzso which result in a more open or extended structure that is suggestive of the zzso zzso The effect is synergistic and zzso and requires the occupation of both the zzso and zzso zzso binding sites for maximum zzso The equilibrium dialysis experiments and kinetic data support the observation that the zzso zzso zzso activity is the result of an increased rate of zzso zzso rather than an increase in the affinity of zzso for zzso and that the zzso zzso binding site is zzso regulated by zzso It appears that zzso may function as an zzso regulator of zzso zzso by promoting the zzso state of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso activity by sodium zzso in the presence of zzso and a functional signal zzso further indicates that zzso promotes the zzso form of zzso
