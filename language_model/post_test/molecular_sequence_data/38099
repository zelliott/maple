zzso 13 zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso has approximately zzso primary sequence zzso with zzso and shares a common zzso zzso The biologically active zzso is zzso and zzso and contains two zzso bonds as determined by comparative zzso mass zzso zzso analysis of the protein before and after reduction with zzso A zzso core zzso of zzso was isolated and analyzed by plasma zzso zzso zzso identifying a zzso core zzso zzso zzso of this core zzso by zzso followed by zzso analysis of the resulting zzso zzso fragments, provided rapid determination of the existing zzso bonds between zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso arrangement is similar to that observed for the analogous four internal zzso zzso in zzso The conservation of zzso bond arrangements between zzso and zzso coupled with their zzso structure and sequence zzso confirms that zzso and zzso are structural zzso It is also consistent with their reported similarities in biological function and zzso binding zzso
