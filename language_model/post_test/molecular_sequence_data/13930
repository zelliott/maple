zzso beta converting zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the conversion of the inactive precursor form of zzso beta to an active mature zzso The mature form of zzso beta is involved in zzso inflammatory responses and in the progression of zzso zzso We recently reported on the production of active human ICE in insect cells using the zzso expression system zzso XM et zzso 1994, Gene zzso Because the levels of expression achieved with this system were limiting for the purpose of performing detailed zzso and zzso studies, we examined the production of ICE in zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso expression system and fusion to zzso we were able to recover high levels of active ICE zzso The expressed zzso which was distributed between the soluble and zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from both zzso using a combination of classical and affinity zzso Comparisons of ICE derived from both zzso indicated that they were comparable in their specific activities, zzso zzso and sensitivities to specific ICE zzso The combined yields of ICE obtained from the soluble and zzso zzso was close to 1 zzso of induced zzso zzso human ICE was zzso in the presence of a specific ICE inhibitor in a form suitable for X-ray zzso zzso This readily available source of ICE will facilitate the further characterization of this novel and important zzso
