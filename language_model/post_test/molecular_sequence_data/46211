zzso zzso are plant secondary zzso derived from the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and its product, zzso in developing roots and zzso of the model zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns of zzso in different zzso stages of zzso roots and in roots infected with zzso zzso were zzso The tissue specificity of zzso expression was zzso by in zzso zzso zzso analysis, in which transgenic zzso zzso roots silenced for zzso were generated, was zzso The absence of zzso in the silenced plant lines was determined by zzso zzso The expression of zzso a marker gene for zzso zzso zzso was increased significantly in the zzso plant lines, suggesting that zzso influences zzso zzso zzso plants also showed a more rapid zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso application of zzso to zzso zzso zzso plants provided further evidence for a negative regulatory effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso roots and zzso can be solely attributed to zzso Taken together, our data suggest a role for zzso zzso in zzso formation through the regulation of zzso gene zzso
