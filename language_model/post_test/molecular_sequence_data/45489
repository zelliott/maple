The gene promoter of zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso contains several zzso regulatory zzso such as upstream regulatory element zzso DNA zzso element zzso zzso and zzso recognition zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso screen using three tandem repeats of zzso in zzso promoter as the bait allowed isolation of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that Cut bound to both zzso and the sequence zzso in zzso with much higher affinity to the zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity by transient zzso expression zzso in zzso zzso cells after an zzso interference for Cut or zzso showed zzso activates the zzso promoter while Cut functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso further showed both zzso and Cut proteins to be localized in the zzso region containing the zzso promoter in zzso cells, especially in the Cut case upon induction of zzso These results indicate that Cut functions as a zzso zzso of zzso gene by binding to the promoter region in the differentiated state, while zzso binds to zzso to promote expression of zzso during cell zzso
