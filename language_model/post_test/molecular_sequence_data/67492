The linear zzso channel zzso zzso serves as an excellent zzso for monitoring the organization, zzso and function of zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso channels are crucial for establishing and maintaining the structure and function of the channel in the membrane zzso In order to address the basis of differential importance of zzso zzso in the zzso channel, we monitored the effects of zzso substitution of two of the four zzso zzso the inner pair zzso and zzso and the outer pair zzso and zzso using a combination of steady state and zzso zzso approaches and circular zzso zzso We show here that these double zzso zzso zzso adopt different zzso in zzso suggesting that the zzso preference of double zzso zzso zzso is dictated by the positions of the zzso in the zzso These results assume significance in the context of recent observations that the inner pair of zzso zzso and zzso is more important for zzso channel formation and channel zzso These results could be potentially useful in analyzing the effect of zzso substitution on the functioning of zzso channels and membrane zzso
