A newly identified 22 zzso protein that interacts with zzso zzso protein zzso was shown to possess the characteristic zzso domain, hence named zzso and zzso as a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Independent studies from different laboratories reported the protein with different names such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have identified, on the basis of the zzso sequence analysis, putative zzso factor 1 binding sites upstream of the zzso translation start zzso We demonstrate that indeed zzso is zzso We show, in zzso zzso activity of zzso in preventing zzso zzso of insulin and zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have cloned rat zzso zzso and zzso the protein to zzso and studied its structural and functional zzso We find that zzso fragments on zzso zzso analysis of fragments suggests that the fragmentation might be due to the presence of zzso zzso zzso We have established conditions to improve its zzso zzso CD indicates a randomly coiled structure for zzso zzso structure analyses by zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso show that zzso exists as a zzso in zzso unlike other members of the zzso zzso zzso exhibits significantly exposed zzso surfaces as reported by zzso acid zzso We find that the zzso activity is temperature zzso Thus zzso appears to be a true member of the zzso family, which exists as a zzso in zzso and exhibits zzso zzso
