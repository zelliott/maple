A zzso zzso from the domain zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from groundwater sampled from a deep zzso zzso formation located in zzso zzso zzso The strain zzso zzso and zzso as zzso for zzso zzso were strictly zzso zzso zzso irregular zzso zzso zzso in diameter, and occurred zzso The strain grew at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso M zzso zzso zzso M zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing revealed that, although the strain is a member of the zzso zzso it clearly differed from all described species of this zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso for zzso zzso with type strains of closely related zzso species were less than zzso zzso and zzso features of strain zzso clearly indicate that it represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
