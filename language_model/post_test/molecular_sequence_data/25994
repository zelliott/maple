zzso has been converted into zzso acid, zzso and zzso the first two zzso being related structurally to zzso sequences in zzso and zzso zzso Used as the starting material was a major product of the kinetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It was subjected to a sequence of transformation that included the introduction of a zzso function into the zzso group, the inversion of zzso in the zzso zzso to give the zzso zzso zzso at position 6, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to give the desired zzso zzso In the formation of the latter, the zzso zzso was found to be less prone to zzso migration to zzso than more conventional zzso zzso The relative acid zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso groups are zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of some zzso derivatives are zzso
