zzso of zzso insects is typically associated with zzso shifts, with subsequent divergent selection and adaptation to the ecological conditions associated with the new zzso However, a few insect groups have apparently undergone zzso while remaining on the same zzso species, and such zzso may provide novel insights into the causes of zzso zzso We used zzso and nuclear DNA to zzso a zzso for 14 species of zzso zzso flies zzso zzso found on zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been considered to be zzso based on zzso zzso Our zzso analyses provide strong support for extensive zzso plant zzso in this group, and it demonstrates that diversification has involved numerous shifts between different plant zzso zzso zzso flowers, and zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is thus apparently facilitated by the opportunity to partition the plant zzso One zzso exhibits zzso isolation among species, which may have facilitated divergence via zzso zzso Using a novel method based on zzso zzso we show that the rate of change in an zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher along branches with zzso shifts between zzso zzso than along branches without such zzso This finding suggests that zzso zzso zzso exhibit close zzso adaptation to specific zzso parts, which may mediate ecological transitions via disruptive zzso
