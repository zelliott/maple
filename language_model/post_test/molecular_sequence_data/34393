zzso aromatic zzso that include many zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by the type II zzso zzso zzso which consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso is uniquely primed with a zzso group generated by a type I zzso followed by zzso to a downstream type II zzso to zzso a zzso zzso whose zzso position is reduced by zzso type II zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso for which we have conducted extensive structural studies zzso How zzso can accommodate a longer zzso zzso than the zzso and the molecular basis of its zzso and zzso is not well zzso Here we present a detailed study of zzso that sheds light on its zzso zzso alignment of zzso predicts that zzso is less active than zzso with significant differences in zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso confirmed this zzso The zzso crystal structure further provides the molecular basis for the observed differences between zzso and zzso in the recognition of zzso and zzso Instead of the zzso motif observed in zzso zzso has the zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso whose molecular basis can be explained by the crystal zzso Together with zzso zzso results, zzso simulations, and the zzso crystal structure, a model for the observed zzso and zzso is presented zzso that zzso how different type II zzso recognize zzso with different chain zzso yet precisely reduce only the zzso zzso The molecular features of zzso important for zzso and zzso can potentially be applied to zzso new zzso via protein engineering that rationally controls zzso zzso
