Two novel zzso bacteria, strains zzso and zzso were isolated from seawater around zzso The characteristics of both strains were investigated, and zzso analyses of their zzso zzso gene sequences showed that they belonged to the zzso zzso In zzso gaseous zzso both strains grew only on zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso or zzso by either zzso zzso methane zzso zzso which are ubiquitous in zzso bacteria for initial zzso of zzso were not detected in these zzso although genes similar to particulate methane zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso tree of the deduced zzso acid sequences formed a new zzso near the zzso of zzso bacteria similar to other zzso of zzso in type I, type II, and zzso zzso and zzso in alpha and beta zzso
