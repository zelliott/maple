zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso highly expressed in zzso The mechanism for its zzso from expressing cells is zzso because its primary structure lacks a zzso signal zzso zzso therefore, investigated the mechanism and structural requirements for zzso of zzso As with other zzso zzso in zzso translation of zzso was inhibited by signal recognition zzso which binds to the signal zzso When translated in zzso full-length zzso was zzso into zzso zzso and protected from zzso zzso By using various zzso deletion zzso we found that two zzso zzso located at the N zzso and at the center of the zzso primary structure, were crucial for zzso zzso of various point zzso revealed that local zzso of the central zzso domain, but not the N zzso was crucial for zzso zzso results were obtained with respect to zzso zzso from zzso zzso Upon deletion of the complete sequence preceding it, the previously zzso zzso domain appeared to serve as a zzso signal zzso Our results suggest that nascent zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso without zzso zzso via a zzso zzso in which both the N zzso and the central zzso domain are zzso thereafter, zzso is zzso and zzso
