The gene zzso the mouse zzso water channel protein zzso was cloned and its zzso structure was zzso zzso consists of six zzso with boundaries at zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which partially zzso to those of other known zzso zzso All zzso sites conform to the zzso rule except the first one which is zzso zzso extension and zzso protection analyses using mouse liver zzso demonstrated three initiation zzso sites located zzso 156 and 146 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso No defined zzso box was found in the zzso region where numerous zzso motifs and one zzso box were zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso localized the zzso locus to mouse zzso zzso The zzso region is zzso with human zzso 11, 16 and zzso These results zzso reveal marked structural distinction between the zzso gene and the other known zzso zzso zzso zzso may now permit the molecular characterization of zzso expression and zzso represent a fundamental step for the construction of a target zzso to generate transgenic zzso knockout zzso
