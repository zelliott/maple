zzso mice zzso are commonly used as animal models for studying zzso To date, zzso zzso in the zzso and brains of zzso mice have been zzso however, zzso of SAM has not yet been used as material for studying the zzso zzso despite its extremely important role in the progress of aging or zzso zzso 

To identify proteins associated with aging or zzso diseases in zzso 

zzso gel zzso zzso was used to compare the zzso of zzso zzso from two strains of SAM zzso and zzso zzso expressed spots whose expression altered over twofold zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso and database zzso 

Identification results showed that 18 zzso expressed protein spots represented 14 different proteins known to be involved in zzso or aging zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso B, zzso zzso zzso and an unnamed protein product were involved in zzso stress and cell defense, zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso II were involved in zzso energy metabolism and zzso and zzso capping protein and high mobility group zzso protein were involved in infection and DNA zzso 

zzso combined with zzso is effective for comparative zzso analysis of zzso zzso of SAM to identify proteins closely involved in aging or zzso diseases, especially immune diseases, and further functional studies of these proteins in SAM may throw some light on the study of zzso for aging or zzso zzso
