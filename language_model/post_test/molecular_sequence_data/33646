zzso C virus zzso is a major cause of liver disease worldwide, with zzso or zzso zzso being a frequent zzso zzso In previous work, we identified sequence zzso within domain 3 zzso of zzso 3 zzso core protein that correlated with zzso and in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso of zzso to promote zzso zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso distribution of zzso 

zzso cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso 3 core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso zzso were analyzed by means of zzso oil red O zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso that expressed zzso had statistically significantly more zzso than did cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso and zzso respectively), as well as higher zzso levels P zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso does not zzso to zzso droplets but partially zzso to the zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso core zzso is sufficient to mediate the zzso of zzso by means of a mechanism that is independent of zzso 1 and zzso Our results also suggest that altered zzso trafficking may be zzso
