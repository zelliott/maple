During malaria zzso invasion of red blood cells, zzso proteins bind receptors on the surface of the zzso Two candidate zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso membrane zzso 1 zzso and the zzso zzso proteins zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that passive zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against zzso and zzso respectively, protects against a lethal challenge infection with zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso recognizes an zzso located on a zzso surface of zzso as determined by zzso display and analysis of the three-dimensional structure of zzso in a region similar to that bound by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso recognized by zzso could not be zzso We report here that zzso zzso and zzso also protect against challenge with the zzso zzso line zzso in which zzso has a significantly different zzso acid sequence from that in zzso When administered together, the two zzso acted at least zzso in providing protection against challenge with the virulent zzso zzso These results support the concept of developing a zzso zzso vaccine and the inclusion of zzso targets such as zzso which these results suggest contain zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso
