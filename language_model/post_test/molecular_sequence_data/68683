It has previously been shown that an zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso protein zzso is zzso and activated in response to a range of hormones, growth factors zzso nerve growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a variety of cells including zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso proteins and zzso zzso As such they are believed to function in zzso signal zzso In zzso zzso zzso using synthetic zzso zzso has been used to identify cells in the adult rat central nervous system containing zzso zzso coding for two zzso of zzso regulated zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso was observed in many regions including the cerebral cortex, zzso bulb, zzso amygdala, zzso zzso (except the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso nucleus, thalamus, zzso brain stem zzso zzso and zzso in the spinal zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso was confined to fewer regions than zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso signals for zzso regulated zzso were seen in the zzso bulb, cortex, regions of the zzso amygdala, nucleus zzso of zzso zzso zzso some zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of the spinal zzso Of particular interest, zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso was absent from all regions of the zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso regulated zzso was almost absent from the zzso region, whereas zzso regulated zzso was present in all zzso of the zzso There were no zzso regions that expressed zzso regulated zzso but not zzso regulated zzso however, zzso of the zzso root zzso showed zzso regulated zzso but not zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso Although zzso regulated zzso and zzso regulated zzso expression was selectively zzso in the brain, zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso in the spinal zzso The distinct cellular distribution of individual zzso regulated zzso in the adult rat zzso suggests that they play unique zzso zzso
