We are interested in the mechanism and regulation of the zzso regulated protein zzso zzso and zzso due to their key roles in cellular signal zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso a large number of structurally disparate proteins upon zzso by zzso zzso serum and growth factors, and are activated through a protein zzso zzso termed the zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso found in zzso or zzso motifs on zzso Its zzso mechanism is intriguing, because it appears to predominantly rely on interactions outside of the active site zzso to specify a zzso To study zzso we developed a zzso protein called zzso which comprises zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso an excellent zzso of zzso Here we review several zzso kinetic experiments that reveal details of the zzso mechanism and a zzso unknown process of zzso zzso by free zzso The zzso relevance of this mechanism is zzso
