In order to determine how efficiently the zzso proteins derived from human and avian influenza A viruses can interact with each other in the context of a zzso cell, a genetic system that allows the in zzso zzso of active zzso was zzso The ability to achieve replication of a zzso reporter zzso in zzso cells was examined with zzso zzso of the core proteins zzso zzso PA and zzso from two strains of human viruses zzso zzso and zzso two strains of avian viruses zzso and zzso and a strain of avian origin zzso zzso that was isolated from the first human case of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong in zzso In accordance with published observations on zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was identified as a major zzso of the replication efficiency of zzso complexes in zzso zzso Moreover, the results showed that replication of the zzso reporter zzso was more efficient when zzso and zzso were both derived from the same avian or human virus or when zzso was derived from an avian virus, whatever the origin of the other zzso Furthermore, the zzso and zzso proteins from the zzso zzso virus exhibited intermediate properties with respect to the corresponding proteins from avian or human influenza zzso suggesting that some molecular characteristics of zzso and zzso proteins might at least partially account for the ability of the zzso zzso virus to replicate in zzso
