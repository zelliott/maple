Genes of the zzso zzso zzso class 1 zzso zzso factors involved in shoot zzso zzso development and zzso We studied the zzso zzso of Green Fluorescent zzso rice zzso proteins zzso after particle zzso of onion and rice cells and after transformation of zzso and rice with zzso and zzso expression zzso In all test systems, the three rice zzso proteins showed nuclear and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso additionally showed in some cells a distribution over zzso moving randomly in the zzso Use of an zzso expression system indicated a nuclear presence of zzso in cells of the shoot zzso zzso and zzso zzso in early leaf zzso zzso and rice test systems were used to study effects of plant hormones and zzso transport zzso on zzso protein zzso Application of zzso or zzso shifted protein zzso completely to the zzso and resulted in loss of the zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso application induced a complete nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso To study zzso movement of the zzso proteins we set up a novel zzso zzso in which trafficking of zzso zzso proteins was zzso through the zzso of green fluorescent or blue fluorescent marker zzso In multiple independent experiments zzso zzso more extensively to neighboring cells than zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and trafficking properties of zzso zzso and zzso correlate with differences in zzso zzso patterns and functional differences between the rice zzso genes and their putative zzso from other zzso
