zzso of the zzso sequence of the gene zzso a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is a member of the zzso family zzso and is composed of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli in an zzso form, zzso in the presence of 8 M zzso zzso in a zzso form and zzso by removing zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that this zzso protein is zzso zzso showed relatively broad zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and olive oil with comparable zzso zzso was active only in the form of a zzso in which at least 12 zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso bound too tightly to be removed from the protein upon dialysis, but were removed from it upon zzso zzso The zzso zzso was fully active in the presence of 10 zzso zzso but was inactive in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso and generally contains the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso within this motif to Ala completely zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso
