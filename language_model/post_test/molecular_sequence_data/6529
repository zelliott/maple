An zzso light chain protein was isolated from the urine of an individual zzso with systemic zzso Complete zzso acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain zzso protein established it as a zzso I, which when compared with other zzso I zzso associated proteins had unique zzso including zzso zzso and zzso To study the zzso structure, zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli by using a zzso product amplified from the patient zzso bone zzso zzso The zzso product was zzso into zzso a zzso replication zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated, zzso to zzso and zzso by using ammonium zzso as the zzso Two crystal forms were zzso In crystal form I the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso as a zzso with unit cell zzso zzso to previously published zzso protein zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso domain from patient zzso identified significant differences in position of zzso in the zzso segments plus variations in framework region zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso differences can be seen along the two types of local zzso corresponding to the zzso and zzso zzso From the packing zzso a model for the zzso light chain zzso zzso is proposed based on a zzso spiral structure with a rise of approximately the zzso of two zzso per 360 degree zzso This spiral structure could be consistent with the dimensions of zzso zzso as determined by electron zzso
