X-ray crystal structures of two zzso analogue zzso bound to zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined to zzso and zzso A zzso These zzso zzso bind to the same site on the zzso approximately 35 A from the active zzso The common features of binding include a large zzso region and two hydrogen bonds between both oxygen atoms of a zzso group on the inhibitor and two main chain zzso nitrogen atoms of zzso and zzso on zzso The zzso site lies at the base of the thumb domain, near its interface with the zzso extension of zzso The location of this zzso site suggests that the binding of these zzso interferes with a zzso change essential for the activity of the zzso
