zzso zzso class zzso peptides can generate specific zzso zzso responses in zzso and are therefore often used as vaccines for patients with zzso However, only occasional objective clinical responses have been reported suggesting the necessity of zzso zzso help and possibly zzso for the induction of an effective zzso immunity in zzso The zzso gene encodes the cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso which is frequently expressed in a wide spectrum of zzso Both zzso and cellular immune responses against zzso have been described making zzso an attractive candidate for vaccine zzso 

zzso zzso was used to predict five zzso peptides with a high binding probability for six selected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are prevalent in the Caucasian zzso 

Using peripheral blood cells of 13 cancer patients and 5 healthy controls, the zzso zzso zzso was identified as an zzso with dual zzso for both zzso helper and zzso zzso T zzso This zzso also reacted with zzso zzso in the serum of a patient with breast zzso Most zzso zzso simultaneously induced specific zzso zzso and zzso responses in zzso 

zzso is the first zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses in zzso This zzso zzso represents an attractive vaccine candidate for the induction of effective zzso zzso
