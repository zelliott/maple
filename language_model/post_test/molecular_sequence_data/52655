The zzso zzso encodes both zzso and zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso zzso is more stable than the alpha zzso at zzso pH and zzso strength, despite its substantially higher charge density and truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Graham, zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso interactions could contribute to this unexpected finding, we have examined the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso as a function of zzso and zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso data suggest that, at zzso pH and zzso strength, the beta zzso binds roughly 2 zzso of zzso or a single equivalent of zzso with moderate zzso Under comparable conditions, the alpha zzso apparently binds just 1 zzso of zzso and essentially no zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that the bound zzso zzso occupy the zzso zzso In zzso M zzso at pH zzso the stability of the zzso exceeds that of the alpha zzso by approximately zzso zzso at 37 degrees C and by approximately zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso The latter value represents a substantial fraction of the difference in zzso free energies measured in zzso for the two zzso zzso however, these results do not completely explain the paradoxical stability of the beta zzso which maintains its higher melting temperature under all conditions zzso
