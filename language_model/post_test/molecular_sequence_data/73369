The zzso are the cells responsible for bone zzso zzso zzso zzso appear crucial for this zzso To identify possible zzso expression in zzso we amplified zzso zzso fragments having zzso with zzso zzso and used them as a probe to screen a rabbit zzso zzso zzso We obtained a zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 582 zzso acids that showed more than zzso identity to human, zzso and rat zzso 1 zzso zzso a cell surface zzso believed to trigger cancer cell zzso By northern zzso zzso was found to be highly expressed in zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso and bone zzso cells, as well as with various zzso In zzso zzso on bone sections showed that zzso is expressed also in zzso in zzso zzso recognizing zzso reacted with specific plasma membrane areas corresponding to zzso and zzso involved, respectively, in migratory and attachment activities of the zzso These observations highlight how cells might bring zzso into contact with focal points of the zzso zzso and are compatible with a role of zzso in migratory and attachment activities of the zzso
