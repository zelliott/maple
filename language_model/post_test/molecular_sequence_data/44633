The zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso is a newly discovered zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, responses to a novel zzso zzso zzso were investigated in the systemic vascular bed of the zzso zzso induced zzso decrease in systemic zzso pressure when injected in doses of zzso zzso zzso In terms of relative zzso activity, zzso was comparable in potency to zzso The decreases in systemic zzso pressure in response to zzso were not altered by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a dose that reduced responses to zzso The results of the present study show that zzso responses to zzso are not zzso by the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and are not dependent on the presence of zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso
