zzso T cells undergo programmed cell death zzso or zzso when cultured without the appropriate zzso The zzso zzso zzso beta converting zzso zzso is implicated in zzso based on its structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the induction of zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso T cell line expresses ICE but not zzso zzso Interestingly, ICE zzso and protein levels increase during zzso Yet zzso of ICE zzso activity zzso zzso with either of two zzso ICE zzso does not abrogate or delay zzso following zzso zzso as measured by DNA fragmentation and zzso Our results suggest that ICE is not required for zzso in zzso T zzso
