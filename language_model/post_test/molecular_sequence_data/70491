We characterized an zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso of zzso zzso which is involved in the development of the central nervous system and zzso zzso At the early zzso stage of zzso zzso expression is first detected zzso in the neural zzso By the zzso stage, expression is localized zzso in the nerve zzso and also begins in the zzso During the late zzso stage, the zzso neural expression becomes zzso segmented zzso and is then zzso except in the cerebral zzso at the anterior end of the central nervous zzso Within the cerebral zzso zzso is expressed in a broad zzso domain, probably zzso both the floor plate and zzso plate zzso this pattern is comparable to zzso expression in the mouse zzso In the anterior part of the gut, expression becomes intense in the zzso (the right wall of the zzso which is the presumed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso More zzso there is zzso expression in the zzso and zzso In sum, the present results help to support zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso between the zzso cerebral zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
