Fusion of viral and cellular zzso by the envelope zzso zzso effects entry of zzso into the zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso into zzso and zzso which remain zzso zzso zzso to both zzso and a zzso leads to the zzso changes in zzso needed for membrane zzso We used X-ray zzso to determine the structure of the zzso part of a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso coiled zzso in place of the zzso fusion zzso The core of the zzso is found to be an extended, zzso zzso coiled zzso with the zzso zzso at its zzso A zzso zzso packs in the reverse direction against the outside of the coiled zzso placing the zzso and zzso zzso near each other at one end of the long zzso These features, and the existence of a similar reversal of chain direction in the fusion zzso zzso of influenza virus zzso and in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso suggest a common mechanism for initiating zzso
