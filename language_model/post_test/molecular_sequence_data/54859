zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso toxin and the toxin zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having the largest contribution to zzso disease, is zzso by the zzso protein zzso and activated by the zzso zzso regulator zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism by which zzso controls zzso of the zzso zzso zzso repression and binding were characterized by using a promoter zzso series, gel mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso zzso regions found to be important for zzso repression correlated with in zzso zzso Four main zzso binding regions are present at zzso One region zzso the zzso zzso binding site and extends upstream, another zzso the zzso zzso binding site around the zzso element, and the remaining two are located adjacent to one another downstream of the zzso start zzso Competition for binding to the overlapping zzso binding sites was observed in gel mobility shift zzso where zzso was found to zzso zzso from the zzso promoter zzso In addition, regulatory differences between the zzso and zzso promoters were zzso zzso was found to have a higher relative binding affinity for the zzso promoter than for the zzso promoter in zzso In contrast to zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, zzso zzso of zzso did not require the zzso domain of the zzso of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso regulation of zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso is mechanistically zzso and this may lead to important differences in the expression of these zzso zzso
