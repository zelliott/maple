A novel zzso designated as strain zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected from a zzso river valley in zzso county, Yunnan province, zzso China and was subjected to zzso zzso zzso The zzso produced zzso smooth, red to black zzso colonies zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso medium lacked zzso and cells zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid in the zzso zzso and contained zzso zzso and zzso as the main zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences clearly showed that strain zzso zzso formed a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso and was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the result of zzso zzso between strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this isolate represented a different zzso species in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso data showed the differentiation of strain zzso zzso from its closest zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso
