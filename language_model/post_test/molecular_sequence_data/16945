zzso of zzso zzso zzso results in the production of diverse zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into their synthesis in zzso are reported here through molecular studies in the fruit fly, zzso zzso Two zzso zzso gene products are implicated in initiating zzso of these important zzso zzso We find zzso is a zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso and harbors zzso activity toward zzso and zzso is a zzso that converts zzso to zzso To assess their relative roles in the cellular production of zzso we zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular synthesis of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells and transgenic flies results in a significant reduction of zzso zzso whereas depletion of zzso either alpha or beta zzso or both, does not decrease zzso synthesis but instead increases its production, possibly by expanding zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of an zzso zzso results in significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso production depends on the zzso zzso activity of zzso and is increased in transgenic flies zzso zzso Our studies reveal that zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso pools directly impinge on higher zzso zzso and that the major route of zzso synthesis depends on the activities of zzso and zzso but not zzso thereby challenging the role of zzso in the genesis of higher zzso zzso
