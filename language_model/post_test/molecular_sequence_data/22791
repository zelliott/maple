We have shown that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso linked to the truncated zzso domain of zzso zzso as a carrier for zzso induced rapid zzso in human zzso and zzso cell zzso Here, we report that human and rat zzso lines containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were induced into zzso by exposure to this zzso called zzso The zzso was comparatively nontoxic to zzso zzso human and rat zzso cell lines containing zzso zzso and zzso normal human peripheral zzso blood stem zzso Degree of sensitivity to the zzso correlated directly with the level of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso was zzso by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso and zzso V zzso in human zzso cells in zzso and in a zzso zzso zzso zzso rat model using zzso delivery in zzso The mechanism of cell death by this zzso was solely through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso membrane zzso expression in zzso cells but no significant increase in zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso function for inducing zzso zzso in zzso which express sufficient quantities of zzso zzso or zzso zzso may be restored or zzso respectively, by a zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso regulatory domain zzso zzso may serve as a zzso model for the development of new zzso agents with unique selectivity for zzso cancer cells and it can be successfully delivered in zzso into a brain tumor by a zzso delivery system, which zzso the zzso zzso
