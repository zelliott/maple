zzso zzso was previously isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso We cloned the gene and corresponding zzso for zzso in order to characterize the zzso in the context of zzso zzso and zzso From the zzso zzso zzso was deduced to have zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso shared zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso from zzso zzso indicating that the gene belongs to a novel zzso of zzso zzso However, the organization of the zzso zzso which has eight zzso and seven zzso differed completely to that of zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that the level of zzso zzso expression increased when zzso was used as sole carbon zzso These results suggest that zzso has been well zzso during the evolution of zzso as a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso starting from zzso
