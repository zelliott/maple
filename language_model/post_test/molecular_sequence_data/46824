zzso is a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso and has two zzso The first is a type I zzso zzso the second, detected by zzso with an zzso gene probe, has been zzso identified as a defective type I zzso The cassette region of the first zzso has now been fully zzso and contains three zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two open reading frames of unknown zzso In addition, sequencing of a region downstream from the zzso 5 gene cluster of the first zzso revealed a copy of zzso sequence zzso flanked by zzso copies of sequence from the zzso insert zzso of zzso This arrangement is similar to that found in zzso of zzso The coincidence of an zzso gene and mobile elements on a zzso zzso has potential implications for the spread of zzso drug resistance, though evidence of zzso movement zzso by these elements has not been zzso
