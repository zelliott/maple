For the first time, zzso elements were found in insect zzso zzso zzso elements were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso They were zzso zzso long, flanked by two zzso zzso repeats, and were able to zzso a putative zzso acid zzso These elements were present in about 30 copies in the zzso zzso zzso but their distribution among closely related zzso and zzso zzso was zzso DNA and zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso showed greater similarity to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso than to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The possibility of horizontal transfer was investigated by examination of a host for zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso elements were found in this zzso but they were not very similar to the zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso formed a group with those of zzso suggesting vertical transmission from a common zzso
