The nuclear pore complex mediates the transport of zzso across the nuclear envelope zzso The zzso nuclear pore protein zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is suggested to interact with the zzso membrane and to be required for nuclear zzso The highly zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is predicted to contain an zzso motif zzso zzso Due to its low level of sequence zzso with other zzso zzso the zzso and zzso motifs have not been identified in its primary zzso In the present study, we solved the crystal structure of the zzso domain of mouse zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso adopts the characteristic zzso zzso as in other reported zzso zzso The structure allowed us to locate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among the zzso motif zzso those on the zzso surface are different from those of the zzso zzso zzso while those buried in the zzso core are highly zzso The zzso domain forms a zzso in the zzso in accordance with zzso zzso zzso The zzso surface of the zzso domain, with its zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso mainly by zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the zzso strand of one zzso zzso is sandwiched by the aromatic zzso of zzso in the zzso strand and zzso in the zzso strand of the other zzso zzso in the zzso This structure reveals a new zzso mode of the zzso zzso
