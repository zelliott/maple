The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso major outer membrane proteins that are considered unique to the zzso agent of zzso zzso and the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, however, we found an zzso gene in zzso zzso that was remarkably zzso among zzso zzso strains from human zzso zzso zzso patients, zzso and a horse from various regions in the United States, but the gene was different in a sheep isolate from the United zzso The zzso gene in the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was a zzso gene and was located downstream of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso gene zzso The zzso gene was expressed by zzso zzso in the blood from zzso patients zzso and zzso and by zzso zzso zzso from these patients cultured in zzso cells at 37 degrees zzso The zzso gene was also expressed in a zzso mouse infected by attaching ticks infected with strain zzso and in a horse zzso infected by attaching strain zzso zzso However, the transcript of the zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso in zzso mice and zzso zzso ticks infected with strain zzso These results indicate that zzso is functional in various strains of zzso zzso and relative expression ratios of zzso to zzso vary in different infected zzso These findings may be important in understanding roles that zzso proteins play in zzso zzso infection and evolution of the zzso major outer membrane protein gene families in zzso zzso
