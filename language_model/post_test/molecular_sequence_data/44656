An 18 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was found previously in zzso particles suspended in the culture medium and in the zzso of cell clusters of carrot zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in the zzso spaces of carrot seeds, being located both in the zzso and at the inner edge of the zzso We zzso zzso by washing the zzso particles with the mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso We determined several partial zzso acid zzso and then we cloned and zzso a zzso for zzso zzso was found to consist of 133 zzso acid zzso that included a signal zzso but it did not contain zzso sites for zzso zzso or zzso zzso Since its sequence was found to be zzso to that of zzso of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso was renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed in zzso was also found in an zzso form in zzso cell zzso zzso prepared from the culture medium of carrot cells inhibited commercial zzso zzso and a zzso extracted from zzso carrot zzso The expression of the gene for zzso was detected in developing seeds, and the level of its transcript was markedly enhanced upon treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso
