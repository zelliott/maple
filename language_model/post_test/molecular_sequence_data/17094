Universal protein networks zzso from bacteria to animals dictate the core functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso that plays a pivotal role in a broad spectrum of cellular zzso reactions such as zzso acid, zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso However, the in zzso cellular regulation mechanisms of zzso and another key zzso zzso zzso zzso remain zzso This study aimed to examine the universal protein regulatory network by utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso data, and zzso zzso Here we report a novel human zzso henceforth referred to as zzso which interacts with zzso and activates zzso zzso enhances zzso activity through the activated zzso and more directly on its zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso function, and ubiquitous cellular zzso of the zzso zzso complex were zzso among zzso coli, zzso and zzso In the rat brain, zzso zzso was enriched in the zzso and the zzso Further, the linkage of the zzso complex to calcium signaling was demonstrated by its interactive zzso within the zzso signaling complex, by zzso and zzso activity of zzso and by zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that the zzso complex is a common mechanism zzso in zzso bacterial cell metabolism and zzso zzso cell zzso This is the first report of an zzso of zzso and zzso a function novel to zzso
