zzso E zzso an zzso zzso plays a significant role in the metabolism of zzso It lowers plasma zzso levels by acting as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso in addition to playing a role in promoting zzso cholesterol zzso in zzso zzso The objective of this study is to examine the effect of zzso modification on the structure and function of rat zzso and to determine the sites and nature of modification by mass zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso which is generated zzso as one of the products of zzso zzso and is present in the environment in pollutants such as tobacco smoke and heated zzso In initial studies, zzso zzso was identified by zzso using an zzso specific zzso in the plasma of zzso old male rats that were exposed to filtered air zzso or low doses of environmental tobacco smoke zzso While both groups displayed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso group had higher levels in the zzso fraction compared with the zzso zzso This observation provided the rationale to further investigate the effect of zzso modification on rat zzso at a molecular zzso Treatment of zzso rat zzso with a zzso zzso excess of zzso resulted in zzso a significant decrease in zzso and cholesterol zzso abilities, zzso impairment in the zzso and zzso capabilities, and zzso significant zzso in the overall stability of the zzso The disruption in the functional abilities is attributed directly or indirectly to zzso modification yielding an zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso at position zzso zzso as determined by zzso laser zzso of zzso of flight mass zzso zzso zzso The loss of function may also be attributed to zzso in the overall fold of the protein as noted by changes in the zzso zzso unfolding pattern and to protein zzso Overall, disruption of the structural and functional integrity of zzso by zzso modification of essential zzso zzso by zzso is expected to affect its role in maintaining plasma cholesterol zzso and lead to zzso in zzso zzso
