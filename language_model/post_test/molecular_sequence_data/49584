zzso signals play key roles in zzso and zzso through the zzso of cell fate and zzso zzso proteins are implicated in the zzso - zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso signals to the zzso zzso Here, we identified and characterized zzso gene by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso was truncated in the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso was determined in zzso by adding zzso position zzso of zzso onto the zzso of zzso zzso gene consists of 27 zzso and gives rise to four zzso zzso due to alternative zzso of alternative promoter type as well as of cassette zzso zzso zzso gene was linked to the zzso gene on human zzso zzso with an zzso less than 1 zzso zzso zzso was expressed in fetal heart, adult zzso eye, spinal cord, zzso zzso zzso and also in glioblastoma, zzso melanoma, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was a zzso protein with zzso zzso and zzso zzso which showed zzso zzso identity with zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso it was concluded that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins constitute the zzso zzso zzso
