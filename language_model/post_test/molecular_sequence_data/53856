A zzso salt zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we describe for the first time cloning and analysis of the gene zzso zzso zzso in a member of the zzso zzso The zzso has a native molecular weight of 125,000 to zzso and a zzso molecular weight of zzso as determined from the deduced zzso acid zzso indicating that the zzso is a zzso The pH optimum of zzso zzso zzso is between 5 and 7, and the temperature optimum is 40 degrees zzso The zzso is strongly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso indicating that a zzso zzso is likely to be involved in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso can zzso all six major human zzso zzso and at least two animal zzso zzso A slight preference for zzso zzso acids was detected based on both the specificity and the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was determined and used for zzso studies, transcript analysis, and construction and analysis of various zzso The levels of zzso with zzso of other bacteria and with zzso V zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso On the basis of the similarity of zzso and zzso whose crystal structure has been zzso zzso can be classified as an zzso zzso zzso with zzso as the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was confirmed by the fact that a zzso exchange by zzso zzso resulted in an inactive zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso is part of an zzso containing at least two zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and one spontaneous zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso cultures and zzso These zzso had point zzso that zzso zzso by premature zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso
