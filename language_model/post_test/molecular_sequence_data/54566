Methane was the most abundant hydrocarbon released during the 2010 zzso Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of zzso Beyond zzso to this anthropogenic event, this methane release simulates a rapid and relatively short-term natural release from zzso into deep zzso Based on methane and oxygen zzso measured at zzso stations throughout the affected region, we find that within zzso days from the onset of release zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of oxygen were zzso primarily by zzso and left behind a residual microbial community containing zzso zzso We suggest that a vigorous zzso bacterial bloom zzso nearly all the released methane within this time, and that by zzso large-scale releases of methane from zzso in the deep ocean are likely to be met by a similarly rapid zzso zzso
