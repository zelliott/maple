In both humans and mice, a zzso of zzso protein B zzso is associated with a decreased concentration of mature zzso and zzso of a larger zzso zzso zzso zzso which is not observed under normal zzso Isolation of zzso zzso from the lungs of children who died with two different zzso zzso yielded pure zzso and showed only trace amounts of mature zzso zzso of the zzso zzso structure revealed a zzso zzso zzso segment, followed by a zzso segment that is identical to mature zzso The zzso structure determined zzso is similar to that of a proposed late intermediate in the processing of zzso suggesting that zzso is the immediate precursor of zzso In zzso zzso fluid from transgenic mice with a focal zzso of zzso zzso was detected in the zzso active, large zzso fraction and was associated with membrane structures that are typical for a large zzso zzso However, unlike zzso zzso exhibited a very poor ability to promote zzso zzso gave high surface tension during zzso film zzso and did not bind zzso in zzso zzso is thus capable of zzso with zzso zzso but its zzso zzso segment must be zzso removed to generate a biologically functional zzso The results of this study indicate that the early zzso fatal respiratory distress seen in zzso children is combined with the near absence of active zzso of zzso
