The temperature dependence of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso buffer at pH 7 under different zzso of zzso and in the presence or absence of zzso M zzso was zzso All registered structural changes are the result of zzso processes if the zzso of the zzso is low (about zzso zzso zzso and zzso exist in the only two forms, transforming into each other: under low temperatures they exist as zzso with the parallel or zzso orientation of chains accordingly which transform into unfolded chains when the temperature zzso In contrast zzso exists in the three different forms depending on the temperature and zzso zzso They are: the three- stranded clip, the zzso hairpin with a single stranded zzso and completely unfolded zzso For the first time this work presents zzso parameters of the triplex formation from zzso depending on zzso zzso We have registered the CD zzso to one-, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso was investigated, and it was established that molecules of the dye may zzso into the zzso with formation of stable complexes (the constant of association zzso zzso It is maximum three molecules of zzso zzso which may bound to one zzso of the zzso zzso It has been shown that the suggested synthetic model (three zzso blocks combined by zzso zzso is the most convenient for zzso investigations of zzso zzso
