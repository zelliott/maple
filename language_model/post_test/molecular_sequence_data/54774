Land plants and algae form a zzso the zzso believed to be zzso We report the results of an analysis of the zzso of putative zzso in the currently available zzso to bacterial and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso and zzso zzso with the land plant zzso having group 2 zzso zzso except for the unexpected occurrence of two group 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that plant zzso zzso are related to zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso We sought to define the bacterial groups, whose ancestors shared the precursors of zzso zzso via zzso and zzso analyses based on zzso alignment of representative sets of bacterial zzso zzso zzso and group 1 and 2 zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso and group 1 zzso zzso could have originated from the horizontal gene transfers zzso that accompanied the two generally accepted zzso of a zzso and a zzso with a zzso zzso In contrast, the origin of the group 2 zzso zzso unexpectedly appears to involve zzso from a zzso ancestral to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, although zzso positions and zzso are mostly zzso among the land plant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are absent in the zzso zzso genes and zzso positions and zzso are highly variable in their zzso zzso Thus, zzso are irrelevant to zzso evolution in zzso
