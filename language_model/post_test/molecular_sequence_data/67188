zzso zzso are a class of zzso that regulate many aspects of plant growth and development processes including stem zzso zzso and seed zzso A novel zzso zzso designated as zzso was identified using zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso expressed in a zzso and time zzso manner with minimum expression at 1 zzso zzso and maximum expression at 50 zzso zzso starting from 30 zzso and peaked at 24 h after zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso at transcript level while no significant effect was observed for other zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli with zzso zzso tag and the zzso protein migrated at 38 zzso slightly larger than the predicted 29 zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso with a protein of 40 zzso in rice leaf zzso zzso expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and zzso In zzso zzso and zzso promoter analysis revealed that zzso expressed in shoot zzso zzso and young primary zzso Northern zzso Western zzso and zzso activities revealed that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso rice expressing zzso in zzso orientation exhibited severely affected zzso and zzso zzso The transgenic plants were zzso short compared to zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to zzso and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in zzso growth and development of zzso
