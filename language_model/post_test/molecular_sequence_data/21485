zzso is an interesting zzso zzso for the brewing industry, as it efficiently zzso zzso a sugar often remaining partly unused during beer zzso It has been shown that on zzso the expression level of zzso is much higher in ale strains than in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso the zzso particularly in the ale zzso In the present study the regulatory elements of the zzso promoter of one ale and two zzso strains were identified by zzso zzso zzso regions up to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene were zzso from the three zzso zzso strains and the laboratory zzso strain zzso The promoter sequence of the laboratory strain was identical to the zzso promoter of strain zzso of the zzso Genome zzso whereas the promoter sequences of the industrial strains zzso markedly from the zzso zzso The zzso promoter regions of the ale and zzso strains were for the most part identical to each other, except for one 22 zzso deletion and two 94 and 95 zzso insertions in the ale zzso zzso analyses of promoter elements revealed that the promoter sequences contained several zzso and zzso binding sites, as was zzso However, some of the zzso and zzso binding sites were located on the two insertions of the ale strain, and thus offered a plausible explanation for the different expression pattern of the zzso gene in the ale zzso zzso functional analysis of zzso ale and A15 zzso strain zzso promoters fused to zzso zzso the green fluorescent zzso showed a significant difference in the ability of these two promoters to drive zzso zzso Under the control of the zzso promoter of the ale strain the emergence of zzso was strongly induced by zzso whereas only a low level of zzso was detected with the construct carrying the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso Thus, the extra zzso binding element, present in the zzso promoter of the ale strain, appears to be necessary to reach a high level of induction by zzso Both zzso promoters were zzso by zzso but their zzso was different, possibly due to a distinct distribution of zzso elements in these two zzso
