zzso zzso is a potent zzso for Swiss zzso cells, but the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly zzso Here, we report that addition of zzso zzso a rapid and transient zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso zzso peaked at 5 zzso and was zzso after 30 zzso of incubation with zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso was comparable to that induced by zzso and zzso growth zzso As zzso strongly induced zzso of the major protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso in either intact or zzso cells, we examined whether zzso could be involved in zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso by zzso was dependent on zzso activity as shown by zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso by prolonged treatment of Swiss zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso by zzso was markedly inhibited by treatment with zzso zzso implicating a G zzso of the zzso zzso in the action of zzso zzso rapid zzso of a downstream target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also required zzso and a zzso zzso G zzso In addition, zzso zzso was dependent on a zzso protein in Swiss zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso and DNA synthesis in secondary cultures of mouse zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso As G proteins link many cell surface receptors to zzso zzso we zzso therefore, that zzso could bind to a zzso that mediates at least some of its biological effects in Swiss zzso cells and mouse zzso zzso
