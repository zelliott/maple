The extreme process condition of high temperature and high zzso limits the applications of most of natural zzso in pulp and paper zzso Recently, various methods of protein engineering have been used to improve the zzso and zzso tolerance of zzso In this work, directed evolution and zzso zzso were performed to obtain a zzso zzso improved both on zzso stability and zzso from the native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with two units increased in the optimum pH zzso zzso zzso and significant improvement on zzso stability was selected from the second round of zzso zzso And the further zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso increased in the optimum temperature zzso was then obtained by introducing a zzso bridge zzso and a single zzso acid substitution zzso to zzso using zzso zzso zzso also showed higher zzso and zzso efficiency zzso cat zzso m ) than that of zzso zzso and zzso The attractive improved properties make zzso more suitable for zzso of cotton stalk pulp under the extreme process condition of high temperature zzso and high zzso zzso zzso
