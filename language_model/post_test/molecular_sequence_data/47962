The number of publications documenting the utility of zzso zzso zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso for the analysis of biological molecules has increased in geometric proportion spanning diverse areas of zzso Currently, we are investigating the capabilities of zzso to zzso relative molecular zzso zzso of zzso an area which has not been explored zzso We present here the results of an investigation of a zzso system utilizing zzso heart zzso c zzso as the zzso and bovine heart zzso c zzso as a constant concentration internal zzso As these compounds are relatively large ( approximately 12 zzso they will become multiply charged during the zzso zzso Using appropriate solution and instrument conditions, the zzso and zzso charge states were enhanced for both zzso c zzso We report that using the average of the zzso zzso for the two charge states observed for each species, the linear curve zzso ratio vs concentration zzso had a dynamic range of zzso zzso zzso orders of zzso Linear zzso zzso analysis zzso of these averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso yielded the equation y zzso zzso + zzso The slope of the line with its calculated precision, reported as one standard zzso is zzso zzso zzso which is statistically ideal zzso equal to zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso of the two individual charge states were significantly different zzso the slope of the zzso + zzso + zzso peak intensity ratio vs zzso ratio data was zzso zzso zzso and the slope of the zzso + zzso + zzso data was zzso zzso zzso We attribute this difference to the variation in primary zzso acid sequence for the two zzso c zzso Both have 104 zzso zzso but there are three zzso zzso between zzso and zzso one of the zzso zzso an additional basic site to zzso While this extra basic zzso may imply an additional charging site, the low charge states observed under the solution conditions employed indicate that most zzso basic sites are not zzso However, the extra basic site also renders zzso slightly more zzso These results present significant considerations when choosing internal standards for the zzso of large proteins by zzso and demonstrate that relative molecular zzso signals in zzso can be used to zzso zzso species in the zzso zzso
