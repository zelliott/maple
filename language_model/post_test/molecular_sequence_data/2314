The zzso open reading frame of human zzso type 16 zzso has been shown to be selectively retained in cervical tumors and to zzso both transforming and zzso functions in zzso cells, supporting the notion that expression of zzso contributes towards the progression of zzso cervical zzso A comparison among zzso sequences of different zzso types reveals some zzso at the zzso acid zzso Of particular interest are two regions, one which contains significant zzso to a region of zzso zzso and zzso virus 40 large T zzso and a second region which contains two zzso zzso zzso To determine the importance of these zzso to the function of the zzso zzso a series of zzso carrying zzso at zzso acids in the region of zzso zzso and at the zzso motifs were zzso The zzso zzso sequences were placed under the control of a strong zzso promoter zzso long terminal zzso and the activity of the zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cells, a cell line in which both the transforming function and the zzso function of zzso could be zzso A single zzso acid substitution analogous to a zzso in zzso which destroys the transforming ability of this protein abolished both transformation and zzso by zzso zzso at the zzso motifs demonstrated that this region contributes to the transforming potential of zzso although proteins in which both motifs were interrupted retained a low level of transforming zzso zzso in the region of zzso zzso which occur within a recognition sequence for zzso zzso II did not markedly affect transforming activity of zzso but severely reduced zzso zzso This indicates that efficient zzso is not required for transformation by zzso zzso in these zzso
