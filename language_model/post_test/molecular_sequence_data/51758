zzso zzso is a useful fluorescent probe to study the interaction of zzso zzso with the B4 zzso from zzso zzso seeds zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso leads to a zzso increase in zzso zzso with a zzso 10 zzso blue shift in its zzso zzso The strong binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 20 degrees zzso is due to a zzso zzso contribution to the association zzso Among the other zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso followed by Me alpha zzso are the best zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso 469 and 130 times weaker zzso respectively, as compared to zzso whereas zzso is about zzso times more potent than zzso indicating that zzso at the zzso position of zzso have a considerable influence on the binding zzso zzso orientation of the zzso group at zzso and zzso orientation at zzso as in zzso are important for the interaction with zzso The zzso zzso group is not zzso The binding site of the zzso is directed exclusively towards zzso zzso Interestingly enough, despite its preference for Me alpha zzso over Me beta zzso in zzso the zzso prefers terminal zzso zzso as compared to the zzso zzso
