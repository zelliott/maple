zzso receptors are innate immune molecules recognizing and inducing the clearance of zzso as well as modified host zzso To recognize a wide pattern of invading zzso many scavenger receptors bind to common zzso molecular patterns, such as zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso a member of the human scavenger zzso zzso protein family, displays a wide zzso zzso The zzso motif zzso derived from its scavenger zzso zzso zzso is involved in some of these zzso but most of the recognition mechanisms are zzso In this study, we used mass zzso sequencing, gene zzso and zzso proteins to identify zzso zzso protein zzso as a recognition zzso of zzso zzso against zzso are shown to protect against zzso zzso infection, but no function or host zzso have been identified for the zzso zzso belongs to the zzso repeat zzso family of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with truncated forms of the zzso proteins confirmed that the zzso region is needed in the binding of zzso to zzso The same motif of two other zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso forsythia, also zzso binding to zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso binding occurred with peptides containing the zzso zzso but also peptides devoid of the zzso motif inhibited binding of zzso zzso These results thus suggest that the zzso zzso motif in bacterial proteins serves as a novel pattern recognition motif for unique core peptides of human scavenger zzso zzso
