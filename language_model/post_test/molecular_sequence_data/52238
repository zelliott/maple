We have cloned and zzso zzso the nuclear gene for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso c zzso This zzso which was previously not found in zzso c zzso zzso from zzso zzso has a deduced zzso acid sequence which is zzso identical to the sequences of zzso zzso of bovine and human zzso c zzso The zzso copy of zzso was replaced with a zzso copy of zzso in which the coding region for the suspected zzso zzso zzso was replaced with the zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso deletion strain grew poorly at room temperature and was unable to grow at 37 degrees C on zzso zzso whereas growth was normal at both temperatures on zzso This zzso petite zzso of the deletion strain was zzso to zzso growth with a single copy zzso carrying zzso zzso c zzso activity in zzso zzso from the zzso deletion strain is decreased to zzso of that in zzso from the zzso parent, and this activity is restored to normal when the zzso deletion strain is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso deletion strain revealed that zzso zzso zzso c zzso is assembled at room temperature and at 37 degrees C, although the zzso a + zzso zzso is diminished approximately zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the protein zzso by zzso is identical to the zzso sequence of a zzso found in zzso zzso c zzso zzso by a new procedure zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso c zzso which is essential during assembly for full zzso c zzso activity but apparently can be removed after the zzso is zzso with retention of zzso zzso This is the first instance in which deletion of a zzso of zzso c zzso results in assembly of zzso zzso zzso c zzso but having markedly diminished zzso
