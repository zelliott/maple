zzso similarities exist between terminal zzso repeats zzso of some miniature zzso zzso element zzso families isolated from a wide range of organisms, including plants, insects, and humans, and zzso of DNA zzso from the zzso zzso We present here evidence that one of these zzso families, previously described for zzso zzso is derived from a larger element zzso a putative zzso We have named this novel class II zzso zzso We show that its putative product is related to zzso of the zzso zzso being closer to the zzso zzso A similar truncated element was found in a tomato DNA zzso indicating an ancient origin and/or horizontal transfer for this family of zzso These results are reminiscent of those recently reported for the human zzso where other members of the zzso family, named zzso are believed to be responsible for the generation of abundant zzso elements in an early zzso zzso These results further suggest that some zzso families, which are highly reiterated in plant, zzso and human zzso could have arisen from a similar zzso implicating zzso zzso
