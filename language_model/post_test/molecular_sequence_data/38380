The liver is the first target organ for malaria zzso immediately after the bite of an infected zzso We studied local zzso of malaria DNA vaccines at the site of the liver using a gene gun as a useful tool for in zzso zzso of foreign zzso A malaria DNA vaccine consisting of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso gene plus the mouse zzso gene was bombarded directly by a gene gun into mouse liver once or into the skin zzso A marked protective effect was induced by gene zzso into the liver (more than zzso compared with that into the skin (less than zzso A zzso immune response and high production of zzso were observed in the zzso zzso from mice bombarded into the liver, resulting in more effective protection compared with those bombarded into the zzso These results provide an important implication on the development of efficient malaria vaccine zzso
