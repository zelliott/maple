zzso zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of plants and zzso The zzso zzso zzso this zzso was isolated from a wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso library, and its deduced zzso acid sequence found to show zzso sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso The deduced zzso consists of 325 zzso acids zzso zzso contains a zzso motif for the binding of zzso zzso a zzso required for zzso activity, and an zzso region of 37 zzso acid zzso resembling zzso transit zzso The identity of zzso was further demonstrated through zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso zzso by expression of the wheat zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso is highly expressed in green zzso and zzso zzso and in the roots of zzso as well as in the leaves of several plant zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that the gene exists as a single copy in the wheat zzso zzso plants transformed with zzso in the sense orientation zzso zzso or zzso orientation zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso promoter, showed high levels of zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity in transgenic plants was determined, and found to be three- to fivefold higher in sense plants than in control plants, but unaffected in zzso zzso zzso experiments with toxic levels of hydrogen zzso zzso gas showed that while sense zzso were highly zzso control and zzso plants were severely damaged by the zzso
