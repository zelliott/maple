Liver X zzso zzso is known to promote zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso zzso X zzso zzso a previously known zzso zzso could mediate a zzso zzso zzso by zzso the free fatty acid zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study is to investigate further the role of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice were used to study the regulation of zzso and other zzso zzso genes and the implication of this regulation in zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma were zzso and their respective regulation by zzso and zzso was investigated by combinations of zzso binding and reporter gene zzso 

We showed that genetic zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso analysis established zzso as a novel zzso target of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso was largely abolished in zzso zzso zzso We also showed that zzso a positive regulator of zzso is a zzso target of zzso suggesting that zzso can regulate zzso directly or through its zzso of zzso Interestingly, both zzso zzso regulation and zzso zzso regulation are liver zzso 

We conclude that zzso is a shared target of zzso zzso and zzso The network of zzso regulation by zzso zzso and zzso establishes this free fatty acid zzso as a common target of orphan nuclear receptors in their mediation of zzso zzso
