The emergence of zzso is closely associated to the evolution of zzso bone zzso However, the molecular basis underlying the origin and subsequent diversification of the skeletal zzso zzso is still poorly zzso One efficient way to tackle this issue is to compare the zzso between zzso species, of zzso genes coding for bone zzso zzso In this work, we have focused on the evolution of the network forming collagen family which contains the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso reveal that these three zzso are zzso and derive from two independent zzso in the zzso zzso To shed light on the evolution of this family, we have analyzed the zzso expression of the network forming zzso in zzso and zzso skeletal elements of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso express zzso a gene strongly expressed in zzso in zzso but not in zzso In addition, while zzso is known to be robustly expressed in zzso zzso the expression levels of its zzso zzso are dramatically zzso Our work reveals that while a skeletal expression of network forming collagen members is widespread throughout zzso zzso from divergent zzso lineages express different combinations of network forming collagen zzso
