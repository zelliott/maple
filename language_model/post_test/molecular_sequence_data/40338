zzso models for zzso interactions predict that viruses will cause zzso of microbial host zzso due to an arms race between resistance and zzso A new form of microbial resistance, zzso zzso regularly zzso short zzso zzso are a rapidly evolving, zzso immunity mechanism in which a short piece of invading viral DNA is inserted into the zzso zzso thereby rendering the host resistant to further zzso Few studies have linked this form of resistance to population dynamics in natural microbial zzso 

We examined sequence diversity in 39 strains of the zzso zzso zzso from a single, isolated hot spring from zzso Russia to determine the effects of zzso immunity on microbial population zzso First, multiple zzso genetic markers identify a large zzso group of identical zzso zzso with a diverse set of rare zzso Second, the zzso zzso zzso zzso split the large group of zzso into two very different groups and reveal extensive diversity and no evidence for dominance of a single clone within the zzso 

The zzso of resistance zzso found within this population of zzso zzso is indicative of a lack of strain dominance, in contrast to the prediction for a resistant strain in a simple zzso zzso Based on evidence for the independent acquisition of resistant zzso we zzso that zzso zzso zzso interference between resistant strains promotes and maintains diversity in this natural zzso
