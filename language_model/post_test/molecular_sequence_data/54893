zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor implicated in a wide range of zzso zzso including cellular survival, zzso gene expression and natural killer cell zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso acts as a zzso of zzso gene expression underlying the zzso of zzso zzso sensory zzso In this study we performed zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso technology zzso to reveal direct zzso and zzso target genes in an in zzso cell model for zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso promoter regions bound by zzso and zzso promoter regions bound by zzso Based on promoter analysis of zzso zzso we were able to redefine the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling and gene expression zzso analysis subsequently indicated that a large fraction zzso of zzso target genes were zzso silent, whereas zzso target genes in general were zzso zzso Only a small subset of zzso target genes also bound zzso zzso analysis indicated that a substantial number of zzso target genes share a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding zzso zzso analysis confirmed binding of zzso to zzso target zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso significantly reduced zzso outgrowth in zzso Together, our findings show that zzso is a general zzso zzso of basic zzso zzso zzso factors that control zzso zzso
