zzso group I zzso in zzso zzso zzso have been found in diverse groups of zzso In this work, we identified zzso group I zzso in six strains of marine zzso zzso zzso with sizes around 280 zzso were consistently obtained in all the strains zzso In a zzso analysis using the zzso sequence determined in this study with other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence was grouped together with the sequences from other zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso tree zzso from the zzso sequences clearly separates the different zzso zzso suggesting that each family has its own evolutionary zzso
