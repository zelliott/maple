The influence of zzso secondary structure on the zzso activity of a zzso length transcript for processing to circular zzso was studied in a nuclear extract from potato suspension zzso The nuclear extract was prepared according to a modified procedure for a plant zzso zzso The transcript of the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso with 17 additional zzso thus doubling most of the central zzso region of zzso of the zzso The transcript can assume four different secondary structures, which either co-exist as zzso in solution or can be kept as zzso structures after different treatments by temperature and/or zzso zzso The structures were zzso by zzso calculations and zzso gel zzso and were confirmed by zzso zzso Only the so-called extended middle structure was processed to exact zzso zzso In this structure the zzso and zzso are branching out from the zzso zzso structure at the loop starting with zzso zzso The other structures were processed only if they could be rearranged into the active zzso
