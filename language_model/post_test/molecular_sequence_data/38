To investigate the DNA zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake and those from the patients from zzso zzso 

Five zzso zzso were obtained from the wounds caused by earthquake of 5 zzso admitted into the West China Hospital, and 6 zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso of the same hospital during the same zzso DNA fingerprint zzso was obtained by repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis was conducted with the help of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Five different patterns zzso were found among the 11 zzso zzso The 5 strains isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake included zzso A zzso zzso 1), zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso 1), and zzso E zzso zzso zzso And the 6 zzso isolated from the patient that come from zzso areas included A zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso 1), zzso C zzso zzso 1), and zzso D zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake are highly zzso with those isolated from the patient from zzso areas during the same zzso
