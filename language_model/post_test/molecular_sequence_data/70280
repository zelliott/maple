The cell wall zzso of strains of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso partially zzso with acid, and the resulting zzso were reduced and zzso to yield zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these fragments by gas zzso zzso and of the intact zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso revealed the major structural features of the different zzso from representatives of the different zzso All of the zzso products contained a zzso segment of alternating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso segment consisted of three major zzso linear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso units zzso with either zzso zzso or the zzso zzso at both zzso zzso The recognition of these features in in zzso grown zzso zzso is an important zzso The zzso from strains of zzso contains a zzso motif composed of the linear zzso zzso attached to linear zzso zzso zzso The zzso segment of the zzso of zzso zzso is composed of linear zzso zzso units zzso in part at zzso with terminal zzso zzso The two representative strains of zzso also differed in the composition of the zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso units are zzso The reducing end of the zzso and therefore, apparently, of the entire zzso from all species from all zzso are apparently composed of the unit, zzso which, in turn, is apparently attached to zzso via zzso zzso
