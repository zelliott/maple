zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso and oxygen to zzso oxide and zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso The zzso consists of a central zzso sequence flanked on the zzso side by a zzso region that contains the zzso and zzso sites and on the zzso side by a region zzso with zzso zzso zzso By using domain boundaries defined by limited zzso of full-length zzso zzso zzso regions of rat brain zzso zzso oxide zzso were expressed and zzso Two proteins were made in high zzso one, corresponding to zzso zzso contained bound zzso and zzso and was able to bind zzso zzso or zzso the other, containing zzso zzso contained bound zzso but was unable to bind zzso zzso or zzso These results showed that rat brain zzso zzso oxide zzso contains a critical zzso for zzso binding between zzso 221 and zzso Limited zzso with zzso of the former protein resulted in a new species with an zzso zzso 275 that retained the ability to bind zzso further defining the critical region for zzso binding as being between 275 and zzso zzso of the sequences of zzso oxide zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso revealed a similarity in the region between zzso 470 and zzso suggesting that this might represent the core region of the zzso zzso The zzso of binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso were not more than zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that there might be a single zzso site per zzso
