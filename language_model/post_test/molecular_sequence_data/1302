zzso family organic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso proteins expressed predominantly in kidney and zzso These proteins mediate the zzso or zzso of numerous zzso (and zzso important compounds, and accordingly have been the focus of intensive zzso Here we investigate the molecular zzso of the zzso zzso identifying zzso in zzso and zzso zzso several of which are zzso zzso as well as reporting the cloning of a novel human family member, zzso expressed exclusively in liver in both zzso and zzso The latter helps define a zzso within the zzso which appears to have zzso and zzso members, raising potential issues with respect to the use of zzso as models for the transport of organic zzso (which include many zzso in zzso Although this zzso zzso could not be made on the basis of sequence zzso analysis of zzso phasing suggests that the zzso zzso and zzso lineages of the zzso family formed after the divergence of zzso and zzso zzso these lineages expanded through independent tandem zzso to produce multiple gene zzso After analyzing over 200 other zzso zzso we find such pairing to be relatively specific to zzso organic zzso and zzso zzso suggesting selection for gene pairing operating within this family in zzso This might reflect a requirement for zzso or broader zzso specificity in zzso zzso to zzso due to their greater zzso complexity and thus potentially broader exposure to organic zzso
