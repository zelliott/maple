In zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso complex zzso reportedly requires zzso of the zzso domain of P by zzso Two zzso zzso sites have been implicated in this zzso for both zzso Indiana and New Jersey zzso P zzso We show here that, in contrast to New Jersey, the Indiana P protein is zzso zzso on three sites in zzso The evidence rests on assessing the zzso status of zzso P gene zzso containing all possible combinations of Ala zzso at zzso zzso and zzso All zzso containing the zzso substitution showed a reduced level of zzso and yielded no zzso zzso the zzso zzso behaved like the triple substitution and displayed no significant zzso while the zzso zzso yielded no zzso zzso of zzso therefore depended on prior modification of zzso We also tested the ability of our zzso P proteins to convert to the more highly zzso zzso species, a modification essential for zzso in the New Jersey zzso and thought to be carried out by an zzso zzso All of our zzso zzso P proteins readily converted to zzso in the presence or absence of L zzso and the latter had no significant effect on P zzso We conclude that zzso Indiana P protein differs in significant ways from New Jersey zzso It is zzso and zzso zzso on a cluster of three sites, not two, suggesting that an additional zzso may be zzso Moreover, Indiana zzso to zzso conversion is independent of prior zzso zzso and does not require the presence of L zzso
