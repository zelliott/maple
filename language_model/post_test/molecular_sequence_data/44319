In zzso growth properties of three zzso cell lines were compared under a variety of culture zzso The zzso and zzso cell lines were each derived from embryonic zzso culture with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso large T zzso zzso while the A7 cell line was immortalized using zzso zzso large T zzso zzso immortalized with zzso zzso large T zzso at the zzso temperature, 33 degrees C, while growth is expected to be suppressed at the zzso temperature, zzso degrees zzso Both the zzso and zzso cell lines were capable of zzso at zzso degrees C continuously for up to 6 zzso All three cell lines showed no appreciable differences in growth rates related to temperature over a zzso period in either zzso or defined zzso zzso The percentage of cells in zzso of the cell cycle did not decrease or was elevated at zzso degrees C for all three cell zzso After 3 zzso at zzso degrees C, the three cell lines also showed positive zzso using two zzso zzso reacting with different zzso of zzso large T zzso Double strand DNA sequence analyses of a 300 base pair zzso zzso of the large T gene from each cell line, which included the zzso zzso revealed zzso in both the zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso cell line zzso zzso had reverted to wild type, and two additional zzso with zzso zzso with predicted zzso acid changes were also zzso While the zzso zzso of the zzso cells was zzso an additional zzso substitution with a predicted zzso acid change was zzso The A7 cell line sequence was identical to the reference zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso acid sequences in the zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso large T are not necessarily stable, and zzso temperature sensitivity of cell lines immortalized with zzso is not necessarily zzso
