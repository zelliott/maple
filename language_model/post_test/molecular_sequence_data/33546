zzso zzso uses zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso change zzso direction by changing the state of the zzso motor via a zzso referred to as the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso encodes four switch complex zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso instead of the more typical three of zzso coli or zzso zzso Our goal was to examine whether and how all four switch proteins participate in zzso Previous work determined that zzso was required for zzso and we extend those findings to show that all four switch proteins are necessary for normal numbers of zzso zzso Furthermore, while zzso and zzso are partially redundant with each other, both are needed for zzso levels of zzso We also report the isolation of an zzso zzso strain containing an zzso substitution in zzso resulting in bacteria that swim constantly and do not change zzso Along with data demonstrating that zzso interacts with zzso these findings suggest that zzso functions in zzso zzso much as it does in other zzso
