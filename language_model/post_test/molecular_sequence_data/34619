Three individual zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have zzso to bind to zzso disease virus zzso were identified by the zzso method using zzso display zzso The binding zzso of these peptides presented on zzso were confirmed by zzso competition zzso using chicken zzso zzso The synthetic peptides designed based on these results partially neutralized the infection of zzso in zzso The zzso identified here have the potential to lead to the identification of novel molecules that inhibit the zzso infection independent of the immune zzso
