This review starts with a description of certain features of zzso zzso and their DNA and zzso structures relevant to zzso control of zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequences of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso diverge in about 50% of the coding region, their five zzso and the zzso sizes of their genes are compatible with the proposition that they zzso from a single ancestral zzso Of particular note is their long zzso regions zzso which include a zzso sequence almost completely identical in the zzso and zzso of a range of zzso This motif near the cap region of the zzso which forms a specific zzso structure, provides for regulation of the translation of zzso and zzso zzso When zzso levels of zzso iron are not in zzso a large reserve of zzso and zzso is present in the cell zzso restrained from translation by a protein with an Mr of about zzso which binds to the zzso zzso When excess iron floods the zzso this zzso complex appears to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is now able to initiate zzso protein synthesis so that the dormant zzso become active and are transferred to the zzso The mechanism zzso the binding protein is regulated in response to iron is currently under zzso The regulatory protein occurs in the cell sap and is present in several interchangeable forms which appear to differ in the zzso state of specific zzso within the zzso Under some circumstances, the abundance of these forms appears to be altered by zzso iron zzso It is unclear how iron influences binding of the regulatory protein to zzso zzso Some investigators consider that iron binds in the form of zzso to the regulatory zzso for which they offer in zzso zzso We have examined the role of zzso versus zzso zzso iron in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso synthesis in rat zzso and zzso zzso By manipulating the flow of iron between the zzso zzso iron and zzso iron pools we have concluded that zzso iron can act as a regulator of zzso synthesis in a manner which is independent of zzso zzso This conclusion does not exclude a role for zzso in some specialized cell zzso
