We have isolated and zzso partial zzso clones that zzso zzso a zzso protein from zzso zzso A zzso library was constructed from the leaves of this plant and screened with synthetic zzso zzso representing various portions of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows the signal zzso and a coding region virtually accounting for the entire zzso acid sequence of zzso The sequence reveals regions of similarity to other zzso zzso especially in a region of the zzso where critical zzso acid zzso might participate in the active zzso
