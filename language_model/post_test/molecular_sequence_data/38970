zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso with mating zzso brings about responses that lead to cell zzso zzso stimulation does not, however, induce a continuous response as the cells become zzso to the presence of the zzso One mechanism that contributes to zzso in zzso is the release of a zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso requires a functional zzso zzso In this study, we report the first molecular characterization of the zzso protein and provide direct evidence that it is the zzso that degrades zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor that zzso an internal zzso event zzso by a zzso with specificity for basic zzso This generates a series of zzso active zzso fragments and an inactive zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso of the zzso and, although the zzso zzso is zzso it is required for the zzso zzso to attain zzso
