zzso zzso zzso is an important tool in the generation of zzso zzso for zzso purposes and in the uncovering of basic zzso zzso The affinity of zzso is known to play an important role for the resulting sensitivity of zzso zzso systems and in deciding whether a zzso zzso response will be zzso With zzso as a carrier protein and a zzso zzso zzso representing a 19 zzso acid sequence from the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso we investigated whether it was possible to influence the affinity and zzso of zzso raised against the zzso using different zzso ratios and zzso The zzso was coupled to zzso in four zzso ratios and two molecular zzso - terminal and central - and the zzso were verified by mass zzso Mice were zzso ten times at zzso intervals with low doses of the eight zzso Blood samples collected between each zzso were zzso by zzso for specific zzso zzso and relative zzso With both types of zzso the zzso zzso zzso increased in response to increasing zzso ratios, but central zzso resulted in markedly higher zzso than terminal zzso The overall zzso zzso affinities reached approximately similar levels with both zzso whereas a reversed zzso was observed between zzso ratio and zzso affinity for terminal zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso ratio of a zzso and its carrier may affect the resulting zzso zzso and that a zzso ratio between a terminally zzso zzso and its carrier approaching one will result in relatively high zzso zzso Furthermore, the molecular orientation of the coupled zzso has a major effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso
