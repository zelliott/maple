We found a tandem repeat sequence in the region zzso zzso in which restriction fragments zzso D and zzso B overlap each other, near the zzso of the unique long sequence zzso of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso strain F zzso The zzso physical map of zzso was constructed, and the position of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso clones from a single strain was defined on the zzso The maximum size difference in the zzso zzso was estimated to be 600 zzso between these zzso and 100 zzso between the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso was zzso and was shown to contain a tandem repeat sequence consisting of 15 units of 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso length zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and clones is attributable to copy number variation of the tandem repeat zzso
