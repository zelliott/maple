Members of the zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso family of zzso factors control the zzso of cholesterol and other zzso and zzso synthesis is critical for cell growth and zzso We recently found that the mature forms of zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso cells, giving rise to a zzso recognized by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that mature zzso was stabilized in a zzso manner during zzso We have now mapped the major zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso in the C zzso of mature zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso is zzso on zzso specifically during zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso B complex in zzso cells and we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso mature zzso during zzso thereby preserving a critical pool of active zzso factors to support zzso zzso Taken together with our previous work, the current study suggests that zzso may provide a link between zzso zzso proliferation and cell zzso This hypothesis was supported by our observation that zzso zzso of zzso arrested cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, thereby attenuating cell zzso
