Local production of zzso inflammatory zzso zzso a zzso that blocks human zzso virus type 1 zzso entry into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target cells, may be a significant factor in resistance to zzso infection and control of local viral zzso The mechanisms governing zzso expression in T cells, however, are not well zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso expression in T cells is zzso regulated by zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso responsive element zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of primary human T cells with zzso deletion and zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter identified an activated zzso zzso motif at position zzso to zzso base pairs, relative to the zzso box as a vital zzso element and a binding site for zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso or induction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in the formation of zzso complexes, including an zzso zzso to the zzso site and zzso of zzso promoter zzso Our data characterize an important binding site for the zzso regulator zzso in the zzso promoter and suggest that dynamic changes in the relative levels of zzso and zzso play a crucial role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human T zzso
