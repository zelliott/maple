zzso zzso of arbitrary zzso sequence have identified DNA zzso useful for genetic mapping in a large variety of zzso Although technically very powerful, the use of arbitrary zzso for zzso mapping has the disadvantage of characterizing DNA sequences of unknown zzso Thus, there is no reason to anticipate that DNA fragments amplified by use of arbitrary zzso will be enriched for either transcribed or promoter sequences that may be zzso in zzso For these reasons, we modified the arbitrarily primed zzso method by using zzso zzso derived from zzso promoter elements and protein zzso zzso of these zzso were tested individually and in zzso combinations for their ability to amplify zzso DNA from a variety of species including various zzso strains of laboratory mice and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso strains of mice, we determined the zzso location of 27 zzso fragments in the mouse zzso The results demonstrated that motif zzso zzso products are reliable markers for mapping the mouse zzso and that motif zzso can also be used for zzso zzso of many divergent zzso
