zzso breast cancer accounts for about zzso of all breast zzso and zzso and zzso genes have been identified as validated zzso genes for this zzso Testing for zzso gene zzso is usually based on a zzso approach, such as the partial zzso zzso method, and zzso direct zzso However, this approach is time consuming due to the large size of zzso and zzso zzso Recently, a new low cost and time saving zzso protocol has been developed to analyze gene zzso by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A subset of 90 patients, enrolled in the zzso Counseling Program of the National Cancer Centre of zzso zzso was performed to validate this zzso Previous retrospective analysis showed that zzso patients zzso were zzso in zzso and zzso genes and these data were confirmed by the present zzso DNA samples underwent touchdown zzso and, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were divided into groups depending on zzso size to allow zzso zzso The product of this reaction were analyzed on zzso WAVE zzso Acid High zzso zzso Analysis zzso The operator who performed the zzso zzso approach did not know the sequencing results at that zzso The zzso zzso zzso approach was able to detect all zzso with a sensitivity of zzso Furthermore, in order to save time and zzso a zzso setting preparation was zzso
