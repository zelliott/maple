Chicken skeletal muscle zzso previously reported to bind the zzso zzso ends of zzso filaments was zzso to zzso By two zzso gel zzso it consists of two zzso beta I (35 zzso and beta II (32 zzso and each zzso has two zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso peptides of beta I were nearly identical with those of portions of the muscle barbed zzso protein Cap Z zzso although several zzso acids were different from those deduced from zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Caldwell, zzso and Cooper, zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86, zzso The zzso acid sequences of two peptides from beta II were completely identical with portions of Cap Z beta deduced from zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso Cooper, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso capped the barbed end of an zzso filament as evidenced by zzso assembly of zzso zzso filaments and specifically its impairment of growth in the zzso zzso Thus it is concluded that highly zzso zzso is identical with the more recently described Cap zzso an zzso zzso capping protein of chicken skeletal zzso
