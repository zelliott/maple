zzso bind a variety of proteins as they pass through the zzso regions of the zzso where they acquire forward zzso and zzso zzso Recent evidence indicates that certain zzso zzso proteins that bind zzso have zzso activity and may function as part of the innate immune zzso We reported earlier that zzso now designated human zzso 118 zzso is a zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso has potent zzso activity that is dose, time, and structure zzso zzso of zzso coli for 60 zzso with 10 zzso zzso reduced bacterial survival to zzso of the control, and 25 zzso reduced survival to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of 50 and 100 zzso further reduced survival to less than 2 and zzso zzso A zzso effect of salt concentration on the zzso activity of zzso was zzso Reduction of zzso bonds and zzso of zzso resulted in the complete loss of zzso zzso zzso caused rapid zzso of both outer and inner zzso of zzso coli and striking zzso zzso in the bacterial surfaces visible by scanning electron zzso consistent with a zzso mechanism of bacterial zzso In contrast, zzso cell zzso were not zzso by zzso as indicated by the rat zzso zzso zzso Studies on zzso zzso of zzso synthesis and membrane zzso in zzso coli were consistent with a primary effect at the cell membrane zzso zzso may contribute to zzso innate immunity and protect the zzso against attack by zzso in the male and female zzso zzso
