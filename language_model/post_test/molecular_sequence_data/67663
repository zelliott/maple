zzso electron transfer in biological systems, especially in zzso is a highly intriguing zzso Its zzso details cannot be addressed by structural data obtained by zzso alone because this provides only zzso information on a given zzso zzso In combination with transient zzso and zzso manipulation of the zzso however, a dynamic molecular picture of the zzso process may be zzso In zzso zzso light sensors using zzso zzso zzso electron transfer between a zzso and the zzso zzso is the key reaction to switch from a zzso to a zzso state, which zzso to the biological signaling zzso Particularly puzzling is the fact that, although the various naturally occurring zzso zzso show little difference in the zzso acid composition of the zzso binding pocket, the reaction rates of the forward reaction differ quite largely from a few zzso up to several hundred zzso In this study, we modified the zzso potential of the zzso zzso pair by zzso zzso close to the zzso C2 zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso We provide information on how changes in the zzso potential of either reaction partner significantly influence zzso zzso electron zzso The altered zzso zzso allowed us zzso to zzso describe an excited state charge transfer zzso prior to electron transfer in the zzso zzso Additionally, we show that the electron transfer rate directly zzso with the quantum yield of signaling state zzso
