zzso is a zzso zzso protein that was originally cloned as an zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to associate with the zzso zzso beta chain and zzso zzso and to inhibit signaling zzso by zzso and zzso We now demonstrate that zzso also interacts with the zzso zzso beta chain zzso This interaction requires the A region of zzso zzso zzso which also mediates the association of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso functions associated with both of these zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso can zzso control at least two independent zzso signaling zzso Although a functional zzso binding domain of zzso was not required for its interaction with zzso in zzso its zzso binding capability was essential for the zzso action of zzso On this basis, we have generated a zzso form of zzso protein with an altered zzso domain that acts as a dominant negative and should prove useful in further understanding zzso zzso
