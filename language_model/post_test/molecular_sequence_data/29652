zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso which zzso partial protection against zzso zzso challenge, is recognized by zzso and T zzso from cattle that have recovered from infection and are immune to subsequent zzso zzso is a zzso protein with an zzso zzso region that contains four zzso zzso zzso among all zzso zzso family members and a zzso zzso region that contains zzso zzso tandem zzso zzso zzso To define the location of zzso zzso for vaccine development using a zzso protein or zzso zzso a series of truncated zzso zzso proteins and peptides were tested for stimulation of zzso lines derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso lines from three zzso zzso cattle with different zzso zzso responded to the zzso region of zzso whereas T cells from only one animal responded zzso to the CT zzso zzso lines from the three individuals recognized two to six zzso peptides spanning zzso zzso to zzso and representing at least four dominant zzso Using zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso 295 to zzso and one zzso repeat zzso zzso which is present twice at zzso positions 391 to 402 and zzso to zzso were zzso Several peptides representing zzso repeats of the zzso zzso zzso zzso neither zzso responses of zzso clones specific for this zzso nor inhibited responses to the zzso zzso Upon stimulation with specific zzso zzso clones specific for zzso or CT zzso produced gamma zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso which is highly zzso among otherwise zzso different strains of zzso zzso supports the inclusion of this region in vaccine zzso to be tested in zzso
