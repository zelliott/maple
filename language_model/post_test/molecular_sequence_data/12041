The identity of zzso zzso zzso complex zzso complexes that elicit vigorous T cell responses has remained an interesting problem for both practical and theoretical zzso Although a few abundant zzso class zzso peptides have been zzso and zzso identifying the unique T zzso peptides from among the thousands of existing peptides is still a very difficult zzso In this report, we identified the zzso zzso that is recognized by an zzso zzso zzso T cell clone using a novel genetic strategy that is based upon measurement of T cell zzso occupancy in single T zzso Using zzso T cells as a probe, we screened a zzso zzso library in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and isolated a zzso clone that allowed expression of the appropriate zzso zzso complex in zzso The zzso zzso zzso exactly matched the consensus zzso zzso zzso but was surprisingly zzso by a zzso defined translation reading zzso Furthermore, the abundance of the naturally processed analog in zzso cells was estimated to be zzso copies per zzso These results illustrate a novel strategy for identifying T zzso zzso in general and directly show that zzso T cells can respond to rather rare zzso zzso These results also suggest that the total pool of processed peptides expressed on the zzso surface may include those generated by cryptic translation of normally expressed zzso
