We present a plausible productive zzso obtained by zzso calculations for the binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso site of zzso zzso H zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex stability was verified by molecular zzso zzso analysis reveals the requirements for zzso recognition and zzso the zzso zzso group is in the proximity of the zzso iron and zzso in a hydrogen bond network with the zzso zzso and zzso and a water zzso whereas the zzso group forms salt bridges with the remote zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that a single zzso of zzso or zzso does not affect zzso activity, whereas dual zzso of these zzso to either zzso or zzso significantly decreases zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso pocket is involved in zzso zzso
