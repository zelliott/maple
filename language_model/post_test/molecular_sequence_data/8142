The influence of zzso factors over the production of zzso of zzso N zzso zzso from zzso and bacterial sources in zzso coli was zzso The effect of these parameters on the expression of zzso zzso zzso was determined by using two expression zzso containing the zzso or the zzso Under the zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli reached zzso of total soluble proteins and under the zzso promoter, the level reached approximately 50% of total soluble zzso zzso the high level of expression did not affect zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso relative to other zzso zzso suggested that proteins of low gravy scores zzso or zzso zzso tend to be soluble whereas higher gravy scores zzso or zzso zzso form zzso Neither the zzso content of the gene nor the relative percentage zzso content of the protein affected the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
