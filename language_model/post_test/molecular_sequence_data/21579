The presence of zzso organisms zzso has been hypothesized to be a cause of deterioration in enhanced biological zzso removal zzso processes due to their abilities to zzso zzso organisms zzso Based on zzso zzso gene zzso new members of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified from sludge samples of a zzso sequencing batch reactor used for zzso The new zzso formed a zzso lineage zzso clearly distinct from the previously reported seven zzso zzso Because the new zzso members were not targeted by the known zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso FISH probe zzso and a new FISH probe zzso targeting all eight zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso properties of the new zzso members were zzso FISH and zzso approaches showed that zzso cells zzso were large zzso zzso zzso in zzso with the ability to take up zzso under zzso conditions, but unable to accumulate zzso under the subsequent zzso conditions, consistent with in zzso zzso of zzso FISH analyses on several sludge samples showed that members of zzso were commonly detected as the majority of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this study showed that members of zzso could be a zzso of zzso with an important role in zzso zzso zzso of FISH zzso which zzso with broader zzso zzso at different zzso levels will contribute to studies of the zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso
