zzso zzso is an economically important zzso zzso that threatens an estimated 250 million cattle with the disease tropical zzso Development of a defined zzso vaccine is one means of trying to develop control measures against the zzso To this end we have characterized a surface zzso complex of the zzso stage zzso by using a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso in zzso We have cloned the gene coding for this complex and have demonstrated that a fusion protein expressed from a zzso of this gene elicits strong zzso zzso zzso we provide data on the structure and expression of this zzso In particular we show that the region of the zzso expressed in one zzso codes for a protein segment relatively rich in zzso zzso Also we demonstrate that expression of this gene appears to be stage specific, transcripts being present only in the zzso and zzso zzso The relevance of these findings to the production of a defined zzso vaccine is zzso
