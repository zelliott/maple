In zzso disease of the breast, the zzso of the zzso is infiltrated by large zzso cells of zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that the spread of zzso cells through the zzso zzso is induced by a zzso factor that acts via the zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we characterized and zzso a zzso factor released by zzso and identified its target receptors in specimens from patients with zzso disease and in zzso breast zzso cells, which zzso zzso 

We isolated the zzso factor from zzso medium and zzso zzso zzso These sequences were used to identify the zzso factor as zzso which is released by skin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells, as does zzso zzso zzso factor activities of zzso are inhibited by zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso domain of zzso which blocks the binding of zzso We used in zzso zzso to show that normal zzso cells produce zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso as well as their zzso zzso are expressed by zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso factor that is produced and released by normal zzso zzso and thus plays a key role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso receptors zzso as well as zzso and/or zzso both of which function as a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso complex on zzso cells results in the zzso of these breast cancer cells, which eventually migrate into the zzso zzso zzso
