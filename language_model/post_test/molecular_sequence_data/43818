The zzso gene family consists of a large number of zzso expressed genes capable of zzso putative zzso factors and related by a zzso domain, the zzso We cloned and characterized the zzso zzso transcript using the screening of a zzso zzso zzso library with a probe containing the zzso and we performed zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence is strongly zzso in comparison to the human, mouse and chicken zzso and is located on sheep zzso zzso The zzso expression pattern in developing zzso is consistent with the hypothesis that this gene plays a role in the germ cell zzso
