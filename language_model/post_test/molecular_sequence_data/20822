An zzso zzso showing high specific activities on zzso and short chain vinyl zzso was obtained from zzso zzso latex after an extraction step with zzso zzso and zzso followed by gel zzso zzso Although the protein could not be zzso to complete zzso due to its presence in high molecular mass zzso a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 41 zzso was obtained by zzso This material was zzso with zzso and the zzso acid sequences of the zzso peptides were determined by zzso These sequences were used to identify a partial zzso zzso zzso from expressed sequence tags zzso of zzso zzso Based upon zzso zzso a full-length gene was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a theoretical molecular mass of 38 zzso From sequence analysis, zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso protein family and four potential zzso sites were zzso The putative zzso zzso was zzso zzso with the zzso zzso being part of the zzso A zzso of zzso was built from known X-ray structures and sequence alignments and the zzso zzso was found to be exposed at the surface of the zzso thus confirming the results of zzso zzso by zzso suggesting a direct accessibility of the inhibitor to the active zzso
