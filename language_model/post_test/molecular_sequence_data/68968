We have been studying the suppression of experimental zzso zzso in the Lewis rat after oral administration of zzso basic protein zzso zzso is zzso by zzso T cells that zzso transfer protection and suppress immune responses in zzso This suppression is zzso by zzso of zzso following triggering by the fed zzso In the present study, we tested the ability of overlapping 20 zzso acid peptides from zzso to trigger suppression zzso by zzso cells from Lewis rats orally zzso to zzso Using a zzso system, we found that zzso cells from zzso orally zzso animals zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso suppress zzso responses of an zzso specific cell zzso This suppression correlated with zzso of zzso by cells zzso with the zzso In addition, T cells from animals fed the zzso zzso zzso alone zzso zzso whereas no zzso release or in zzso suppression was observed in animals fed the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso triggered proliferation of zzso primed cells from animals zzso with zzso whereas the zzso zzso identified above did zzso Furthermore, oral administration of zzso zzso suppressed disease induced by zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso were not affected by oral administration of zzso zzso whereas zzso responses to whole zzso were zzso These results demonstrate that distinct zzso zzso exist on zzso which are separate from zzso zzso and that zzso bystander suppression plays an important role in zzso of tissue specific zzso processes following oral zzso These findings have important implications for the design of tissue specific targeted zzso by oral zzso in zzso
