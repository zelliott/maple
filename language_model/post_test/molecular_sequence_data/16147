The mating zzso zzso arrests zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso control is also exerted in zzso since cells do not exit zzso until they have attained a critical zzso A dominant zzso zzso which causes both zzso resistance and small cell size zzso about zzso that of the wild zzso has been isolated and characterized genetically and by molecular zzso Several zzso zzso were induced zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso consisted of a termination zzso two-thirds of the way through the zzso coding zzso A zzso deletion of zzso produced by gene zzso increased cell volume about zzso thus, zzso may be a zzso or zzso zzso of a zzso gene involved in zzso size zzso Multiple copies of zzso also greatly reduced the duration of the zzso phase of the cell zzso
