DNA zzso zzso is involved in DNA repair, zzso zzso and likely zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso conditions affect zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso we questioned whether zzso expression could also be zzso To address this question, we characterized zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and exposed zzso of that species to zzso conditions or to environmental modifications corresponding to those encountered in the International Space zzso We noted a robust expression of zzso zzso during early zzso and in the zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts are zzso times more abundant in zzso zzso than in humans and mice, thereby providing an explanation for the zzso zzso zzso of G and C bases in zzso zzso zzso decreases after 10 days of development in space and radiation seem primarily involved in this zzso However, space radiation, alone or in combination with a zzso of the zzso rhythm, did not affect zzso protein levels and did not induce protein zzso showing the limited impact of radiation encountered during a 10-day stay in the International Space zzso
