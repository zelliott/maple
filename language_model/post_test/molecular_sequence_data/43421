The characteristic zzso that are produced during the zzso infection cycle are composed of a major viral zzso zzso zzso To characterize the zzso gene and gene product of African zzso virus zzso a full-length zzso copy of the zzso gene of zzso was cloned and the zzso sequence zzso zzso was highly zzso within the zzso zzso with between zzso conservation of zzso acids among zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso was investigated by in zzso translation of the zzso zzso gene followed by expression of the gene in insect zzso The zzso protein assembled in zzso structures with a diameter of approximately 23 zzso and lengths of up to 4 zzso The absence of a zzso structure and lower zzso value of zzso zzso zzso clearly distinguished them from those of zzso zzso
