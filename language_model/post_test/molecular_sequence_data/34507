In addition to providing zzso zzso tree making procedures such as zzso and maximum likelihood can make specific predictions of actual historical zzso Resurrection of such sequences can be used to understand early events in zzso In the case of zzso the nature of zzso is such that when applied to multiple zzso sequences it typically predicts ancestral sequences that satisfy the base pairing constraints associated with secondary zzso The case for such sequences being actual ancestors is greatly improved, if they can be shown to be biologically zzso 

A unique common ancestral sequence of 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences predicted by zzso was zzso and found to be functional in the context of the zzso coli cellular zzso The functionality of various point zzso and zzso that were constructed as part of the resurrection were examined in zzso When separately introduced the changes at single stranded positions and individual double zzso at zzso positions were also zzso An additional double zzso was examined at a different zzso position and it was also zzso 

The results show that at least in the case of the zzso zzso considered here, ancestors predicted by zzso are likely to be realistic when the prediction is not overly influenced by single zzso It is especially noteworthy that the zzso of the predicted ancestors could be anticipated as a cumulative consequence of the zzso of the individual zzso that comprised zzso Thus, point zzso data is potentially useful in evaluating the zzso of ancestral sequences predicted by zzso or other zzso The results also suggest that in the absence of significant zzso structure constraints double zzso that preserve pairing in stem regions will typically be zzso Overall, the results suggest that it will be feasible to resurrect additional meaningful zzso zzso ancestors as well as ancestral sequences of many different types of zzso
