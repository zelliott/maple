We have determined the DNA sequence of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso of this sequence with that of the zzso zzso shows surprisingly that the zzso have accumulated more zzso than their zzso Moreover, many of these changes in the zzso are clustered in short regions or hot zzso Additional comparison of these sequences with the zzso and zzso sequences shows that, in several cases, the altered sequence generated at the hot spot is identical to the corresponding region of a zzso zzso zzso The clustered changes are responsible for zzso of the zzso acid differences between the zzso and zzso genes and suggest that zzso conversion events occurring within the zzso and involving only tens of zzso are an important mechanism for the generation of zzso differences between natural zzso zzso
