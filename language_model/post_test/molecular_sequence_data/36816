The zzso zzso consists of a small zzso domain and two wing zzso By changing its wing zzso the zzso can cleave many different zzso in a zzso manner, functioning as an zzso restriction zzso Although relatively strong zzso activity is known to be associated with zzso zzso the zzso zzso itself has been claimed to have no zzso zzso Here, we show the evidence that the zzso zzso has the ability to rejoin its zzso products at low temperatures such as 4 degrees zzso In contrast, little or no zzso product can be produced at 50 degrees C, the temperature giving the maximum zzso zzso The zzso reaction requires zzso zzso The first zzso zzso see zzso possessing zzso zzso zzso must be zzso but the second zzso zzso required to have zzso can be replaced by DNA counterparts, equal to or longer than zzso thus making it possible to generate zzso zzso zzso We also show the zzso zzso zzso to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates the zzso linkage thus generated to be exclusively zzso
