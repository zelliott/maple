The substitution profile of zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso prepared in our laboratories has been previously zzso However, in those studies, no attempt was made to characterize the zzso or regional zzso of this zzso zzso derivatives with degrees of substitution of two or higher represent a large number of possible zzso dependent on this zzso and regional zzso The zzso zzso zzso however, cannot have regional zzso and, therefore, has only three possible substitution products related to the zzso zzso and zzso groups of a zzso zzso In this study the zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso with the progress of the zzso being followed by a zzso zzso zzso method that resolved these zzso The zzso containing the zzso was zzso and the pure materials were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Through this analysis the assignment of the zzso zzso was zzso
