zzso is an unique zzso zzso zzso with optimal activity at neutral zzso It has been suggested that zzso of human zzso contributes to neutral optimum pH of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The hypothesis was verified by the characterization of zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced with zzso by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were expressed in zzso cells, exhibited different zzso profiles and optimum pH of the zzso zzso was lower than that of the zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso of human zzso plays an important role in the determination of optimum pH of the zzso
