Most humans and Old World nonhuman primates are infected for life with zzso virus zzso or closely related zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso Several potential strategies for immune evasion and persistence have been proposed based on studies of zzso infection in humans, but it has been difficult to test their actual contribution zzso Interest has focused on the zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso because of its essential role in the maintenance and replication of the zzso viral zzso in zzso infected cells and because zzso zzso expressed in these cells is protected from presentation to the major zzso complex zzso restricted zzso zzso zzso response through the action of an internal zzso repeat zzso Given the high degree of zzso conservation among zzso which zzso humans and Old World zzso we hypothesized that strategies essential for viral persistence would be well zzso among viruses of this zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso shares sequence zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso is a functional zzso for zzso zzso zzso maintenance and zzso Interestingly, all three zzso possess a zzso domain, but the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fail to inhibit zzso processing and presentation as determined by using three different in zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso of zzso processing and presentation by the zzso zzso may not be an essential mechanism for persistent infection by all zzso and that other mechanisms may be important for immune evasion during zzso zzso
