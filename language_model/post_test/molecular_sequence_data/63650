Small zzso zzso zzso can function as zzso zzso of gene expression to regulate stress responses and zzso We here describe the mechanisms by which two zzso zzso and zzso activate the zzso coli zzso zzso coding for an essential zzso in zzso zzso The two zzso although being highly similar in sequence and structure, act in a zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso directly activates zzso zzso translation by an zzso zzso In contrast, zzso acts upstream of zzso and positively regulates zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We also report the first example, to our knowledge, of zzso expression being controlled by the zzso status of a zzso zzso zzso We show that in zzso cells, zzso zzso is unstable due to 3' end zzso whereas in an zzso coli zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso zzso is stabilized and zzso which in turn zzso zzso and causes zzso zzso Our study reveals zzso action of two zzso zzso in a complex regulatory cascade that controls the zzso zzso Similar zzso of zzso zzso regulators may operate in other zzso
