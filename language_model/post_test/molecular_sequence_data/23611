zzso A zzso radiation is implicated in the zzso of human skin zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso for UVA is not fully zzso A zzso role for UVA has been suggested, which involves zzso of zzso zzso generating zzso DNA zzso We investigated the zzso of UVA alone and in combination with zzso acid zzso a precursor of the zzso zzso zzso in transgenic Big Blue mouse embryonic zzso A significant generation of zzso zzso a typical zzso zzso DNA zzso was observed in cells treated with a combination of zzso (1 zzso and UVA zzso zzso as zzso by zzso liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso The zzso level of zzso however, remained unchanged in cells zzso with UVA or treated with zzso zzso Other zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso in cells treated with zzso and/or zzso with UVA as determined by terminal zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso in cells treated with a combination of zzso and UVA showed an approximately zzso increase in zzso frequency relative to the control zzso zzso zzso as well as a unique induced zzso spectrum as established by DNA sequence analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso effects were observed in cells zzso with UVA or treated with zzso zzso The spectrum of zzso produced by zzso plus UVA was characterized by a significantly increased frequency of G zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso which are the hallmark zzso induced by zzso zzso the zzso zzso of UVA plus zzso is similar to that established previously for UVA alone at a zzso dose of 18 zzso We conclude that, in the presence of zzso zzso UVA at a zzso dose zzso zzso through the same mechanism as does a zzso dose of UVA per zzso
