The zzso acid sequence for a novel human membrane protein that zzso selective zzso zzso by membrane zzso was deduced by molecular cloning and sequence analysis of its zzso zzso This protein consists of 129 zzso acid zzso and shares several structural characteristics with the rat zzso These include a single putative zzso domain surrounded by many charged zzso acid zzso two potential zzso sites at the zzso portion and a single zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso domain and its zzso zzso sequence are highly zzso between the human and rat zzso Because the slowly zzso zzso current zzso by the human protein on its expression in zzso zzso is indistinguishable from that induced by the rat zzso the sequence zzso at the zzso domain and its following sequence should play an essential role in the induction of selective zzso zzso
