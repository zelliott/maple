Despite the importance of zzso in the evolution of plants, patterns of molecular evolution and zzso interactions following zzso are not well zzso Nuclear zzso DNA is particularly complex with respect to these zzso zzso The composition of zzso tandem zzso is influenced by zzso and zzso concerted evolution and their expression is characterized by patterns such as zzso zzso To understand these complex interactions it is important to study them in diverse natural zzso zzso In this study we use direct sequencing to isolate and characterize zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso from multiple zzso of six different races in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that in most zzso zzso both zzso zzso repeats are present, but that there are significant biases in copy number toward one zzso possibly resulting from zzso concerted zzso The zzso zzso often differs between races and between zzso within a zzso A zzso analysis of ITS sequences provides evidence for multiple origins in several of the zzso zzso This evidence for diverse patterns of zzso molecular evolution and multiple origins of zzso races will provide a useful system for future studies of natural variation in patterns of zzso zzso
