As in all zzso the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso lack zzso and contain a short hairpin structure in the 3' untranslated zzso This hairpin structure is a key element for zzso regulation of zzso gene expression and determines zzso 3' end formation, nuclear export, translation and zzso zzso All these steps contribute to the zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso The hairpin structure is the binding site for zzso zzso protein that is required for zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein gene is transcribed in dividing cells during zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso function in early zzso using zzso interference leads to an zzso zzso brought about by defects in zzso zzso A similar zzso was obtained by depleting zzso zzso and zzso in early zzso indicating that the defects in zzso zzso zzso are caused by reduced zzso zzso We have confirmed this by showing that zzso depletion reduces zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso during zzso development also results in defects in cell division during late zzso zzso In addition, we have observed defects in the zzso of zzso cell fate in animals depleted for zzso zzso and zzso which indicates that zzso proteins are required for cell fate regulation during zzso zzso
