zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently only known from the plateau at the eastern zzso of zzso Tops National Park, about zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Queensland, zzso zzso zzso zzso is also known from zzso Tops zzso zzso W of the nearest known population of zzso zzso zzso zzso Baker, zzso and Van zzso has yet to be found within zzso zzso but is known from museum specimens taken at zzso zzso just zzso zzso as well as extant populations about zzso to both the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be easily distinguished in the field, having an overall zzso appearance with much paler silver feet and zzso deep zzso zzso than zzso zzso which has distinctive zzso toned feet, zzso and zzso zzso zzso fur is also less coarse than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso has a striking zzso head, neck and shoulders, with pale, slightly broken zzso which distinguish it from zzso zzso which has a more subtle zzso head, pale zzso dabs of zzso and more zzso zzso zzso Features of the zzso can also be used for zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso zzso in having smaller zzso teeth, as well as a zzso and smaller skull and from zzso zzso in having on average a zzso zzso smaller skull and zzso lengths and smaller zzso zzso vacuities in the zzso zzso zzso is strongly divergent genetically (at zzso from both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and forms a very strongly supported zzso to the exclusion of all other zzso species, in both zzso and combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We are yet to make detailed surveys in search of zzso zzso from forested areas to the immediate east and north of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso has only been found at these sites in low zzso in decades past and not at all in several recent zzso zzso conducted by the zzso With similar habitat types in close geographic zzso it is plausible that zzso zzso may be found outside zzso Nevertheless, it is striking that from a range of surveys conducted at zzso Tops in the last 15 years and intensive surveys by the authors in the last 3 years, zzso more than 5 zzso trap nights, just 13 zzso zzso have been captured from two sites less than 6 zzso zzso If this is even close to the true geographic extent of the species, it would possess one of the smallest zzso of an Australian zzso zzso With several threats identified, we tentatively recommend that zzso zzso be listed as zzso pending an exhaustive zzso survey of zzso and zzso
