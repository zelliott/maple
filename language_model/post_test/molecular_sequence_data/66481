zzso of the zzso tree zzso zzso produce large quantities of zzso zzso containing approximately zzso zzso acid, an unusual zzso fatty zzso We present a comparative analysis of the zzso functional, and cellular properties of zzso type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso two unrelated zzso that catalyze the committed step in zzso zzso We show that both zzso are zzso by single genes and that zzso is expressed at similar levels in various zzso whereas zzso is strongly induced in developing seeds at the onset of oil zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso produced different types and proportions of zzso containing zzso acid, with zzso possessing an enhanced propensity for the synthesis of zzso the main component of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are located in zzso dynamic regions of the zzso zzso zzso and surprisingly, these regions do not zzso Furthermore, although both zzso and zzso contain a similar zzso zzso zzso retrieval zzso this motif alone is not sufficient for their zzso to specific regions of the zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso have zzso functions in plants and that the production of storage zzso including those containing unusual fatty zzso occurs in distinct zzso zzso
