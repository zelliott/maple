zzso was identified as a zzso zzso gene in cultured human zzso A single zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso alpha and zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta differ at their N zzso and show distinct distribution profiles in human zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the organization of the mouse zzso gene and to determine the effect of zzso hormone on the expression of zzso zzso in zzso 

We cloned mouse zzso of human zzso alpha and beta zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso and zzso analysis were employed to determine the gene zzso The effect of zzso hormone on the expression of zzso zzso in mouse brain and heart was also zzso 

Total zzso extracted from mouse zzso was used to clone zzso alpha and beta zzso by zzso followed by rapid amplification of zzso zzso Mice were rendered zzso by feeding a low zzso diet supplemented with zzso for 2 zzso In one group zzso zzso was injected zzso for the last 4 days whereas another group zzso received vehicle zzso zzso mice were zzso 

Mouse zzso alpha and beta zzso were highly zzso to the human zzso The gene was mapped on zzso zzso zzso to human zzso 6 where the human zzso gene is zzso As observed in human, zzso alpha zzso was expressed only in brain whereas beta zzso was distributed in other zzso as well, such as heart and skeletal zzso zzso alpha zzso was lower in the cerebral zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused an increase in zzso beta zzso in zzso however, expression of neither zzso alpha nor beta zzso was influenced by zzso status in other zzso These results indicate that expression of zzso alpha and beta zzso is regulated by zzso hormone in zzso and the regulation is zzso and zzso
