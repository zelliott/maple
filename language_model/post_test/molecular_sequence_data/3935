A new member of the zzso zzso family zzso was recently identified in humans and shown to be zzso in patients with dominant zzso zzso To understand better the function of zzso zzso we isolated a mouse zzso zzso from brain and raised a specific zzso against its C zzso The zzso distribution of zzso zzso in zzso cells largely overlapped that of zzso zzso zzso a well known zzso marker, and dramatically affected zzso zzso altering it from zzso to zzso zzso targeting was zzso by the zzso region of zzso as zzso deletion of the 124 zzso zzso acids eliminated zzso zzso although fusion of the zzso 60 or 90 zzso acids of zzso with green fluorescent protein resulted in its zzso zzso zzso was expressed widely in the mouse brain, especially in zzso of zzso bulb, cerebral cortex, zzso cortex, zzso zzso red nucleus, cochlear nucleus, motor zzso nucleus, facial nucleus, zzso nucleus, and zzso zzso Within zzso zzso cells, zzso protein was clearly observed in the zzso and zzso of zzso cells, as well as in zzso and zzso zzso In each case, it was distributed in the zzso pattern seen in other cell zzso
