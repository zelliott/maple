zzso of the zzso zzso that impair the action of zzso result in abnormal male sexual zzso We studied the structure of the zzso zzso gene in a patient with the zzso form of complete zzso zzso and another patient with a zzso form of incomplete zzso zzso In the subject with complete zzso zzso the deletion of a single zzso occurred at zzso number 1893 at zzso zzso The subsequent zzso zzso changes the sense of zzso zzso from zzso to a zzso stop zzso zzso zzso is zzso 3, so the zzso predicts the synthesis of a truncated zzso that lacks the entire zzso zzso Analysis of a subject with incomplete zzso zzso revealed a single substitution zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso of zzso 7, resulting in the conversion of an zzso at zzso acid 840 to a zzso This zzso in the zzso domain may zzso but not remove, the zzso binding to its zzso These results suggest that the zzso in our subjects are due to the zzso and that single zzso acid substitution and premature termination zzso can cause zzso severe functional zzso
