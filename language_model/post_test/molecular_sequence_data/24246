zzso results from genetic zzso that occur in a zzso manner giving rise to cells with increasingly zzso zzso We used in zzso zzso first zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells to identify genetic changes responsible for the transition of the zzso from a normal to zzso zzso The model used consisted of a normal invasive zzso zzso cell line and its zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso with the zzso zzso and selected using a forced crisis zzso zzso display increased zzso migratory and invasive behavior, zzso to zzso and zzso signals of zzso and a zzso in gap zzso zzso zzso These cells, however, were unable to form colonies on soft zzso or tumors in nude mice and are thus defined as zzso zzso display revealed 18 gene zzso 7 with unknown and 11 with known identity, showing altered expression between the normal zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso The known sequences include the potential tumor zzso zzso growth factor binding protein zzso and zzso zzso and potential zzso such as zzso zzso alternative zzso factor zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The role of the remaining 4 genes zzso in the zzso zzso is presently unknown and these are zzso binding protein zzso 25, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 155 and an 82 zzso zzso human zzso The functional role of zzso was examined in the control of zzso migration and zzso of zzso cells measured in zzso zzso alone had no effect on these properties of zzso zzso Furthermore, unlike normal zzso cells, zzso cells exhibited zzso to the migration stimulating signals of zzso which was explained by the loss or zzso of the zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso cells, however, expressed the zzso type 1 zzso zzso and responded to zzso by increased zzso This response was blocked with increasing zzso of zzso These results suggest that the loss of zzso and possibly zzso both of which can zzso zzso from zzso permits zzso proliferation of the zzso zzso in an zzso rich environment of the zzso zzso The functions of the other zzso expressed zzso some of which are essential for cell cycle progression or cell survival require further zzso
