zzso zzso C zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso and zzso both of which act as secondary zzso in animal zzso In this report, we identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three distinct partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso forms of putative zzso All three zzso genes were zzso active and displayed unique patterns of zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts were zzso expressed to varying degrees in every tissue of zzso bean plants zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso level was very low under normal growth conditions and was rapidly induced in an zzso zzso manner under environmental stress conditions zzso and high zzso An isolated zzso zzso about zzso zzso in zzso showed that zzso and zzso are in tandem array in the zzso bean zzso The predicted primary sequence of zzso zzso zzso is reminiscent of the zzso of animal zzso which contain core sequences found in typical zzso such as the zzso domain zzso X and Y zzso a zzso C2 domain, and the less zzso zzso zzso zzso of in zzso targeting experiment using a green fluorescent protein zzso showed that the zzso fusion protein was localized primarily to the plasma membrane of the zzso zzso The C2 domain was essential for zzso to be targeted to the plasma zzso The possible biological functions of zzso zzso in zzso bean plants are zzso
