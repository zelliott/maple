The zzso zzso zzso is a natural inhabitant of the human skin zzso that zzso an allergic reaction in zzso zzso To identify zzso of zzso zzso we separated a crude preparation of zzso zzso zzso as discrete spots by zzso PAGE and detected zzso proteins using zzso of zzso zzso zzso We identified the known zzso Mal f 2 and Mal f 3, and determined zzso zzso acid sequences of six new zzso proteins including Mal f zzso The zzso and zzso DNA zzso Mal f 4 were cloned and zzso The gene was zzso zzso zzso and zzso Mal f 4 composed of 315 zzso acids and a signal sequence of 27 zzso zzso We zzso Mal f 4, which had a molecular mass of 35 zzso from a membrane fraction of a zzso of cultured zzso Thirty of 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso had elevated serum levels of zzso to zzso Mal f 4, indicating that Mal f 4 is a major zzso There was a significant correlation of the zzso zzso unit values of Mal f 4 and the crude zzso but not between Mal f 4 and the known zzso Mal f zzso
