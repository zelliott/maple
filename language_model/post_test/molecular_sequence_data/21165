High zzso is a major problem in many zzso areas of the world, especially in hybrid rice zzso zzso zzso in zzso We previously showed a major quantitative trait locus for the percentage of grains with white zzso zzso in the zzso zzso on zzso 8 using a zzso segment substitution line zzso Here, we selected the zzso harboring the zzso zzso from the zzso derived from a cross between zzso (as a zzso zzso and zzso (as a donor zzso which had higher percentage zzso markedly different from that of zzso There were also significant differences in starch zzso appearance of zzso content zzso and milling qualities between zzso and zzso but not in grain size or thousand grain weight zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso populations from a cross between zzso and zzso were used for fine mapping of zzso We narrowed down the location of this zzso to a 142 zzso region between zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the difference in zzso between the zzso The markers tightly linked to zzso should facilitate cloning of the gene underlying this zzso and will be of value for zzso selection in breeding rice varieties with better grain zzso
