A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fixes carbon dioxide via the reductive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this strain is one of the key zzso of the zzso zzso of strain zzso has been reported to be a zzso zzso and zzso by zzso A gene zzso zzso zzso another zzso was found 148 zzso upstream of zzso in the opposite zzso Five of the for genes zzso were required for the expression of the active zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of the zzso zzso showed five zzso corresponding to the zzso gene products, suggesting that the zzso had a novel zzso zzso The zzso zzso had high zzso specificity toward zzso as in the case of the gene products of zzso zzso extension analysis showed that the zzso and zzso genes were transcribed from one and two zzso initiation sites, zzso The results also suggested that both gene clusters were expressed in the cells of strain zzso
