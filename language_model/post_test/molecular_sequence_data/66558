zzso expression is zzso in certain types of zzso As a first step towards understanding zzso regulation, we determined its zzso structure and characterized its zzso zzso Two species of zzso zzso were found to arise from alternative usage of two highly zzso promoters zzso zzso While transcripts arising from zzso were mainly detected in brain, zzso transcripts were highly expressed in heart and zzso Core regulatory regions were characterized for zzso and zzso The zzso of a potential zzso binding site, zzso zzso in both human and zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso activities of the longest zzso construct reflected the level of zzso zzso zzso in zzso smooth muscle, and zzso cell zzso zzso increased zzso zzso concentration zzso mainly at the zzso level in zzso zzso zzso These findings provide a basis for future studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in a variety of zzso and point towards a possible involvement of zzso in zzso cell zzso and zzso activity regulated by zzso
