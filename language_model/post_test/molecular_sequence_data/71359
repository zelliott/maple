The zzso toxicity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso therapy in humans is vascular leak syndrome zzso zzso has a complex zzso involving damage to vascular zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and organ zzso zzso and zzso prepared with the zzso A chain of the plant zzso zzso zzso and other zzso damage human zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso to zzso may initiate zzso if this damage could be avoided without losing the efficacy of zzso or zzso larger doses could be zzso In this paper, we provide evidence that a three zzso acid sequence zzso zzso in toxins and zzso damages zzso Thus, when peptides from zzso or zzso containing this sequence motif are coupled to mouse zzso they bind to and damage zzso both in zzso and, in the case of zzso in zzso In contrast, the same peptides with a deleted or zzso sequence do zzso Furthermore, the zzso from zzso attached to mouse zzso can block the binding of intact zzso to zzso in zzso and vice zzso In addition, zzso a zzso of zzso zzso A zzso and zzso also block the binding of the mouse zzso zzso to zzso suggesting that an zzso motif is exposed on all three zzso Our results suggest that deletions or zzso in this sequence or the use of zzso blocking peptides may increase the therapeutic index of both zzso as well as zzso prepared with a variety of plant or bacterial zzso
