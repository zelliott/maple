zzso zzso clones zzso the zzso zzso from the tiger zzso butterfly zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso from adult head tissue total zzso This zzso consists of zzso zzso and contains a single open reading frame predicted to be zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso amplification of zzso DNA with zzso spanning the coding region yielded a single zzso zzso which was zzso The zzso gene has nine zzso and eight zzso four of which are in unique locations relative to the positions of zzso in other known insect zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso acid and zzso sequence data places zzso within a zzso of insect visual zzso thought to be sensitive to long zzso of zzso The zzso structure of zzso is the first characterized from a member of this zzso zzso Three zzso zzso positions are shared with zzso zzso and one of these is also shared with zzso zzso By contrast, none of the known zzso locations in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso visual zzso are shared by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The placement of zzso within zzso genes therefore independently supports the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso visual zzso
