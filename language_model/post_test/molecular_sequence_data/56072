Most of the zzso and zzso magnetic zzso of the 66 zzso acid long zzso zzso of mouse zzso have been assigned by the combined use of the two-dimensional zzso and two- and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso The sequential zzso zzso and zzso zzso exchange zzso indicate the presence of three zzso regions within the zzso The positions of the three zzso zzso well to those of other zzso the three-dimensional structures of which have already been zzso The present zzso study provides the first experimental evidence for the existence of a zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso
