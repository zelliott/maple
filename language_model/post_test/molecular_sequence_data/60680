Children exposed to radioactive zzso as a consequence of the zzso reactor accident have an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso molecular zzso in these tumors are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report on two novel types of zzso zzso zzso and 7, and describe the fusion products and the zzso fused gene zzso zzso Like the other zzso proteins identified so far they are zzso zzso not zzso and contain coiled zzso zzso required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain is fused to the zzso part of the human zzso zzso factor zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain is fused to a novel protein that is strongly related to zzso Like zzso it contains a zzso motif zzso finger, B boxes, coiled zzso zzso located in the zzso part and a zzso finger and a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and related proteins are zzso zzso for nuclear zzso thus participating in controlling cellular development, differentiation and zzso This is the first report on their involvement in human zzso zzso
