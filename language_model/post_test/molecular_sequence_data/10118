An zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso designated zzso was previously cloned from the zzso zzso zzso mouse strain and partially zzso While genetically zzso for an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso region of zzso this virus, unlike the zzso virus zzso fails to be efficiently recognized by zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso thus provides the opportunity to study the role of zzso sequence variations that are located outside of the zzso zzso as a mechanism of escape from zzso immune zzso In an attempt to identify which zzso of the zzso zzso could account for its ability to evade efficient recognition by zzso zzso zzso we have constructed zzso zzso zzso The direct influence of a sequence variation twelve zzso acids zzso to zzso was explored with the use of zzso viruses and determined not to significantly impair the presentation of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The long terminal repeat zzso derived from the zzso virus, which possesses only one copy of the zzso pair zzso zzso in the zzso region, in contrast to zzso that possesses two copies of the tandem direct repeat zzso was also analyzed for its influence on the presentation of zzso Interestingly, our data indicate that the zzso region derived from zzso zzso influences the presentation of zzso in the context of a zzso zzso zzso
