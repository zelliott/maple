This study reports the occurrence of highly zzso zzso sequences in the zzso zzso of the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were amplified using universal zzso zzso and virtually no genetic differences were detected within and among zzso These sequences matched the control region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of qualitative aspects of these sequences revealed that their structural composition is very similar to the zzso region of other zzso zzso However, the total lack of zzso has not been reported from other closely related zzso The data analyzed here support the occurrence of highly zzso zzso zzso and we found no support for the hypothesis that these sequences are zzso nuclear zzso Furthermore, the control and zzso regions obtained with different zzso corroborate the lack of zzso of the zzso sequences in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
