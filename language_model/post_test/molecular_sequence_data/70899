The zzso zzso B of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso consisted of three different zzso with molecular masses of about 22 zzso 25 zzso and 47 zzso zzso probably in an alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 zzso zzso zzso from cells grown in the presence of zzso was labeled in the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso both reacted with zzso zzso indicating the presence of a zzso zzso This zzso zzso prevented zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso but it could be removed for zzso degradation by incubation with zzso A DNA zzso was isolated and zzso which zzso beta and alpha zzso of zzso zzso followed by a gene zzso zzso A zzso and the gamma zzso of zzso zzso The cloned DNA zzso represented a second zzso gene slightly different from a previously identified partial zzso zzso Both zzso genes contained an zzso zzso zzso which confirmed the observed zzso content of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analyses suggest that zzso encodes a zzso which is zzso into the previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso most probably occurred at an zzso site zzso with the generation of the blocking zzso zzso from zzso at the alpha zzso
