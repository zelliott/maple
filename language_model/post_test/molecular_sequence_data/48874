The zzso status of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from a deep zzso sample from the Sea of Japan, was zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed their affiliation to the zzso zzso with a high sequence similarity of zzso % to both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel strains were characterized by the predominance of the fatty acid zzso : zzso followed by zzso : 1 and zzso : zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso and the polar lipids comprised zzso zzso acid and unknown zzso The zzso zzso value of 88 % between the novel strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed their assignment to the same zzso The values of DNA zzso determined for strain zzso zzso and the closely related strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were 21 % and 23 zzso zzso Based on distinctive zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso it can be concluded that the novel strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is the strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
