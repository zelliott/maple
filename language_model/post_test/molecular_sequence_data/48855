A novel zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a water sample taken from zzso zzso Republic of Korea, during the zzso period of zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso short rods that formed zzso colonies on zzso modified zzso zzso zzso results showed zzso zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso zzso zzso and zzso as major polar zzso 16 : zzso 16 : 0, 17 : zzso and 18 : zzso as major fatty zzso and a DNA zzso content of zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequencing indicated that the strain formed a separate lineage within the order zzso showing similarity values of zzso % with its closest zzso zzso The combined zzso and zzso data showed that strain zzso could be distinguished from all zzso within the order zzso and represented a novel species of a new zzso in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
