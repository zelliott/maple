Among the most zzso zzso hormone systems in zzso are the zzso system zzso and the zzso peptides zzso We examined the zzso and zzso system in the zzso Atlantic zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the relative sensitivity of target zzso to these hormonal systems, we isolated zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We then determined the zzso expression of their zzso in saltwater zzso zzso from local Texas waters and an isolated freshwater population in Lake Monroe, zzso AT zzso was most abundant in zzso tissue from both zzso zzso zzso was most abundant in zzso zzso tissue from both zzso and also highly abundant in the kidney of saltwater zzso zzso This study is the first to report the sequence of an zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso zzso is more similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is further supported by molecular analysis of zzso and zzso proteins demonstrating conservation of zzso zzso acid zzso and motifs in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as an zzso protein provides fundamental insight into the evolution of the zzso zzso
