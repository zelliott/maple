zzso a zzso to great depth can be highly zzso about zzso within an individual or a zzso Here we address the problem of how to zzso the multiple layers of information contained in deep sequencing zzso We propose an interactive zzso web viewer for browsing large data sets of aligned sequence zzso By enabling seamless browsing and fast zzso the zzso program assists the user to zzso information at different levels of resolution, from an overview of a zzso region to fine details such as zzso within the zzso A specific problem, particularly if the sample is heterogeneous, is how to depict information about structural zzso zzso provides a simple zzso representation of paired sequence reads that is more revealing about potential insertions and deletions than are conventional zzso
