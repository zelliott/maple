zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis by an unknown zzso zzso zzso the first dedicated step of zzso zzso and feedback control of its expression maintains the proper balance of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso II zzso zzso responds to zzso zzso When zzso is zzso Pol II zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso at zzso zzso zzso sites, producing attenuated zzso When zzso is zzso Pol II zzso at an zzso further zzso zzso the regulatory zzso to produce zzso zzso A major zzso for zzso zzso initiation at the upstream sites is the presence of zzso at the first and second positions of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of Pol II and in zzso disrupt zzso regulation by altering start site zzso Thus, Pol II initiation can be regulated by the concentration of initiating zzso
