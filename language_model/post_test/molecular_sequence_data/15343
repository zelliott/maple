A significant portion of zzso small zzso zzso is composed by small zzso zzso From zzso to zzso cells, these molecules act as guides in the zzso zzso or zzso of target zzso We used a zzso search program to detect zzso putative zzso of zzso one out of ten zzso produced by zzso a human zzso involved in zzso zzso to cancer and zzso zzso This search led to the definition of a list of zzso fly zzso whose zzso organization, evolution and expression strategy are discussed zzso We report that an intriguing novel zzso named zzso is transcribed as a longer, zzso precursor from the reverse strand of zzso a fly regulatory gene that plays a key role in cell zzso zzso and immune zzso zzso of zzso was found significantly zzso in a zzso strain in which zzso zzso is greatly reduced, suggesting that these two zzso genes may be mutually zzso zzso to its function, zzso concentrated specifically in the zzso bodies, followed a dynamic spatial expression profile during zzso and displayed a zzso zzso element that enables it to target zzso a zzso regulated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that is particularly abundant in zzso
