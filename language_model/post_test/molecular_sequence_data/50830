zzso binding to consensus sequences of the zzso element zzso and the zzso factor binding site zzso were investigated using zzso anterior zzso nuclear zzso Each element showed specific gel mobility zzso By zzso competition for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso binding zzso On the other hand, zzso decreased the zzso binding considerably to zzso suggesting that approximately zzso of the total zzso binding is due to factors which bind to a common site shared by both zzso and zzso whereas proteins binding to zzso alone are zzso Relative binding affinities of zzso against zzso estimated from the zzso competition data were zzso for zzso binding and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso and zzso gave different patterns consisting of different molecular zzso zzso of the relative binding affinities and the multiple molecular size of binding factors, cannot be explained simply by the presence of two types of binding factor, common zzso and specific zzso zzso A more likely explanation is that the zzso factors alter the zzso form by changing each respective partner to bind zzso and/or zzso
