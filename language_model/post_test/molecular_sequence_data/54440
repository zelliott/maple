In this study, sludge was taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant that contained a nearly equal number of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso to bacterial zzso genes zzso zzso and enriched in three zzso zzso receiving an zzso medium containing different ammonium zzso 2, 10, and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso -N zzso zzso and zzso zzso The abundance and communities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria zzso in enriched zzso activated sludge zzso were monitored at days 60 and 360 of the zzso Early on, between day 0 and day 60 of reactor operation, comparative abundance of zzso zzso genes to zzso zzso genes varied among the zzso depending on the ammonium levels found in the zzso As compared to the seed zzso the number of zzso zzso genes was unchanged in the reactor with lower ammonium level zzso zzso while in the zzso with higher ammonium levels zzso and zzso zzso the numbers of zzso zzso genes were zzso By day zzso zzso disappeared from the zzso consortiums in all zzso The majority of the zzso sequences from all zzso at each sampling period fell into a single zzso zzso however, suggesting that the ammonium did not affect the zzso communities under this operational zzso This result is contradictory to the case of zzso where the communities varied significantly among the zzso zzso with a high affinity for zzso were present in the zzso with lower ammonium levels, whereas zzso with a low affinity to zzso existed in the zzso with higher ammonium zzso
