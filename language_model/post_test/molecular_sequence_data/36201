A zzso complementary DNA zzso that encodes protein zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from mouse brain by a combination of reverse zzso and primer zzso The predicted zzso protein consists of zzso zzso acids which are zzso identical to those of rat zzso Northern blots that were zzso with this zzso revealed abundant zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in mouse brain in roughly equal zzso zzso zzso was also abundant in normal zzso zzso and zzso and in several zzso tumor zzso In all other mouse zzso and cell lines that were zzso at least faint levels of zzso zzso could also be zzso In zzso other than brain, the amount of zzso zzso was less, and the smaller species generally zzso Furthermore, in these zzso both zzso zzso appear to be approximately 200 zzso longer than the two zzso found in the zzso When the zzso is expressed in insect cells via a zzso expression zzso a zzso protein is zzso which, unlike other zzso zzso does not bind zzso zzso even at very high zzso
