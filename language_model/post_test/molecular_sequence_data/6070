The zzso protein zzso zzso programmed cell death in such diverse animals as insects, zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso protein is a zzso for and inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, 7) and a zzso for four zzso zzso zzso zzso activities implicated in zzso in zzso A zzso zzso that greatly reduced zzso activity in zzso as a zzso zzso and inhibitor abolished zzso activity in zzso in protecting against cell death in zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso zzso site in zzso into the zzso virus protein zzso which zzso zzso zzso but not programmed cell death in zzso zzso caused zzso to block zzso cell zzso These observations suggest that zzso may prevent programmed cell death in zzso zzso and other species by acting as a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso
