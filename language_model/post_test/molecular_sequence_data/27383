zzso zzso zzso constitute a family of seven structurally similar but zzso distinct proteins produced by different strains of zzso zzso Type A zzso zzso zzso is produced along with 6 zzso associated proteins zzso including zzso zzso through zzso expression of a clustered group of genes to form a complex zzso The presence of zzso enhances the oral toxicity of the zzso zzso zzso makes up the largest fraction of zzso in zzso and strongly protects zzso against zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in its complex form is also used in therapeutic and zzso applications to treat several zzso zzso In this study zzso zzso of zzso in its zzso and complex forms, zzso associated zzso and zzso have been examined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the whole complex reacted 60 times better with the complex and 35 times better with zzso and zzso compared to the zzso zzso suggesting stronger zzso of zzso over that of zzso zzso and a higher potential of zzso and its associated proteins to induce host immune zzso This observation also suggests that zzso and other zzso could potentially be employed as zzso for development of vaccines against zzso and could be a good surrogate for zzso zzso zzso binding zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso raised against zzso indicate that zzso in its zzso and complex forms zzso equal zzso response and a zzso higher zzso response compared to zzso light and heavy zzso We have also discovered a new zzso an zzso zzso present within the complex preparation of zzso which shows dramatically high zzso
