The purpose of this study was to monitor local zzso responses to zzso zzso in calves during primary infection and zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso was collected weekly from zzso infected calves and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso The major finding was a prominent transient increase in zzso zzso zzso compared with that of zzso calves, observed in zzso cells collected zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso worms were also first observed in zzso zzso zzso after zzso were partially immune which was evident at slaughter zzso zzso as a lower zzso burden than in previously zzso calves infected at the same zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells zzso zzso was increased compared with that of zzso animals but not as high as that of primarily infected zzso zzso cell expression of the other zzso tested for was not as clearly zzso by the zzso zzso It seems likely that the strong zzso response observed during primary infection reflects an innate response to the worms that may initiate an ensuing zzso response, which zzso protective zzso
