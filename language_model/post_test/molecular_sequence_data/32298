zzso factor zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso zzso and behavioral responses to zzso We analyzed the zzso promoters of two zzso zzso zzso genes and found them to be remarkably zzso with zzso zzso zzso We found several zzso zzso elements in the zzso zzso genes including a zzso response element zzso zzso protein 1 binding sites, and zzso response zzso Exposure to a physical zzso caused a rapid zzso in zzso zzso binding protein zzso 20 zzso and zzso (1 zzso in the anterior zzso area of juvenile zzso zzso bound to the putative zzso zzso in zzso which was disrupted by point zzso introduced into the zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoters supported zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso caused robust zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso of a zzso zzso reduced zzso promoter zzso Using zzso gene transfer in zzso brain, we show that the zzso zzso promoters support zzso or zzso zzso in zzso which was abolished by zzso of the zzso Using zzso zzso we found that zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso promoter in zzso in a zzso zzso These data provide strong support for the hypothesis that zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso depends on zzso binding to the zzso in the zzso Our findings show that the basic regulatory elements of the zzso gene responsible for zzso zzso arose early in zzso evolution and have been maintained by strong positive zzso
