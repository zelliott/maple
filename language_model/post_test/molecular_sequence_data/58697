zzso zzso I zzso is a family of zzso protein zzso found in all zzso examined to zzso Here, the rat zzso zzso alpha and alpha L were cloned and expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA zzso the zzso unique to zzso alpha L demonstrated that zzso alpha and zzso alpha L arise by the alternative zzso of a common zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, the alpha L zzso is the only known active zzso zzso to contain an insert within its zzso zzso zzso distribution of each zzso zzso was examined by zzso zzso and Western zzso Both zzso were expressed in all zzso tested but at different zzso zzso expressed zzso alpha zzso were active and therefore zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso alpha L proteins were demonstrated to have zzso zzso I zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso zzso proteins exhibited differences in binding and activity toward common zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that the alpha L insert within the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso These kinetic differences suggest that zzso alpha and zzso alpha L may perform different biological zzso
