zzso of small, zzso spore proteins during zzso of zzso zzso spores is initiated by a zzso zzso called zzso Western zzso zzso analysis of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso showed that zzso is zzso at about the third hour of zzso in a precursor form and is processed to an approximately zzso to zzso species 2 to 3 h later, at or slightly before the time of zzso of zzso acid by the zzso This was found with both normal levels of expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso as well as when either protein was zzso up to zzso The zzso processing of zzso was blocked in all zzso zzso and zzso zzso tested zzso of which accumulated zzso zzso but not in a zzso zzso which accumulated zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso initially zzso in zzso were identical to those predicted from the coding zzso zzso However, the processed form generated in zzso lacked 15 zzso zzso or 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence surrounding this zzso zzso site was very zzso to the consensus sequence recognized and zzso by zzso in its small, zzso spore protein zzso This zzso plus the efficient processing of zzso zzso during zzso suggests that the zzso precursor may zzso itself during zzso During spore zzso the zzso from either species expressed in zzso zzso was further processed by removal of one additional zzso zzso acid zzso generating the mature zzso which acts during spore zzso
