We report a new family of bacterial zzso zzso zzso identified in ten proteins of four diverse predatory zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso that zzso zzso their protein molecules by protein zzso and zzso The new, zzso zzso appear with other zzso including putative zzso domain 1 zzso a new domain typically appearing immediately upstream of zzso zzso The zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso includes a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso at its zzso part, and a signal zzso and two zzso kidney disease zzso at its zzso zzso We demonstrate the in zzso transcription, translation, zzso and processing of the zzso zzso zzso and the in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of its zzso zzso Interestingly, whereas the zzso gene is zzso zzso its protein product is zzso processed throughout the zzso life cycle of the zzso zzso zzso The modular structure of the zzso its zzso and complex processing suggest that it may be involved in the interaction between the zzso and its zzso
