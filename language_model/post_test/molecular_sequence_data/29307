In the accompanying study, we show how zzso zzso can be redirected by zzso of short zzso zzso at multiple locations in zzso Here we use this approach to selectively target and destroy human cancer zzso Many cancer cells zzso specific cell surface zzso We have generated zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso envelope derivatives bearing short zzso zzso for zzso protein zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso zzso viruses containing these zzso envelope derivatives selectively zzso human cancer cell lines that zzso the zzso zzso A zzso targeting the zzso zzso can deliver the zzso zzso gene to human melanoma and breast cancer cells, which are killed by the subsequent addition of zzso zzso our results demonstrate that short zzso zzso inserted at appropriate locations in zzso envelope can selectively target zzso to human cancer cells and deliver a zzso relevant zzso
