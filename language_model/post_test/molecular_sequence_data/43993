Among zzso zzso animal zzso the chicken zzso zzso zzso is unique in displaying almost complete selectivity for zzso over other zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso domain zzso from serum zzso protein zzso and of a complex between the zzso from liver zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso were used to model the binding site in zzso zzso of portions of zzso into the zzso framework did not substantially increase zzso A bacterial expression system for the zzso of zzso was developed so that specific zzso predicted to be near the zzso zzso of zzso could be altered by zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso is bound to zzso in the same orientation as it binds to liver zzso A zzso and a zzso zzso that probably contact the the zzso group have been zzso These results, together with studies of zzso zzso suggest that these zzso form part of a binding pocket for the zzso group, which zzso selective binding of zzso
