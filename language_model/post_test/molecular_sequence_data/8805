Six basic proteins of 26 to 38 zzso with zzso points zzso zzso or zzso zzso were abundant in proteins separated by two-dimensional zzso from adult rat zzso mast cells zzso One was identified previously as rat mast cell zzso zzso 1, a zzso of 26 to 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that two zzso of about 29 and 30 zzso had zzso terminal zzso acid sequences zzso to mouse zzso zzso 5 zzso whereas the zzso terminals of the 33, 35, and 36 zzso proteins were zzso to zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso produced against synthetic peptides of the identified zzso terminal sequences were used in zzso zzso At least three proteins reacted with zzso to zzso whereas zzso to zzso detected three adjacent zzso rather than just the two identified by using zzso zzso zzso of zzso side chains using zzso F reduced the zzso of each set of three zzso zzso and zzso to a band of each protein of a lower zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso bound to a zzso of 30 to 35 zzso which is probably zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of proteins from zzso zzso mast cells showed zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso This is the first report of zzso in the rat and of clearly distinguishable zzso forms of zzso zzso These zzso appear to be restricted in their distribution to selected zzso zzso but little is known about their zzso
