zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli is a bacterial protein toxin with an zzso zzso structure, in which the B zzso has a membrane binding function and the A zzso is needed for zzso zzso The zzso crystal structure has been solved using a combination of multiple zzso replacement, fivefold averaging and molecular dynamics zzso Phase combination using all these sources of phase information was of crucial importance for the chain zzso The structure has now been refined to zzso A resolution, resulting in a model containing zzso protein atoms and zzso zzso molecules with a zzso zzso of zzso and good zzso The B zzso are arranged as a highly stable zzso with a zzso zzso Each zzso takes part in approximately 30 zzso hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges with its two neighbors, whilst burying a large surface zzso The A zzso has higher temperature factors and less zzso secondary structure than the B zzso It interacts with the B zzso mainly via the zzso zzso fragment, which runs through the highly charged central pore of the B zzso The pore contains at least 66 water zzso which fill the space left by the zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the contacts between A and B zzso showed that most specific contacts occur at the entrance of the central pore of the B zzso while the contacts within the pore are mainly zzso and water zzso with the exception of two salt zzso Only a few contacts exist between the A1 zzso and the B zzso showing that the zzso zzso functions as a zzso of the A and B parts of the zzso zzso with the A zzso by the B zzso does not cause large zzso from a common B zzso structure, and the zzso symmetry is well zzso A potential zzso site is located in an zzso zzso at the interface of two small sheets in the A1 zzso At the back of this zzso the functionally important zzso makes a hydrogen bond connecting two zzso which seems to be zzso across the zzso toxin zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso is located nearby, close to a very zzso region, which packs two zzso zzso This zzso region may be important for zzso and membrane zzso
