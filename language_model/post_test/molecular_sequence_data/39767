To understand evolutionary paths connecting diverse biological forms, we defined a three-dimensional zzso space separating two flower color zzso of zzso A hybrid zone between zzso showed a steep zzso specifically at genes controlling flower color differences, indicating that these zzso are under zzso zzso species with diverse floral zzso formed a zzso cloud within the zzso zzso We propose that this cloud defines an evolutionary path that allows flower color to evolve while zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso located in different arms of the zzso path yields zzso zzso accounting for the observed steep zzso at hybrid zzso
