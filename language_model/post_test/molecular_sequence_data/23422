zzso p 5 represents a major zzso of zzso grass zzso zzso zzso zzso knowledge about the structures responsible for zzso binding would allow the design of a novel generation of zzso zzso 

We aimed to characterize the zzso zzso of zzso p zzso using zzso display combined with a molecular modeling zzso 

zzso p zzso zzso from zzso of patients with grass zzso zzso was used for screening of a random zzso zzso library displaying constrained zzso 

Fifteen zzso clones that shared sequence motifs and could be grouped into families were selected by using zzso p zzso zzso zzso alignment with the zzso zzso acids of zzso p zzso revealed 3 sequence sections with frequent hits of identical or similar zzso zzso On the surface of zzso p zzso these sections assembled in compact patches, most likely representing zzso zzso zzso whereas no matching clusters were found on the back sides of the 2 zzso p zzso zzso In surface zzso resonance experiments, the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso p 5 could be zzso by zzso peptides up to zzso indicating that they represent true zzso mimics zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was proved in zzso zzso 

The selected zzso facilitated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso p zzso We suggest them to be suitable candidates for the development of an zzso zzso
