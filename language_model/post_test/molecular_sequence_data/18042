Since plasma zzso activates human zzso and in plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso with high molecular weight zzso zzso we determined whether zzso could mediate zzso association with zzso Human zzso were found to possess zzso binding sites for zzso but no zzso was detected at 37 degrees zzso zzso binding to zzso was dependent upon zzso specific, zzso and zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso sites per zzso Furthermore, zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso also served as a zzso for zzso zzso since zzso deficient in zzso have reduced zzso zzso when zzso in plasma deficient in zzso or with zzso zzso Thus, zzso surface zzso may serve as a zzso for zzso zzso inhibited zzso bound specifically and zzso to human zzso zzso zzso zzso was required for binding of zzso to zzso and the addition of zzso (2 zzso increased the binding zzso Excess zzso completely inhibited binding of and displaced labeled zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso with an apparent zzso of 170 zzso and 140,000 zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was not inhibited by the zzso zzso derived from the zzso of zzso nor by the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso but was not inhibited by zzso a zzso to a different domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was not inhibited by zzso These observations were consistent with a further finding that zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso binding to zzso These studies indicate that zzso specifically binds to an zzso zzso zzso on the zzso surface through the zzso terminal of the zzso and that zzso zzso this zzso
