zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso were isolated from mouse zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso resulted in the separation of the zzso zzso into three zzso zzso with no affinity for the gel zzso zzso with low affinity zzso and zzso with high affinity zzso for zzso Whereas zzso contained almost exclusively zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso fraction after removal of the zzso zzso chains were zzso on zzso A majority of these zzso zzso no longer showed affinity for zzso These experiments indicate that the zzso recovered in the zzso zzso is present in hybrid zzso zzso zzso determination demonstrated that the zzso chains were somewhat larger zzso approximately zzso than the zzso chains in the zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso chains in the hybrid zzso were slightly smaller zzso approximately zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso showed that they contained similar amounts zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso at zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis by gel zzso of the zzso components isolated from zzso after zzso treatment showed that a major portion of these contained one zzso chain zzso zzso of the number of zzso and zzso chains in zzso zzso based on zzso composition and zzso chain zzso indicate that all zzso zzso are zzso
