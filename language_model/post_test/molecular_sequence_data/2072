zzso transformed T cells not only express a large number of zzso receptors zzso but also produce a factor named zzso factor zzso that zzso the expression of zzso Based on a partial zzso zzso acid zzso complementary DNA zzso clones for human and mouse zzso were isolated and zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso monkey kidney cells showed zzso inducing activity on zzso cells, which are sensitive for zzso zzso zzso was strongly expressed in zzso T cells lines, but not in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in normal human peripheral blood zzso cells, the expression of zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso suggesting a possible involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed an unexpected relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso involved in many important biological reactions such as the conversion of zzso into zzso or the stabilization of zzso zzso The biological significance of the generation of a zzso potential in zzso zzso and the possible involvement of zzso reduction in the induction of zzso are zzso
