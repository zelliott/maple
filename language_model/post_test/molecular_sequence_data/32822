The zzso protein zzso zzso signaling cascade is critical for regulating plant defense systems against various kinds of pathogen and environmental zzso One component of this zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso has not yet been shown to be induced in plants following zzso attacks, such as those by insects and zzso We describe here a gene coding for a blast zzso zzso and insect zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), which was identified in a library of zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso Two copies of zzso are present in the zzso zzso zzso They zzso a predicted protein with molecular mass 39 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso patterns following zzso of plant hormones such as zzso zzso acid zzso zzso salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso as well as exposure to zzso zzso zzso revealed that the expression of zzso is related to defense response signaling zzso A comparative analysis of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that both were induced by stress-related hormones and zzso zzso but that the zzso of their responses differed despite their high zzso acid sequence identity zzso
