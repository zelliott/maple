Like other zzso zzso receptors zzso the zzso of zzso fish can be subdivided into six major families, each of which recognize a general class of molecular zzso However, there also are a number of zzso with unknown function, the presence of which seems unique to the zzso fish, among which is zzso We identified full-length complementary DNA zzso sequences for zzso of zzso and common zzso two closely related fish zzso zzso have six copies of zzso whereas carp express only a single zzso Both zzso zzso (at least zzso and carp zzso have 26 zzso repeats zzso zzso modeling indicates a best fit to the crystal structure of zzso zzso analyses place zzso in the zzso family closest to zzso and zzso which sense zzso from zzso zzso in the zzso Conservation of genes on zzso zzso 9, which carries zzso with genes on mouse zzso 14, which carries zzso indicates zzso could be a possible zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggests a zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso Although in zzso reporter zzso could not identify a zzso unique to zzso in zzso infection experiments indicate a role for zzso in the immune response of carp to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is mainly expressed in peripheral blood zzso zzso with B zzso in particular, expressing relatively high levels of zzso In zzso stimulation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso supportive of a role for zzso in the immune response to zzso zzso
