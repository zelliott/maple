Despite the primacy of the sodium current in cardiac zzso and evidence that decreased sodium current is zzso in humans, little is known about zzso regulation of the underlying zzso zzso 

We have cloned a zzso zzso segment of zzso region of zzso and identified multiple zzso initiation sites by primer extension and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso and in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were employed to identify promoter zzso zzso stranded zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to screen DNA zzso in the promoter zzso 

The zzso includes zzso zzso of upstream zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1, and a portion of the zzso zzso 1; the region is highly zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso and in zzso cells identified zzso a core promoter in the zzso segment, zzso regions zzso approximately zzso decreases from core promoter activity in the zzso upstream region zzso and zzso and approximately zzso increases in zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso a very strong negative regulatory region between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A core promoter zzso present in zzso zzso of normal zzso screened, increased reporter activity approximately 50% in zzso but not in zzso zzso 

The zzso promoter includes multiple positive and negative zzso elements extending into zzso zzso A common zzso in this region zzso channel expression in zzso
