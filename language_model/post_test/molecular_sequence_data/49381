zzso zzso contain host zzso termed zzso that function to regulate the light environment of their resident zzso by acting as a zzso in excessive zzso We have determined the crystal structure of an intensely blue, zzso zzso to zzso A resolution and a genetically engineered fluorescent zzso to zzso A zzso The zzso zzso structure adopts a markedly different zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso despite the zzso sequences zzso being zzso the zzso ring of the zzso zzso is zzso and in the trans zzso Furthermore, the fluorescent zzso adopted a zzso zzso zzso The data presented here demonstrates that the zzso of the zzso is highly dependent on its immediate zzso
