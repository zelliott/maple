Most examples of positive selection zzso from zzso sequence data involve zzso zzso However, positive selection also promotes the divergence of proteins zzso zzso recognition in marine zzso The zzso zzso has a large zzso zzso containing two proteins of 16 zzso and 18 zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibits zzso in zzso a hole in the egg zzso envelope through which the zzso swims to reach the egg plasma zzso The zzso protein coats the zzso zzso process and probably mediates fusion of the two zzso In this review, we compare sequences of both proteins from five species of California zzso Both proteins show extensive divergence which has been promoted by positive zzso zzso The ratios of zzso to synonymous zzso zzso may be the highest yet discovered for full-length zzso Although extensive divergence has occurred, there is conservation of the shape and polarity of zzso in both zzso The two zzso proteins arose by a gene zzso followed by their extensive zzso Five hypotheses are presented which attempt to explain the nature of the unknown selective force responsible for the robust positive zzso The positive selection may, in some unknown way, be related to the establishment of zzso barriers to zzso Because positive selection promotes the divergence of zzso zzso zzso recognition proteins in both zzso and sea zzso we predict that positive selection may be a general phenomenon in the evolution of zzso recognition systems in marine zzso
