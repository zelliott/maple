zzso structural information about a protein from zzso experimental data is still a zzso challenge to zzso zzso This is because of the low ratio of the number of independent zzso to the number of molecular degrees of freedom, the approximations involved in the different relationships between particular zzso quantities and molecular zzso and the averaged character of the experimental zzso For example, protein zzso data are seldom used for structure refinement because of the zzso and limited accuracy of the zzso relationship linking a zzso to a zzso zzso Moreover, sampling of the large zzso space is still zzso Using the zzso protein zzso as an example we investigated whether use of a zzso zzso force field, inclusion of zzso degrees of freedom, and application of zzso zzso sampling that accounts for zzso averaging produces a more realistic representation of the ensemble of protein zzso than standard zzso refinement in a zzso zzso using restraints that do not account for averaging and are partly based on zzso zzso zzso better agreement with observed experimental data, the protein zzso ensemble is less restricted than when using standard zzso refinement techniques, which are likely to yield a picture of the protein which is too zzso
