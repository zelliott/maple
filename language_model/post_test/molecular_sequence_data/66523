zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso conversion of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso The recent completion of the zzso sequence of zzso major revealed the presence of two genes coding for two zzso of this zzso In zzso analysis showed that one zzso had an extension at its zzso and was predicted to zzso to the zzso The situation is different in other zzso zzso with only one zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso and no zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso The two zzso major zzso genes were cloned in frame with the green fluorescent protein and the resulting fusion proteins showed differential zzso the short form zzso was found in the zzso while the long one zzso was found in an zzso that has hallmarks of the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso had a similar cellular zzso pattern as the zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso genes were expressed zzso in the zzso stage of the zzso and the zzso levels of zzso could be modulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso increased resistance to the zzso zzso and to a lower level to the inhibitor zzso in a rich folate containing zzso These findings suggest that folate metabolism is zzso in zzso and that zzso zzso levels are responsive to environmental zzso
