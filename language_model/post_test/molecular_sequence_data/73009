Several zzso protein zzso including zzso and zzso are known to directly interact with the 90 zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso to detect zzso during a zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso Internal zzso acid sequence information was obtained and used to clone a partial zzso zzso of the zzso sequence to other cloned proteins revealed zzso zzso with a zzso protein and zzso zzso with zzso cell cycle control protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were produced against a zzso fusion protein that recognizes zzso with a high level of zzso These zzso recognize the 50 zzso protein present in zzso and zzso zzso No other proteins were recognized with these zzso suggesting that zzso is a unique zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells indicates a primarily zzso zzso around the nuclear zzso A survey of zzso expression in zzso zzso on a protein zzso revealed the following relative levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso heart zzso kidney zzso liver zzso lung zzso skeletal zzso These results link studies demonstrating zzso of certain zzso with zzso in zzso cells and a number of reports in zzso and zzso demonstrating the importance of zzso in cell cycle and zzso zzso
