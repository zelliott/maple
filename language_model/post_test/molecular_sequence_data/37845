In zzso zzso and zzso occur exclusively at the zzso pocket, a deep zzso of the plasma membrane where the zzso extends from the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso However, structures resembling coated zzso were only identified in zzso form and not in zzso form zzso Due to the apparent absence of coated zzso in zzso the significance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been considered of minimal zzso We show that the zzso pocket associated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso may function as an high density zzso zzso in the zzso form zzso Using zzso zzso we have characterized the process of zzso zzso in zzso form zzso The wild type zzso zzso binds and zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner; the binding and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are inhibited by excess zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation of zzso zzso do not occur at 4 degrees zzso At 28 degrees C, the zzso zzso zzso were efficiently zzso through a process that is inhibited by incubation at 4 degrees C and sensitive to the presence of zzso The zzso and degradation of zzso zzso does not occur in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso These results suggested that the zzso of zzso zzso in the wild type zzso occurs via zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extension of zzso drastically reduced the degradation but not the binding of zzso zzso This result indicated that potential zzso signals may be present in the zzso extension of zzso This is the first time that the importance of zzso zzso in zzso form zzso has been zzso
