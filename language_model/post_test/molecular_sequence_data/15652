zzso zzso has the ability to change its surface zzso profiles zzso The zzso family zzso zzso by the zzso genes are key players in this profile zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has 38 zzso genes that form three gene zzso Most of these zzso genes have an zzso promoter sequence that is responsible for the zzso switching of individual zzso gene zzso Here, we identified the zzso that zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso We focused on two open reading frames of the zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso which show significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso Since genetic tools for zzso zzso are still not developed, we cloned the zzso and zzso genes and expressed them in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The promoter regions of the zzso genes zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were also introduced into zzso zzso and zzso coli cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso of these promoters occurred in the presence of the zzso gene but not in the presence of the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso gene product is the zzso that zzso zzso gene promoter zzso We used a zzso method to detect zzso promoter zzso This method also enabled us to detect zzso of 10 zzso gene promoters in zzso zzso zzso zzso All these promoter zzso occurred at the 12 zzso zzso repeat zzso sequences zzso the promoter zzso The consensus sequence of these zzso was proposed as zzso zzso or zzso zzso G or zzso
