zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso of zzso acid to zzso and zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso and a zzso radical are formed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and internal peptides were zzso The sequence information was used for reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, and a zzso probe was zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso suggested a zzso pair zzso zzso A full-length clone of the zzso zzso zzso gene was obtained by screening of a zzso zzso II library of the fungus zzso zzso The zzso region contained zzso and zzso zzso The gene contained three short zzso and spanned over zzso The deduced open reading frame consisted of zzso which corresponded to zzso zzso acids and a molecular zzso mass of zzso Data base analysis with the gapped zzso zzso showed that 391 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso identical and zzso positive with the zzso domain of zzso zzso H zzso zzso Based on zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was tentatively identified as zzso and the important zzso for zzso as zzso 376 zzso consensus zzso The zzso zzso zzso was tentatively identified as zzso zzso consensus zzso We conclude from zzso and structural similarities that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso likely share common ancestry and may belong to a gene family of fatty acid zzso zzso
