Previous studies from this laboratory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Davenport, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have used the zzso zzso zzso zzso to define two sites on the zzso plasma membrane zzso a zzso site which zzso in several minutes with no loss of zzso activity and a zzso site which zzso in tens of minutes to produce complete zzso of the zzso The slow site is protected when zzso or zzso is bound to the zzso site of the zzso The present study demonstrates that the fluorescent zzso zzso acid zzso can be used to label five of the eight zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides bearing those zzso have been zzso by high performance liquid zzso and located within the known primary structure of the zzso by zzso acid analysis and/or zzso By zzso the zzso with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso before incubation with zzso it has been possible to identify the fast zzso site as zzso and the slow zzso zzso site as zzso Both zzso lie within the central zzso domain of the zzso close to a highly zzso stretch of zzso acids that may be involved in zzso zzso However, all five zzso zzso can be nearly completely modified by the less bulky zzso zzso zzso zzso with less than zzso zzso of zzso zzso thus, none of the five zzso can be considered to play a direct role in the reaction cycle of the zzso
