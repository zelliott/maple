The zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso that is involved in zzso salvage zzso has been cloned by using the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso containing the zzso gene was zzso and shown to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso which is in good agreement with the measured molecular weight of the zzso zzso zzso zzso coli strains harboring plasmids carrying the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of the zzso gene shows similarity to zzso acid sequences of sugar zzso classified in the zzso family stronger than to those of the zzso coli zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and primer extension analysis revealed a zzso transcript and promoter zzso like the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso These results, together with the zzso sequence of the downstream region of zzso suggested that the organization of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The second zzso zzso shows significant similarity to the zzso zzso genes of several organisms, although its function has not yet been zzso The zzso gene was specifically transcribed in the early exponential growth phase, which seems to zzso to the specific zzso zzso activity profile and suggests a role in controlling the zzso zzso level by efficiently recycling zzso when cells are in the early exponential zzso
