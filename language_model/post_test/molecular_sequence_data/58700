In previous experiments, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes have been shown to zzso putative zzso factors essential in zzso In an attempt to investigate expression of these genes during zzso we have performed zzso zzso mapping using zzso prepared from zzso in various zzso zzso Two putative promoters were identified upstream of the zzso coding zzso The promoters significantly differed in their strength, and were active in distinct zzso zzso the weaker, zzso was active only in zzso zzso and the stronger, zzso was induced at the beginning of aerial zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed two apparent zzso start points, both being zzso only in the late phase of aerial zzso zzso No zzso zzso was detected in an zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments from zzso and zzso were inserted into several zzso zzso to give expression patterns consistent with the results of direct zzso zzso The results zzso temporally different expression of zzso and zzso during the differentiation of zzso and direct or indirect dependence of zzso expression on the zzso putative zzso factor, thus indicating a cascade of zzso factors in zzso zzso
