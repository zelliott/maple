The zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein and its zzso zzso zzso seven in zzso zzso are zzso domain proteins that function in zzso zzso zzso complexes and facilitate zzso and degradation of a wide range of cellular zzso including zzso Despite these diverse targets, the means by which zzso recognize zzso or binding proteins has remained zzso Here we identify a zzso motif zzso that mediates the interaction of zzso protein with a range of protein zzso zzso alignment and zzso scanning revealed zzso that are important to this zzso This consensus sequence correctly predicted a zzso interaction with a zzso from the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The unusually zzso binding obtained with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso with zzso suggests that it may serve as a useful dominant negative zzso for zzso zzso
