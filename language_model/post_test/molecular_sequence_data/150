zzso of zzso zzso of diverse organisms revealed that the moss zzso zzso is the most primitive zzso possessing zzso zzso zzso examination of zzso revealed that oil bodies zzso were abundant in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso illustrated the neutral lipids in zzso isolated from the zzso to be largely zzso zzso and zzso and zzso showed the major proteins to be zzso zzso zzso revealed the expression of all three zzso genes to be tissue zzso This tissue specificity was greatly altered via alternative zzso a control mechanism of zzso gene expression unknown in higher zzso During the production of sex zzso at the tips of zzso zzso the number of zzso in the top zzso tissue decreased zzso with increases in the number of zzso and level of transcripts zzso the zzso cycle zzso thus, the zzso are food reserves for zzso In spores during zzso zzso adjacent to zzso along with transcripts zzso the zzso cycle zzso zzso thus, the spore zzso are food reserves for zzso and equivalent to seed zzso The zzso zzso could be observed easily with zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and other zzso zzso expression of various gene zzso transformed into zzso cells revealed that all zzso were linked to the zzso zzso zzso that zzso were zzso in extended regions of the zzso and that two different zzso were zzso in all zzso
