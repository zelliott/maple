zzso zzso induced a set of general stress proteins in response to a salt or heat zzso zzso subjected to a mild heat stress showed a protective response which enabled them to survive otherwise lethal temperatures zzso 52 degrees zzso In a similar way bacteria were enabled to survive toxic zzso of zzso by zzso with lower salt zzso A mild heat shock induced a zzso against lethal salt zzso The zzso of cells with low salt, however, was less effective in the induction of zzso than a preceding mild heat zzso Three stress proteins were identified on the basis of their zzso zzso acid sequences as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The role of general and specific stress proteins in the induction of zzso tolerance and zzso is zzso
