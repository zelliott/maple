The molecular epidemiology of zzso infection was previously studied in Cyprus but the degree of zzso diversity has remained zzso The main objective of the present study is to examine zzso strains isolated from 77 zzso individuals representing 38% of the known infected population in Cyprus in the period 1986 to zzso DNA of the near full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was amplified by zzso zzso from all zzso zzso and zzso using a newly designed zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to determine zzso associations and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the obtained viral sequences indicated that zzso B was the dominant zzso zzso followed by zzso A zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso D, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso originating from the Democratic Republic of zzso zzso were not classified in any pure zzso or circulating zzso form zzso Complete zzso and zzso analyses revealed that one of these zzso had a new, unique zzso pattern, zzso segments of zzso D and G, and is distinct from any other zzso or zzso reported so zzso zzso analyses of the sequence of the second zzso which could not be zzso reveal that it is close to zzso K reference sequences but clusters near the root of the zzso At least two zzso unrelated zzso zzso with an zzso zzso similar to this isolate are required to designate this zzso as a novel zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso to results of the earlier zzso studies, these data exhibit the extensive zzso of zzso infection in zzso which is being fueled by a continuous entry of new strains from other countries, creating an evolving and zzso zzso
