zzso zzso is a leading zzso zzso In contrast to its more aggressive relative zzso zzso it causes chronic rather than acute zzso In highly virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contribute significantly to immune evasion and aggressive zzso by their strong ability to lyse human zzso Members of the zzso family are also produced by zzso zzso but their role in immune evasion is not zzso zzso strong zzso capacity of zzso zzso zzso would be at odds with the notion that zzso zzso is a less aggressive pathogen than zzso zzso prompting us to examine the biological activities of zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that zzso zzso has the capacity to produce zzso a potent zzso zzso representing the first potent zzso to be identified in that zzso However, production of strongly zzso zzso was low in zzso zzso explaining its low zzso zzso Interestingly, the different approaches of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to causing human disease are thus reflected by the adaptation of biological activities within one family of zzso zzso the zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso has the capacity to evade zzso killing, a phenomenon we found is partly zzso by resistance mechanisms to zzso peptides zzso including the zzso zzso which degrades zzso and the zzso zzso regulator, zzso zzso These findings establish a significant function of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso immune evasion and explain in part why zzso zzso may evade elimination by innate host defense despite the lack of zzso toxin zzso Our study shows that the strategy of zzso zzso to evade elimination by human zzso is characterized by a passive defense approach and provides molecular evidence to support the notion that zzso zzso is a less aggressive pathogen than zzso zzso
