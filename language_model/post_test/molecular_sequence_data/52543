zzso growth zzso zzso members play important roles in the early development of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso related proteins 1, 2, and 4 induce muscle zzso from zzso zzso zzso whereas the bone zzso proteins 4 and 7 induce zzso to differentiate as zzso Bone zzso proteins are antagonized by soluble binding proteins such as zzso and zzso which leads to expression of neural cell zzso zzso in animal zzso The transforming growth zzso zzso member zzso zzso 3 also zzso the neural cell zzso zzso through zzso of bone zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso 2 and 3 share a high amount of sequence zzso they lead to very different cell zzso This study investigates the functional zzso that distinguish the activities of these two zzso It was found that mutually exclusive regions of zzso 2 and 3 were required for zzso The central region of the mature domain is required for zzso 2 to induce muscle zzso whereas the zzso and zzso ends of the mature domain are required for zzso 3 to induce neural cell zzso zzso These results help to define the minimal zzso required for the unique activities of these zzso
