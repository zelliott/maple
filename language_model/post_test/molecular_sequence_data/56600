zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to transcribe zzso cloned zzso genes in zzso The extracts were prepared by zzso zzso bodies, obtaining the 10,000 zzso g zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso by treatment with zzso zzso to yield a fraction designated zzso Some in zzso zzso was initiated from zzso promoters and a small amount of zzso was from zzso DNA template in zzso However, optimal zzso from zzso templates required zzso promoter zzso and primer extension analysis indicated that zzso zzso in zzso zzso was initiated from the same start sites recognized in zzso A zzso zzso that was generated against zzso coli zzso 70 and which zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 66 inhibited in zzso zzso of zzso and cloned zzso DNA, suggesting that zzso initiation in the zzso fraction is zzso by zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso based on detection of transcripts of specific lengths was applied to the zzso system; this zzso and others described here should be useful in defining zzso promoters and other zzso regulatory zzso
