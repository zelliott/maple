zzso analysis of part of the fusion protein gene from recent zzso of zzso virus revealed that distinct lineages of the virus exist which reflect the geographical location of their isolation in Africa and zzso Current strains circulating in Kenya and Sudan were most similar, both in terms of zzso sequence and zzso nature, to viruses isolated in Egypt and in Nigeria in zzso and they were quite distinct from an East African isolate zzso from the zzso Two older zzso of the virus, the Japanese zzso vaccine strain dating from the 1930s and the Old zzso strain dating from 1911, each differed considerably from the other zzso The sequence data were derived from the region where the precursor protein is zzso to yield the biologically active zzso zzso all strains zzso had a highly basic connecting zzso which is required for efficient zzso by zzso host cell zzso No correlation was found between zzso acid changes at this site and the zzso virus zzso unlike the association reported for zzso disease zzso
