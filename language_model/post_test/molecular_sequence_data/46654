The zzso small zzso of zzso zzso and zzso constitute a family of the zzso proteins with five zzso motifs zzso domain or zzso zzso in their zzso regions and zzso zzso with variable lengths in their zzso zzso zzso the human DNA data base of expressed sequence tags zzso revealed novel partial sequences similar to, but distinct from, the sequences of the previously known zzso zzso We isolated a zzso clone of near full length by zzso and zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso methods and compared the predicted zzso acid sequence zzso zzso of the novel zzso zzso named zzso with those of known zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is most similar to zzso zzso zzso among the family, particularly in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has a longer zzso zzso domain than any other member of the family, and it contains nine zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso (30 zzso was expressed in various zzso and adherent cultured human cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may play basic roles in zzso signaling irrespective of cell zzso
