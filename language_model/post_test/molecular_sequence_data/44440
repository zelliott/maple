zzso chain reaction zzso zzso complementary to portions of the chicken repetitive element zzso have been used previously to generate useful markers on the chicken zzso linkage zzso To understand better the genetic basis for this technique and to convert zzso zzso to markers useful in physical zzso zzso five zzso zzso zzso were cloned and partially zzso zzso zzso was then employed to clone the corresponding region of the zzso of both the Jungle zzso zzso and White zzso zzso parental DNA zzso Our results demonstrate that some of the zzso zzso arise from zzso at an zzso zzso element, whereas others are due to chance zzso between the zzso primer in use and random zzso sites in the zzso unrelated to a zzso zzso zzso In all five instances, it was possible to identify the sequence difference between the zzso and zzso parental zzso that gave rise to the initial zzso and design zzso zzso primer sets that uniquely detect that zzso In four of the five instances, the zzso was a one or two zzso sequence difference within the primer zzso site, but in the fifth case the responsible difference was outside, but very close to, the zzso zzso In all instances the zzso zzso for the sequence zzso mapped zzso with the corresponding zzso amplification zzso We conclude that zzso provides an efficient and reliable mechanism for zzso mapping in zzso that can correlate linkage and physical mapping zzso
