The recently discovered zzso locus of zzso zzso encodes the cryptic zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso is required for expression of the zzso zzso zzso and functions as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso for zzso expression but were proposed to allow for zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso Here, we show zzso that the zzso protein is membrane bound, zzso that it can complement the zzso S zzso zzso that it can be triggered by zzso zzso zzso that it is zzso to cell zzso and zzso that the zzso expression of zzso and zzso results in cell zzso Apparently zzso and zzso function as a zzso and an zzso zzso This suggests that their roles in zzso zzso by zzso coli are zzso possibly through directed cell zzso
