We report the isolation and characterization of seven nuclear genes zzso zzso zzso zzso in tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The seven genes zzso A, zzso B, C, D, E and zzso fall into three structural classes zzso II, and zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso III restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso analysis demonstrated that the genes reside on zzso 8, and may be clustered within a 165 zzso zzso zzso insert mapping demonstrated zzso E and zzso F (both class zzso and zzso B, D and A zzso I, II and I zzso are grouped within separate zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence was determined for each zzso zzso to zzso revealed that the zzso lack zzso A transcript of about 2 zzso is expected for each zzso Each zzso possesses a region zzso a transit zzso characteristic of zzso targeted to the zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso range in mass from 66 to 71 zzso and predicted mature zzso range from 57 to 62 zzso All the zzso zzso two putative zzso sites characteristic of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Five of the seven zzso possess divergent DNA sequences in their zzso promoter zzso These zzso sequence differences may regulate the differential expression of zzso zzso
