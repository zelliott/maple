zzso zzso zzso switch from flower to zzso production at the end of the flowering zzso The structure of the zzso shoots resembles the abnormal zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thus a candidate gene in the regulation of zzso zzso To investigate this hypothesis, part of the zzso gene (between the second and third zzso was isolated using zzso zzso designed in regions zzso between zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso walking to obtain the complete gene and zzso zzso zzso results showed that the zzso zzso is strongly expressed in zzso zzso zzso and young zzso However, in zzso that had switched to zzso formation, zzso zzso was greatly zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso indicates that this gene is connected to, or part of, the zzso regulatory zzso zzso analysis confirms the zzso of zzso and zzso and indicates that the gene may be useful for zzso reconstruction at the zzso or family zzso
