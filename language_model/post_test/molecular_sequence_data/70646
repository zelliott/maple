The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso has been reported to have complex effects on the production of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, the effects of zzso on the processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso to zzso were examined in zzso cells expressing zzso or the zzso 100 zzso acids of zzso zzso In cells expressing zzso or low levels of zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso at low zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso at high zzso and increased cellular levels of zzso in a zzso manner by zzso zzso zzso Low zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso more dramatically than zzso zzso zzso treatment of cells expressing high levels of zzso did not alter cellular zzso levels and inhibited zzso and zzso zzso with similar zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can be processed both by zzso and by a degradation zzso that is inhibited by low zzso of zzso The data are consistent with zzso of zzso by high zzso of zzso but do not support previous assertions that zzso is a selective inhibitor of the zzso producing zzso Rather, zzso zzso may be more dependent on zzso zzso concentration than zzso zzso
