The activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is required for zzso action of zzso and zzso zzso transport therefore plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso Few analyses have addressed the zzso acid requirements for zzso zzso zzso consists of 12 zzso zzso flanked by two zzso zzso zzso analyses of a related zzso protein have identified an evolutionary extremely zzso zzso zzso which links the zzso domain to a zzso zzso zzso Here, we focused on the sequence requirement of this zzso We zzso four highly zzso zzso acids of the zzso strand zzso to zzso and analyzed the functional consequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso significantly reduced zzso transport activity by zzso whereas the other three zzso displayed normal zzso zzso and cell surface labeling revealed normal trafficking of all four zzso Altogether, our results identify zzso as a critical zzso for zzso transport zzso Furthermore, in view of its evolutionary zzso the data suggest a remarkable tolerance of the zzso transport activity to zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso
