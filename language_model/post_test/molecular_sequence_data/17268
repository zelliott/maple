zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which produces the zzso zzso The complete gene cluster zzso the zzso machinery required for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso gene cluster consists of nine open reading frames zzso zzso to zzso which are transcribed from a zzso regulatory promoter region and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tailoring zzso The zzso zzso the zzso gene cluster in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso were identified, and one of them was found to zzso a protein with zzso to previously characterized zzso zzso zzso are also associated with the structurally related zzso zzso zzso gene clusters derived from three zzso zzso indicating a possible mechanism for the distribution of these zzso gene clusters between various zzso zzso We propose an alternative hypothesis for zzso evolution in zzso based on the results of comparative and zzso analyses of the zzso and zzso gene zzso These analyses suggested that zzso zzso evolved from a zzso zzso zzso The identification of the zzso zzso gene cluster and evolution of zzso in zzso reported in this study may be valuable for future studies on toxic zzso bloom zzso In addition, an appreciation of the natural evolution of zzso zzso pathways will be vital for future zzso engineering and rational design of novel zzso and zzso
