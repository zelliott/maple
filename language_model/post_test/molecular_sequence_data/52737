Representatives of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso have highly derived body plans subdivided into several zzso groups of segments united by a common function and/or zzso The zzso of segments in the zzso the part of the body between head and zzso in both lineages is thought to have evolved independently from ancestors with a distinct head but a zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the trunk zzso genes are expressed in broad overlapping zzso suggesting a zzso ancestral state zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso In comparison, in insects, the zzso genes of the zzso clusters are more regionally deployed into distinct zzso where they serve to control the zzso of the different trunk zzso Thus an originally zzso pattern of zzso gene expression has apparently been modified in the insect lineage associated with and perhaps zzso the observed pattern of zzso Since insects are the only zzso with a derived trunk zzso tested to date, we examined the expression patterns of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that, unlike the pattern seen in zzso these genes are expressed in zzso discrete zzso coinciding with zzso boundaries which are distinct from those of the zzso Our observations suggest that, during the independent zzso in insects and zzso zzso the zzso zzso genes evolved to perform different zzso zzso We also propose that, in each zzso the changes in zzso gene expression pattern may have been important in trunk zzso
