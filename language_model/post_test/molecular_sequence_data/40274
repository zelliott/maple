Four zzso zzso genes were cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso bacteria, namely members of zzso and zzso Three of them were from zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was composed of zzso zzso acids and 57% zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest degree of similarity to two individual zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso identity, zzso The other gene for zzso zzso zzso was shotgun cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest zzso to zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso All zzso zzso belong to zzso zzso family 7, although, they do not show significant similarity to one another with zzso to zzso zzso Among the above zzso the zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso The molecular mass of zzso was around zzso The zzso was remarkably salt activated and showed the highest zzso stability in the presence of zzso zzso favorably zzso zzso zzso in zzso We discussed zzso zzso of family 7 zzso zzso based on their zzso zzso acid zzso
