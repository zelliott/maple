zzso A virus zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso protein that plays important roles during zzso assembly and budding of the zzso To search for zzso protein components that interact with zzso protein and explore the potential roles of these interactions in the zzso of influenza virus infection, 11 independent zzso including zzso zzso zzso a short zzso of the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso factor, were screened from a human cell zzso library using a zzso zzso zzso The interaction between zzso protein and zzso was studied in more zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso region zzso acids zzso of the zzso protein and the five tandem zzso repeats zzso zzso acids zzso in zzso were necessary for the zzso The interaction was confirmed by both zzso zzso pull-down zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso cells inhibited the zzso of zzso into the zzso Taken together, the present data indicate that zzso can interact with the structural zzso protein of the influenza virus, which provides a novel clue toward further understanding of the roles of zzso protein in the interactions between influenza virus and host zzso
