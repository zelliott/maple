zzso zzso strains recently isolated from French zzso zzso were compared with collection strains of the two defined subspecies, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso Six strains isolated from six different regions of France were compared with three strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso including the type strain zzso zzso and four strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso including the type strain zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso For zzso zzso both zzso tests and zzso protein profiles revealed significant differences between the two known subspecies and the French zzso three distinct groups were zzso These findings were further confirmed by random amplified zzso DNA and repetitive zzso zzso zzso methods in which the French zzso were clearly distinguished from the other two zzso zzso analysis of a zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso region zzso a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso confirmed the presence of three distinct zzso The French strains exhibited almost 94 % similarity to the zzso 90 % to zzso and 86 % to zzso sequences of the three collection strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 87, 84 and 80 % sequence zzso respectively, was observed with the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on both the zzso and zzso results, the French strains are proposed to represent a novel subspecies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was designated as the type zzso
