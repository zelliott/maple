Recently we identified a novel 250 zzso protein in zzso that is a zzso for the zzso protein zzso zzso We refer to this protein as zzso for zzso zzso of 250 zzso zzso has a predicted zzso zzso protein zzso domain at its zzso zzso This domain shows some zzso to the GAP zzso for zzso at the zzso zzso of the protein zzso and for zzso in the protein zzso zzso The present study further characterizes zzso The zzso sequence for human zzso is reported, and the sites that undergo zzso upon insulin treatment of zzso have been identified by tandem mass zzso We have found that in zzso zzso exists as a complex with a novel protein of zzso zzso acids known as zzso The complex of zzso with zzso is notably similar to the important regulatory complex of the protein zzso with zzso (the zzso sclerosis zzso in the size of its zzso the location of the GAP domain, and its zzso by zzso In an effort to detect the cellular role of the zzso complex, we generated zzso zzso that largely lack zzso by zzso zzso and examined several zzso zzso The zzso of zzso had no effect on insulin zzso of the zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso or zzso or on zzso zzso zzso and it had only a slight effect on zzso zzso zzso
