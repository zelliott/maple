Although both zzso zzso B and E have been identified from infected individuals in zzso zzso E is the main form of zzso currently circulating in the zzso zzso zzso sequences were obtained from 2 early zzso from northern Thailand in a study to learn more about the zzso sequences currently being transmitted among recently infected zzso zzso zzso was a female prostitute who tested negative for zzso to zzso in April 1993, then positive in July zzso zzso zzso was a male military conscript who tested negative for zzso to zzso in May 1993, then positive in November zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were collected from these two individuals in January 1994 and about zzso segments containing the full-length zzso gene were amplified by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of full-length zzso from the subjects were zzso E based upon zzso zzso The zzso sequences from the 2 zzso appeared more diverse than previously published zzso E zzso sequences from zzso Overall, however, the zzso E zzso zzso sequences from Thailand were less diversified compared to the zzso E zzso isolated from people with AIDS in the Central African zzso Most of the observed zzso acid variations were limited to the 5 variable regions in zzso zzso vaccine strategies which elicit immune responses to the zzso regions of zzso zzso protein will have a greater possibility of zzso
