The zzso system of the zzso fungus zzso zzso contains a recently discovered zzso that may zzso the zzso linkage between the zzso acid of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso named zzso was zzso to zzso with a molecular mass of zzso 58 zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity was optimal at pH zzso and 60 degrees zzso The zzso displayed a narrow pH range stability at pH zzso and retained 50% of its activity after 430 and zzso zzso at 50 and 55 degrees C, zzso The zzso was active on zzso containing zzso acid zzso zzso showing a lower zzso efficiency on zzso zzso than its zzso counterparts reported in the literature, which is typical of zzso zzso zzso was proved to be a modular zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis provided zzso mass and sequence information that facilitated the identification and zzso of zzso as a family 15 zzso zzso that showed the highest zzso with the hypothetical zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso CBS zzso This work represents the first example of the zzso and identification of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso
