In zzso many zzso contain a common zzso terminal zzso zzso This zzso the spliced leader zzso is acquired from a small zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso via zzso Parallel in zzso and in zzso experiments have begun to clarify both the mechanism and biological role of zzso In zzso analysis (in cell free zzso has shown that zzso is remarkably similar to the zzso zzso removal of intervening sequences from zzso zzso Additionally, this analysis has suggested a mechanism that may explain how the two zzso of zzso (the zzso zzso and zzso efficiently associate with one another in the absence of sequence zzso In zzso experiments suggest that a major biological function of zzso in zzso may be to process zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from the study of both zzso and zzso species are discussed, and zzso in zzso is compared and contrasted to the analogous process in zzso zzso
