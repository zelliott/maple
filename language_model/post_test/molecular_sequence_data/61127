A zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso approach based on the variation in zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso gene was used to assess genetic zzso in 26 populations and zzso of the Mediterranean fruit fly zzso zzso zzso Beginning with the zzso zzso zzso zzso method to amplify zzso of this zzso five zzso were identified on the basis of DNA sequence zzso Several of these zzso affect recognition sites for the restriction zzso zzso and zzso Using these zzso in successive zzso of the zzso products, each of these zzso can be identified directly from zzso From this, surveys were conducted to document zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso The relationships of existing populations and the invasion process represented by new zzso of the zzso were zzso using a principal coordinate analysis and the zzso method to zzso the distribution of genetic diversity at different levels in a zzso zzso From these results, a framework of genetic relationships among the populations and zzso is zzso In addition, for at least some of the zzso populations that are probably acting as sources of origin have been zzso
