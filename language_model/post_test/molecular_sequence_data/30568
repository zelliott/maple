The rat zzso zzso gene is regulated by zzso zzso and codes for a zzso protein zzso zzso and Mr zzso that is believed to be involved in zzso Recent studies have identified at least five zzso I hypersensitive sites zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso The zzso site is situated immediately adjacent to the zzso initiation zzso We have isolated a DNA zzso zzso which contains a portion of the zzso site to examine the binding of nuclear proteins to zzso zzso zzso I zzso studies demonstrated that material extracted from zzso zzso with zzso M zzso contained zzso zzso factors zzso to be zzso which bind to zzso DNA between positions zzso and zzso zzso relative to the zzso initiation zzso zzso of the binding activity with a synthetic zzso identical to the protected sequence indicated the formation of at least three zzso zzso The DNA binding activity of the zzso binding protein or proteins correlated with the zzso regulated expression of zzso Although the zzso sequence of zzso closely resembles the binding site for the zzso zzso factor zzso competition studies attempting to zzso protein binding from the zzso sequence with DNA fragments containing the zzso binding motif were zzso In zzso zzso zzso studies suggested that the DNA zzso zzso to zzso containing the zzso site promotes the zzso of the zzso gene in an orientation zzso The in zzso zzso activity of the zzso DNA containing the zzso sequence was significantly higher in zzso extracts from zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso In zzso our findings indicate that the DNA binding activity of proteins which bind to zzso site is influenced by the zzso status of the zzso
