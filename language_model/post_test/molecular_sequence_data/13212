In immature T cells the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is rearranged and expressed before the zzso zzso zzso At this stage zzso beta chain can form zzso zzso with the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso Using the recently isolated zzso zzso zzso as a probe, we have isolated the human zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence predicts a mature protein of 282 zzso consisting of an zzso zzso domain, a connecting zzso a zzso region, and a long zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparison of human zzso with the mouse zzso zzso reveals high sequence zzso in the zzso as well as the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso region differs in zzso acid composition and in length from the zzso zzso The human zzso gene is expressed in immature but not mature T cells and is located at the zzso region of the short arm of zzso zzso
