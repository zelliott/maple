We analyzed the higher level zzso of the bee family zzso based on the coding regions of three zzso nuclear genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso zzso Our combined data set consisted of zzso aligned zzso sites zzso base pairs zzso for LW zzso 405 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We included 58 species of zzso bees from 33 zzso representing all zzso and tribes, and rooted the trees using seven zzso from other bee families: zzso zzso zzso and zzso We analyzed the separate and combined data sets by a variety of methods, including equal weights zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso zzso Analysis of the combined data set produced a strong zzso signal with high zzso and Bremer support and high zzso probability well into the base of the zzso The zzso recovered the zzso of the zzso and of all four zzso and both tribes, recovered relationships among the zzso and tribes zzso with zzso and provided robust support for the relationships among the numerous zzso in the tribe zzso zzso zzso zzso Using our combined zzso data set, several recently described zzso fossils from the zzso and zzso and recently developed zzso methods, we estimated the zzso of major zzso within the zzso Our results indicate that each of the four zzso arose well before the zzso boundary and suggest that the early radiation of zzso bees involved substantial zzso American interchange roughly zzso with the separation of these two zzso in the late zzso This combination of zzso nuclear genes is capable of recovering zzso zzso in bees with high levels of zzso We propose that LW zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be useful in resolving relationships among bee families and other zzso insect zzso
