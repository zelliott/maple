We describe a confidence test for branching order that can aid protein zzso reconstruction as well as the evaluation of the optimal zzso It is proposed that the process resulting in the observed zzso acid zzso differences, which is the basis for the identification of the order and relative times of divergence events, is appropriately described by a modification of the negative zzso zzso The relative total numbers of zzso zzso and zzso which result in a given number of zzso acid differences, may be obtained as the expectation of this zzso The associated zzso enable significant differences in tree branching order to be zzso If the total rates of zzso of the genes zzso the compared proteins are equal, the expected total zzso and their associated zzso map zzso to their relative times of zzso In addition, significantly different rates of change zzso to differences in total zzso rate and/or acceptance zzso may be identified without the requirement of outlying reference zzso The method is equally zzso to zzso derived from DNA or zzso sequence zzso
