zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups on zzso sugar chains of zzso which play important roles in many biological events, including the proliferation and migration of cancer zzso A previous zzso study reported that this gene is expressed by zzso treatment in breast zzso In this study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms and biological functions of zzso zzso zzso Our data showed that zzso expression of zzso is localized in zzso compartments and in the plasma zzso In addition, zzso has an zzso activity involved in the production of the zzso zzso The result from a promoter zzso and zzso zzso revealed that 3 different zzso response elements zzso in the zzso promoter are critical for responsiveness to zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding blocker zzso inhibit the expression of zzso zzso However, the zzso of signal molecules relating to the zzso pathway, including the zzso coupled zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso had no zzso effects on zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene and the zzso of membrane zzso function resulted in the significant zzso of zzso proliferation of zzso zzso Considering these results, we propose that zzso regulates the expression of zzso through the direct binding of zzso to zzso and that the expressed zzso plays a crucial role in the proliferation of zzso cells through its activity as a membrane zzso
