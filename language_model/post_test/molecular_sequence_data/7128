Three unique zzso untranslated regions zzso have been characterized for human zzso zzso zzso zzso All three zzso shared a common zzso sequence adjacent to the zzso coding region and then zzso zzso The size of the unique upstream sequence was zzso zzso or 104 zzso zzso of zzso DNA demonstrated that the zzso zzso span multiple zzso The unique region of the zzso recognizes a zzso and a zzso zzso transcript in zzso zzso isolated from human MSN cells, and zzso analysis demonstrated that each unique zzso is contained in multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on MSN zzso isolated from zzso demonstrated that all three of the zzso contained within multiple zzso transcripts were associated with zzso and hence zzso zzso from human fetal spinal zzso and adult brain zzso demonstrated that all of the zzso are expressed at these zzso time zzso
