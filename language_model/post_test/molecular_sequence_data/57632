zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso of zzso zzso zzso that were replication defective zzso The parental zzso plasmids contained a zzso that zzso promoter zzso for zzso of zzso a zzso zzso of translation of the essential zzso replication initiation protein of zzso The zzso zzso also introduced a nonsense zzso into a leader zzso gene that precedes and slightly zzso the zzso translation initiation site in the zzso This reduced the rate of synthesis of zzso by zzso its translation from that of the leader zzso The reduced rate of zzso synthesis was responsible for the zzso zzso All zzso zzso retained the zzso zzso and contained zzso zzso responsible for suppression of the zzso zzso One zzso zzso contained a second zzso adjacent to the zzso sequence of zzso Another zzso zzso contained a zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso By using zzso zzso gene zzso it was found that both kinds of zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso to a level sufficient to support zzso In both cases, the synthesis of zzso remained zzso from that of the leader zzso The zzso zzso increased the rate of leader zzso translation of zzso zzso and also reduced the sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and increased the rate of zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso were used to assess the range of regulation of expression of zzso provided by each of the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso By constructing zzso that contained various combinations of the zzso the contributions of the zzso and zzso regulatory circuits were assessed with respect to control of zzso copy number and stable zzso zzso that lacked either circuit were less stable than zzso zzso
