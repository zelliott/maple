zzso formation in association with the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster is a serious problem in zzso infections of zzso zzso In all 112 zzso zzso strains tested, the zzso genes were present, and none of these strains formed zzso The zzso formation is known to be zzso by environmental zzso We have found about zzso of phase variation in these strains with treatment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, this zzso disappeared without these zzso zzso we have constructed stable zzso zzso through a passage culture zzso To explain the mechanism of this variation, zzso changes of zzso genes were tested in strain zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso No differences of DNA sequence in zzso genes were found between the zzso Additionally, molecular analysis of three regulatory zzso the accessory gene regulator zzso and the zzso accessory regulator zzso and in addition, alternative zzso factor zzso B zzso was zzso The data of Northern zzso and zzso showed that zzso plays an important role for this zzso variation in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso indicated three point zzso in the zzso zzso especially in the stop zzso and two point zzso in the zzso zzso This study shows that this variation of zzso formation in zzso zzso is deduced by the role of zzso not zzso and zzso
