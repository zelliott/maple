zzso the major zzso zzso from the human malaria zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso development and is considered a promising zzso zzso In order to facilitate the zzso screening of zzso zzso from natural sources, we developed an economic and zzso zzso system in zzso coli using a zzso zzso zzso Very high expression levels zzso of total host zzso were observed when zzso expression was induced with zzso zzso zzso in several zzso coli zzso with the highest level observed for zzso A lower expression zzso of total host zzso was observed when zzso was grown in zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso as zzso However, the culture grew to notably higher cellular density, increasing zzso times the overall yield of the system when compared with conventional zzso Although several conditions were modified to achieve the expression of soluble and active zzso the zzso was mainly obtained in the form of zzso zzso After zzso and zzso zzso zzso of active zzso were obtained per liter of culture at low cost using a regular incubator zzso and zzso zzso exhibited structural and functional characteristics very similar to the natural zzso Due to its versatility and zzso this strategy can be zzso adapted to other proteins from zzso species or any other zzso with an zzso zzso
