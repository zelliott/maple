Three factors that bind to the positive regulatory region zzso of the zzso alpha zzso gene were shown to be present in growing zzso cells as shown by the gel zzso zzso pattern in which three specific complexes zzso C2 and zzso were zzso The complexes are similar to those observed in zzso cell nuclear extracts in which zzso substitution zzso in the competitor gave parallel specific effects in both zzso During the process of the cell growth cycle, the relative mobility of zzso was altered, and the amount of C1 decreased in the zzso zzso All three complexes zzso C2 and zzso disappeared and other specific complexes with higher zzso were alternatively observed at 6 h after serum stimulation and zzso The expression of the zzso for the alpha zzso gene was zzso at zzso and gradually increased after serum zzso These results suggest that different sets of factors are responsible for the zzso of the gene at different stages of the cell zzso
