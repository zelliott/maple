zzso of the zzso neutral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso neutral zzso of zzso zzso zzso were produced by means of zzso zzso and the effects of the zzso on zzso were zzso zzso were designed to alter the interaction between the middle and zzso zzso of these zzso In all zzso a cluster of zzso contacts centered around zzso 315 contributes to this zzso In zzso zzso (like zzso a 10 zzso zzso covering the domain zzso makes an additional zzso The zzso zzso at position 315 was replaced by smaller zzso zzso In addition, the zzso was deleted from zzso and inserted into zzso The changes in zzso observed after these zzso confirmed the importance of the zzso cluster and of the zzso for the structural integrity of zzso Combined zzso showed that the effects of individual zzso affecting the interaction between the zzso were not zzso The effects on zzso decreased as the strength of the zzso interaction zzso The results show that once the zzso interface is sufficiently zzso additional stabilizing zzso at the same interface do not further increase zzso The results are interpreted on the basis of a model for the zzso zzso of neutral zzso in which it is assumed that zzso results from the occurrence of local unfolding processes that render these zzso susceptible to zzso
