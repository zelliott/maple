The application of zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso to the analysis of zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso is zzso A new zzso zzso mass zzso has been applied for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso of the protein bovine serum zzso zzso The improved zzso frequency stability and reduced frequency shifts observed over a wide range of trapped zzso population sizes provide the ability to signal average zzso without degrading mass measurement zzso requiring internal zzso or advanced data processing schemes to compensate for variations in zzso zzso signals brought about by different population zzso A total of 100 zzso were zzso leading to the observation of a total of 123 isotope zzso with a zzso ratio greater than zzso From those zzso 86 can be ascribed to zzso fragments of zzso on the basis of mass measurement errors of 10 zzso or zzso Of these, 71 were within 2 zzso error limits corresponding to complete zzso acid sequence coverage and an average error of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso are feasible for a large number of species detected simultaneously without the necessity for internal zzso and indicate the potential of such zzso when combined with zzso zzso for zzso more rapid identification of large numbers of zzso
