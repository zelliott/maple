The integration activity of human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso was characterized in zzso by using zzso zzso zzso The highest level of integration activity was found at pH zzso to zzso while the zzso activity was highest at pH zzso to zzso Although the zzso and integration reactions are consecutive in zzso integration, our result indicates that the optimal conditions of the two reactions are quite zzso In addition, it is suggested that the zzso and integration steps can be separated by control of the cellular zzso state in zzso zzso Strong integration was detected in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso but weak integration at around 10 zzso zzso zzso This observation explains that the zzso zzso is preferred to the zzso zzso as a zzso in the integration zzso Although there was no zzso in the integration site of the target DNA, integration was found to frequently occur at particular regions of the target zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso which had been reported zzso were shown to lose integration activity completely, indicating that these zzso are critically involved in zzso zzso
