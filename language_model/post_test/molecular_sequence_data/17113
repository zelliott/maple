The zzso solution structure of a highly stable zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso de zzso designed zzso zzso three zzso repeats per zzso stabilized by zzso contacts within the core and zzso interactions at the interface crossing the zzso core which direct zzso zzso This zzso domain has previously been shown to have high zzso content as well as possessing a low zzso constant zzso zzso The zzso structure is completely zzso and is an zzso zzso in solution, as determined using a combination of zzso and zzso based structural zzso This structure provides a structural framework for visualizing the important interactions for stability and zzso which are key to protein engineering applications such as affinity zzso and de zzso zzso
