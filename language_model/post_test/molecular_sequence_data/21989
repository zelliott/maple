Whereas there have been extensive studies of the expression of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso nothing is known about the zzso zzso of zzso transcripts and zzso In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of two full-length zzso zzso and of their zzso promoters in zzso zzso The comparison of the relative transcript levels of the zzso and zzso genes in developing and adult muscles is highly suggestive of specific functions for the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed the first zzso transcripts in the more differentiated anterior zzso of the zzso when the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso begins to be zzso zzso zzso zzso later extended zzso but was never detected in the zzso zzso zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso protein accumulated in zzso zzso slightly after zzso zzso
