We report an enigmatic zzso zzso reaction zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that occurs in neat zzso solution around neutral pH utilizing a totally unprotected zzso zzso containing free zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a chain of zzso steps between pH 6 and 8 at 4 degrees C, producing a gamut of zzso zzso zzso through zzso or zzso of a native protein segment zzso zzso derived from zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested the absence of strong interaction between the reacting zzso The circular zzso zzso of zzso through zzso showed zzso enhancement of secondary structure in the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of a zzso to an zzso resulted in a product that was more structured than its zzso The relative zzso stability of the zzso was reflected in their ability to resist zzso indicating that the zzso reaction was facilitated as a consequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso reaction proceeded in two zzso formation and zzso of the zzso followed by a fast phase of zzso zzso that the zzso trap encountered in the zzso reaction was a zzso zzso The zzso substitution at any position of the zzso sequence was zzso suggesting that the first step of the zzso zzso namely the zzso reaction, that proceeded very slowly even with the parent zzso was quite sensitive to zzso acid zzso In contrast, the zzso reaction of an Ala zzso zzso occurred in much the same way as zzso albeit with faster rate, suggesting that Ala substitution stabilized the overall zzso zzso zzso The results suggest the viability of the zzso zzso zzso as a mechanism to achieve zzso zzso of totally unprotected zzso fragments in neat zzso zzso Further, the study projects the presence of considerable innate synthetic potential in zzso zzso zzso rich possibilities of protein engineering of this zzso to generate a zzso zzso zzso
