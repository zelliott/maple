Several studies have reported a correlation between expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso hydrocarbon zzso responsiveness in human breast cancer cell zzso zzso cells are zzso and zzso however, initial studies showed that zzso induced zzso zzso levels zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso in high passage zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with an zzso zzso In contrast, no induction responses were observed in low passage zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso responsiveness of zzso compared to zzso zzso cells was associated with a zzso increased expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that the apparent molecular weight of the zzso zzso zzso transcript and zzso protein were comparable in zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso In contrast, zzso analysis of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso protein showed that zzso cells expressed the expected zzso transcript, whereas a zzso transcript was the major product in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed that zzso cells primarily expressed a zzso zzso form of zzso whereas a dominant zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso Complete sequence analysis of the zzso form of zzso revealed a major deletion of the zzso region of the protein zzso 330 to zzso Like zzso cells, the zzso zzso transcript was detected in zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas the zzso zzso zzso was dominant in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that expression of this protein may be useful as a zzso factor in breast zzso
