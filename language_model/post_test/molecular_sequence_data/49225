In the developing spinal cord, motor zzso acquire zzso zzso identities that can be recognized by distinct profiles of zzso zzso factor zzso The mechanisms that direct the differentiation of motor zzso zzso zzso from an apparently uniform group of motor zzso zzso remain poorly zzso In the chick zzso the zzso class zzso protein zzso is expressed selectively by motor zzso zzso and has been implicated in the zzso of motor zzso zzso We show here that zzso expression persists in zzso motor zzso that populate the median motor column zzso whereas its expression is rapidly extinguished from lateral motor column zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso The extinction of expression of zzso and the related zzso protein zzso from zzso motor zzso appears to be required for the generation of CT zzso but not for zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso are likely to mediate the suppression of CT zzso generation that is induced by the zzso HD protein zzso Finally, zzso appears to regulate motor zzso identity by acting as a zzso zzso providing further evidence for the key role of zzso repression in motor zzso zzso
