zzso is a zzso snake zzso protein that zzso von zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso We have cloned zzso for a zzso from a zzso library of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso having a high similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells, showed zzso activity comparable to natural zzso In a single zzso expression experiment, a zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso and it showed reduced, but apparent, zzso zzso zzso Ala scanning zzso showed that zzso at zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso with the zzso A1 domain and zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso are located near zzso and zzso of zzso respectively, and that zzso is in proximity to zzso of the A1 zzso Our results indicate that these charged zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso have a preferential role in the activity of zzso Since it has been time-consuming and difficult to obtain homogeneous zzso from natural zzso zzso zzso has potential benefits for clinical and basic investigations into zzso and zzso as a standard zzso
