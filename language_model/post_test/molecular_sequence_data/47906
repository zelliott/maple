The locus of zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli encodes a type III zzso system, an outer membrane protein zzso zzso the product of zzso ) and zzso a zzso protein that becomes a host cell zzso for zzso Many type III zzso proteins require zzso which function to stabilize zzso prevent inappropriate zzso interactions and aid in zzso An open reading frame located between zzso and zzso previously named zzso was predicted to zzso a protein with partial similarity to the zzso zzso zzso We examined the potential of the zzso gene product to serve as a zzso for zzso The zzso gene zzso a 15 zzso zzso protein that specifically zzso with zzso as demonstrated by the zzso zzso zzso column binding and zzso zzso An zzso zzso was defective in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso but was unaffected in expression of other zzso zzso zzso appeared to stabilize zzso levels in the zzso but was not absolutely necessary for zzso of zzso Based upon the physical similarities, zzso characteristics and the demonstrated interaction with zzso zzso is zzso as zzso for the zzso for zzso coli zzso of T zzso
