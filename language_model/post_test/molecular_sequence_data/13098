The purpose of these studies was to identify zzso activities required for the production of zzso oxide in zzso zzso exposed to zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso The in zzso treatment of zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso resulted in production of zzso which was inhibited by addition of the specific zzso 1 and 2A zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso A, and zzso (but not the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso NO zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein (without zzso of their zzso The zzso and zzso of control zzso contained large amounts of zzso activities that were inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso activities are involved in the regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
