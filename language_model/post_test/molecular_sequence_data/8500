zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso consisting of two identical zzso chains linked by a zzso zzso The unique biological activities of zzso include its potent zzso and zzso inducing properties specific for the vascular zzso zzso is implicated in tumor zzso wound healing, and the stimulation of collateral vessel formation at the site of zzso zzso zzso in order to produce large quantities of biologically active zzso a zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in a zzso expression zzso The coding region of zzso was isolated from zzso cells by zzso zzso and then cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the medium as a zzso zzso zzso reacted to zzso raised against the zzso and zzso synthetic zzso of human zzso As much as zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be obtained from the zzso expression zzso The zzso protein was biologically active in inducing vascular zzso cell proliferation in zzso and zzso changes in zzso
