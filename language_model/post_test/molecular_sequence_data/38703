Three full-length zzso from alfalfa zzso coding for zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso coli and characterized as zzso zzso zzso The zzso were specific for zzso zzso and zzso acids and did not use the zzso zzso as zzso Because alfalfa contains both zzso this indicates the presence of two different types of zzso zzso each specific for one kind of zzso The zzso contain zzso zzso acids (54 zzso and contain an unusual, zzso zzso sequence of 22 zzso zzso which strongly reduces the zzso zzso The only known zzso of a zzso zzso (from zzso zzso was considered to be a transit zzso The reduced zzso activity, however, indicates that the zzso zzso with zzso extensions could be zzso This hypothesis is supported by the fast release of zzso zzso products by plants upon zzso One of the zzso showed a strongly decreased zzso and zzso compared to the other zzso Because this is probably due to the substitution of zzso by zzso the zzso at position 377 seems to be zzso This is the first time that sufficient quantities of zzso zzso have been obtained for characterization studies, by zzso difficult zzso procedures and degradation of the zzso The high expression level, easy zzso good stability and high specificity make these cloned zzso zzso excellent tools to study the reaction mechanism and zzso We zzso an integrated reaction zzso based on the known chemistry of zzso zzso zzso This is the first mechanism that zzso all observed features of zzso zzso
