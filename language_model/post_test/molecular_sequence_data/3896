The transition from zzso to zzso growth is an essential process in the life cycle of zzso Plant floral induction pathways respond to both environmental and zzso cues and much has been zzso about these genetic pathways by studying zzso of zzso zzso zzso are plant growth regulators important in many aspects of plant growth and in zzso they promote zzso Here we provide genetic evidence that zzso inhibit flowering in zzso A zzso dwarf zzso derived from the zzso cell layer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso along the length of the shoot where zzso are normally zzso The zzso gene associated with the zzso is a zzso of the wheat zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso 6) and the zzso gene zzso insensitive zzso The conversion of zzso to zzso in the zzso demonstrates that the zzso zzso is a modified zzso inhibited from completing floral development by zzso
