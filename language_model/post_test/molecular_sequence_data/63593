Although the zzso factor zzso plays an essential role in zzso layer formation and zzso in the developing zzso cortex, the mechanisms by which it accomplishes these regulatory functions are largely zzso zzso and the zzso family zzso factor zzso which is presumed to play a role in the zzso of a zzso of layer 5 projection zzso are expressed with a prominent zzso to zzso zzso in cortical zzso In the absence of functional zzso zzso do not express zzso and the zzso zzso lacks zzso layer 5 zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso regulation of zzso and provide evidence that zzso is a direct target of zzso 

We identified and analyzed the regulatory function of an zzso zzso upstream DNA sequence in the putative mouse zzso zzso Three potential zzso binding sites were identified in this zzso We found that the presence of one of these sites is necessary and sufficient for full zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso cells, while other still unknown factors appear to contribute to zzso promoter activity in cortical zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso which is expressed at the highest level in zzso of the zzso cortex, exerts zzso control of zzso activity, thus specifying a zzso of layer 5 projection zzso 

We conclude that the genetic interplay between the zzso factors, zzso and zzso is responsible, in part, for the regional zzso of a distinct zzso of layer 5 projection zzso
