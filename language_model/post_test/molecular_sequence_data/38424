zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso zzso into the culture zzso when cultivated in a medium containing zzso zzso zzso whereas the removal of zzso zzso resulted in a low zzso After concentration of the culture zzso by zzso with ammonium zzso the induced zzso were zzso by sequential zzso Four different zzso A, zzso zzso and B3 with molecular masses of 35, 47, 58, and 64 zzso respectively, were zzso All zzso showed similarities in their kinetic parameters when observed with zzso zzso including an optimal pH of zzso and an optimal temperature between zzso degrees zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso at similar rates to that of zzso zzso whereas group B zzso zzso both zzso in much lower zzso From analyses of the reaction products, it is most likely that zzso A and all group B zzso zzso the zzso tested in an zzso However, group B zzso were distinct from zzso A in possessing high zzso zzso From zzso terminal sequencing, zzso zzso zzso and B3 were shown to have almost identical zzso which differed from that of zzso zzso The similarities in the reaction modes and zzso terminal sequences among zzso zzso zzso and B3 suggest that these zzso may be derived from a zzso precursor protein through zzso zzso
