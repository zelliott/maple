The zzso element zzso from zzso zzso encodes the putative zzso protein zzso The zzso gene is interrupted by the functional group II zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso is required for synthesis of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso A zzso genetic zzso was developed to identify zzso zzso that affect zzso In this zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a shuttle zzso carrying the zzso region, including the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso provides zzso zzso of the transfer zzso of zzso zzso zzso within zzso either in the zzso zzso or in the zzso protein gene zzso were generated in the context of zzso When these zzso were tested in the zzso zzso significantly reduced mating was zzso zzso molecular analysis of in zzso zzso activity confirmed that the observed mating defects resulted from reduced zzso Once the system was validated for the engineered zzso random zzso of the zzso followed by genetic and molecular screening for zzso defects resulted in identification of point zzso that affect zzso
