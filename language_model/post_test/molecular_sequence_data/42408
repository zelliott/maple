In human zzso expression of zzso is confined to zzso cells zzso whereas zzso expression has been observed in zzso cells of the zzso as well as the zzso In zzso zzso expression of zzso at the cell surface appears to exclude expression of either zzso or zzso despite continued zzso of the latter zzso In order to determine whether this mechanism might be operative in human skin, we have compared the expression of zzso and zzso on the surface of zzso and zzso zzso cells to their expression at the level of zzso using a combination of zzso zzso zzso northern zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso By both zzso and Northern zzso zzso expression was observed in both zzso and zzso cells, whereas expression of zzso was confined largely to the zzso Moreover, as shown by zzso zzso selection and zzso zzso and zzso were both expressed on zzso zzso but were absent from other zzso cell zzso These results argue against cell surface exclusion as a mechanism for selective expression of zzso in human zzso
