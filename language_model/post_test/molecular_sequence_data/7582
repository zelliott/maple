Human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection of the zzso and zzso cells of the central nervous system has been proposed to contribute to zzso zzso Recently it was shown that differences in the zzso sequence of the long terminal repeat zzso of different zzso strains govern the zzso pattern of viral zzso The zzso from central nervous zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso directs expression in the zzso of transgenic mice, in contrast with the zzso zzso zzso By in zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso interference experiments, we have studied the interactions of host cell proteins from human zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells with the zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso belonging to the nuclear zzso family bind with different affinities to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso factor present in the various cell types was unable to recognize the zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso putative binding zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso components of zzso interact with the zzso zzso sequence located in the zzso to zzso region of both zzso zzso These interactions were cell type specific, since they were detected only with extracts from zzso and zzso cells and not from zzso or zzso zzso zzso experiments further revealed that the zzso to zzso sequence is able to mediate zzso zzso zzso in zzso and not zzso zzso
