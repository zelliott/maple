Several zzso acid bacteria were isolated from bitter tasting zzso in which zzso was partially zzso The degradation of zzso via zzso zzso zzso was found in 22 out of 67 zzso The confirmation of zzso degradation by this zzso was twofold: showing their zzso zzso activity and detecting the presence of the corresponding gene by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso were the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso precursor zzso zzso was also detected in most of zzso The strain identification by zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was the zzso species and only 2 belonged to zzso zzso Environmental conditions conducting to zzso zzso in zzso were studied by varying the zzso zzso pH and incubation temperature in zzso zzso zzso This strain failed to grow with zzso as sole carbon source and the addition of zzso enhanced both growth and zzso zzso Regarding zzso of zzso zzso zzso was always the main zzso in all environmental conditions zzso the only exception being the culture with zzso zzso zzso where zzso amounts of zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso was zzso accumulated in the culture medium under almost all culture conditions, the degradation rate being notably slower at 15 degrees zzso However, no disappearance of zzso was found at pH zzso a usual value in cider zzso After sugar exhaustion, zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso acid and/or zzso to obtain energy and these zzso were accompanied by the removal of the toxic zzso increasing the zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso
