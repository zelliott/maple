zzso DNA forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been extensively zzso However, no such analysis with plant zzso has been zzso Here, we report the analysis of zzso forms of the tobacco zzso zzso zzso is one of a few active zzso of plants and has been shown to be activated in tissue zzso zzso circular DNA forms of zzso with one or two long terminal repeats zzso were found in cultured zzso zzso analysis of the sites of zzso through joining two zzso showed that the junction between the zzso contains small deletions and/or zzso The insertions are zzso and do not show any zzso to the zzso zzso Similar insertions have been detected in the zzso circular forms of the zzso element of zzso and suggested to be the result of zzso of zzso zzso The structural features of the junctions found in zzso suggest that the insertions are produced by a mechanism other than zzso The potential mechanism of production of the zzso circular forms of zzso is zzso
