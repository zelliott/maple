zzso zzso channels share a common zzso sensor domain zzso consisting of four zzso zzso including a highly mobile zzso zzso that contains the major gating zzso zzso of zzso zzso family zzso channels is sensitive to external zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso slow the zzso rate of two zzso family channels zzso and zzso by forming a bridge between a zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso favors binding of zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso 321 in zzso contributes to effects of zzso and zzso This novel finding provides structural constraints for the position of zzso zzso zzso in closed, zzso zzso family zzso zzso models of zzso and zzso zzso structures based on a zzso model of the Shaker family zzso channel zzso match these zzso Our results suggest close zzso conservation between closed zzso and Shaker family channels, despite large differences in zzso sensitivity, zzso rates, and zzso zzso
