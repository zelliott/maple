A DNA zzso that carries the gene coding for zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso The open reading frame zzso the precursor of the zzso zzso was 1905 base pairs zzso long, corresponding to a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso The promoter site, which could be recognized by zzso coli zzso zzso was upstream from the zzso and the sequence adhering to the zzso sequence was found in front of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence agreed with the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso acid 28 zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed the domain structure of the zzso a signal zzso of 27 zzso acids long was followed by a zzso domain of about 400 zzso zzso a zzso type III module zzso and a putative zzso binding zzso The molecular mass zzso of the mature protein deduced from the zzso sequence was significantly lower than the value (95 zzso estimated on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso but coincided well with the value zzso estimated from zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso By comparison of the primary structure with those of other zzso zzso the zzso binding domain was found to consist of two zzso zzso and zzso ones, connected by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli under the control of the zzso zzso The zzso expressed in zzso coli was zzso from culture broth and showed the same zzso properties as the zzso from zzso zzso
