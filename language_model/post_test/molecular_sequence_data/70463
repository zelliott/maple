The generation of sensory and zzso zzso from the neural crest requires the functions of two classes of basic zzso zzso zzso factors, the zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso Auerbach, zzso Anderson, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 75, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso de la zzso zzso zzso and Anderson, zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso We have cloned two chick zzso and found that they are expressed in a subset of neural crest cells early in their zzso zzso expression of the zzso in zzso biases zzso neural crest cells to zzso in the sensory zzso and zzso the expression of sensory zzso markers in zzso crest zzso Surprisingly, the zzso can also induce the expression of multiple zzso and zzso markers in the zzso a zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that a subset of neural crest cells may already be specified for a sensory zzso fate early in migration, as a consequence of zzso zzso
