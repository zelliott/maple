zzso in the zzso gene zzso are responsible for a range of clinical zzso involving zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso within the zzso zzso region are specifically responsible for the development of the related zzso disorders zzso syndrome and zzso To address the question of the structural effect of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso we used zzso techniques to examine the zzso structure of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso bound with DNA as a template zzso et zzso zzso The zzso analysis reveals that the zzso zzso zzso is indeed capable of forming the typical zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso Energy calculations indicate that the zzso structure is stabilized primarily by zzso interactions between zzso at the zzso zzso Point zzso responsible for the development of these genetic disorders were also zzso the results suggest that these zzso lead to the inability of zzso to adopt its proper structure and bind to the regulatory sequences of its target zzso which in turn affects its zzso role in the zzso Published 1999 zzso zzso
