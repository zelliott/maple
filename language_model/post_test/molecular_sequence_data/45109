zzso zzso is oxidized as an energy source by two component zzso the large component zzso and the small component zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso supplied by a zzso zzso zzso We determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain 7 in its three states zzso zzso and zzso zzso exists as a zzso and each zzso was found to contain an zzso zzso preferred zzso to zzso because there was not enough space to accommodate the zzso zzso of zzso in its zzso zzso The most striking difference between the zzso and the zzso structures was observed in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso structures rotated zzso 20 degrees relative to the zzso zzso The bound zzso has a compact folded zzso with nearly parallel stacking rings of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso stacked the zzso ring of zzso so that zzso could directly transfer zzso The bound zzso also had a compact zzso but was bound in a reverse direction, which was not suitable for hydride zzso
