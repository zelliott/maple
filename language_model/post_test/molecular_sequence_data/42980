In order to preserve and exploit the valuable genetic resources of tropical forest trees, such as zzso a systematic assessment of the available genetic zzso is zzso The approach we have used is based on a simple zzso DNA extraction procedure together with a zzso zzso zzso zzso procedure zzso Twenty-five zzso zzso zzso and zzso collected from Peru and zzso collected from Ecuador, which are difficult to distinguish using zzso or zzso zzso were uniquely zzso using a minimum of three zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso detected using zzso clearly zzso between the geographical origin of the three zzso zzso zzso of zzso into within and between population components revealed that most variation was detected within a zzso The potential of zzso analysis to facilitate the rationalization of field gene banks and provide accurate estimates of diversity to allow zzso of collecting strategies is zzso
