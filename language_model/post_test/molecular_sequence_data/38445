zzso abnormalities at zzso zzso are among the most common zzso in diffuse zzso zzso and have been associated with a poor zzso A novel cell line, zzso was established from zzso fluid that carries a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso gel zzso the zzso on the zzso locus mapped to a gamma locus between zzso and zzso A zzso library was prepared from zzso and zzso clones spanning the zzso were identified by screening with zzso in zzso zzso The zzso occurs 860 zzso downstream of the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso The break appears to be a staggered zzso break consistent with an error in zzso class zzso The zzso gene is highly transcribed and zzso and the protein is highly zzso It is zzso that zzso expression is brought under the control of the zzso zzso zzso lies in a region of zzso 1 characterized by an unusually high density of zzso with 7 known genes in a region of approximately 85 zzso To determine whether there was a zzso effect of the expression of genes in the region as a consequence of the zzso the expression of 6 additional genes was zzso None of the other genes in this region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3) are zzso in zzso Thus, the zzso zzso seen in both the primary tumor and the derived cell line results in the marked zzso of zzso without affecting the expression of other genes in the zzso zzso zzso
