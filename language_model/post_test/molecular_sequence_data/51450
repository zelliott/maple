zzso T zzso recognize zzso fragments of zzso proteins presented by class I zzso zzso Recently, these peptides have been shown to be short, usually zzso and their binding to particular class I molecules is now well zzso There is also detailed understanding of how proteins are processed to generate zzso peptides and some knowledge of the T zzso receptors zzso zzso have been shown to be important in controlling virus infections, including those that cause zzso zzso have also been demonstrated against other zzso and their activity may lead to the abnormalities of zzso class I zzso expression that are frequently observed on zzso The overall role of zzso is probably to survey body cells for zzso including those induced by virus infection and zzso and to destroy potentially harmful zzso
