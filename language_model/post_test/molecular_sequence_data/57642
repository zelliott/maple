We have identified membrane components which are adjacent to type I and type II zzso proteins during their zzso into the membrane of the zzso Using two different zzso approaches a zzso zzso zzso previously identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso was found adjacent to all the membrane inserted nascent chains used in this zzso On the basis of zzso this zzso protein was shown to be identical to the recently identified zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is the principal zzso partner of both type I and type II zzso proteins during their membrane zzso (this zzso and of zzso proteins during their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that membrane proteins of both zzso and zzso proteins employ the same zzso zzso sites, and that zzso is a core component of these zzso
