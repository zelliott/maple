A gene zzso a positive zzso of the expression of zzso zzso zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library in zzso zzso The presence of the cloned gene in zzso coli zzso zzso of the genes zzso zzso acid zzso and could complement zzso zzso Introduction of the gene on a zzso zzso into zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the gene zzso zzso was zzso This revealed a single open reading frame zzso an zzso protein of 23-7 zzso This was confirmed by zzso analysis in zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of this zzso protein showed a high degree of zzso to the zzso protein of zzso zzso demonstrating the existence of a family of related zzso zzso proteins capable of stimulating zzso zzso The protein had no significant zzso to known zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first time, that the zzso family of zzso proteins may stimulate expression of zzso synthesis indirectly by acting on other regulatory zzso
