We examined unequal zzso DNA zzso between human repetitive DNA elements located on a zzso artificial zzso zzso and transforming zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing an zzso element, as well as a sequence identical to a unique site on a zzso was introduced into zzso and double zzso clones zzso zzso occurs between zzso and zzso zzso elements sharing as little as zzso zzso The physical proximity of an zzso element to the unique DNA segment appears to play a significant role in determining the frequency with which that element serves as a zzso zzso In addition, zzso points of the zzso reaction are largely confined to the ends of the repetitive zzso Since a similar distribution of crossover sites occurs during unequal zzso zzso in human germ and zzso zzso we propose that similar zzso processes may be responsible for the events observed in our system and in human zzso This suggests that further examination of the zzso of unequal zzso zzso of human DNA within zzso may yield a greater understanding of the molecular events which control this process in higher zzso
