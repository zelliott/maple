Selective zzso zzso are potent tools for zzso zzso Their zzso are significantly zzso in human breast zzso whereas normal breast tissue only expresses zzso The zzso zzso consists of 36 zzso zzso whereas smaller peptides are preferred because of better zzso zzso As zzso zzso enhance the zzso to background ratio compared to zzso antagonists, we were interested in the development of zzso selective zzso We designed 19 peptides containing the zzso of zzso zzso with several zzso By using competition zzso binding affinity zzso we identified three zzso zzso with high zzso affinity and zzso zzso stability studies in human blood plasma of the zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides resulted in zzso of several zzso Furthermore, the degradation pattern revealed zzso degradation of the peptides by zzso zzso The most promising zzso was further investigated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Signal zzso zzso revealed clear zzso properties, which could be confirmed by zzso studies that showed clear zzso zzso For the first time, here we show the design and characterization of a small zzso selective zzso This zzso might be a useful novel zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso
