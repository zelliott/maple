zzso viruses zzso are highly zzso and their replication zzso massive zzso formation in infected cell cultures which is believed to be zzso by expression of the envelope zzso zzso The zzso zzso is essential for virus particle zzso The unusually long putative zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso carries dispersed charged zzso acids and has an important function for particle zzso To better understand the zzso interaction and zzso cell fusion, we generated a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso deletions revealed the zzso domain to be zzso but the full-length zzso to be required for zzso zzso The zzso 15 zzso acids of the zzso were found to be sufficient for membrane zzso and promotion of zzso particle zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein rarely induced zzso due to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso resulted in particle export and a dramatic increase in fusion zzso A zzso zzso of zzso in the middle of the putative zzso resulted in increased zzso activity of zzso in the absence of zzso due to enhanced cell surface expression as well as structural changes in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a further increase in the fusion activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that an interaction between the viral zzso and zzso is required for zzso zzso formation and that the positive charge in the zzso is an important zzso controlling zzso transport and zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso
