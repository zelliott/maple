The zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are a recently identified family of zzso proteins that function in zzso processing of cell surface molecules and in cell zzso Since zzso must interact with a constantly changing environment, we hypothesized that zzso would express unique zzso zzso To identify zzso proteins expressed in human zzso zzso a zzso chain zzso strategy combined with zzso zzso zzso was zzso We report here the identification of zzso zzso 23), a novel member of the zzso protein zzso The results obtained from zzso cloning and Northern zzso analysis of zzso isolated from various zzso zzso indicate that a zzso zzso zzso a zzso form, zzso and a zzso zzso zzso a zzso form, zzso are expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be predominantly expressed in secondary zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso small zzso stomach, zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with an zzso zzso demonstrated that cells with typical zzso zzso are responsible for expression of the zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed on the surface of human peripheral blood zzso and transformed zzso and zzso cell lines as an zzso zzso Thus, we have identified a novel zzso zzso protein family zzso
