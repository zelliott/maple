Natural immunity to synthetic peptides zzso derived from the sequences of a zzso Mr zzso zzso zzso was found in human zzso zzso serum zzso zzso were detected both to the native zzso zzso and to the zzso containing essentially zzso zzso A series of short peptides with deletions at the zzso and zzso were then tested to identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound significant serum zzso zzso but only the former consistently inhibited human zzso suggesting that zzso zzso constitute a major zzso zzso The human zzso subset of zzso was then examined and this showed a significant zzso of zzso when zzso with both the native zzso zzso and the zzso The series of short peptides was then used to stimulate zzso cells, in order to determine the zzso zzso The synthetic zzso with zzso zzso was the shortest zzso that zzso significant zzso zzso and this zzso was designated as a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso was also investigated in zzso zzso of monkeys with the free zzso failed to elicit serum zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso with zzso linked to zzso zzso as a carrier zzso serum zzso and zzso responses of zzso not only to the synthetic zzso but also to the native zzso zzso As in the human studies a zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso whereas an overlapping zzso zzso was located in zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
