zzso as a novel binding protein can interact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Met which has a similar zzso zzso structure as zzso zzso zzso Whether zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso has not been established to zzso In this study, using zzso zzso system, it was identified that zzso bound to the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso through its zzso zzso We confirmed the formation of complexes between zzso and zzso by zzso studies and zzso pull-down zzso The region of zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso was located in its zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso revealed zzso zzso and receptors zzso did interact in several zzso cell zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso could inhibit zzso increase of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso dependent zzso expression through its interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity plays an important role in zzso signal zzso These data suggested that zzso could participate in zzso gene zzso and expression by its binding to zzso
