zzso expression of genes in the zzso cluster depends upon sequences located between 5 and 20 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso known as the locus control region zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells depends on zzso a zzso factor which binds to zzso sequences in the zzso To gain insight into the mechanism of zzso gene zzso by zzso an zzso zzso zzso cell line was used to map regions of zzso required for zzso zzso Within the zzso domain, two discrete zzso regions were required for rescue of zzso zzso The first was located at the zzso of zzso while the second was located zzso of the cap 'n zzso zzso zzso Other zzso sequences were zzso indicating that zzso content per zzso does not determine zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso domain markedly diminished rescue of zzso zzso This domain was required, in addition to the basic zzso zzso domain, for DNA binding zzso The requirement for discrete zzso sequences within the zzso domain suggests that zzso gene expression in zzso cells depends on specific interactions between zzso and downstream zzso zzso
