We show that zzso and zzso repeat zzso can be analyzed in single cells without using zzso or zzso zzso This provides a rich new source of DNA zzso for genetic mapping by zzso zzso The zzso fraction between two CA repeat zzso was determined after whole zzso amplification of single zzso followed by typing of two different zzso one zzso for each zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso may also be valuable both for zzso genetic disease diagnosis based on zzso or zzso analysis and for the typing of forensic or ancient DNA samples containing very small amounts of zzso zzso
