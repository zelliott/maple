In contrast to classical zzso the detailed structures and cellular and synaptic actions of zzso are less well zzso zzso mass profiling of single identified zzso of the zzso zzso zzso indicated the presence of 17 abundant zzso in the zzso zzso visceral zzso 1 zzso and a subset of 14 peptides in its zzso coupled counterpart, right zzso zzso zzso Altogether, based on this and previous work, we showed that the high number of peptides arises from the expression and processing of four distinct zzso precursor zzso including a novel zzso Second, we established a variety of zzso modifications of the generated zzso including zzso zzso linkage, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and its muscle targets were formed, and their synaptic physiology was zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso heart muscle cells revealed, as tested for a selection of representative family members and their zzso that the peptides of zzso exhibit zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides were more potent than the unmodified zzso zzso in enhancing these zzso Together, this study is the first to demonstrate that single zzso exhibit such a complex pattern of zzso gene zzso precursor processing, and differential zzso modifications along with a remarkable degree of convergence of zzso zzso This study thus underscores the importance of a detailed mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso content and zzso modifications related to zzso zzso
