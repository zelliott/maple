Recent studies have demonstrated the zzso function of the X gene product of zzso B zzso However, little information is available on the regulation of X gene zzso In this report, we first investigate a cellular factor regulating X gene zzso by DNA zzso using the human zzso cell line zzso which is zzso for zzso replication as well as X zzso zzso A zzso cellular factor was found to bind to the promoter region upstream of the first zzso zzso zzso zzso of the X open reading zzso zzso I zzso analysis showed the binding sequence of this factor to be situated between zzso zzso and zzso where an zzso zzso structure zzso zzso zzso analysis of X gene transcripts demonstrated the binding site to be adjacent to two major start sites zzso zzso and zzso of X zzso Second, we demonstrate that introduction of a zzso into the binding site gives rise to a loss of the binding with a zzso shift of the zzso start site of X zzso beyond the zzso zzso structure, causing it to become more zzso Thus, the zzso protein appears to be involved in directing the zzso initiation site of the X gene toward the downstream region of the X promoter when X protein is produced from X zzso
