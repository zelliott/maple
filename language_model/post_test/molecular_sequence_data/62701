During embryonic pattern formation, the main body axes are established and cells of different zzso fates are specified from a zzso zzso Despite the fundamental importance of this process, in plants, the underlying mechanisms are largely zzso We show that expression dynamics of novel zzso zzso related zzso gene family members reveal early embryonic patterning events in zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the egg cell and zzso and become confined to the zzso and zzso daughter cells of the zzso respectively, by its zzso zzso zzso not only marks zzso descendants of the zzso but is also functionally required for their correct development, suggesting that the zzso division of the plant zzso separates zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso expression is initiated in the zzso daughter cell of the zzso and subsequently shifts into the descendants of the zzso daughter apparently in response to signaling from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso shows that identity of the zzso center is initiated very early in the zzso cell, and highlights molecular and zzso similarities between the stem cell niches of root and shoot zzso Together, our data suggest that during plant zzso zzso zzso programs are initiated very early in single precursor cells and that zzso genes play an important role in this zzso
