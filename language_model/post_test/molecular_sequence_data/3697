The zzso family of zzso factors regulates development of multiple zzso Several zzso factors have two promoters directing distinct zzso zzso Although zzso acts in both zzso and zzso development, no alternative promoter usage has been zzso We examined various cell types and zzso for potential alternative zzso transcripts and identified an alternative transcript directed by a promoter located 10 zzso upstream of the recognized zzso zzso within this promoter and alternative first zzso are highly zzso between mouse and human zzso This new promoter is expressed selectively in the brain but is essentially zzso in the zzso In contrast, the recognized promoter is selectively expressed in the zzso but not in the zzso We also observed a gradual increase in expression from this new promoter during zzso zzso These results indicate that similar to other zzso factors, the zzso gene can be controlled by two promoters that may direct zzso and zzso zzso
