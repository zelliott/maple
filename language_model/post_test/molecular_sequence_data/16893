West Nile virus zzso strains circulating during the first five years of zzso transmission in New York were collected, partial zzso sequences were determined, and in zzso and in zzso zzso analyses of selected strains were undertaken to determine whether observed increases in the intensity of zzso and epidemic transmission in New York State during 2002 and 2003 were associated with viral genetic zzso zzso diverse regions of the zzso zzso were also compared to determine whether some regions may be more or less variable than zzso The complete envelope coding regions of 67 strains and fragments of the zzso protein 5 zzso and 3' zzso regions of 39 strains collected during 2002 and 2003 were zzso West Nile virus in New York remains relatively genetically zzso zzso genetic diversity was greater in 2002 and 2003 at both the zzso and zzso acid levels than in previous years due to the emergence of a new zzso zzso in zzso This zzso persisted and became dominant in zzso zzso and zzso coding regions were approximately zzso more likely than the 3' untranslated region to contain zzso zzso and the envelope region was approximately zzso more likely to contain zzso acid zzso than the zzso zzso Variation was noted in in zzso zzso transmission zzso but not in in zzso growth zzso zzso belonging to the zzso dominant zzso were transmitted after approximately two fewer days of zzso zzso providing a possible mechanism for the dominance of this zzso The observed increase in the intensity of zzso transmission beginning in 2002 was associated with an increase in viral genetic diversity that was the result of the emergence of an additional zzso zzso This zzso seems to possess an advantage over previously recognized zzso strains in zzso transmission zzso
