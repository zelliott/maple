The expression of two zzso gene clusters zzso and zzso was studied in zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso of transcripts were mapped by primer extension and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso initiation sites were differentiated by in zzso zzso and capping zzso A zzso initiation site, present in both gene zzso was found zzso zzso upstream of zzso This promoter element matches the consensus motif for zzso zzso promoters and zzso zzso zzso in a pea zzso zzso protein zzso zzso sites were identified zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso the expression of the two zzso is only controlled by one duplicated promoter element, and zzso multiple processing events are required to produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
