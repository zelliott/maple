Previous studies have shown that sodium channel zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso sensory zzso of zzso root zzso and zzso zzso These zzso include zzso zzso that are involved in zzso of pain associated with tissue and nerve zzso In this study, we show that mouse zzso is a zzso zzso that is predicted to produce a current that is resistant to zzso zzso Mouse and rat zzso are 80 and zzso identical at the zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso The zzso gene zzso this zzso is organized into 24 zzso Unlike some zzso zzso does not have an alternative zzso 5 in domain zzso zzso of the U2 and zzso zzso types are present at zzso positions relative to other members of this zzso zzso is located on mouse zzso 9, close to the two other zzso sodium channel zzso zzso and zzso The human zzso zzso was mapped to the zzso linkage group on zzso zzso close to human zzso and zzso The zzso of the three sodium channel genes supports a common lineage of the zzso sodium zzso
