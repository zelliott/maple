zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetic zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a zzso in the zzso zzso gene is associated with zzso in Han Chinese zzso 

We performed clinical evaluation of three Han Chinese families with zzso and zzso the entire zzso of the zzso gene in zzso and normal individuals from the zzso The identified zzso was further zzso in 196 unrelated healthy zzso zzso conservation analysis and structural prediction were used to zzso the potential zzso of the zzso 

Clinical zzso of zzso varied in the three families zzso in Family A, zzso in Family B, and zzso in Family zzso A comprehensive medical examination of the patients showed no signs of zzso except zzso symptoms, in which zzso zzso and high echo in both zzso bodies were observed in all zzso Further zzso examination of the zzso zzso with zzso red zzso identified zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 3 of the zzso gene was identified in all patients, but not in some unaffected family zzso zzso of 196 unrelated normal controls revealed no presence of this zzso This zzso changed the highly zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso position and altered the zzso structure of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso protein is associated with zzso in Chinese zzso The seemingly specific distribution of this zzso in Han Chinese may be used for clinical zzso
