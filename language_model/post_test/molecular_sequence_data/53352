Respiratory zzso virus zzso produces intense pulmonary zzso in part, through its ability to induce zzso synthesis in infected airway zzso zzso In this study, we compare mechanisms for induction of the zzso zzso zzso in human type II zzso zzso cells by zzso infection and by stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso deletion and zzso experiments indicate that although the region from zzso to zzso zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso transcription, this region alone is not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso requires participation of a previously zzso element, spanning from zzso to zzso zzso that we term the zzso response element zzso and a previously characterized element at zzso to zzso zzso containing an zzso binding zzso zzso infection of zzso cells zzso increased zzso and zzso activities and increased synthesis of zzso regulatory zzso zzso which is present in the zzso zzso These data confirm that the zzso gene enhancers are controlled in a zzso fashion and participation of distinct promoter elements is required to activate gene zzso These observations are important for rational design of zzso of zzso lung zzso
