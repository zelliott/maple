The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic zzso of sequences present in the zzso ends of zzso zzso strains defined by the presence zzso or absence zzso of zzso zzso and to compare the mean terminal restriction zzso zzso lengths to those of zzso zzso populations representative of groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso Southern blots containing zzso zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains were zzso with the previously described zzso sequences zzso zzso of zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso length analysis showed that the zzso ends of zzso zzso are distinctly zzso with zzso ranging from zzso to 9 zzso for zzso strains and from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso length ranged from zzso to 9 zzso and no association with the zzso of the zzso could be zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed the occurrence of sequence zzso in the zzso region between and within zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in all zzso zzso except for strain zzso but not in any of the zzso zzso The zzso constructed by alignment of all zzso zzso strains showed the division into two main groups, mainly related to the presence or absence of the zzso zzso In conclusion, the present results extend the zzso differences demonstrated by zzso and zzso analysis in zzso zzso to the zzso ends of the zzso
