The crystal structure of an zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution and refined to a zzso R factor of zzso Although the overall structure of zzso is essentially similar to those of other group II zzso zzso from different species, it shows unique features in several zzso Particularly noteworthy is the zzso part, which folds differently to those of other group II zzso This part is considered to be responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso loop is tightly organized with zzso zzso Another striking feature of zzso is the involvement of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in a coordination linkage with zzso of the zzso zzso This is the first observation of an internal metal zzso participating in an zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso is deeply inserted into the zzso channel of another zzso and forms several zzso zzso This results in the formation of an infinite chain of zzso These chains are stacked in an zzso arrangement in the zzso
