Genes zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso II zzso constitute a zzso zzso Nine zzso genes have previously been isolated from the tobacco species, zzso zzso and the zzso initiation sites in zzso have been zzso zzso conditions from a previously developed in zzso zzso system from tobacco cultured cells were zzso for the zzso zzso zzso initiation sites in zzso predominantly coincided with those found in zzso and were typically zzso a system unique to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for initiation zzso was a consensus motif for the initiation region in zzso as reported in zzso zzso analysis defined functionally that the zzso box is essential for zzso initiation and that the zzso motif is a zzso of zzso initiation sites but not transcript zzso zzso sites were determined from in zzso zzso located zzso zzso downstream from likely zzso zzso Four major zzso of in zzso transcripts from zzso were zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso site, suggestive of zzso discrete zzso termination zzso These zzso are mapped in or nearby zzso zzso
