The novel epidemic strain zzso zzso zzso Bengal originated from a zzso zzso El zzso strain by zzso shift resulting from zzso zzso exchange of zzso zzso zzso zzso Conservation of the genetic organization of zzso regions seen in other zzso raised the possibility of the existence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains that emerged by similar zzso To test this hypothesis, 300 zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were screened for the presence of zzso genes and an epidemic genetic background by DNA dot zzso zzso zzso and restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso We found four zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an zzso genetic backbone suggesting exchange of zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso region revealed that a novel approximately zzso gene cluster had replaced all but the approximately zzso right junction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In sharp contrast to the zzso the zzso regions of the four strains were quite zzso the zzso and zzso strains had the El zzso zzso zzso island zzso zzso the zzso strain had the classical zzso zzso and the zzso strain had a novel zzso zzso Two of the four strains carried zzso the zzso strain possessed a zzso with a recently reported immune specificity zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso and the zzso strain had an El zzso zzso zzso zzso and novel zzso zzso Although the zzso and zzso strains lacked the zzso zzso they carried a zzso zzso zzso Identification of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso potential in epidemic genetic backgrounds means that attention should be paid to possible future zzso caused by these zzso and to the need for new, rapid vaccine development zzso
