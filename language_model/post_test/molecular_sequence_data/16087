To determine whether the zzso zzso zzso is more closely related to the A or B zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence of its zzso was compared to the zzso acid sequences of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso from zzso zzso differs by five and six zzso acid zzso respectively from the alpha 1 and alpha 2 forms coded for by genes in the B and D zzso and is identical to the beta form specified by a gene in the A zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is either coded by a gene in the A zzso or a zzso set highly zzso to zzso The results demonstrate that at least a portion of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso and probably zzso A variety of other studies have also shown that zzso zzso is very closely related to zzso zzso and, in all likelihood, also possesses the A zzso zzso it could be argued that either zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the same species or that zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso is the source of the A zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Except for Johnson's results, our data and that of others suggest a revised origin of zzso zzso Specifically, the list of six putative B zzso donor species is reduced to five, all members of the zzso section of the zzso zzso
