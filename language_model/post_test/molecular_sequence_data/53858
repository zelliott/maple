Recent progress in molecular microbial ecology has revealed that traditional zzso methods fail to represent the scope of microbial diversity in nature, since only a small proportion of viable zzso in a sample are recovered by zzso zzso To develop methods to investigate the full extent of microbial diversity, we used a bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso to construct libraries of zzso DNA isolated directly from soil zzso zzso zzso To date, we have constructed two such libraries, which contain more than 1 zzso of zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences recovered from one of the libraries indicates that the zzso libraries contain DNA from a wide diversity of microbial zzso including sequences from diverse zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso screening of the libraries in zzso coli identified several clones that express zzso genes from the zzso confirming that the zzso zzso can be used to zzso zzso and analyze environmental zzso The zzso expressed by these clones include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso libraries are a powerful tool for exploring soil microbial diversity, providing access to the genetic information of zzso soil zzso Such libraries will be the basis of new initiatives to conduct zzso studies that link zzso and functional information about the zzso of environments dominated by zzso that are zzso to zzso
