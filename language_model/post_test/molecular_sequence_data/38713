zzso 4 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso isolated from the skin of a Korean frog, zzso zzso This zzso shows a broad range of activity against zzso cells but shows very little zzso activity against human red blood zzso The solution structure of zzso was studied by using circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso CD investigations revealed that zzso adopts mainly an zzso zzso in zzso solution, in zzso and in zzso zzso but adopts random structure in zzso zzso By using both zzso and zzso zzso experiments, complete zzso and zzso resonance assignments were obtained for zzso in 50% zzso zzso The calculated structures of zzso consist of two zzso zzso extending from zzso zzso and from zzso zzso These two zzso are connected by a flexible loop spanning between the zzso 11 and zzso By using zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso mass zzso we confirmed that zzso contains a zzso bridge formed between the zzso zzso and zzso in its zzso The effect of zzso bridge on the structure and the activity of zzso was zzso The reduced form of zzso revealed a similar activity and zzso to native zzso suggesting that the zzso bridge does not strongly affect the zzso and the zzso activity of zzso
