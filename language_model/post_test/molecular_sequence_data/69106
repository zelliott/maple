zzso which encodes part of the alpha zzso of the rabbit skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso was employed to search for the presence in whole liver and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso which encodes zzso Such zzso zzso would be a candidate for zzso which encodes the putative zzso zzso zzso inflow system zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso prepared from intact liver zzso but not zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso species comparable in size to that which encodes the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso It is concluded zzso that zzso do not possess zzso or that the levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso are too low to be detected by Northern analysis and zzso that another cell type present in liver tissue does possess a zzso In a low stringency screen of a rat liver zzso library employing zzso zzso as a probe, seven positive zzso clones were zzso While regions of the zzso zzso zzso insert from one of these clones showed sequence similarities with regions of zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence did not appear to zzso a zzso zzso The present results suggest that the approach of low stringency zzso library screening is unlikely to allow isolation of zzso zzso
