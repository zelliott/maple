zzso releases into plasma the human zzso zzso previously termed the zzso zzso Because zzso and its zzso are zzso as part of a common zzso stimuli which release the hormone should also release zzso and vice zzso However, release of zzso with its zzso has been difficult to demonstrate by zzso zzso in humans administered zzso Under this condition, the zzso zzso that is released with the zzso zzso is a novel zzso which is zzso similar to zzso yet is not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso may be a partially processed form of zzso To test this hypothesis the synthetic zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested for zzso with the various zzso zzso used in this laboratory to distinguish the zzso zzso from zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso showed extensive zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 1), which is known to detect the zzso zzso of human zzso Plasma from men and zzso monkeys administered zzso and from pregnant women was separated by zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso was zzso from the column with the same retention time as synthetic zzso zzso releases an zzso precursor intermediate into the circulation of humans and monkeys and may exert an important effect upon zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These observations suggest a zzso in the zzso zzso processing of the zzso precursor in zzso versus zzso zzso
