zzso zzso factors bound to adjacent sites in zzso promoters often exhibit cooperative zzso In most instances, the molecular basis for this zzso is poorly zzso Our efforts have been directed toward zzso of the mechanism of zzso between zzso and zzso two proteins that zzso direct expression of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

We have previously shown that zzso zzso the two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso on DNA through direct zzso zzso In the present study, we have constructed zzso zzso proteins and determined their orientation using a novel zzso technology based on chemical zzso We find that, in the presence of zzso the zzso zzso binds in such a way as to preserve the orientation of the zzso zzso zzso but not that of the basic zzso 

zzso interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso enable the two proteins to bind DNA zzso and zzso regulate the zzso zzso The chemical zzso technology presented here provides a powerful strategy for affinity zzso studies, including those using zzso zzso
