CD and zzso zzso were used to compare the zzso properties of two related zzso One of the zzso Model zzso was designed to adopt a zzso strand zzso zzso zzso structure in water that might be stabilized by zzso interactions between two zzso zzso in the zzso segment and two zzso zzso in the zzso terminal zzso The other zzso AB Helix, has the same zzso acid sequence as Model AB except that it lacks the zzso segment at the zzso Although the zzso segment of Model AB was found to be zzso its presence increases the number of zzso in a zzso zzso shifts the zzso of three zzso side chains by 1 pH unit or more compared to an zzso zzso zzso the zzso as a zzso in high zzso of ammonium zzso increases the zzso stability of zzso at the terminal ends of the zzso and results in many slowly exchanging zzso zzso throughout the entire backbone of the zzso These results suggest that interactions between adjacent segments in a small zzso can have significant structure organizing zzso Similar kinds of interactions may be important in determining the structure of early zzso in protein folding and may be useful in the de zzso design of independently folding zzso
