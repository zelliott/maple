The orange to blue zzso of flowers in nature is, in most cases, provided by zzso a class of plant zzso many of which are modified by zzso zzso However, the identity of the zzso catalyzing the zzso reaction remains to be zzso Here, we describe for the first time the zzso zzso and zzso cloning of an zzso zzso from scarlet sage zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso protein catalyzing the zzso transfer of the zzso group from zzso to the zzso group of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed a zzso value of zzso zzso at 30 degrees C and pH zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso values of 101 zzso and 57 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid, which mimics an aromatic zzso group linked to the zzso zzso of an zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor with respect to the zzso This strongly suggests that the presence of an aromatic zzso group at the zzso zzso of zzso is important for zzso recognition by the zzso On the basis of the partial zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso acids and shared motifs that are commonly found among members of a versatile plant zzso family, which was recently shown to include numerous zzso of unknown zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the transcripts of zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso and red zzso in accordance with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso and aromatic zzso of zzso are generally zzso by zzso members of the plant zzso zzso
