We have used zzso sequencing aided by zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso in the zzso promoter region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Earlier studies showed that there was very heavy zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso promoter of the human zzso gene on the inactive X zzso (the zzso but that these same sites were completely zzso on the active X zzso (the zzso For mouse zzso previous restriction zzso analysis had shown apparently complete zzso of only one zzso in the promoter region on the zzso at zzso site zzso which is located in the untranslated region, 28 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso We analyzed this potentially critical region by combining the use of zzso with zzso and find that the zzso zzso near zzso are either zzso or only partially zzso on the zzso zzso analysis of male and female DNA over a zzso sequence including the promoter and zzso extend the finding of relative zzso on the mouse zzso to include all zzso zzso in this zzso These results are relevant to the role of DNA zzso in stabilizing the inactive state of zzso In addition, we find that caution must be exercised in using zzso for zzso analysis of some zzso A DNA zzso zzso artifact can incorrectly suggest zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso
