To study the prevalence and variation of influenza zzso zzso the zzso and genetic characteristics of influenza zzso viruses circulating in Mainland China during April 2011 to March 2012 were zzso The results showed that influenza zzso viruses increased gradually since 2012 and became the dominant strain since zzso The viruses were zzso closely related to the vaccine strain zzso zzso and the representative virus zzso zzso in Mainland zzso The genetic characteristics analysis results showed that recently isolated viruses belonged to the zzso zzso and most of the low reaction strains also fell into the same zzso Crystal structure analysis of zzso protein found that, compared with the vaccine strain zzso the recently isolated viruses had zzso acid zzso in the zzso site A, B and C areas, in addition to gaining potential zzso sites at the zzso acid position of 45 of zzso and zzso of zzso Although the majority of circulating influenza A zzso viruses in zzso season in Mainland China were zzso matched by current influenza vaccine strain and the selected representative zzso low reaction strains have increased since 2012, therefore it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance on the variation of influenza virus and to provide solid information for the vaccine strain zzso
