A zzso model of zzso zzso zzso was constructed based on its sequence zzso with other zzso particularly zzso c zzso the only protein with a known crystal structure in the zzso zzso The construction of initial zzso of insertions and deletions was assisted by secondary structure predictions, zzso zzso predictions, and consideration of the specific protein zzso A succession of molecular dynamics simulations of these regions with surrounding zzso as constraints were carried out to relax the bond lengths and zzso Full protein molecular dynamics simulations with explicit consideration of bound waters were performed to relax the geometry and to identify zzso flexible regions of the successive models for further zzso Among the important functionally relevant structural features predicted are: zzso four zzso bonds are predicted to be formed between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso a zzso site, zzso was located on the surface; zzso zzso was predicted to form a salt bridge with zzso on the zzso side of the zzso and was considered as a possible origin for the pH dependence of compound I zzso and zzso two candidate zzso binding sites with a cluster of surface aromatic zzso and flexible zzso were found in the refined model, consistent with the nature of known zzso of zzso Based on these predicted structural features of the model, further theoretical and experimental studies are proposed to continue to zzso the structure and function of zzso
