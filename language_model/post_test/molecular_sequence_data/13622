zzso zzso represent an interesting tool for selective zzso of gene zzso In order to direct zzso to specific compartments within the cell, we have investigated the possibility of zzso them to a signal zzso zzso zzso This sequence should be able to convey zzso to the zzso zzso and from there to the zzso and the nucleus where their targets are zzso On this basis we prepared zzso zzso by zzso in a single step, a zzso zzso with an zzso bearing a zzso group, through a zzso zzso This paper deals with the definition of the optimal pH and temperature conditions leading to an efficient synthesis of zzso zzso the reaction was quantitative at pH zzso within few zzso This method was first set up using a zzso zzso and a zzso as a zzso zzso Then a zzso zzso complementary to the translation initiation region of the gag zzso of zzso was coupled to a zzso containing a zzso signal zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was compared with that of zzso zzso linked through either a zzso bond or a zzso zzso The zzso with a zzso bond has a higher zzso activity than the zzso zzso and the zzso linked via a zzso zzso
