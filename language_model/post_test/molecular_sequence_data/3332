To investigate the changes of zzso zzso and viruses during zzso and human zzso virus zzso infection, we examined the zzso ability of sequential zzso from three zzso infected with zzso zzso and analyzed the sensitivity of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso against the parental zzso showed a persistent zzso zzso activities were highly strain specific, but the spectrum of the zzso activity expanded against various zzso of primary zzso at 3 years after infection in one of the three zzso The zzso from an zzso zzso at 56 zzso designated as zzso was neutralized by zzso from this zzso at a much lower zzso than zzso even by the zzso collected 2 years after the zzso zzso from zzso that were newly infected with zzso also did not neutralize zzso despite zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that long-term persistent infection with zzso induced zzso zzso with a broad zzso However, a virus resistant to the zzso zzso emerged in the persistently infected zzso
