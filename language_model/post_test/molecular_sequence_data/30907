The zzso zzso are the most common form of cellular defense against the biological effects of zzso in zzso By screening a zzso library with zzso zzso derived from the active site zzso acid sequence of the bovine zzso we have isolated a zzso clone for the human zzso The zzso contains a single open reading frame zzso a protein of Mr zzso which exhibits considerable zzso to three bacterial zzso When provided with an zzso coli zzso promoter, the zzso zzso can be expressed in zzso coli to produce an active zzso which is indistinguishable in size from the protein from human zzso The zzso expressed in this way is functional in zzso and protects an zzso coli zzso deletion zzso against the zzso and zzso properties of the zzso agent zzso The zzso gene spans at least 15 zzso and is located on human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells which express the zzso protein contain a zzso zzso of about 1 zzso However, this zzso is absent from three zzso sensitive zzso human cell lines indicating that the regulation of zzso gene expression in these cell lines may be zzso
