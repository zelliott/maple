An zzso acid sequence essential for zzso proteins zzso to bind to zzso is presented zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A synthetic zzso of 23 zzso acid zzso which corresponded to the sequence zzso binding zzso zzso was active in binding to zzso and inducing its zzso The zzso interaction mechanism was analyzed by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso as a simplified model for zzso zzso zzso transferred nuclear zzso effects zzso of zzso in zzso zzso were zzso and strong binding of two Val and two zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was zzso Among the sharply peaked signals from zzso aromatic zzso those due to zzso ring zzso broadened upon mixing with zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso in the binding with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions between Val and zzso zzso are important for the binding of zzso to zzso zzso interactions have not been taken into account previously in the widely accepted zzso model for the binding of zzso to zzso
