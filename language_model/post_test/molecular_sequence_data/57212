A series of zzso zzso against zzso human zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso were prepared by zzso mice with the native zzso immobilized on zzso One of these zzso designated zzso was found to inhibit both zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso but had no effect on the zzso H activity of the zzso This zzso was zzso with respect to zzso and competitive with respect to zzso zzso zzso The extent of zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity decreased with increasing zzso of zzso in the incubation but was not affected by changes in zzso zzso zzso bound equally well in solution to both free zzso and to the zzso zzso However, binding to the latter was significantly reduced by the addition of increasing zzso of zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit the interaction of zzso with the zzso complex was dependent on the identity of the zzso zzso zzso only that zzso complementary to the template was effective in this zzso zzso bound to the zzso reverse zzso zzso in solution and reacted with both zzso and zzso zzso of reverse zzso on Western zzso The zzso is therefore presumed to recognize a linear surface zzso on the zzso zzso was found to specifically recognize a zzso with the sequence zzso This sequence zzso to zzso zzso of zzso reverse zzso a region identified as highly zzso by several computer zzso Two zzso within this sequence have been identified with resistance to zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of zzso reverse zzso may be at or near the zzso active site of the zzso and may form part of the zzso zzso binding domain of the zzso
