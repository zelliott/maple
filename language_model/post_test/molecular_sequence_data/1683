A previously unidentified protein with an apparent molecular mass of 120 zzso was detected in some zzso zzso strains including the natural isolate strain zzso This protein was likely involved in the zzso of the strain, since a correlation between this zzso and expression of the 120 zzso protein was zzso We have applied random zzso by in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and isolated three zzso zzso of this strain from approximately 2,000 zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in one of the three zzso was amplified by zzso zzso walking and the zzso zzso in the other two zzso occurred also within the same zzso zzso sequencing of the region revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame specifying a putative protein of 538 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The deduced eight zzso acid sequence following a putative signal sequence completely coincided with the zzso zzso sequence of the 120 zzso protein determined by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene unexpectedly zzso the 120 zzso protein from zzso zzso Interestingly, this gene zzso a collagen zzso zzso In zzso zzso using the zzso zzso was successfully applied to zzso zzso
