The zzso zzso of zzso zzso type 1, which has the repeating zzso unit zzso zzso is a major zzso factor, and it is believed that zzso against this zzso zzso protection to the zzso The zzso properties of fragments of this zzso were explored using systematic search with a modified zzso method zzso and with molecular mechanics zzso The results show that the zzso linkage adopts two favored zzso zzso approximately equal to zzso degrees zzso degrees zzso and approximately 15 degrees zzso degrees zzso whereas the other zzso linkages only have a single favored zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso and zzso containing the zzso zzso exist as two different zzso distinguished by the zzso I and II of the zzso zzso For the zzso zzso and longer fragments, the calculations show preference for the zzso zzso zzso These results can explain previously reported nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The zzso in its favored zzso II is sharply bent, with the zzso zzso exposed at the zzso This hairpin zzso of the zzso was successfully zzso with the binding site of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that had been zzso modeled from known crystal zzso For fragments made of repetitive zzso units, the hairpin zzso leads to a left-handed zzso structure with the zzso zzso protruding zzso at the zzso zzso This arrangement results in a pronounced exposure of the zzso and also the adjacent zzso in each repeating unit, which is consistent with the known role of the as zzso zzso as a major zzso zzso of this zzso zzso
