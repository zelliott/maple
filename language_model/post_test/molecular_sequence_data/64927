The present work represents the first characterization of a clustered zzso repetitive unit containing an zzso gene in a zzso zzso To complete the knowledge on the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso family in zzso we undertake its characterization in five zzso zzso species, as an extension of our previous work on the zzso gene zzso We report the quintet zzso as the major organization unit in the zzso of zzso zzso with two zzso zzso genes with zzso zzso zzso segments linked to the unit, which is not justified by their zzso with zzso zzso Surprisingly, 3' zzso regions of zzso genes show two different zzso termination signals, a zzso and a zzso zzso both related to the evolution of zzso gene expression patterns throughout the cell zzso The clustered zzso zzso characterized share essential features with zzso zzso zzso suggesting a common evolutionary origin for both zzso zzso which is supported by the reconstructed zzso for zzso zzso The characterization of zzso genes in four additional zzso species revealed the presence of strong zzso selection acting among the members of the zzso The zzso location of most of the core zzso genes studied was identified by FISH close to zzso regions in zzso zzso Further analysis on zzso variation would be necessary to assess if zzso proteins evolve according to the zzso model of evolution and if the effect of the strong zzso selection maintaining protein zzso could account for the zzso detected between clustered and zzso zzso
