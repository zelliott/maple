The zzso zzso I and zzso III are two members of a series of biologically active peptides zzso to be membrane zzso In order to understand the effects of the membrane on the secondary structure of the zzso we have carried out the zzso characterization of zzso I and III in the presence of zzso zzso using circular zzso nuclear magnetic zzso and computer zzso The characteristic bands in the circular zzso zzso indicate an zzso content of approximately zzso in zzso III and zzso in zzso zzso The observation of zzso quite distinctive for such secondary structure strongly supports the CD zzso The zzso preferences of the two zzso derived from CD and zzso were then energetically refined with molecular dynamics zzso The results from the zzso examination were zzso as input for the simulations, the CD results for generation of the initial structure, and the zzso as constraints during the zzso The results from the different techniques employed are in complete zzso
