zzso are a closely related family of membrane zzso proteins that are believed to participate in targeting diverse membrane proteins to specialized zzso in the plasma membrane and zzso zzso This study addresses the question of how individual zzso zzso achieve functional specificity when zzso in the same zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice display zzso of zzso zzso receptors and zzso receptors along with reduced contraction rates that can be rescued by expression of green fluorescent protein zzso but not zzso We developed zzso zzso expression zzso containing all combinations of the three major zzso of zzso and zzso to determine which zzso of zzso are required for zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso determined activity of zzso zzso in zzso in a zzso pattern in zzso and in restoration of a normal zzso distribution of both zzso and zzso zzso receptors as well as normal beat frequency of contracting zzso Further deletions within the zzso domain demonstrated that the zzso domain determines zzso activity, whereas deletion of the death domain had no zzso zzso zzso are the most divergent between zzso zzso and are candidates to zzso the zzso that enable zzso to selectively target proteins to diverse cellular zzso
