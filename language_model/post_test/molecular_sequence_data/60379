We investigated the expression of the drug zzso zzso zzso resistance gene 1 zzso zzso resistance associated protein gene zzso and the DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso in three human zzso cell lines zzso 2, zzso 7, zzso with or without drug treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso method and a competitive zzso zzso The signals of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso were weakened when zzso was added to zzso In zzso the administration of zzso alone increased the signals of zzso while the addition of zzso decreased the signals, and the signals of zzso were decreased by zzso plus zzso In zzso our results concerning the expression of drug zzso genes in three human zzso cell lines demonstrate that zzso may zzso the mechanism of resistance to zzso in liver zzso
