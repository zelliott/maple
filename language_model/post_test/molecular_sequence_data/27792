zzso are transported into zzso zzso by a binding zzso transport system known as zzso zzso it comprises three structural zzso zzso as well as a fourth gene of unknown function zzso which is transcribed zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Kay, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso strongly reduced expression of zzso or of zzso zzso zzso however, expression was restored when zzso was present in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was strongly zzso in the presence of zzso but could be alleviated by the addition of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso was found not to be zzso zzso Thus, zzso is considered to be regulated by zzso repression and encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso From the DNA sequence of zzso the predicted gene product was zzso and shared distinct zzso with other globally regulated zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso
