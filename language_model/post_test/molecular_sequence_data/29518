zzso bacteria are able to sense temperature changes and respond by zzso the expression zzso zzso that code for zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso has been shown to play a role in the zzso of zzso factor zzso In addition to zzso proteins of the zzso family have also been identified in different zzso as participating in the zzso of some zzso zzso For one of these zzso the zzso zzso it has been shown that it interacts with zzso and both proteins form a zzso complex responsible for the zzso of, at least, zzso coli zzso The presence of genes coding for zzso of both proteins on some zzso plasmids and their relation to zzso suggests that this complex could also play a role in the regulation of zzso zzso
