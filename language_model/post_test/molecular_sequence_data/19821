Type III zzso systems zzso found in several zzso zzso are zzso involved in the transport of zzso zzso directly into the zzso of target zzso zzso are essentially composed of zzso zzso zzso structures and a hollow needle formed by a single zzso zzso Within the bacterial zzso the zzso needle protein requires two distinct zzso for stabilization before its zzso without which the entire zzso is zzso The zzso zzso crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso reveals that the C zzso of the needle protein zzso is engulfed within the zzso groove of the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso scaffold necessary to stabilize the zzso needle is totally distinct from zzso complexes between zzso or zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso interactions leads to impairment of bacterial zzso toward zzso indicating that this essential zzso which possesses zzso in a wide variety of zzso is a unique attractive target for the development of novel zzso
