In 1911, Peyton zzso reported that a zzso could be transmitted between chickens in a zzso extract of the zzso The zzso agent, zzso zzso virus zzso zzso cells by virtue of the presence within its zzso of a viral zzso zzso which is derived from a normal cellular gene that has been picked up, or zzso by the zzso This cellular zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso which has the ability to zzso proteins on zzso zzso Studies of zzso were thus directly responsible for the discovery of cellular zzso and of zzso zzso discoveries which have been fundamental in shaping our ideas about cellular growth zzso In spite of this, the normal biological role of zzso is still unclear and it remains impossible to provide a full answer to the question of how zzso causes zzso It is clear, however, that zzso is the zzso of a family of at least 8 closely related genes zzso protein zzso zzso the other family members being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The purpose of this review is to outline our current knowledge of the structure, expression pattern, and function of each of the members of the zzso gene family and to describe recent data which begins to explain how these proteins interact with other cellular proteins to control cell zzso The evidence for involvement of these proteins in zzso is also zzso
