zzso zzso zzso zzso is a hypersensitivity lung disease caused by the mold zzso zzso We previously reported that the majority of T cell clones zzso isolated from three zzso patients, and specific for a dominant zzso of zzso zzso zzso f 1, were zzso zzso zzso cells capable of responding to zzso in association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso In the present study we extended the previous findings to determine whether the observed restriction with the zzso zzso held importance in a larger patient zzso zzso revealed that 16 of 18 zzso patients were either zzso zzso or zzso Compared with a normal control population, the zzso of zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso were significantly increased in these zzso zzso zzso analyses of an additional 15 patients identified the same zzso zzso previously shown functional for zzso f 1 zzso zzso The relative zzso of zzso f 1 peptides for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined to determine whether differential binding to the zzso zzso explains successful zzso zzso Similar low binding zzso were detected for both zzso zzso indicating that the functionality cannot be simply explained by differences in binding zzso Thus, the limited number and their role in zzso presentation emphasizes the possibility that the six identified zzso zzso are important in the zzso of zzso
