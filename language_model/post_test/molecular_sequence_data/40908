zzso acid zzso plays a key role in various aspects of plant growth and development, including adaptation to environmental stress and fruit maturation in sweet cherry zzso In higher plants, the level of zzso is determined by synthesis and zzso In order to gain insight into zzso synthesis and zzso in sweet cherry fruit during maturation and under stress conditions, four zzso of zzso zzso for zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso and one zzso of zzso for zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, were isolated from sweet cherry fruit zzso zzso zzso The timing and pattern of zzso expression was zzso with that of zzso zzso which was correlated to maturation of sweet cherry zzso All four zzso were expressed at varying zzso throughout fruit development and appeared to play overlapping roles in zzso zzso throughout sweet cherry fruit zzso The application of zzso enhanced the expression of zzso zzso as well as zzso but zzso the zzso transcript zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were strongly increased by water zzso No significant differences in zzso and zzso expression were observed between dehydrated and control zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso content is modulated by a dynamic balance between zzso and zzso which are regulated by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, during fruit maturation and under stress zzso
