Human cervical zzso are often associated with human zzso zzso In zzso cervical zzso the zzso E6 and zzso are consistently zzso In this study, the effects of zzso zzso of both proteins were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complementary to regions zzso the start zzso of zzso E6 and zzso zzso respectively, were zzso These zzso zzso inhibited the growth of cervical cell lines zzso and zzso which harbor zzso but had little effect on cells that do zzso Both zzso also affected the ability of zzso cells to form colonies in soft zzso In nude mice, treatment with either zzso zzso or a mixture of both led to substantially smaller zzso zzso was observed to inhibit zzso zzso The zzso zzso probably exerts its effect by suppressing the expression of E6 as well as zzso Cell cultures and tumors treated with zzso showed a decrease in zzso zzso In addition, an zzso zzso targeted at the zzso gene was able to reverse some of the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells, indicating that zzso inhibited zzso zzso This study further demonstrates that zzso zzso may be useful zzso
