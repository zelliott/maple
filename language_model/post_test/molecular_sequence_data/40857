In most zzso zzso greater sequence variation is observed in zzso regions zzso and untranslated zzso than in coding regions due to selective zzso During characterization of genes and transcripts zzso small zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso from the zzso fly, we found exactly the opposite pattern of conservation in several families of zzso the zzso regions were highly zzso but the coding regions were highly zzso 

Seven genes from the zzso family are clustered as one zzso and six tandem repeats within a 15 zzso region of the zzso Except for zzso a gene that encodes a protein identical to that zzso by zzso the other six genes consist of a highly zzso mature zzso region as well as highly zzso regions including the promoter, zzso and zzso a signal zzso coding region, and an zzso This unusual pattern of highly diversified coding regions coupled with highly zzso regions in the rest of the gene was also observed in several other groups of zzso genes or zzso The unusual conservation pattern was also found in some of the zzso zzso from the Asian rice zzso zzso but not from the orange wheat blossom zzso Strong positive selection was one of the forces driving for diversification whereas concerted homogenization was likely a mechanism for sequence zzso 

Rapid diversification in mature zzso suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for functional zzso The conservation in the zzso regions of these genes including zzso also suggested potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization that are not yet fully zzso This report should be useful for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and functional adaptation of zzso zzso
