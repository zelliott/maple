Members of the zzso gene family are involved in regulating many zzso processes including zzso determination and zzso and in zzso So far they have only been identified in species from the zzso zzso and zzso To understand the origins of the zzso family, we used a zzso strategy to obtain 28 new sequences of zzso gene zzso zzso from four zzso zzso two sponge species, one zzso and one zzso One additional zzso sequence was retrieved from zzso sequences of the zzso species zzso zzso Unexpected zzso gene diversity was found in these species, especially in the zzso and the zzso The zzso of gene relationships deduced by zzso zzso analysis, although not supported by zzso values, suggested that the zzso family started to diversify in the zzso stem branch prior to the divergence of zzso and that further diversification occurred in the zzso branch, as well as later in zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, gene loss appears to have occurred in the zzso and probably in other zzso zzso explaining their lower number of zzso zzso
