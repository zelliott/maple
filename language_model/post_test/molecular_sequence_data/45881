The scanning model of zzso translation proposes that highly stable secondary structures within zzso can inhibit translation, while structures of lower zzso stability also affect translation if close enough to the zzso zzso G zzso However, only zzso information is available about the dependence of translation efficiency in live zzso cells on the zzso stability, location, and zzso content of zzso structures in the zzso zzso We devised a zzso zzso zzso for translation efficiency in single live cells and compared a wide range of zzso with predicted zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso G zzso distances of zzso zzso zzso efficiency decreased abruptly as hairpin zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso a hairpin as little as nine bases relative to the zzso cap could zzso translation more than zzso zzso zzso content diminished translation efficiency when predicted zzso stability and zzso distances were held zzso We additionally found naturally occurring zzso regions affected translation differently in live cells compared with translation in in zzso zzso Our study will assist scientists in designing experiments that deliberately zzso zzso translation with designed zzso zzso
