A large collection of zzso strains of zzso zzso of diverse origins including zzso 01 and zzso and those belonging to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were examined with a battery of DNA zzso specific for zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso accessory zzso toxin zzso and El zzso zzso zzso to determine the distribution of genes among wild strains and to understand the importance of these factors in the zzso of the disease zzso Among the 01 clinical zzso the majority of the strains had an intact core region zzso zzso zzso and also possessed the zzso zzso Although rare, strains of 01 with natural deletions of the zzso zzso and/or ace genes were also zzso The absence of the zzso genes zzso the core region and the presence of the zzso gene dominated the 01 environment, food zzso and the clinical and environmental zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso All the zzso strains examined in this study possessed genes located in the core region and the zzso zzso Among all the zzso genes zzso the zzso gene was the most zzso genetic element in zzso zzso independent of zzso and zzso
