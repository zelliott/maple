The present study proposes a strategy for human in zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on sequential extraction with zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso approaches were zzso samples were subjected to zzso zzso followed by zzso and mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples were zzso by zzso (both linear and zzso zzso and zzso analysis, and samples were subjected to zzso followed by zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso The majority of the identifications corresponded to zzso fragments of zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso basic zzso zzso zzso S and zzso and zzso 1 (all also identified in intact zzso Overall, more than 90 zzso were zzso zzso clearly show that peptides with zzso groups are enriched in the zzso fraction while peptides with no zzso or zzso groups are prevalent on the zzso zzso Also, zzso peptides were observed mainly on the zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso show a predominance of zzso points located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data suggest that zzso activity could influence zzso formation and zzso
