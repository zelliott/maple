zzso toxicity in acid zzso severely limits crop productivity through zzso of root growth and, consequently, shoot zzso Several zzso zzso were previously identified as having roots with Al zzso suggesting that these represent deleterious zzso affecting genes required for either Al tolerance or resistance zzso For this report, the zzso zzso was chosen for further zzso The zzso of zzso is most obviously presented in Al challenged roots, as evidenced by exaggerated root growth zzso in conjunction with increased expression of zzso genes compared to zzso Using a zzso cloning approach, the zzso zzso was isolated and found to represent a deleterious zzso acid substitution in a previously zzso half type ABC zzso zzso which is expressed in a zzso dependent manner in all zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso expression is primarily localized to the root tip and the zzso throughout the zzso zzso with this, an zzso zzso fusion accumulates at the zzso membrane of root cells, indicating that zzso may be important for zzso movement of some zzso possibly zzso Al, as part of a mechanism of Al zzso
