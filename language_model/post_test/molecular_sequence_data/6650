The extreme zzso zzso zzso strain zzso produces an zzso alkaline zzso zzso during zzso This zzso is stable for more than 24 h at 70 degrees C and has a pH optimum of zzso The zzso gene was identified using zzso designed to amplify a region between two highly zzso zzso acid motifs in zzso zzso and the zzso product was used to identify a zzso zzso containing the zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso gene contained a region identical to that obtained by zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the entire derived zzso sequence with other zzso zzso zzso revealed significant zzso especially with zzso I from zzso zzso zzso and with zzso A from zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with zzso as an aid for zzso and to overcome difficulties experienced with other zzso zzso which produced inactive zzso The zzso is inactive as zzso and zzso was shown to be zzso with shorter incubation times required at higher zzso removal of the zzso signal zzso from the start of the gene reduced the time required for zzso to less than a third of that required if the signal zzso was zzso
