The highly zzso H5N1 avian influenza virus emerged from China in 1996 and has spread across zzso and Africa, with a continuous stream of new cases of human infection appearing since the first large-scale outbreak among migratory birds at zzso zzso The role of wild birds, which are the natural reservoirs for the virus, in the epidemiology of the H5N1 virus has raised great public health concern, but their role in the spread of the virus within the natural zzso of zzso zzso wild zzso remains zzso In this study, we investigated H5N1 virus infection in wild zzso in an attempt to trace the circulation of the zzso zzso surveys confirmed a natural H5N1 virus infection of wild zzso in their native zzso The zzso gene of the H5N1 virus isolated from zzso reveals two distinct evolutionary zzso a zzso H5N1 virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and a wild bird zzso zzso H5N1 virus zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso zzso at position zzso zzso by the zzso gene of the zzso zzso virus was different from that of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso virus was the same as that of the goose H5N1 virus zzso zzso Further, we discovered that in contrast to the zzso zzso virus, which is zzso to mice, the zzso zzso virus is highly zzso To mimic the virus infection of zzso we zzso zzso zzso a species closely related to zzso with the H5N1 virus of zzso zzso Our findings first demonstrate that wild zzso are zzso hosts exposed to H5N1 zzso avian influenza viruses in the natural zzso and also imply a potential transmission of highly zzso avian influenza virus from wild zzso into domestic zzso hosts and zzso
