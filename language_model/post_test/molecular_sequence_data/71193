zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso show no channel activity after zzso expression in zzso expression zzso This report shows that zzso expression of zzso and zzso specifically suppresses the currents zzso by zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso but does not affect currents zzso by zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso To understand the molecular basis of the electrical silence of zzso zzso channels, crucial functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso segment, and pore zzso were exchanged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies of these zzso revealed that the pore region is involved in determining the zzso behavior of zzso zzso zzso This analysis was extended by protein interaction zzso aiming to identify the region of zzso zzso responsible for the specific suppression of zzso and zzso zzso We could show that the zzso domain of zzso zzso does not support zzso assembly but interacts specifically with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso assembly of zzso with zzso or zzso is governed by the zzso core and not the zzso zzso
