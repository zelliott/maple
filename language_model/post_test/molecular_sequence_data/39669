The zzso zzso is the zzso dominant zzso in the zzso zzso This group consists of multiple zzso that are zzso and zzso distinct and occur in different zzso along environmental zzso Here we examine adaptations to zzso zzso limitation among zzso First, we used DNA zzso to identify genes involved in the zzso response in two strains belonging to different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most of the zzso genes under P zzso were unique to one zzso In zzso many zzso genes were zzso suggesting a general stress response in this zzso We also observed major differences in zzso The zzso genes comprise two clusters on the zzso the first containing the P master regulator zzso and most known zzso genes and the second, absent in zzso containing genes of unknown zzso We examined the organization of the zzso gene cluster in 11 zzso strains belonging to diverse zzso and found high zzso in gene content that was not zzso with zzso zzso We zzso that this zzso zzso is related to differences in P availability in the oceans from which the strains were zzso Analysis of a zzso library from the zzso Sea supports this zzso most zzso cells in this zzso environment contain the zzso genes seen in zzso although a number of previously zzso gene combinations were zzso
