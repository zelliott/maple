The bacterial zzso motor is a molecular machine that converts zzso flux across the membrane into zzso zzso The zzso zzso is either a zzso or a sodium zzso The polar zzso motor of the marine zzso zzso zzso is driven by sodium zzso and the four protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for motor zzso Among them, zzso and zzso are similar to zzso and zzso of the zzso motors, zzso zzso shows greatest similarity to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso zzso the same length as zzso and zzso of its zzso are identical to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso has high similarity only to the zzso region of zzso To examine whether the zzso zzso motor genes can function in place of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso we constructed plasmids including both zzso and zzso or zzso alone and transformed them into zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso from both strains showed restored zzso although the swimming speeds were zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso were not restored to zzso by any zzso containing zzso and/or zzso Next, we tested which zzso zzso or zzso coupled to the hybrid motor zzso The motor did not work in zzso buffer and was inhibited by zzso and zzso sodium zzso zzso but not by a zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso motor zzso zzso of zzso zzso can generate zzso by zzso with the sodium zzso flux in place of zzso of zzso zzso
