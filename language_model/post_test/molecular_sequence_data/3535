zzso or zzso of members of the zzso zzso family is important during cell cycle zzso However, zzso a member of this family that was originally identified because of its high structural zzso to zzso is activated during cell differentiation and cell death but not during cell cycle zzso We previously demonstrated a correlation between the zzso of zzso protein and zzso activity and cell death during development and zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso massive zzso cell death in mouse zzso and that zzso is expressed in zzso cells displaying fragmented zzso During zzso cell death, zzso protein expression is substantially increased as detected by zzso but not by Western zzso while its zzso level remains the same as control, and its zzso activity is markedly zzso The zzso of zzso during zzso cell death is not due to de zzso protein zzso We also examined zzso a regulatory protein of zzso in zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso system, we isolated zzso a zzso differentiation specific zzso as a protein that interacts with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso level does not change, but the protein expression of zzso a truncated form of zzso is elevated during cell death in zzso as established here, as well as during cell death in zzso Our results suggest a role for zzso and its regulatory proteins during zzso induced cell zzso These results further support the view that zzso and its regulation may be key players in the execution of cell death regardless of how the cell dies, whether through biological mechanisms, disease states such as Alzheimer's disease, or induction by zzso
