The structural competence of the skeleton is maintained by an zzso mechanism in which resident bone cells respond to zzso zzso To investigate the possible role of the zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso in this response, we studied NO production in zzso organ culture systems, rat long zzso zzso zzso cells, and embryonic chick zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso bone cores, loading (for 15 zzso produces increases in zzso zzso NO zzso release during the loading period, which paralleled those in zzso and zzso zzso of rat zzso and zzso produces increases in zzso release, and in zzso NO zzso zzso diminish these zzso zzso rapid increases in NO release are zzso by strain in both zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of extracted zzso shows that rat zzso zzso and zzso express both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of NO zzso zzso to mechanical strain relies on assessment of the strain environment followed by modification of bone zzso Immediate increases in NO production induced by loading suggest the involvement of NO in strain measurement and cellular communication to establish strain distribution, as well as potentially in zzso changes in bone cell zzso
