The zzso gene family is zzso from insects to zzso and codes for putative zzso receptors that share a zzso zzso domain and seven zzso zzso We previously identified a novel zzso zzso zzso now renamed zzso in the zzso syndrome zzso deletion region at zzso band zzso and showed that its product can interact with the zzso wingless zzso Here, we report the characterization of the mouse zzso zzso The zzso gene produces a zzso transcript zzso a zzso protein with zzso identity to the human zzso zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso region on zzso mouse zzso zzso By zzso in zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso and sections we delineated the zzso and spatial expression patterns in the neural tube, trunk skeletal muscle precursors zzso limb skeletal zzso zzso regions, and zzso zzso In adult mouse zzso the zzso transcript is abundantly present in heart, brain, zzso and skeletal zzso In zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso cell zzso zzso studies of cells zzso with a zzso expression construct confirm that zzso is a membrane zzso These results suggest potential zzso zzso of zzso a role of zzso in skeletal muscle zzso and contributions of zzso to the zzso zzso
