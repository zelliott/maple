The zzso gene of zzso coli zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been cloned and zzso The mature zzso as deduced by the structural gene zzso contains zzso zzso acids and has a calculated Mr of zzso zzso of the zzso control region to other zzso zzso control regions reveals a common region of zzso symmetry which may be the binding site for the zzso zzso zzso Construction of an zzso strain permitted zzso of the protein to zzso zzso sequence analysis and comparison of zzso binding domain sequences zzso & zzso 1987) confirm the zzso acid sequence deduced from the gene zzso The zzso protein exhibits zzso activity of zzso the normal zzso and zzso can replace zzso as a nitrogen donor with a zzso zzso 1 M and a turnover of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso forms an zzso zzso complex with zzso zzso is 22 zzso at 4 degrees zzso This isolated complex is not chemically competent to complete turnover when zzso and zzso are added, demonstrating that zzso and zzso are not zzso bound as a zzso available to complete the chemical conversion to zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso is bound zzso to the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso and dead-end zzso kinetic studies on zzso zzso are most consistent with a sequential mechanism in which zzso binds followed by rapid equilibrium binding of zzso and then zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso results in quantitative transfer of the zzso to zzso
