The three-dimensional structure of the basic pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso contains four internal water zzso which form a total of nine zzso hydrogen bonds with the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the effect of such internal zzso on protein structure and stability, we displaced one of the internal water molecules in a zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso 36 is replaced by zzso The replacement of a water zzso by the zzso side chain was established by the absence of the zzso nuclear zzso effects zzso that had been attributed to the water zzso near zzso 36 in zzso zzso and by the presence of new, zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has slightly reduced zzso stability compared to zzso corresponding to a zzso by delta zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso in 6 M zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of the complexes formed between zzso and zzso zzso or zzso are significantly reduced when compared to the corresponding complexes with zzso zzso
