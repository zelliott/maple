zzso is a zzso hormone which is produced in human zzso zzso including the zzso and prostate zzso Little is known of the molecular events regulating zzso gene zzso We have studied this question using gene transfer of zzso zzso gene zzso into a zzso cell zzso A number of human cells lines expressed zzso as detected by reverse zzso In one of these lines, the prostate zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso was also detected by Northern zzso zzso The DNA sequences of the zzso zzso regions zzso 900 zzso of the two human zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso containing portions of the zzso regions of zzso and zzso linked to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso reporter gene were zzso The expression of the reporter gene zzso was zzso in the zzso cell line and the results of these transient zzso zzso have led to the identification of positive and negative regulatory regions within the zzso zzso A difference in activity of the zzso and zzso gene promoters in this prostate cell line was observed, with the zzso promoter being more zzso This situation may mimic that occurring in zzso since the zzso zzso from the prostate zzso into seminal fluid is the product of the zzso zzso
