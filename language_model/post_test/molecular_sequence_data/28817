zzso processing zzso zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for the maturation of various zzso proteins in higher zzso To clarify the mechanism of maturation and zzso of zzso we expressed the precursors of zzso gamma zzso in insect zzso The cells accumulated a zzso zzso precursor zzso and an zzso zzso precursor zzso which might be zzso The zzso sequence of zzso revealed that zzso had a zzso signal zzso to be removed zzso Under zzso conditions, the zzso zzso was zzso converted to a zzso intermediate form zzso and then to the zzso mature form zzso zzso sequencing of zzso and zzso showed that sequential removal of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced zzso Both zzso and zzso exhibited the activity, while zzso exhibited no zzso These results imply that the removal of the zzso zzso is essential for zzso the zzso Further removal of the zzso zzso from zzso is not required to activate the zzso To demonstrate that the zzso zzso functions as an inhibitor of zzso we expressed the zzso zzso and produced specific zzso against zzso We found that the zzso zzso reduced the activity of zzso and that this zzso activity was suppressed by specific zzso against zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso functions as an zzso domain that masks the zzso zzso Thus, the removal of the zzso zzso of zzso might expose the zzso site of the zzso
