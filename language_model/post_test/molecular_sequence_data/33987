zzso of soluble proteins to the zzso in zzso zzso is determined by an zzso transit zzso zzso which is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso precursor proteins are zzso at the rough zzso zzso but are then specifically sorted from other proteins in the zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso recognition is presently zzso zzso zzso do not contain a zzso sequence zzso therefore, we asked whether they contain an essential structural zzso Using nuclear magnetic resonance to study a model zzso from zzso carrier zzso we found a short, zzso zzso but the zzso was otherwise zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso we blocked zzso secondary structure by zzso zzso but found robust zzso zzso zzso we increased the zzso content of the zzso through zzso while maintaining established zzso zzso zzso import was disrupted in a zzso zzso zzso but import was then restored by the further addition of a single zzso We conclude that structure in the zzso interferes with zzso import, and therefore zzso are functionally zzso These results provide an explanation for the zzso acid bias observed in zzso zzso
