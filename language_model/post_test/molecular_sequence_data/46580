zzso is a zzso protein that is required to arrest the cell cycle and to establish cell polarity during zzso zzso zzso is localized predominantly in the nucleus but accumulates in the zzso in cells exposed to zzso Here we show that zzso functions in both zzso zzso nuclear zzso is required to arrest the cell cycle, whereas zzso zzso is involved in the establishment of cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by two zzso zzso zzso contains a functional zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso is exported from the nucleus by zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso deleted for zzso failed to export zzso in response to zzso whereas zzso of zzso was sufficient to accumulate zzso in the zzso in the absence of zzso zzso was localized in the nucleus and zzso with zzso in a manner dependent on zzso zzso zzso analysis identified a small zzso within zzso that is necessary and sufficient for binding to zzso and is also required to export zzso in zzso Finally, similar to zzso zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso which can no longer be zzso exhibit a mating zzso but are able to arrest their cell cycle in response to zzso Taken together, our results suggest that nuclear export of zzso by zzso coordinates the two zzso functions of zzso during zzso
