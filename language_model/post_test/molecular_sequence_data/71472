The zzso acid group of zzso zzso zzso A3 and zzso are well established as zzso zzso which bind zzso to DNA at and above zzso zzso in the presence of zzso metal zzso such as zzso As part of our broad objective to zzso their zzso mode of action, other than association with DNA, we studied their interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso Different zzso studies, such as zzso zzso and CD, have shown that both free zzso and zzso and their zzso complexes bind to zzso with an affinity higher than that reported for zzso The affinity zzso for the association of zzso and zzso (or their zzso zzso with zzso are comparable with those for the association of zzso with other zzso zzso for example zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The nature of the binding of the two antibiotics to zzso is zzso The mode of binding of the antibiotics with zzso also changes in the presence of zzso The interaction leads to a change in the zzso structure of the zzso The relevance of the results to our understanding of the mode of action of the antibiotics is zzso
