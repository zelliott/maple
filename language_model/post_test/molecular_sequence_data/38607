Mercury resistance zzso are widespread in zzso bacteria, but vary in the number and identity of genes zzso We have shown that the zzso gene from zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso mercury transport zzso by determining in zzso mercury zzso when zzso is expressed in the presence of zzso zzso We have confirmed that zzso of zzso is also a zzso zzso zzso We have been able to detect interaction of the zzso protein zzso only with the zzso zzso and not with zzso or zzso zzso analysis led to the prediction of models for zzso zzso and zzso having three, four and two zzso regions zzso In all three cases one pair of zzso zzso is predicted to be within the inner membrane with a second pair of zzso zzso on the zzso face, and the second zzso contains a zzso and at least one charged zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso transport may be similar in these zzso even though their structures in the membrane zzso
