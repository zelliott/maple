The zzso zzso gene of the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus has been amplified and zzso from archival zzso The zzso gene is known to be involved in many aspects of viral function and to interact with host zzso thereby playing a role in host zzso The 1918 zzso zzso acid sequence differs at only six zzso acids from avian consensus zzso consistent with zzso from an avian source shortly before zzso However, the zzso sequence of the 1918 zzso gene has more than 170 differences from avian strain consensus zzso suggesting substantial evolutionary distance from known avian strain zzso Both the gene and protein sequences of the 1918 zzso fall within the zzso zzso upon zzso zzso The evolutionary distance of the 1918 zzso sequences from avian and zzso strain sequences is zzso using several different zzso The results suggest that the 1918 strain did not retain the previously circulating human zzso Nor is it likely to have obtained its zzso by zzso with an avian strain similar to those now zzso The results are consistent with the existence of a currently unknown host for zzso with an zzso similar to current avian strain zzso at the zzso acid level but with many synonymous zzso differences, suggesting evolutionary isolation from the currently characterized avian influenza virus gene zzso
