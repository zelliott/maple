zzso bud outgrowth is controlled by zzso and environmental signals through the integrated action of hormones and other factors that probably regulate the cell cycle in the zzso While hormonal regulators have been studied zzso less is known about downstream mechanisms regulating bud zzso The zzso domain protein zzso zzso zzso is a putative zzso regulator that zzso bud outgrowth in zzso zzso analyses have indicated that three hypothetical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso are closely related to zzso zzso zzso A reverse zzso approach was used to identify zzso and zzso zzso to assess the function of the hypothetical zzso No obvious zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso zzso that was due to enhanced outgrowth of primary and secondary zzso The role of zzso as a zzso of bud outgrowth was supported by zzso zzso zzso abundance was high in zzso zzso and decreased to low levels in buds that were zzso zzso of zzso expression in hormone signaling zzso with zzso branching suggest that zzso acts downstream of zzso and the zzso hormone to coordinate bud zzso The data are consistent with zzso zzso providing functionality similar to zzso zzso and highlight the conservation of mechanisms regulating branching across large evolutionary zzso
