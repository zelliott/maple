zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from diseased zzso has been zzso The complete zzso of zzso comprises zzso zzso and encodes five typical zzso genes zzso zzso M, G and zzso In addition, two open reading frames zzso are predicted overlapping with P zzso one upstream of P and smaller than P zzso called zzso and another in P gene which may encodes a protein similar to the zzso zzso virus C zzso The C zzso is contained within the P zzso The five typical proteins share the highest sequence identities zzso with the corresponding proteins of zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of partial L protein sequence indicates that zzso is close to zzso zzso The first 13 zzso at the ends of the zzso zzso are absolutely inverse zzso The gene junctions between the five genes show zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by putative zzso initiation sequence zzso which are different from known zzso The entire Ps zzso was cloned and zzso and used to generate zzso zzso in zzso One obvious band could be detected in zzso carp zzso cells zzso by zzso serum via Western zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso fusion protein exhibited zzso distribution as multiple punctuate or doughnut shaped zzso of uneven zzso
