Recent studies have shown that at least 17 genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso are clustered within a zzso DNA zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Several additional transcripts have also been mapped to this gene zzso A zzso zzso zzso named zzso corresponding to one of the two transcripts identified earlier between the zzso and zzso genes on the gene cluster was zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene contains a coding region for a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The gene consists of three zzso and two zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso resulted in a zzso zzso which accumulated a bright yellow zzso zzso zzso studies with six different zzso systems showed that the migration patterns of the accumulated zzso were identical to those of zzso a known zzso zzso zzso feeding studies with this zzso showed that zzso acid and zzso were not converted to zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were converted to zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso strain and zzso zzso strain indicated that the zzso gene was disrupted in the zzso zzso A search of the zzso database for similarity indicated that the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso and it has been assigned to a new zzso gene family named zzso We have therefore concluded that the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the conversion of zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
