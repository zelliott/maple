zzso zzso zzso zzso are an ecologically important group of zzso Previous studies showed the presence of divergent copies of zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso and suggested horizontal gene transfer from host plants or zzso to zzso We zzso these genes from DNA isolated from an in zzso cultured isolate of zzso zzso that was free of any obvious zzso We found two highly variable zzso sequences and variable zzso zzso Despite this high variation, comparison of the sequences with those in gene banks supported a zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, our results are in sharp contrast with the previously reported zzso origin of those zzso We present evidence that some highly divergent sequences of zzso and zzso deposited in the databases are likely to be zzso We therefore reject the prediction of horizontal transfer to zzso zzso High differences in zzso content between zzso sequences and sequences grouping in other lineages are shown and we suggest they can be used as an indicator to detect such zzso zzso zzso gave unexpected results and failed to resolve zzso as a natural zzso zzso zzso supported zzso as sister group of the zzso Contrasts between our results and trees previously generated using zzso sequences are zzso
