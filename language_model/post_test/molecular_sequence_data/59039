In an attempt to understand the molecular nature of zzso disease, we have examined the zzso acid sequence of the affected zzso gene product (The International zzso Disease zzso zzso Cell 82, zzso and the zzso zzso which give rise to the biological zzso zzso searches and molecular modeling have led to the development of a model for the folding and disposition of the zzso possibly within a zzso zzso High zzso with a zzso protein of unknown function suggests a strong evolutionary conservation of zzso We speculate that a possible role for the protein may be in zzso the zzso or zzso zzso of other zzso specifically zzso c of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
