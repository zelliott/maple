With a standard set of zzso directed toward zzso regions, we have used the zzso chain reaction to amplify zzso segments of zzso from more than 100 animal species, including zzso birds, zzso fishes, and some zzso zzso and direct sequencing were possible using zzso zzso from zzso samples of fresh specimens and zzso amounts of zzso preserved for months in alcohol or decades in the dry zzso The bird and fish sequences evolve with the same strong bias toward transitions that holds for zzso However, because the light strand of birds is deficient in zzso zzso to zzso transitions are less common than in other zzso zzso acid replacement in a segment of the zzso b gene is faster in zzso and birds than in zzso and the pattern of replacements fits the structural hypothesis for zzso zzso The unexpectedly wide zzso utility of these zzso offers opportunities for zzso and population zzso
