To study the relationships between zzso and zzso we compared the zzso and their frequency induced by ultraviolet zzso at 254 zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso in the same zzso zzso are deficient in zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso patients develop early skin tumors, zzso patients do not exhibit abnormal levels of zzso After zzso of zzso hypersensitivity and DNA repair zzso of the immortalized cell lines zzso and zzso compared with a zzso cell line, zzso zzso was studied with a new shuttle zzso zzso carrying the target zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells were similar and significantly increased compared with normal zzso zzso analysis of 312 independent zzso plasmids revealed that more zzso were induced in zzso cells zzso than in zzso zzso and normal cells zzso while zzso cells exhibited a twofold higher rate of tandem zzso compared with zzso and normal zzso In the three cell lines, a predominance of zzso to zzso transitions was found, especially in chiefly on the zzso at zzso zzso The types of zzso point zzso in zzso cells were, however, more similar to those in normal cells than those found in zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso located in zzso sites, while zzso in normal and zzso cells were mostly at zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed differences in the location of the zzso hotspots between the three zzso Although the zzso frequency of the zzso zzso zzso is much higher in zzso and zzso cells than in normal cells, the zzso spectrum is closer between zzso and normal cells as compared with zzso zzso These zzso could contribute to an explanation of some of the differences between the two zzso
