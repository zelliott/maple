The zzso zzso zzso zzso family is a ubiquitous family of heavy metal zzso Much interest in this family has focused on implications for human health and zzso In this work a broad zzso study has been undertaken which, considered in the context of the functional characteristics of some fully zzso zzso zzso has aimed at identifying molecular zzso of zzso selectivity and at suggesting metal specificity for newly identified zzso zzso 

Representative zzso members from all three zzso of life zzso zzso zzso were retrieved from zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment has allowed detection of a modified signature that can be used to identify new hypothetical zzso zzso zzso reconstruction has classified the majority of zzso family members into three groups, each containing zzso members that share the same specificity towards the zzso metal, zzso zzso zzso or zzso The metal selectivity of newly identified zzso zzso can be zzso by their position in one of these zzso The function of some zzso zzso acids was assessed by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared with similar experiments performed in zzso zzso An essential structural role can be assigned to a widely zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso highly zzso in putative zzso zzso might be involved in metal zzso The potential role of zzso zzso acid zzso in metal specificity is zzso 

In the present study zzso and functional analyses have allowed the identification of three major zzso zzso zzso The metal selectivity of newly identified zzso zzso can be zzso by their position in one of these zzso The modified signature sequence proposed in this work can be used to identify new hypothetical zzso zzso
