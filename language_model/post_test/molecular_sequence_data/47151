The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso cluster zzso of a recently emergent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Here we report the sequence of the genes downstream of the zzso zzso gene and analysis of the genes zzso the zzso gene cluster in other zzso The gene downstream of zzso designated zzso zzso junction zzso is predicted to be not required for zzso zzso but appears to be a hot spot for DNA zzso Several zzso of the zzso gene (three different insertions and a zzso have been found in other zzso DNA dot zzso analysis of 106 zzso zzso strains showed the presence of the left and right junction zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in all zzso Further, these genes mapped to a single zzso zzso in all 21 strains analyzed by zzso gel zzso indicating a close zzso The zzso sequence element zzso found in both zzso and zzso zzso regions, is present in zzso of the strains zzso interestingly, where present, it is predominantly linked to the zzso zzso These results indicated a zzso organization of the zzso region, with the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso A similar organization of the zzso region in other zzso raises the possibility of the emergence of new pathogens by zzso zzso via the junction zzso
