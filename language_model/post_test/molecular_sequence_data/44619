Studies of the effects of zzso zzso and zzso stress stimuli in differentiated cultures of human zzso zzso zzso cells have provided the rationale for our studies of a major new gene termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso clone was isolated by differential library screening using selection criteria based on the induction pattern of a new zzso found in zzso cultures after prolonged but not brief exposure to zzso This zzso induction pattern matched the time course and dose response required for zzso pressure zzso in patients receiving zzso The very large, progressive induction of zzso combined with specific structural features of its zzso suggested that zzso should be considered a candidate gene for zzso obstruction in zzso Among the properties of zzso zzso were a signal sequence for zzso several structural features for interactions with zzso and other zzso and putative sites for cell surface zzso In addition, the zzso zzso in the structure were related to zzso zzso that was shown to occur with native and zzso zzso zzso The zzso that zzso was a major stress response protein in zzso cells following hydrogen zzso (or zzso zzso exposure provided a potential link between zzso and zzso mechanisms thought to be involved in glaucoma zzso zzso evaluation showed that basic zzso growth factory and transforming growth factor beta decreased the zzso induction of zzso and certain zzso zzso drugs protected against both zzso and zzso stress responses in zzso zzso Our recent studies of zzso zzso structure have shown motifs in the promoter region that suggest a basis by which multiple zzso stimuli can regulate zzso production and by which putative genetic zzso could lead to an zzso of the zzso Further application of cell zzso molecular biology, genetic and zzso approaches will be helpful in understanding the role of zzso in different glaucoma zzso
