General mechanisms initiating the zzso process in early animal development are still zzso not least because embryonic zzso differs widely among zzso The rabbit zzso is revived here as a model to study zzso zzso because its relatively simple zzso at the appropriate stages makes zzso differences and similarities particularly obvious between zzso and zzso Three approaches that zzso on zzso zzso as a key event at the start of zzso were zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso 212 zzso acids of the rabbit zzso gene was cloned by zzso and used as a molecular marker for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed single zzso cells in the zzso at zzso days post zzso zzso several hours before the first zzso zzso cells can be detected zzso With the anterior marginal zzso as a landmark, these zzso zzso are shown to lie in a zzso zzso of the embryonic disc, which we call the zzso zzso extension zzso for reasons established during the following functional zzso zzso Vital dye zzso zzso in zzso suggests that zzso cells arrive in the zzso from anterior parts of the embryonic disc and then move within this area in a complex pattern of zzso zzso and anterior directions to form the primitive zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that proliferation is reduced in the zzso while the remaining anterior part of the embryonic disc contains several areas of increased zzso These results reveal similarities with the chick with respect to zzso expression and cellular zzso They zzso however, in that local differences in proliferation are not seen in the zzso avian zzso Rather, rabbit zzso cells start zzso differentiation in a way similar to zzso where a transient zzso of proliferation zzso zzso differentiation and, zzso zzso
