To produce more zzso converting zzso zzso peptides zzso we have established a zzso zzso coli expression zzso The zzso sequence for the zzso zzso which was zzso into the zzso zzso has been expressed as inclusion bodies in zzso coli zzso zzso The influences of induction time and concentration of zzso zzso on the expression of zzso protein were zzso The resulting expression level of the protein accounted for about zzso of cellular protein at a temperature of zzso zzso concentration of zzso and induction time of zzso The inclusion bodies were washed, separated from the cells, and zzso with zzso After zzso by affinity zzso the zzso protein was recovered with a high purity of about zzso zzso weight of the zzso protein was measured using zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso of the zzso protein with zzso and the zzso value was 61 zzso The zzso activity in spontaneously zzso rats zzso was also zzso Single oral administration of this zzso in zzso old zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso blood pressure to 50 zzso zzso at 4 zzso The data obtained provide a good reference for further development of zzso zzso into an effective zzso agent for prevention and treatment of zzso
