The zzso zzso genetic island zzso encodes a type IV zzso system zzso that is found in most strains of zzso zzso This zzso functions to zzso zzso DNA that is active in natural zzso The zzso has also been found in some strains of zzso zzso We screened 126 zzso of zzso zzso and found the zzso in zzso of zzso with the prevalence varying widely among zzso The zzso is found in a significant number of zzso C, zzso and X strains but was not found in strains of zzso A, B, or zzso Through detailed zzso mapping and DNA sequencing, we identified five distinct zzso types in zzso DNA sequencing and a genetic zzso revealed that the zzso was likely integrated into the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso can be excised and lost from the zzso zzso studies showed that in contrast with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso does not zzso DNA, nor does it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes did not affect association with or invasion of host zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso is found in a significant proportion of zzso strains and that while some strains carry multiple insertions and deletions in the zzso other strains carry intact zzso genes and may produce functional zzso zzso
