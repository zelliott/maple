A zzso zzso the first zzso member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors has been characterized in the Pacific zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso predicts a protein of 260 zzso acids that has zzso identity with the zzso domain, zzso identity with the basic zzso domain and zzso identity with the zzso zzso domain of other members of the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction with reverse zzso indicates that this gene is expressed during zzso stages from an zzso egg to a zzso It was demonstrated by northern zzso that the gene is also expressed on several adult zzso The identification of a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso may help to identify common functions that have been zzso through evolution and to zzso evolutionary relationships within this zzso of zzso
