Type I zzso zzso are zzso exhibiting zzso and zzso effects, including multiple activities on immune zzso However, the importance of these zzso in the early events leading to the generation of an immune response is still zzso Here, we have investigated the effects of type I zzso on freshly isolated zzso zzso factor zzso human zzso in terms of zzso cell zzso differentiation and activity in zzso and in severe combined zzso mice zzso with human peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso induced a surprisingly rapid maturation of zzso into short-lived tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso endowed with potent functional activities, superior with respect to the zzso zzso treatment, as shown by zzso zzso mixed zzso reaction zzso with zzso zzso and zzso proliferation responses to zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso induced zzso production and strongly promoted a T helper cell type 1 zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso resulted in the generation of a potent primary immune response, as evaluated by the detection of human zzso to various zzso zzso These results provide a rationale for using type I zzso as vaccine zzso and support the concept that a natural alliance between these zzso and zzso represents an important early mechanism for connecting innate and zzso zzso
