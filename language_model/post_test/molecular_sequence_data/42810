zzso free calcium zzso an important second messenger, plays a crucial role in a variety of zzso reactions leading to cell zzso and protein zzso This study examines the potential role of zzso in zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso activity of canine zzso observed upon binding of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso fluorescent probe zzso and digital video zzso imaging zzso zzso levels were determined in individual zzso for up to 29 minutes after addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (a known zzso in canine zzso and normal human zzso zzso zzso served as positive and negative controls, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed to induce significant increases in zzso whereas 500 zzso zzso induced a zzso 3- to zzso transient increase above resting zzso zzso of zzso zzso to these zzso cultures was demonstrated by zzso at the end of selected zzso zzso stimulation of cultures previously treated with zzso zzso showed normal responsiveness and more than zzso of the cells were still viable at the end of zzso imaging, thus demonstrating that failure to respond to zzso zzso was not due to an experimental zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso of zzso cultures incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and harvested at various time intervals was dependent on the zzso dose used and increased steadily over zzso zzso in activity were zzso higher in cultures treated with zzso zzso than those incubated with the same dose of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
