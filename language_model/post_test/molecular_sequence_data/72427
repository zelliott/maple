The active site of group I zzso zzso occurs at the interface of two proposed structural zzso In the zzso zzso half of the zzso core resides within the zzso zzso domain while the other half belongs to a putative domain that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso region of the zzso can also fold zzso we used zzso and zzso zzso to probe the zzso accessibility of separate fragments of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso into an active complex in zzso enabling analysis of their structural features both alone and within the zzso Our results show that while the zzso region of the zzso retains its secondary structure, most of the zzso interactions within this region do not form zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso domain zzso folding in the zzso region, organizing the zzso zzso between zzso Thus the zzso domain provides a scaffold for the folding of the zzso zzso zzso
