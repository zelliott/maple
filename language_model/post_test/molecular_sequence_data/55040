zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso Miller contains a stable zzso that was zzso to investigate its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso band corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso analysis detected seven zzso peptides that matched zzso peptides covering one third of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso All the characteristics tested indicated that the activity stabilized within the zzso zzso to the basic zzso zzso family, which includes members that have several zzso zzso Hence zzso might yield a widely used zzso in stabilized zzso
