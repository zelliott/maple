The growth zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso which is a member of the vitamin zzso protein family and was identified as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shares significant similarity with protein S and a similar domain zzso an extensively zzso zzso four zzso growth zzso motifs and a large zzso region, known as the D zzso Here we report on the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso 129 zzso zzso between the fourth zzso domain and the D zzso The gene zzso was previously mapped on zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has been investigated demonstrating the presence of alternative zzso consensus zzso zzso of zzso has been investigated in various human zzso and found to have a similar distribution pattern as zzso with the exception of the zzso where zzso seems to be the zzso zzso
