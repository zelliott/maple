An zzso zzso zzso zzso with an apparent molecular weight zzso of approximately 40,000 zzso has been identified in the asexual stages of the malaria zzso zzso zzso This protein appears to be equivalent to a previously described zzso zzso zzso which was reported to be expressed on the zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 3' end of the gene revealed the omission of a single base in the 3' region of the published zzso The corrected gene sequence encodes a zzso zzso zzso which indicates residency of the 40 zzso protein within the zzso zzso The predicted zzso region also appears to contain a sixth zzso zzso domain, which suggests that zzso is related to previously reported zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Weis K, zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of the 40 zzso zzso protein in malaria zzso was confirmed using zzso and partial protein sequencing of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of asexual stage zzso was used to show that zzso zzso with the known zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso of tightly synchronized zzso showed that expression of zzso increases with increasing maturity of the zzso We propose that zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso proteins and may play a role in protein trafficking in the malaria zzso
