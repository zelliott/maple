zzso zzso proteins can be zzso by the presence or absence of a variable zzso zzso located within zzso domain II of the zzso DEAD zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso for zzso function, since the zzso deletion zzso zzso displayed a zzso rate of cellular growth and protein zzso Loss or gain of zzso is extremely rare in the history of bacterial evolution, indicating that it appears to contribute to zzso function within the relevant species in their natural zzso zzso removal also results in additional zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso and suppression of signal sequence defects zzso The zzso protein was found to be modestly zzso for zzso zzso activities and displayed an accelerated rate of zzso release, consistent with the zzso basis of zzso zzso Based on our findings, we discuss models zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso DEAD motor function at zzso
