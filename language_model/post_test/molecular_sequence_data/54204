We developed the slowly relaxing local structure zzso approach for analyzing zzso spin relaxation in zzso zzso accounts for zzso zzso between the tumbling of the protein and the local motion of the probe and for general zzso zzso It is the zzso of the traditional zzso zzso method, which does not account for zzso and treats only simple zzso zzso zzso is applied zzso to zzso relaxation of zzso groups in the complex of zzso with the zzso zzso Literature data zzso zzso zzso and zzso acquired at zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 320 K, are zzso We find that zzso is a small effect for zzso zzso On the other hand, general zzso properties are zzso In particular, it is important to allow for the asymmetry of the local spatial zzso which can be represented in zzso by a zzso local ordering zzso with components zzso and zzso The principal axes frame of this zzso is obviously different from the zzso frames of the magnetic zzso Here, we find that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features a single zzso order zzso zzso confined to the zzso zzso the local geometry is inherently zzso The zzso S is zzso having absorbed zzso for effects, notably zzso zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso (the other zzso zzso zzso with rates of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso energies are 10 zzso zzso By contrast, zzso yields inaccurate effective local zzso correlation times, zzso with zzso temperature zzso Thus, the problematic zzso and zzso zzso picture of zzso dynamics has been replaced with an zzso physical picture based on a local ordering zzso related to structural features, and a local diffusion zzso that yields accurate zzso zzso
