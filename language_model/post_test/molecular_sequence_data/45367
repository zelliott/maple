Two novel zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were isolated from soil samples collected in the Western Cape province, South zzso Rapid zzso identification revealed that the zzso belonged to the zzso zzso (based on zzso restriction analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso had zzso acid and zzso in their zzso zzso and contained zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to grow at 45 degrees C and in the presence of zzso (3 zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso grows in the presence of zzso (2 zzso Neither strain was able to grow under zzso conditions, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited weak but distinct growth under zzso zzso zzso test results and zzso zzso gene sequence analysis allowed zzso and zzso to be distinguished from other members of the zzso with zzso published zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore represent the type strains of novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, are zzso
