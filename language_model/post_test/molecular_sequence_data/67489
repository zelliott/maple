Much progress has been made in determining zzso where gene expression at the zzso zzso level is controlled by genetic zzso in zzso However, zzso is only a proxy for what matters in zzso variation, which is protein zzso We set out to review the evidence for zzso zzso that affect translation of zzso 

zzso literature zzso 

There is ample literature on zzso diseases caused by rare zzso in zzso active zzso zzso Such zzso may eliminate or create zzso initiation zzso or alter the zzso sequences surrounding them, alter zzso secondary structure, destroy or enhance internal zzso entry sequences or zzso zzso By contrast, examples of complex zzso determined by common zzso in these elements are scarce, although reports (to be zzso of functionally zzso zzso binding sites are beginning to zzso 

Given the zzso limitations of detecting these zzso effects, we zzso that existing knowledge of such effects in common complex zzso represent the zzso of the zzso zzso quantitative zzso is beginning to offer a promise to explore this zzso
