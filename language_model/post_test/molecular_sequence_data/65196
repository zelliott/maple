zzso and its zzso are among the best zzso to label proteins and the labeling generally involves chemical modification of a translated zzso Using this methodology, labeling at a specific position remains zzso It is known that the guinea pig liver zzso zzso zzso modification method can allow zzso zzso labeling of a protein by zzso However, native activity of the fluorescent protein has not been investigated so far, nor has direct comparison between the chemical modification and the zzso modification been zzso zzso we compared the possibility of zzso labeling via chemical labeling and via zzso zzso The latter method was found to be very practical and overcame some of the problems associated with the specificity of the zzso zzso was zzso attached only to the zzso or zzso site of zzso zzso when the reaction was zzso by zzso and the resulting labeled protein completely retained its native zzso The zzso labeling occurred not only at room temperature but also at 4 degrees C to the same extent, which is more desirable for preventing the zzso of zzso
