Two divergent strains of zzso type 31 were analyzed by zzso test and restriction zzso zzso patterns in an effort to find the basis for their genetic zzso One strain, isolated from the throat of a child in Maryland during an upper respiratory illness in 1968, was partially neutralized by Ad 31 zzso (to zzso lower than zzso zzso while its own zzso fully neutralized zzso Ad 31 virus, but shared only zzso of zzso zzso fragments with Ad 31 zzso zzso zzso with Ad 18 zzso however, zzso tests specific for the zzso terminal repeat zzso sequence of zzso 12 and 18 were zzso The other strain, recovered from a stool sample from an infant with zzso in Georgia in 1979, was inhibited by Ad 31 zzso to within zzso zzso zzso but shared only zzso of zzso fragments with Ad 31 zzso zzso zzso with Ad 18 zzso zzso zzso tests with this virus were positive for Ad zzso zzso These data suggest that both strains are from separate evolutionary lines of Ad 31 unrelated to all other zzso studied to date by zzso analysis, and that the partial zzso by zzso Ad 31 zzso might represent small zzso in the zzso zzso
