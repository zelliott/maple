zzso is an ubiquitous zzso protein found in the zzso where it binds different zzso zzso in the zzso zzso where it constitutes a major zzso storage pool, and outside the zzso We identified zzso protein 9 zzso as the first zzso protein shown to interact directly with zzso zzso is a member of a new zzso of the zzso zzso that cycles between the zzso network zzso and zzso through a mechanism dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to characterize the interaction between zzso and zzso Various zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso interacts with an zzso region in the zzso tail of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso with zzso at the surface of the zzso and early zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso in the late zzso compartments and enhanced its zzso zzso This zzso was rescued by the expression of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso indicating that the zzso pool of zzso is involved in zzso zzso sorting to prevent the delivery of zzso to zzso This is the first report showing that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso
