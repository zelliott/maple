The zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso was grown in zzso continuous culture at zzso dissolved oxygen zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of air zzso in both zzso Series 210 zzso and New Brunswick Scientific zzso zzso zzso All culture parameters were monitored and controlled and were zzso identical at steady state in the two zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso was zzso and subjected to zzso zzso using zzso zzso F zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pools released from zzso samples cultured in each zzso at each of the three DO zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection zzso The zzso zzso structures were zzso zzso zzso chains with varying zzso There were also minor amounts of zzso zzso and trace amounts of zzso zzso The level of DO affects the zzso of this zzso A zzso reduction in the level of zzso of zzso chains was observed at lower DO in both zzso as evidenced by prominent increases in the relative amounts of zzso chains and decreases in the relative amounts of zzso zzso the relative amounts of zzso chains being comparatively zzso However, the quantitative results are not precise matches between the two zzso The effect of DO on zzso is less pronounced in the zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso particularly the shift between the relative amounts of zzso and zzso chains in zzso and 50% zzso There are also zzso higher levels of zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso at all three DO zzso The results indicate that the DO effect is not zzso specific and that zzso identical zzso conditions in different zzso zzso may still lead to some incongruities in zzso possibly due to the particular zzso of the zzso and the design of their respective monitoring and control zzso The observed differences in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso grown in the zzso and zzso zzso may be explained by the differences in oxygen supply and control strategies between the two zzso
