zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso B, function as regulators of various cellular zzso Here we focus on zzso an zzso widely expressed zzso zzso protein zzso throughout evolution, which was shown previously to be required for membrane zzso zzso studies show that zzso distributes along zzso during zzso and zzso in various cell zzso Moreover, we report that zzso associates with the zzso zzso indirectly via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso activity behaves as a zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso associates with zzso via a novel zzso mechanism that does not involve classic zzso proteins and motor zzso The association of zzso with zzso requires the zzso of zzso but does not involve zzso zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso association and the role of zzso in membrane traffic are functionally zzso because zzso is required for both zzso zzso zzso is an excellent candidate for a protein that can mediate interactions between the zzso zzso and membrane zzso
