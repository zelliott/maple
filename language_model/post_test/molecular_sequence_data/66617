Based on the published zzso zzso data, three-dimensional structures of the zzso zzso protein zzso loop were obtained by computer modeling in the viral strains zzso and zzso In both cases, the secondary structure elements and zzso of irregular stretches were determined for the zzso representing the principal zzso zzso of the virus, as well as zzso of the cellular zzso and zzso zzso Notwithstanding the high zzso of the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso more than 50% of the zzso loop zzso retained their zzso in the different zzso zzso The combined analysis of the findings and the literature data on the biological activity of the individual zzso of the zzso zzso loop resulted in identification of its structurally conservative zzso zzso which seem to be promising targets for zzso drug design by protein engineering zzso
