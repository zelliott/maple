zzso proteins are employed by many pathogens to achieve successful host zzso zzso pathogens use zzso proteins to invade host cells, survive within and zzso interact with host cells, and finally zzso from host cells to zzso new zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso evolved a number of life cycle stages that enter and replicate in distinct cell types within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite the fact that interaction with zzso zzso is a central theme in the zzso life cycle, little is known about zzso proteins that mediate such zzso We identified a family of five related genes in the zzso of the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins all bearing a single zzso zzso zzso zzso Each protein is highly zzso among zzso zzso Gene expression analysis in zzso zzso and the human malaria zzso zzso zzso indicated that the family is not expressed in the zzso blood zzso However, one of the genes was significantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso the stage transmitted by zzso zzso The protein localized to the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso invasion apparatus intimately involved in zzso zzso zzso proteins may play important roles in zzso interactions with the zzso zzso and transmission to the zzso zzso
