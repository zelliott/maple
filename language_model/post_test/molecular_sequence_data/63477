The characteristics of the zzso and the zzso formed during the operation of a zzso zzso reactor, fed with a moderately zzso synthetic zzso containing zinc and iron, are zzso A diverse population of zzso zzso affiliated to four distinct zzso zzso the zzso The zzso zzso and surface chemistry of the zzso were studied by X-ray zzso zzso scanning electron zzso zzso and energy zzso X-ray zzso The zzso patterns observed are characteristic of zzso solid zzso zzso corresponding to zzso iron zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso results confirm the predominance of zzso zzso appearing as a cloudy zzso zzso zzso of spots on the surface of these zzso zzso reveal the predominance of iron, zinc and zzso indicating the formation of iron and zinc zzso The predominance of these zzso zzso and the formation of very fine zzso during the operation of the zzso column, are in agreement and can be explained by the formation pathways of metal zzso at ambient temperature, alkaline pH and reducing zzso zzso are zzso either as zzso zzso zzso deposited on the bed material, as well as on surface of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso characterized by a rough hazy surface, indicating the zzso of bacterial cells by zzso metal zzso
