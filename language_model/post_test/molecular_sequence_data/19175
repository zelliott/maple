This paper describes the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso zzso from fetal zzso tissue zzso and maternal zzso tissue zzso collected from fallow deer zzso zzso pregnant zzso zzso issued from zzso and zzso were submitted to affinity zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso Finally, they were characterized by zzso and zzso zzso 

Four distinct fallow deer zzso zzso sequences were identified and submitted to zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso sequences identified in other zzso species exhibited 64 to zzso zzso Additionally, zzso was identified in fetal and maternal zzso 

Our results demonstrate the efficacy of zzso and bovine zzso affinity zzso for the isolation of zzso molecules expressed in deer zzso This is the first report giving four specific zzso acid sequences of zzso isolated from zzso junction zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso
