Although we are currently unaware of its biological function, the zzso surface structure is a prominent characteristic of the rough zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso The smooth zzso type of this species as well as the smooth zzso of the zzso type zzso lack these structures on their zzso A zzso serum, as determined by zzso electron zzso was obtained through zzso of a rabbit zzso type serum with excess bacteria of the zzso zzso This serum recognized a zzso zzso which was subjected to zzso zzso Both clones of a zzso expression library that were selected by zzso with the zzso serum contained an open reading frame, designated zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was present at positions 39 to 53 in zzso from this we conclude that the mature zzso protein contains zzso zzso zzso resulting in a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The putative zzso signal sequence of zzso strongly resembles other zzso zzso signal zzso The C zzso of zzso and two open reading frames directly upstream and downstream of zzso exhibited significant sequence zzso to the C zzso of a group of zzso and zzso proteins of other zzso zzso that are all presumably involved in zzso of the protein to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso and zzso protein and as such is part of the zzso zzso
