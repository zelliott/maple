zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso is also important as a zzso agent of human zzso The zzso cross form, which consists of four masses in an zzso is characteristic of the zzso stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which specifically recognizes the zzso cross form of zzso zzso has been described zzso In the present study, we examined the roles of the zzso cross form during the infectious course of zzso zzso in zzso The number of the zzso cross form increased in the peripheral blood of infected mice prior to the peak of zzso With zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso with the ring form, with the zzso undergoing transformation to the zzso cross form and subsequent division, and also with zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso cross zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library by zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso sequence was zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso gene exists as a zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso induced significant protective immunity against zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso cross form plays important roles in both the development of zzso and the protective response against the zzso
