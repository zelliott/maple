zzso zzso important zzso functions of the zzso including zzso cell contraction, zzso zzso zzso and zzso water and sodium zzso In diabetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High affinity zzso receptors are expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, are generally well below the affinity zzso of known zzso zzso Thus, we hypothesized that zzso is produced in the kidney and released locally to act in an zzso zzso Using reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso analysis, we found that fresh human zzso zzso and cultured human zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso zzso and Southern zzso analysis confirmed that zzso zzso products were derived from zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell culture zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso compared to 19 zzso 9 zzso in medium not exposed to zzso P zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells did not transcribe zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Y zzso zzso nor did they zzso measurable zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso cells produce zzso and suggest that zzso zzso may regulate zzso function in an zzso zzso zzso of this zzso may lead to novel methods to alter the course of diabetic zzso and other zzso zzso
