zzso are common zzso that enable proteins to adopt zzso structures, and their formation is often rate limiting for zzso zzso zzso molecules that replace the i + 1 and i + 2 zzso acid zzso of a zzso are envisioned to act as folding zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso thereby lowering the zzso barrier for zzso zzso However, the crucial kinetic experiments to demonstrate that zzso mimics can act as strong zzso in the context of a zzso folding protein have not been zzso We have incorporated 6 zzso mimics simulating varied zzso types in place of 2 zzso in an engineered zzso 1 or zzso turn 1 of the zzso 1 WW domain, a zzso zzso zzso We present 2 lines of kinetic evidence that the inclusion of zzso mimics alters zzso folding rates, enabling us to zzso zzso mimics into 3 zzso those that are weak zzso but permit zzso WW zzso zzso zzso and strong zzso Strong zzso accelerate folding relative to WW zzso incorporating all zzso acid zzso A solution zzso structure reveals that the native zzso WW zzso structure is retained upon incorporating a strong zzso zzso These zzso mimics can now be used to interrogate protein folding transition state structures and the 2 kinetic analyses presented can be used to assess the nucleation capacity of other zzso zzso
