The zzso zzso cell death zzso a novel zzso related zzso is functionally associated with cell zzso exhibits a ubiquitous expression pattern and is zzso in some types of tumor cells undergoing zzso To study the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso we have cloned zzso zzso of its zzso zzso The DNA sequencing analysis revealed a major zzso start site at 72 base pairs in front of the zzso zzso start zzso The upstream of the zzso start site lacks a zzso zzso box and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that this region presents extremely strong promoter zzso The zzso sequences fused to a zzso reporter gene demonstrated that the zzso region from the zzso start site is crucial for zzso regulation, and the zzso reporter zzso expression significantly increased in the early stage of cell zzso induced by zzso These results imply that the zzso gene may be a target gene under the control of some important zzso zzso factors during the cell zzso
