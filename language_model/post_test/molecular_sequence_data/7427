Using a zzso zzso as a probe we isolated and zzso the two corresponding zzso genes zzso and zzso of the bell pepper zzso zzso zzso Both genes have a single zzso and numerous unusual long zzso repeat zzso The zzso share zzso zzso and zzso contains one 450 zzso additional sequence with structural features of a zzso element, which is highly repetitive in the bell pepper zzso Surprisingly, analysis in data banks showed that genes zzso the potato starch zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain a similar element, named zzso in their zzso zzso zzso elements are characterized by a zzso 28 zzso terminal zzso repeat zzso small size, high AT content, potential to form stable DNA secondary structures and they have probably been inserted in zzso target zzso Interestingly, the zzso of the zzso elements shares high zzso with sequences existing in the zzso of zzso linear zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses detected zzso transcripts principally in the red fruit whereas no zzso transcripts were detected in neither of the samples zzso Western zzso analyses detected a zzso zzso zzso protein principally in the ripe red fruit and wounded areas of green zzso zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with protein sequences in data banks revealed a significant zzso with proteins likely involved in the plant's disease resistance zzso zzso at the zzso level showed that zzso is localized in the membrane of zzso
