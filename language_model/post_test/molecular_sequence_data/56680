zzso damage to DNA is zzso and thus may play a role in zzso Because of the large number of different DNA zzso formed by zzso species, no genetic zzso so far identified is exclusively associated with oxygen zzso zzso double zzso zzso are known to occur via zzso damage to DNA and are thought to be a specific indicator of zzso zzso Using a sensitive zzso zzso that can detect both single and double zzso within the same zzso of the zzso zzso alpha zzso we show that treatments that produce zzso oxygen species can also produce tandem double zzso zzso The frequency at which these zzso occur is less than that for single base zzso by a factor of approximately zzso The induction of these zzso is inhibited by treatment that zzso zzso zzso This unique zzso provides a marker of oxygen free zzso zzso in cells that are not exposed to zzso and an indicator for assessing the involvement of zzso damage to DNA in aging and tumor zzso
