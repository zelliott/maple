The zzso era has led to a new frontier of zzso that requires the development of protein zzso which enables us to unravel the biological function of proteins in a zzso parallel zzso Several ways of zzso proteins onto surfaces have been reported, but many of these attachments are zzso resulting in the zzso orientation of the immobilized zzso zzso tag has been used to zzso zzso proteins onto zzso zzso which presumably oriented proteins zzso on the surface of the zzso However, the binding between zzso and His tag proteins is not strong, causing the immobilized proteins to zzso from the slide even under simple wash zzso The authors have developed a novel strategy of using an zzso expression system to generate zzso proteins suitable for zzso onto zzso glass zzso zzso results not only show successful zzso of proteins onto slides by zzso detection method but also full retention of biological activities of the immobilized zzso The strong and specific interaction between zzso and zzso also permits the use of stringent incubation and washing conditions on the protein zzso thus making it a highly robust method for array zzso
