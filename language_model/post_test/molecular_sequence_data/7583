zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso pH by a process which involves zzso of the zzso region of zzso the fusion zzso from its buried location in the native zzso We have examined the zzso acid sequence requirements for a functional fusion zzso by determining the fusion capacities of zzso zzso zzso expressed by using zzso virus zzso and of synthetic zzso zzso of the zzso fusion zzso The results indicate that for efficient fusion, zzso can to some extent substitute for the zzso zzso of the zzso fusion zzso but that zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso containing shorter fusion peptides as a result of single zzso acid deletions are zzso as is a zzso containing an zzso instead of a zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso at zzso zzso 4 with an zzso increases the pH of fusion, and zzso zzso at zzso zzso 11 and 15 are without zzso We confirm previous reports on the need for specific zzso zzso to generate functional zzso and we show that both inappropriately zzso zzso and zzso zzso irrespective of their fusion zzso upon incubation at low pH undergo the structural transition required for zzso
