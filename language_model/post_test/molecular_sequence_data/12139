Small zzso binding proteins of the zzso family are essential regulators of zzso transport in the zzso zzso Members of the zzso family are found on the zzso surface of distinct zzso membrane zzso zzso attachment is facilitated by a zzso zzso zzso In this report we investigated zzso modification and membrane binding of the zzso zzso a member of the zzso family located on the zzso zzso A set of point zzso which simulate the zzso or zzso bound zzso was introduced into the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were expressed in insect cells and the ability of the protein products to undergo zzso modification and membrane association was assessed by zzso zzso partition and cell zzso We report here that the modification of zzso in insect cells depends on protein zzso Only the zzso bound form, but not the zzso bound form is zzso and subsequently membrane zzso
