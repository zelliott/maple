zzso is one of a subset of proteins induced after DNA damage or cell growth zzso To examine the function of zzso we used the zzso zzso system to clone the protein that interacts with zzso zzso We zzso as bait the partial product of zzso zzso including the zzso region and the zzso One zzso clone was almost the same as zzso which encodes an zzso zzso zzso we named it zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was also confirmed in the zzso cells by in zzso zzso zzso For the binding of two zzso the zzso region was important, and the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso was detected in all the mouse zzso zzso Although zzso was significantly elevated with zzso zzso treatment, zzso expression was not zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cells inhibited the cell growth analyzed by zzso zzso
