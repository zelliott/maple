The molecular and zzso zzso of zzso zzso among European zzso of zzso zzso were zzso The zzso sequences of 12 zzso representing all three species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for humans were amplified by zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso is heterogeneous, with an zzso acid sequence identity ranging from 91 to zzso whereas the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains appear to be highly zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso identities ranged from 86 to zzso zzso analysis of zzso reflected the subdivision of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the three species as well as a considerable zzso among zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein of each species of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso coli, zzso and used to generate zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso were zzso six of them recognized zzso zzso of all three species, whereas one was specific for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for use in the zzso of zzso showed strong zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but no or only weak zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from 86 European patients with zzso zzso in different stages and 73 controls were tested in zzso G zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso proteins of the three species, revealing zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso were only rarely detected zzso to zzso With the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sensitivities for the zzso test zzso from stages I to zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, in contrast to zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we recommend that zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso should be used zzso or in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tests for zzso zzso in zzso
