Each zzso variable region gene segment is transcribed from its own unique zzso While all of these promoters share common consensus elements that contribute to the B zzso expression of these zzso the DNA sequence of each promoter is zzso In this study, we have directly compared the zzso efficiencies of two zzso heavy chain zzso promoters in a zzso B cell in zzso zzso zzso We found that the promoters differed in both zzso efficiency and the ability to bind specific protein zzso While some of the zzso differences may be attributed to differences in zzso promoter zzso the spacing between the zzso and the zzso consensus elements was found to be zzso Others have reported a direct correlation between zzso efficiency and the probability that individual variable region gene segments will zzso Our studies may be of direct importance to those interested in identifying B zzso zzso factors and may ultimately help to explain differences in the expression of some zzso gene zzso
