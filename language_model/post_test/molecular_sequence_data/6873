zzso zzso were zzso to zzso and used as affinity labeling zzso to study joint zzso formation by the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is a zzso nitrogen mustard which zzso the zzso position of zzso in the major groove of zzso DNA zzso Incoming zzso at least 30 zzso long zzso to a long zzso duplex DNA in the presence of zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso to the complementary recipient strand of the joint occurred zzso at zzso positioned zzso relative to the appended zzso zzso The pattern of recipient strand zzso was identical to that observed within a zzso duplex and indicated that strand exchange had occurred prior to zzso zzso of the outgoing zzso strand of the joint was less efficient and spanned a zzso zzso long region offset to the 3' side of the zzso zzso zzso of both recipient and outgoing strands in the same joint zzso occurred with low zzso By contrast, no affinity zzso of the displaced strand was observed within a synthetic zzso These reaction patterns suggest that the incoming zzso approaches from the minor groove of the duplex to yield a zzso exchange joint in which the major groove of the newly formed zzso harbors the outgoing strand in an zzso zzso No evidence was obtained for the involvement of a zzso DNA intermediate in zzso
