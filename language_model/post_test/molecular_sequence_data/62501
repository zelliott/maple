The lasting effects of zzso activity on brain development involve zzso gene zzso Using a strategy called zzso zzso we cloned a zzso zzso called zzso (for zzso zzso zzso is a zzso nuclear protein that interacts with zzso zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso protein zzso and is expressed in the developing zzso Mice that have a targeted disruption of the crest gene are viable but display defects in cortical and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from crest zzso mice are compromised in zzso zzso zzso Thus, calcium zzso of zzso zzso helps regulate zzso zzso
