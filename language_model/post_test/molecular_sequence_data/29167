zzso regulate zzso development and zzso but precisely how they control these processes is still poorly zzso By using zzso technology to detect zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso which was increased markedly in cells incubated with zzso and zzso The zzso was most abundant in zzso cells and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence is similar to that of zzso protein zzso a recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso Physical interaction, dependent on the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was demonstrated by zzso of the zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso in addition to its role in cell zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso prime or zzso binding to zzso by zzso in zzso was enhanced by zzso Because the binding protein modified zzso of zzso zzso factor by zzso we designate this zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso
