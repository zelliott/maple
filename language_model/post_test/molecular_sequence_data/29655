zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso agents of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, are obligatory zzso bacteria that cause zzso systemic illness in zzso We identified and characterized clusters of genes for a type IV zzso machinery in these two bacteria, and analyzed their gene expression in cell culture and zzso zzso Eight zzso and zzso genes were found in each bacterial zzso and all of the genes were transcribed in cell zzso Although the gene order and orientation were similar to those found in other bacteria, the eight zzso and zzso genes were clustered at two separate zzso in each zzso Five of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were located downstream from a zzso zzso These five genes in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso transcribed and controlled through at least two tandem promoters located upstream of the zzso gene in human leukemia cell zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso was zzso active in peripheral blood zzso from human zzso patients and zzso infected zzso Three of the remaining genes zzso zzso and zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were arranged downstream from a zzso gene and zzso with the zzso gene through one or more zzso promoters in human zzso This suggests that zzso of the three zzso genes in these two zzso and zzso zzso is regulated by factors that influence the zzso gene zzso This unique regulation of gene expression for the type IV zzso system may be associated with zzso survival and replication of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso or zzso
