The zzso activities of three members of the zzso zzso were discovered using zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso are currently zzso as zzso or zzso zzso These three zzso are zzso identical to one another in zzso acid zzso zzso libraries containing nearly all combinations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to establish the zzso profiles for these zzso It was demonstrated that zzso is restricted to the zzso of zzso derivatives of zzso The best zzso for this zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso The best zzso for zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A fourth zzso zzso from zzso zzso did not have zzso zzso The best zzso for zzso are zzso and zzso The three-dimensional structures of zzso in the presence of the product zzso or a potent mimic of the zzso intermediate were determined by X-ray zzso zzso The side chain of the zzso zzso of the inhibitor is zzso to zzso while the zzso is zzso with zzso and zzso These results have revealed the chemical and structural zzso for zzso specificity in this zzso zzso analyses of an additional approximately 250 sequences identified as members of this group suggest that there are no simple motifs that allow prediction of zzso specificity for most of these zzso highlighting the challenges for zzso zzso of some groups of zzso zzso
