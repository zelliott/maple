A family of restriction zzso and zzso cloning zzso has been developed for producing zzso zzso fusion proteins in zzso zzso These are based on zzso and zzso expression zzso which have been previously used for the successful production of zzso proteins at the zzso zzso The newly designed zzso combines two different promoters zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso two different zzso recognition sites for the zzso removal zzso and tobacco etch zzso different zzso zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso and different zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso A single gene can be cloned and further expressed in the eight zzso zzso by using six zzso zzso avoiding the restriction zzso and zzso zzso A unique zzso site was introduced to facilitate the selection of the zzso zzso As a case study, the new zzso have been used to clone the gene coding for the zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso Interestingly, the obtained results revealed markedly different production levels of the target zzso emphasizing the relevance of the cloning strategy on soluble protein production zzso zzso zzso and tag removal steps showed that the affinity tag and the zzso zzso sites functioned zzso The novel family of zzso zzso designed for parallel cloning is a useful and versatile tool for the production and zzso of a protein of zzso
