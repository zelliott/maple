An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was chemically zzso by zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso 423 zzso acids was cloned into expression zzso zzso and transformed into zzso zzso zzso zzso From about 2000 zzso 400 zzso exhibiting zzso activity were zzso One zzso showing the strongest zzso activity was selected for detailed analyses in 5 L zzso Under control of the zzso alcohol zzso gene zzso promoter, the zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso protein to the culture zzso in about 110 h methanol zzso which comprises of zzso U zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of the zzso zzso was zzso The optimal pH and temperature for this zzso zzso was about zzso and 50 degrees C, zzso zzso zzso and zzso could significantly inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific activity of this zzso zzso was zzso U zzso The zzso and zzso values for sodium zzso were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso expression with the highest expression level and highest zzso activity zzso The novel gene zzso and synthesis method can be applied to other related zzso
