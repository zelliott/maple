Two groups of populations with completely different zzso Pygmy hunter-gatherers and the zzso zzso in Central zzso We investigated the origins of these two groups and the interactions between them, by analyzing zzso variation in zzso individuals from 20 farming populations and 9 Pygmy populations from Central Africa, with the aim of shedding light on one of the most fascinating cultural transitions in human evolution (the transition from hunting and gathering to zzso Our data indicate that this region was zzso zzso with an initial zzso ancestral population ultimately giving rise to zzso farmers, who display various zzso zzso and to zzso in whom zzso is the only surviving zzso zzso zzso analysis of complete zzso sequences for zzso showed this zzso to be zzso to Central Africa, with its most recent branches shared between farmers and zzso zzso analyses revealed that these two groups arose through a complex evolutionary process characterized by zzso initial divergence of the ancestors of contemporary zzso from an ancestral Central African population no more than approximately 70,000 years ago, zzso a period of isolation between the two groups, accounting for their zzso differences, zzso long-standing zzso maternal gene flow from zzso to the ancestors of the farming zzso beginning no more than approximately 40,000 years ago and zzso until a few thousand years ago, and zzso enrichment of the maternal gene pool of the ancestors of the farming populations by the arrival and/or subsequent demographic expansion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
