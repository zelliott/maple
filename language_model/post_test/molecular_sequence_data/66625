Human zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the metabolism of zzso acid and in the pharmacology of many zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of the zzso chains of zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso as a zzso with two putative active zzso However, the zzso structure and the number of species of the zzso in solution have not been zzso zzso has now been characterized using zzso zzso and dynamic light zzso zzso fusion proteins of zzso zzso rat zzso and zzso expressed as a zzso protein were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were conducted over a range of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso strengths zzso M zzso and pH zzso A single species with a molecular mass consistent with a zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso rat zzso zzso also formed very stable zzso The lack of zzso of the zzso the large zzso zzso and the presence of zzso essential zzso in the zzso interface sequences suggest that zzso formation is required for the zzso zzso to fold into an active zzso The conservation of zzso zzso interface sequences in other zzso and plant zzso zzso molecules suggests that they also exist as stable zzso
