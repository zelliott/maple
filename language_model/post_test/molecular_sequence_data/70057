zzso was originally identified as a chicken zzso expressed by the zzso Here, we describe the identification of a mouse zzso of zzso We isolated mouse zzso zzso a zzso with zzso identity in zzso acid sequence to the chicken zzso and defined this zzso as mouse zzso L cells zzso with the mouse zzso zzso acquired a zzso zzso zzso as found for other zzso To examine the binding specificity of mouse zzso L cells expressing this zzso zzso were mixed with L cells expressing chicken zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso While zzso cells randomly zzso with zzso cells, those cells zzso separately from zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso cells gave an intermediate zzso that is, they formed both separate and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso can interact with each other although each has a preference to bind to its own zzso Similar properties were previously found for chicken zzso Thus, the cell binding specificity of zzso is entirely zzso between the two species, suggesting a zzso role for this protein in zzso We also located the mouse zzso gene to zzso zzso
