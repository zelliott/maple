The zzso I zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recently identified as an zzso C to G change zzso zzso downstream of zzso 2, has been associated with increased sensitivity to zzso and its potential relevance in zzso disturbances and in various disorders has been extensively zzso In the present study, we designed a zzso zzso zzso chain reaction for zzso this zzso in peripheral blood DNA zzso When the zzso I zzso was detected with this novel method in a cohort of 247 healthy subjects, the observed zzso distribution matched the zzso equilibrium zzso subjects zzso for the zzso 124 zzso and 23 zzso for the zzso zzso In 50 randomly selected subjects the zzso I zzso was also determined using a traditional restriction zzso length zzso technique and DNA sequencing, and the results showed zzso coincidence with those obtained by our novel zzso The method proved to be more rapid and less zzso compared to currently used techniques, and it avoided the use of extensive zzso We assume that this novel method may have a broad utility in clinical and molecular zzso studies aimed to zzso the impact of the zzso I zzso of the zzso zzso gene either on zzso zzso or various disorders, including cancer treatment and hormone substitution zzso
