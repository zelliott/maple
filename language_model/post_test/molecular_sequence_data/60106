In a previous work, we predicted and demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has in zzso capacities close to those of the zzso zzso of viral fusion zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso can decrease the zzso activity of zzso via a direct zzso zzso we suggested that this zzso is implicated in the zzso of zzso and in the protective effects of zzso E in Alzheimer's zzso Because structurally related zzso do not interact with the zzso zzso domain but inhibit viral fusion, we suggested that interactions existing between zzso peptides and zzso are selective and responsible for the zzso of zzso In this study, we simulated interactions of all zzso zzso of zzso E and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso fragments by molecular zzso We further calculated zzso that do not inhibit fusion in zzso The results suggest that interactions of zzso zzso are the major event to inhibit the zzso capacities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of those interactions is due to the zzso zzso between bulky zzso zzso in the zzso fragments and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
