The microbial community and sulfur zzso zzso of zzso DNA from zzso treating zzso concentrates were studied by zzso zzso library, real-time zzso chain reaction zzso conventional zzso and molecular zzso zzso indicated that major bacterial species were belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso accounting for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the sole zzso species was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso gene copy numbers zzso gram of zzso of bacteria and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains representing zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso To study sulfur zzso in the reactors, pairs of new zzso zzso were designed for the detection of sulfur zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified from zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso gene and is identical to the zzso gene of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed no significant identity to any genes in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, and zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso determination of the gene zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were 1,000 times higher than zzso zzso zzso gene copy numbers, indicating that these genes were mostly impossible from zzso Furthermore, with zzso specific to the zzso zzso zzso this gene was zzso from the newly isolated zzso zzso strain zzso So far as we know, this is the first time to determine zzso activity originating from bacteria and to document zzso gene in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
