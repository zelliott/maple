zzso represent major components of basement zzso and play various roles in embryonic and adult zzso The functional zzso zzso consists of three zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso by separate zzso There are twelve different zzso genes identified in zzso to date that are highly zzso in their sequence but different in their tissue zzso The zzso alpha zzso gene was shown to have the most restricted expression pattern with strong expression in zzso structures, particularly in the developing and mature zzso 

We identified the zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso acid protein zzso that possesses strong identity with the human zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected at all stages of zzso development with the highest levels of expression in the developing zzso zzso nervous and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was inhibited using two zzso zzso zzso that were complementary to sequences surrounding translation zzso zzso zzso exhibited an arrest in lens development and abnormalities in the body axis length and zzso 

These results underline the importance of the zzso alpha 1 for normal zzso development and provide a basis for further analysis of its zzso zzso
