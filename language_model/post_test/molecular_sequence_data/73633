Both insulin and zzso growth factor 1 zzso are known to reduce zzso insulin zzso from the beta cells of pancreatic zzso In this paper we show that the mechanism by which IGF-1 mediates this effect is in large part through zzso of a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso More specifically, in both isolated pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso cells, IGF-1 zzso insulin zzso that has been increased by zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso Moreover, IGF-1 decreases zzso levels in parallel to the reduction of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso that activate protein zzso A and also are zzso for zzso is also inhibited by zzso However, IGF-1 does not inhibit insulin zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In addition, selective zzso of zzso completely block the ability of IGF-1 to inhibit insulin zzso Finally, zzso activity measured in zzso after zzso from cells treated with IGF-1 is higher than the activity from control zzso Taken together with the fact that pancreatic beta cells express little or no insulin zzso but large amounts of IGF-1 zzso these data strongly suggest a new regulatory feedback loop model for the control of insulin zzso In this model, increased insulin zzso in zzso will stimulate IGF-1 synthesis by the liver, and the zzso IGF-1 in turn feedback zzso insulin zzso from the beta cells through an IGF-1 zzso zzso This zzso is likely to be particularly important when levels of both zzso and zzso such as zzso are zzso
