zzso are a unique zzso zzso that attach zzso and firmly to foreign underwater zzso Its biological underwater adhesive is a peculiar zzso zzso zzso Here we characterize one of the two major zzso a 52 zzso protein found in the zzso cement zzso Cloning of the zzso revealed that the protein has no zzso in the zzso zzso The primary structure consists of four long sequence zzso The process of zzso the protein at the adhesive joint of the animal by various treatments was monitored in order to obtain insight into the molecular mechanism involved in curing of the adhesive zzso zzso with protein zzso reducing agents and/or zzso zzso in combination with zzso diagonal PAGE indicated no involvement of the protein in zzso zzso including formation of zzso zzso zzso As zzso of the proteins required high zzso of zzso agents, it appears that both the zzso of the protein as building blocks and zzso molecular interactions between the building blocks, possibly zzso interactions and hydrogen bonds, are crucial for curing of the zzso It was also suggested that the protein contributes to surface zzso by an zzso effect to zzso to zzso zzso of zzso
