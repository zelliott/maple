The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study a zzso sequencing strategy was adopted to zzso 23 out of 47 zzso from an ordered zzso zzso The sum of the lengths of these 23 zzso zzso was approximately zzso zzso which comprised approximately zzso zzso of unique zzso A total of zzso sequencing runs was carried out, with each run generating 559 zzso 268 bases of sequence to give approximately 640 zzso of total zzso After editing, approximately zzso bases per run were estimated to be zzso After the removal of zzso and zzso coli zzso the remaining approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences were zzso generating approximately zzso zzso of unique zzso zzso analysis of these unique sequences suggested that approximately 131 zzso zzso of the unique zzso had matches to either known zzso or database zzso of hypothetical or unknown function zzso A total of 144 strong matches to the database was zzso 101 of these matches represented genes zzso a wide variety of functions, zzso zzso acid zzso photosynthesis, zzso zzso and various regulatory zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and five zzso were also zzso The remaining 160 zzso of DNA sequence which did not yield database matches was then zzso using zzso from the zzso zzso This analysis suggested that 122 zzso zzso of the total unique DNA zzso could zzso putative zzso zzso with the remaining 38 zzso zzso possibly representing zzso zzso zzso From the data so far zzso zzso does not appear to be specialized for zzso any particular zzso function, zzso state or growth zzso These data suggest that zzso contains genes which are functionally as diverse as those found on any other bacterial zzso and also contains sequences zzso which may prove to be unique to this zzso
