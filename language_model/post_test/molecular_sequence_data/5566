The small zzso protein zzso of human respiratory zzso virus zzso is a short zzso surface protein of unknown zzso A full-length zzso of zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was modified such that the entire zzso zzso including the zzso signals and the complete zzso zzso was deleted and replaced by a synthetic zzso zzso This reduced the length of the zzso by 398 zzso and zzso expression of 1 of the 10 zzso zzso zzso virus containing this engineered deletion was recovered, and the absence of the zzso gene was confirmed by reverse zzso in conjunction with zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso and gel zzso of labeled zzso proteins confirmed the lack of expression of the zzso zzso and zzso The absence of the zzso gene did not noticeably affect zzso zzso but two effects on zzso were zzso First, synthesis of the G, zzso and zzso zzso was increased, presumably due to their being one position closer to the promoter in the gene zzso Second, zzso of genes downstream of the engineered site exhibited a steeper zzso of zzso On zzso of zzso cells, the zzso virus produced zzso which were at least equivalent in size to those of the wild type and produced plaques which were zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso virus grew somewhat better (up to zzso than zzso zzso zzso in certain cell zzso While the function of the zzso protein remains to be determined, it seems to be completely zzso for growth in tissue culture and fusion zzso When zzso zzso into mice, the zzso virus resembled the zzso zzso virus in its efficiency of replication in the zzso whereas it zzso zzso less efficiently in the upper respiratory zzso In mice, the zzso and zzso zzso viruses were similarly zzso and effective in inducing resistance to virus zzso
