Signature sequences are zzso patterns of zzso acids zzso zzso long that are associated with a particular structure or function in zzso These may be of three types (by our zzso zzso signatures, remnant zzso and zzso We have performed a systematic search through a database of protein sequences to automatically and zzso find remnant zzso and zzso This was accomplished in three steps: zzso We generated a zzso sequence zzso zzso We used zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate local zzso and zzso sequence alignments for every protein in the database zzso every zzso zzso We selected zzso alignments and grouped them into zzso We find that most of the clusters contain segments from proteins which share a common structure or zzso Many of them zzso to signatures previously noted in the zzso We discuss three previously recognized motifs in detail zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to demonstrate how the alignments generated by our procedure are consistent with previous work and make structural and functional zzso We also discuss two signatures (for zzso and zzso zzso which to our knowledge have not been previously zzso
