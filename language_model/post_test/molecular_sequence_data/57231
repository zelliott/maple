It is unclear whether signaling between zzso cells and muscle cells within zzso zzso known to be important during cardiac development, remains zzso relevant in the adult zzso Also, the mechanisms regulating the synthesis and zzso of locally acting zzso such as zzso zzso known to have potent effects on zzso function and gene expression in cardiac zzso are unknown, as their cells of origin within zzso zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso tissue of adult rats do not express zzso zzso However, the appearance of zzso zzso can be increased in cardiac zzso zzso cells by zzso primary culture with adult rat zzso zzso zzso zzso or at least close zzso appears to be necessary to increase zzso zzso as medium zzso by zzso zzso alone was ineffective when applied to zzso of zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso beta precursor zzso is also markedly increased in zzso zzso cells in zzso and precedes the appearance of zzso precursor zzso In zzso zzso beta acts as an zzso zzso increasing zzso precursor zzso and zzso the rate of zzso zzso cell zzso This regulation of zzso cell zzso in zzso primary cultures suggests that zzso zzso zzso signaling may also be occurring between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
