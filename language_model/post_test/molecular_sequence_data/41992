zzso of zzso oriented consensus zzso with complementary zzso show surprisingly small numbers of zzso within the zzso long zzso stem and loop zzso Even smaller such complementary distances are shown by zzso complementary zzso zzso those with allowed pairing between G and U zzso zzso we suppose that transfer zzso have emerged zzso as complementary strands of primordial double zzso zzso zzso zzso of such molecules with zzso complementary zzso might generate new synonymous zzso for the same pair of zzso zzso zzso the idea of zzso concerted origin dictates very ancient establishment of direct links between zzso and the type of zzso acids with which zzso were to be zzso More specifically, zzso zzso of all, the 2nd zzso could selectively target zzso zzso zzso reaction of zzso itself being performed by another zzso site of zzso or even by another zzso In all, the above findings and speculations are consistent to the zzso concept zzso and Schuster, zzso and throw new light on the genetic code origin and associated zzso Also favoring this idea are data on complementary zzso usage patterns in different zzso
