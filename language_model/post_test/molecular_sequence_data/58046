Two conflicting conclusions regarding the structure of the mouse zzso zzso gene were tested for their zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso state that the zzso gene is composed of six zzso and spans approximately zzso zzso Craig and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) Gene zzso 100, zzso independently reported an additional zzso zzso to the region designated as zzso zzso by zzso and zzso To investigate this zzso we generated zzso zzso to three regions of these reported sequences and used them to zzso to Northern and Southern blots of zzso and DNA from mouse zzso and zzso Two of these regions zzso zzso and zzso represent sequences that are zzso while one of these regions zzso zzso is predicted to be in the zzso of both zzso Our results are consistent only with the zzso gene structure reported by Craig and zzso and show that a significant portion of the zzso 1 reported by zzso et zzso is present in zzso zzso DNA but is not found in zzso zzso Our results also show that zzso zzso molecules from mouse zzso and zzso do not differ significantly in the regions zzso
