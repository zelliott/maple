The zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso linear zzso structurally similar to zzso hormone zzso is of considerable interest because zzso and zzso both recognize and bind to a shared zzso zzso Both hormones are thought to present a zzso zzso to the zzso which is substantially zzso in zzso To better characterize this putative biologically relevant zzso we prepared a series of zzso constrained zzso of zzso with enhanced zzso zzso A combination of structural constraint and zzso stabilization was achieved through side zzso chain zzso ring formation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were prepared and characterized in terms of zzso binding and stimulation (or zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso The binding affinity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was in the low zzso range and similar to that of the parent linear zzso Furthermore, their efficacy was in the zzso range and about zzso higher than that of the corresponding linear parent zzso zzso I and III are the first zzso zzso zzso zzso and amongst the most potent zzso zzso yet zzso The zzso of potency in the zzso zzso series does not correlate with the binding zzso In light of the zzso dependence and the differential effects of zzso bridge formation on the biological activities of zzso vs antagonists, these zzso may provide insight regarding the biologically relevant zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso
