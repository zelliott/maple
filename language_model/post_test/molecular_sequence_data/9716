zzso plays an important role in zzso signaling pathways that influence cell zzso and zzso and stimulate DNA zzso In attempts to determine whether zzso zzso zzso play a fundamental role in zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso characterized a new zzso zzso zzso zzso from bovine zzso This zzso zzso named zzso has a calculated molecular mass of 83 zzso and shares a number of primary structural zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The main differences between the primary structures of zzso and zzso occur in the zzso and zzso zzso Like zzso zzso binds exclusively to activated zzso zzso and does not bind to its closest zzso zzso activated zzso zzso could not be activated by addition of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or by zzso zzso in in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso was activated when zzso with wild type zzso or zzso and zzso associated with zzso in zzso indicating that zzso interacts with active zzso in zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso activity of zzso was zzso both by zzso growth factor and zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in the signaling actions of both zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
