We describe the isolation and characterization of a full-length zzso zzso by a gene that was significantly zzso in the affected skin of patients with psoriasis zzso The zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library and its sequence was found to zzso to a hypothetical locus recorded in zzso with the zzso number zzso The zzso sequence of the full-length zzso was found to have an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids and to span approximately 12 zzso of zzso DNA with 39 zzso on zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains four distinct structural regions, an zzso zzso a zzso repeat zzso region, a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso The gene was consequently designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso The zzso hypothetical protein has a functional domain organization similar to zzso a zzso protein expressed by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso amplified products from zzso prepared from all of the 30 different zzso that we examined including zzso zzso zzso skin, skin zzso skin zzso and fetal zzso During the course of screening the human zzso zzso library, some alternative zzso was also detected in three regions of the zzso zzso In addition, sequence analysis of the zzso genes from eight psoriasis patients and eight healthy controls revealed a number of synonymous and zzso zzso that may be useful markers for future disease association zzso
