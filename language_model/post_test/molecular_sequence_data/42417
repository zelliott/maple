We report the effect of pulmonary passage on random migration and zzso of zzso through zzso pores under the in zzso condition of zzso zzso zzso were isolated either from the left zzso or from the pulmonary artery of patients who underwent coronary zzso due to suspected angina zzso or zzso heart zzso In all 14 cases left zzso zzso showed significantly enhanced zzso migration compared with pulmonary artery zzso Pulmonary passage also influenced the random migration of zzso except for those derived from five patients suffering from pulmonary zzso Our findings might indicate that zzso of zzso in the zzso of the normal lung is zzso by a change in zzso migration behavior during pulmonary passage, thus avoiding increased zzso zzso in pulmonary zzso as observed in adult respiratory distress zzso
