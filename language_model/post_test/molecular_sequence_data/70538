The smooth muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso are produced by mutually exclusive zzso of an upstream zzso zzso and a downstream zzso zzso A rat zzso zzso clone encompassing the mutually exclusive zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso zzso was found to zzso two branch points located 382 and zzso zzso zzso upstream of the 3' zzso site, while the zzso zzso used a single branch point 191 zzso zzso zzso exclusive zzso arises from the proximity of the zzso branch points to the zzso zzso zzso site, and this zzso repression could be relieved in part by the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells and zzso In zzso zzso of zzso transcripts could be activated by zzso zzso of the transcript between the zzso zzso tract and zzso zzso addition of competitor zzso containing the 3' end of the zzso zzso or regulatory sequences from zzso zzso and zzso depletion of the zzso extract by using zzso zzso zzso A number of lines of evidence point to zzso tract binding protein zzso as the zzso factor responsible for zzso zzso was the only nuclear protein observed to zzso to the zzso zzso and the ability of various competitor zzso to activate zzso correlated with their ability to bind zzso Furthermore, repression of zzso zzso in the nuclear extracts depleted of zzso by using zzso zzso could be specifically restored by the addition of zzso zzso Thus, zzso mutually exclusive zzso is enforced by the unusual location of the zzso branch point, while zzso repression of the zzso zzso is zzso by regulatory elements between the branch point and 3' zzso site and by zzso
