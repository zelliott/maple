The zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso is a zzso whose synthesis is zzso with the major zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso by tumor necrosis zzso zzso An zzso B zzso site zzso located in the zzso promoter at zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso reporter zzso expressing the human growth zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso site zzso located at zzso zzso to zzso is not required for zzso zzso and deletion of this zzso zzso results in increased zzso as well as zzso expression of the reporter zzso The zzso is well protected during zzso I zzso zzso and specifically binds proteins in zzso mobility shift zzso A distinct zzso complex is observed when nuclear extracts from zzso zzso are zzso this complex is not seen in extracts from zzso zzso
