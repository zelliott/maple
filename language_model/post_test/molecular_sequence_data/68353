We have zzso a segment of zzso DNA zzso of a zzso the brine shrimp, zzso zzso that includes 3' zzso regions of the genes for zzso 1 of the zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso b zzso zzso From our data we conclude that in this zzso as in the zzso of zzso species, a zzso gene separates the zzso and zzso b zzso This is contrary to an earlier report that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso b genes are immediately adjacent to each zzso
