The zzso genes zzso human and mouse zzso protein zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The human zzso zzso gene zzso shared an identical zzso structure with the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso start zzso zzso was separated from the main reading frame by the first zzso sequence in both zzso An approximately zzso sequence upstream of the zzso start site of both genes displayed remarkable zzso and contained the putative promoters lacking zzso zzso but zzso zzso binding sites and a short stretch of zzso zzso similar to other zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso and zzso found in the promoters of some other zzso genes were also zzso in both zzso These structural features were included in the typical zzso island identified in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso cloned here are authentic and zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso analysis localized the mouse zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to human zzso zzso where human zzso was zzso
