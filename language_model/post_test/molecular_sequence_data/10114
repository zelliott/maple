The zzso of multiple myeloma zzso an incurable zzso causing the zzso proliferation of terminally differentiated B cells, is zzso zzso zzso zzso affecting band zzso and unidentified partner zzso are common in this zzso suggesting that they may cause the zzso of novel zzso By cloning the zzso zzso in an zzso cell line, we show that the zzso zzso represents a zzso and that this aberration is zzso in zzso as it was found in two of zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso juxtaposes the zzso zzso zzso locus to zzso (multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso regulatory factor zzso family known to be active in the control of zzso proliferation and zzso As a result, the zzso gene is zzso event that may contribute to zzso a zzso has zzso activity in zzso These findings identify a novel genetic zzso associated with zzso with implications for the zzso and zzso of this zzso
