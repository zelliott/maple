The zzso synthetic zzso referred to as zzso are thought to be zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These peptides are from the sequence of zzso acids of greatest similarity between zzso and zzso zzso The effect of these peptides was studied on zzso zzso in rat zzso and on acute inflammatory models after local or zzso administration of zzso We found that zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso but had no effect when zzso acid was used as zzso The peptides were able to inhibit acute inflammatory processes induced by zzso or zzso zzso when administered locally or zzso However, zzso had no effect on inflammation induced by zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso may have a direct zzso effect on zzso zzso but not on the zzso or zzso zzso
