Resistance of zzso zzso to drugs such as zzso and zzso is a major problem in malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso particularly in combination with other drugs, are thus increasingly used to treat malaria, reducing the probability that zzso resistant to the components will zzso Although stable resistance to zzso has yet to be reported from laboratory or field studies, its emergence would be disastrous because of the lack of alternative zzso Here, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, genetically stable and zzso ART and zzso zzso malaria zzso Each of two lines of the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso grown in the presence of increasing zzso of ART or zzso showed zzso and zzso increased resistance to ART and zzso zzso Resistance remained stable after zzso zzso after passage in the absence of drug, and transmission through zzso The zzso sequences of the possible genetic zzso of ART resistance zzso zzso zzso and zzso of sensitive and resistant zzso were zzso No zzso in these genes were zzso In addition we investigated whether changes in the copy number of these genes could account for resistance but found that resistant zzso retained the same number of copies as their sensitive zzso We believe that this is the first report of a malaria zzso with genetically stable and zzso resistance to zzso or its zzso
