The preferred binding sites for zzso on three different DNA fragments have been determined by zzso radical zzso zzso which appear as one long protected region using zzso I as a zzso probe are resolved into several discrete binding zzso Each drug zzso protects three bases from radical attack, though adjacent regions show attenuated zzso zzso and the other related compounds induce similar zzso patterns and appear to zzso zzso rich regions with a preference for those containing the zzso step zzso The ability of each such site to bind the drug depends on the sequence environment in which it is zzso The data are consistent with zzso binding to the DNA minor zzso
