Genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the type zzso zzso zzso system from the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso They contain a large number of zzso that are rare in zzso coli and are characterized by equal values of zzso adaptation index zzso and expression level measure zzso zzso zzso are either diffused zzso or located in clusters zzso The expression level of the zzso zzso was increased by a factor of zzso and that of zzso DNA only by a factor of zzso after introduction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes for six rare zzso in zzso zzso It can be assumed that the zzso zzso minor zzso can strongly increase the expression level of only genes with cluster distribution of rare zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso and gel zzso on zzso zzso both zzso were isolated as zzso homogeneous proteins zzso to the results of zzso
