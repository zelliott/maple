Although recent reports have provided strong evidence to suggest that zzso zzso leukemia zzso virus zzso is unlikely to be the zzso agent of prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, this zzso zzso can nonetheless zzso human cells in zzso and induce a chronic infection in zzso In the present study, we determined the accuracy of DNA synthesis of the reverse zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso using a combination of zzso zzso of zzso incorporation and an zzso forward zzso zzso The results obtained were compared with those previously reported for the zzso type 1 zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and 110 times less efficient zzso determined by the zzso rate constant of the zzso incorporation reaction zzso constant zzso than the zzso zzso in incorporating correct zzso zzso and zzso extension kinetic studies demonstrated that zzso zzso was more accurate than the zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed decreased zzso extension zzso and was less faithful when zzso C or A opposite zzso However, the zzso zzso showed stronger selectivity against G in zzso zzso zzso Forward zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso zzso had similar accuracy of zzso DNA zzso but were zzso 13 times more faithful than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were similar in having a relatively higher proportion of zzso and zzso compared with the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso was less prone to introduce large deletions and zzso zzso
