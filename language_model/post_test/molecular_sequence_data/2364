A zzso zzso a novel member of the zzso hormone zzso zzso called zzso zzso has been isolated from a rat zzso cell zzso zzso alpha is an approximately zzso protein most similar in structure to the zzso hormone zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso but it does not bind either zzso hormone or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso alpha is present in many zzso and is particularly abundant in skeletal muscle and brown zzso A zzso DNA zzso containing the entire zzso alpha zzso sequence was isolated and zzso zzso this DNA zzso also contained a portion of the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are alternative zzso products of the zzso alpha gene and are members of the zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso with their coding strands oriented opposite one zzso A zzso segment of the zzso transcribed region is zzso in both the zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso resulting in complementary zzso Thus, through alternative zzso and zzso transcription, a single zzso locus codes for three different members of the zzso hormone zzso zzso Potential implications of this unusual zzso arrangement are zzso
