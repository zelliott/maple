zzso zzso zzso often are flanked by zzso aromatic or charged zzso In this paper, we compare the consequences of single zzso zzso zzso zzso at each interface for the properties of a defined zzso zzso in the absence of charged zzso The choice of molecular framework is critical for these zzso experiments because the presence of zzso zzso aromatic zzso (more than one at either zzso zzso introduces excess dynamic averaging of solid state zzso zzso To this end, we compare the outcomes when changing zzso or zzso or both of them, to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By means of solid-state zzso and zzso zzso experiments, we find that zzso displays similar zzso of zzso zzso tilt as zzso and responds similarly to changes in zzso zzso from zzso to zzso to zzso The presence of zzso changes the zzso rotation angle zzso (about the zzso zzso to a similar extent as zzso but in the opposite zzso When zzso are zzso for both zzso to yield zzso the zzso tilt angle is again of comparable zzso and zzso the preferred zzso rotation angle zzso is relatively unchanged from that of zzso The extent of dynamic averaging increases marginally when zzso replaces zzso Yet, importantly, all members of the zzso family having single zzso or zzso zzso near each interface exhibit only moderate and not highly extensive dynamic zzso The results provide important benchmarks for evaluating zzso and dynamic control of membrane protein zzso
