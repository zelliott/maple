The sequence of the zzso P zzso gene zzso was determined for 60 strains representing all nine species in the family zzso and for the related zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso These sequences were used to zzso evolutionary relationships among the zzso The analysis separated zzso and zzso into two zzso with zzso forming three distinct zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a third cluster zzso the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso line of descent contained two zzso with the zzso zzso strains distinctly separated from strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This analysis indicated that the zzso sequence and structure are distinctive markers for species in the zzso It was also demonstrated that the zzso P zzso derived from zzso zzso is able to cleave a zzso precursor in the absence of zzso These findings are discussed in relation to the structure of zzso zzso P zzso
