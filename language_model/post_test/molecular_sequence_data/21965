At the onset of zzso key zzso regulators called zzso are activated zzso to specify the body axes and tissue zzso In zzso zzso this process is regulated in part by a zzso family of zzso zinc finger proteins that specify the fates of early embryonic zzso The zzso zzso of these and other zzso is regulated in early zzso through zzso physical zzso as well as selective zzso 

We show here that the zzso zinc finger protein zzso serves as a zzso for signals that regulate the transition from zzso to zzso While zzso promotes zzso maturation during zzso destruction of zzso is needed during the first cell division for the initiation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in four zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stabilization of zzso zzso and their zzso are partially suppressed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also depends on zzso B3 and on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, as well as the zzso protein zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso 

Our findings suggest that a zzso zzso activity links zzso zzso to completion of the first cell cycle and support a model in which zzso functions to prevent the premature zzso of zzso zzso until after they are zzso zzso during the first zzso
