zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso begins in the zzso and continues in multiple zzso cells, including the P cell lineages that generate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso precursor cells zzso zzso is regulated by several factors and by zzso and Ras signaling zzso however, no zzso sites zzso zzso regulation have been zzso Here, we describe three elements controlling zzso expression: a zzso upstream zzso that directs embryonic expression in zzso and their descendants in the zzso a zzso zzso region sufficient for zzso zzso and a zzso upstream zzso module that drives expression in the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Three zzso factors regulate expression via the zzso zzso A single binding site for the zzso factor zzso mediates repression in zzso other than zzso however, loss of zzso decreases expression in zzso zzso zzso acts both zzso and positively on zzso in different zzso The zzso domain protein zzso also acts positively on zzso in zzso via this zzso Finally, zzso itself binds to this element, suggesting that zzso zzso its expression in zzso zzso we have begun to unravel the zzso sites regulating zzso zzso gene expression and have shown that zzso is a direct target of the Ras zzso acting via zzso and zzso
