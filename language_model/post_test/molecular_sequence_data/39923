We constructed a zzso zzso zzso that was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater containing zzso as the sole source of carbon and zzso zzso conditions were achieved below the critical dilution rate of zzso d zzso with almost complete zzso zzso The zzso zzso communities in the zzso at dilution rates of zzso zzso and zzso d zzso were analyzed using molecular biological zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso with zzso and bacterial zzso zzso showed that zzso cells predominated throughout the three dilution zzso zzso zzso gene clone library analysis and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction studies showed that zzso zzso zzso genes closely related to zzso was detected at a dilution rate of zzso d zzso , whereas zzso genes closely related to the zzso and zzso zzso were detected at dilution rates of zzso and zzso d zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso , was detected throughout the three dilution zzso zzso gene clone library analysis and zzso zzso gel zzso demonstrated that zzso genes affiliated with the zzso zzso predominated at the low dilution rate, whereas zzso genes affiliated with the zzso zzso predominated at the higher dilution zzso A significant number of zzso genes affiliated with the zzso zzso were detected at dilution rate of zzso d zzso zzso The diversity of genes zzso zzso zzso agreed closely with the results of the zzso gene zzso The dilution rates significantly altered the zzso and bacterial communities in the zzso zzso
