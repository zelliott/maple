Recent studies zzso zzso as the zzso of the late phase of zzso zzso zzso However, it is unknown whether induction of zzso activity is zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso To address this issue, we isolated and zzso a partial zzso zzso expressed in zzso rabbit zzso Using a zzso probe generated from this zzso we measured the steady state levels of the zzso transcript after zzso PC zzso cycles of zzso zzso zzso zzso Three hours after zzso PC, the zzso zzso levels in the zzso region were increased approximately zzso relative to samples from the zzso region and from control zzso This increase in zzso levels was completely abolished by zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of the NO donor zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso levels similar to that induced by zzso zzso We conclude that in the conscious zzso zzso PC zzso an increase in zzso zzso levels, and that this induction is triggered by increased generation of NO during the PC zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso of zzso is a natural response of the heart to a brief zzso stress and that NO itself, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript levels, a finding that may have implications for nitrate zzso This previously zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is likely to play an important role in the development of late PC as well as in many other zzso conditions in which NO is zzso
