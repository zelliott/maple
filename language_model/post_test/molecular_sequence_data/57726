A powerful chemical modification procedure has been developed to define zzso of DNA recognition by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso has identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso that was protected from modification by the presence of an zzso containing the specific recognition site of the zzso To determine the importance of this zzso zzso each of the zzso zzso in zzso was changed to zzso and the DNA binding properties of the zzso proteins zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso bound to its DNA recognition site with a zzso larger zzso constant than the wild type zzso while the other two zzso bound with an intermediate zzso zzso rate constant zzso correlated well with the zzso zzso for the wild type, zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso Competition analyses with zzso zzso of the DNA recognition site and zzso zzso coli DNA revealed that the zzso zzso zzso had an altered DNA binding site specificity and was impaired in its ability to discriminate between specific and zzso zzso Thus the zzso group of zzso is an important zzso of DNA recognition by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
