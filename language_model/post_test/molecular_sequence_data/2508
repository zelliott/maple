zzso of the gene zzso zzso gives rise to different zzso peptides in the zzso and zzso zzso gene expression is regulated by a protein zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso cell lines, whereas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lines is without zzso To zzso the factors important for the control of zzso zzso in the zzso we have studied zzso gene expression and zzso zzso in rat zzso Analysis of zzso zzso clones zzso zzso indicated that pancreatic and zzso zzso zzso transcripts were zzso The regulation of zzso gene expression in rat zzso differed markedly from that previously observed in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso peptides zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso levels in rat zzso zzso zzso also increased the zzso of zzso without affecting zzso zzso levels or zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso toxin increased both zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso gene expression in the zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso differences in both the regulation of zzso gene expression and the zzso processing of zzso contribute to the diversity of zzso gene zzso
