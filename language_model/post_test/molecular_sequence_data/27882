Previous studies indicate that T cells recognize a complex between the major zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two aspects of this complex formation are considered in this zzso zzso what is the nature of the specificity of the interactions that allows a few zzso molecules to serve as restriction elements for a large universe of zzso and zzso what is the relative contribution of zzso selection zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso repertoire in determining the capacity of an individual to respond to an zzso By zzso single zzso acid substitution zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by zzso the structural similarities between unrelated peptides capable of binding to the same zzso zzso we have been able to document the very zzso nature of the zzso zzso Despite this zzso of zzso it is possible to define certain structural features of peptides that are associated with the capacity to bind to a particular zzso zzso With respect to the question of the relative role of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso in determining immune zzso we present data that suggest both mechanisms operate in concert with one zzso Thus only about zzso of a collection of peptides that in sum represent the sequence of a protein zzso were found to bind to zzso Although zzso was restricted to those peptides that were capable of binding to zzso zzso zzso selection was zzso we found that about zzso of zzso peptides were not zzso zzso there were also zzso in the zzso zzso
