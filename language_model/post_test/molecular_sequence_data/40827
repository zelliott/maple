It has been widely recognized that the zzso at specific directions are caused by the functional constraints in protein family and the directional zzso at certain positions control the evolutionary direction of the protein zzso The zzso at different positions, even zzso zzso are mutually coupled and form an evolutionary zzso Finding the controlling zzso positions and the zzso network among zzso are zzso important for protein rational design and zzso zzso 

A zzso approach, namely zzso acid position zzso correlation analysis zzso is developed to predict mutually zzso positions and find the evolutionary network in protein zzso The zzso acid position zzso function, which is the foundational equation of zzso measuring the zzso of a zzso at a position, is derived from the zzso (multiple structure zzso database of protein evolutionary zzso Then the position conservation correlation zzso and position zzso correlation zzso is constructed from the zzso acid position zzso zzso Unlike traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso approach, which is based on the statistical analysis of position zzso the zzso focuses on the correlation analysis of position zzso 

As an example the zzso approach is used to study the zzso domain of protein family, and the results well illustrate the zzso zzso mechanism in zzso protein family, and find the functional zzso network among zzso We expect that the zzso approach may find applications in protein engineering study, and suggest new strategy to improve zzso and zzso properties of zzso
