zzso the membrane zzso of the zzso pumps has been approached largely by analysis of zzso zzso which are confusing in the zzso third of the zzso Each pair of predicted zzso segments with the zzso loop contains at least one zzso allowing fluorescent labeling of these regions of the zzso by zzso zzso once the zzso domain has been zzso The membrane segment arrangement of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso zzso This was followed by zzso or zzso zzso labeling of the zzso zzso residual membrane fragments, zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso The presence of four zzso pairs was demonstrated for the alpha zzso of the zzso with no membrane retention of zzso and zzso although zzso has four zzso based on zzso zzso A similar observation was made for the zzso zzso except that zzso zzso was detected in the membrane with a molecular weight of 4 zzso showing that zzso had occurred at zzso predicted to be zzso in a 10 membrane segment zzso It seems likely that for both these zzso the membrane domain contains only 8 alpha zzso spanning zzso zzso at zzso in the beta zzso was found only in zzso not in zzso zzso arguing for a single membrane segment in this zzso In the zzso additional evidence for the presence and arrangement of the first, third, and fourth pair of segments was obtained by labeling the intact zzso with zzso zzso zzso The K competitive zzso an zzso zzso labeled the first pair of membrane zzso The zzso zzso zzso class, the zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso region as well as zzso zzso in the zzso loop between zzso and zzso No labeling of the beta zzso was found, indicating the presence of three zzso bonds in the zzso domain of this zzso Both sets of zzso zzso are predicted to bind close to the fatty zzso head group zzso zzso by these zzso shows that zzso changes are transmitted between zzso and zzso zzso
