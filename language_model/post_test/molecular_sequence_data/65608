zzso are composed of a family of zzso proteins localized in zzso and zzso Four types of zzso zzso have been reported, and at least two types of zzso zzso and zzso have been verified to be present in zzso zzso A new member of the zzso gene family, which was designated as rat zzso was obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein contains a zzso domain as well as a zzso signature sequence that is a prominent feature of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso and that its expression was zzso during zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is present in zzso zzso but not in heads and that it is completely released from rat zzso by 6 M zzso treatment, but not extracted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso M zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso revealed that zzso was located in the middle piece of zzso in rat zzso with no zzso in the heads and the principal zzso zzso electron zzso adopting zzso method discovered that zzso is predominantly associated with the inner side of the zzso zzso zzso might work as a middle piece component requisite for zzso stability and zzso zzso
