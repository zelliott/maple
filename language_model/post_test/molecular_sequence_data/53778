A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso produced in zzso coli, and compared to the zzso from zzso coli zzso The secondary structure profile of zzso obtained by zzso zzso shows that it has four zzso and three zzso arranged in zzso similar to that of zzso However, zzso supports the growth of zzso zzso in zzso coli and is zzso reduced by the zzso zzso from zzso coli, indicating that zzso is functionally closer to a zzso than a zzso zzso has higher specific insulin zzso activity than zzso and retained its full activity over 4 days at 95 degrees C, whereas zzso lost its activity in 150 zzso The standard state zzso potential of zzso is about zzso zzso which is the lowest value thus far known among zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This indicates that the lower zzso potential is necessary in keeping zzso zzso bonds reduced in the zzso and in coping with zzso stress in an zzso zzso
