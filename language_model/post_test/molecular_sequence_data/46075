zzso zzso is a plasma membrane zzso that has been signaled as a primary cause of zzso resistance zzso in zzso We performed a zzso zzso screen using the zzso domain of zzso and identified 2 small zzso involved in zzso trafficking, zzso and zzso which complex with zzso The zzso of zzso either zzso or zzso but not of zzso in zzso cells decreased the presence of zzso in the cell zzso As a result, expression of this zzso reduced the zzso zzso of zzso cells, by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This effect was zzso by the zzso active zzso zzso but not by the dominant negative zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso trafficking to the plasma membrane from zzso zzso and this zzso required the interaction of both proteins and the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited a significant reduction of zzso levels, but not of other zzso zzso as compared with the sensitive parental cell line, suggesting that the development of the zzso zzso in these cells involves zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso of proteins that regulate its surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels in zzso by zzso interference enhanced the expression of zzso in the cell surface, and reduced the zzso of zzso zzso these findings substantiate the notion that zzso of the zzso and spatial distribution of zzso in cancer cells may be a valid therapeutic strategy to alleviate the zzso zzso and signal to zzso as a potential zzso
