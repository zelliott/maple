The zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses two zzso genes with linear zzso zzso The cloning and sequencing of the regions zzso zzso zzso revealed two large zzso repeats zzso than zzso zzso separated by a single copy region of zzso zzso Both repeats contain identical copies of the zzso zzso The single copy region contains two disrupted genes with zzso origin zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso to a small gene described in two zzso linear zzso The zzso analyses argue in favor of a same zzso origin for both genes but, surprisingly, these genes were separated by a zzso zzso Both strands of the complete region containing the two zzso zzso copies and the zzso appear to be transcribed on large zzso zzso A model zzso the events that would have occurred is zzso zzso capture of the zzso by the zzso before its integration in the zzso or acquisition of the zzso gene by zzso after the zzso integration, zzso integration of the zzso in the zzso accompanied by a large zzso containing the zzso gene and zzso erosion of the zzso sequences by large deletions and zzso
