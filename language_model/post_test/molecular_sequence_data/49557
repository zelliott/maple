An zzso zzso gene zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso The gene consists of two zzso and encodes a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso Although zzso shared zzso and zzso global zzso acid sequence similarity with sea zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, the zzso of zzso was highly zzso zzso acid sequence identity as high as 85 to zzso was identified between the zzso zzso and its zzso from various zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso located at position 44 of the zzso of all known zzso zzso was also zzso zzso of a zzso analysis based on the 60 zzso acid sequence of the zzso indicated that zzso was closely related to sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression pattern analyzed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso showed that zzso zzso was mainly expressed in the early zzso stage zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed a ubiquitous zzso expression pattern in zzso as well as in zzso cells near the vegetal region of early and zzso stage zzso This spatial expression pattern is very different from those of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and in various zzso organisms with zzso restricted zzso expression patterns in zzso zzso
