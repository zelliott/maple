Recently various methods for the zzso zzso of peptides have been developed for the mass zzso analyses of zzso samples to facilitate de zzso sequencing of the peptides zzso This paper describes the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso this procedure allows both de zzso zzso sequencing and quantitative zzso to be studied zzso As zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The experimental and reference zzso zzso were zzso independently using zzso and zzso and then combined to generate an zzso labeled zzso mixture in which each zzso pair differs in mass by 6 zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso mass zzso experiments on the resulting zzso zzso revealed several immediate advantages of zzso in addition to the de zzso sequencing capability of zzso zzso zzso differentiation between zzso zzso peptides and unmodified peptides in mass zzso differentiation between zzso and zzso fragments in tandem mass zzso of multiply zzso peptides by comparing zzso of the zzso pairs, and relative zzso zzso between zzso zzso We demonstrate that the combination of zzso zzso and isotope coding in the mass zzso analysis of zzso samples is a viable method that overcomes many problems associated with current zzso zzso zzso
