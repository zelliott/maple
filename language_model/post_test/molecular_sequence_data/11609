zzso interactions between the genes that regulate development and those which regulate the cell cycle would provide a mechanism by which numerous biological events could be better zzso We have identified a direct role for zzso in the control of zzso zzso In primary human diffuse zzso zzso expression zzso correlated with zzso zzso The human zzso gene zzso a zzso binding site within its untranslated first zzso that is zzso throughout zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso are capable of zzso both the zzso promoter and zzso of a zzso reporter in cell zzso zzso of the identified binding site eliminates zzso protein binding in zzso and renders the promoter inactive in zzso These data suggest that zzso proteins might regulate zzso expression during development and propose a novel alternative mechanism for zzso initiation or zzso by which loss of zzso function occurs at the zzso zzso
