zzso zzso zzso zzso poses a potential risk of zzso infection in zzso zzso transplantation trials using zzso primates zzso as recipients of zzso zzso present the opportunity to assess the zzso risk in zzso However, zzso poorly zzso zzso cells for unclear reasons and therefore zzso may represent a zzso animal model to assess the risk of zzso zzso We investigated the mechanism responsible for the low efficiency of zzso infection in zzso zzso 

Two steps, cell entry and exit, were inefficient for the replication of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A restriction factor, zzso is likely to be responsible for the block to matured zzso release, supported by the correlation between the levels of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso macaque, zzso zzso and zzso the main zzso for zzso entry, zzso zzso 1 zzso was found to be genetically zzso zzso genes in these species zzso zzso at zzso acid 109 in place of the zzso in human zzso This genetic zzso inevitably impacts in zzso sensitivity to zzso infection of these zzso In contrast, African green monkey zzso zzso is functional, but zzso infection is still zzso Although the mechanism is zzso zzso treatment, which removes zzso sugar zzso increases zzso infection, suggesting a possible role for the zzso of the zzso 

Since zzso zzso and zzso species often used in zzso zzso experiments, have a defective zzso they hardly represent an ideal animal model to assess the risk of zzso transmission in zzso zzso zzso species, like zzso whose both zzso are functional may represent a better model than zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
