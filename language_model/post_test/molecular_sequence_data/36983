zzso 18 zzso in length having sequences complementary to regions spanning the initiation zzso regions of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were tested for their ability to inhibit translation of these zzso In zzso zzso a strong and dose dependent reduction of zzso zzso synthesis in response to zzso from zzso zzso cells was brought about by zzso which is complementary to the sequence from zzso to zzso of the zzso sequence but there was no zzso by zzso zzso the latter zzso which is complementary to the sequence from zzso to zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was a strong inhibitor of the synthesis of this zzso in response to rat prostate zzso and the zzso sequence from zzso zzso had no zzso The translation of zzso zzso zzso in a wheat germ system was inhibited by the zzso zzso at much lower concentration than those needed in the zzso zzso suggesting that degradation of the hybrid by zzso H may be an important factor in this zzso These results indicate that such zzso may be useful to regulate cellular zzso levels and as zzso to study control of zzso zzso
