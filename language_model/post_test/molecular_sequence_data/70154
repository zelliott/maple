The present study determined the effect of genetic obesity and zzso zzso treatment on the expression and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels as determined by Western zzso and associated zzso activity zzso zzso at the 2 alpha zzso were significantly lower in zzso zzso zzso rats compared with that observed in zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso to the zzso zzso 16 zzso or specific zzso probe zzso and slot zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The depressed zzso zzso protein levels in zzso rats may be attributed to their low plasma testosterone and growth hormone zzso however, lack of differences in zzso zzso zzso suggest zzso regulatory zzso Treatment with zzso further suppressed zzso zzso protein levels and activities in both zzso and zzso zzso rats in comparison with that seen in zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher after treatment with zzso in zzso zzso rats, while no change was observed in zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso treatment fails to increase zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso rat is zzso however, it may share a common molecular basis with the zzso in nuclear zzso rate previously observed with zzso
