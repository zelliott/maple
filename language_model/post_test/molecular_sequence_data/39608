zzso zzso are a family of zzso proteins found in most zzso zzso Three zzso closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso b) were expressed in a zzso zzso zzso which lacks almost all of its plasma membrane zzso activity, to study their ability to reduce zzso iron zzso The expression of each of these zzso zzso was able to rescue the growth zzso of the zzso zzso cells in zzso conditions, suggesting their involvement in iron zzso Plasma membrane zzso activities were measured using intact zzso zzso Each zzso zzso showed significant zzso and zzso zzso activities that were dependent on the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso b was conducted to identify zzso acids that are indispensable for its zzso Among more than 20 zzso or partially zzso zzso acids that were investigated, zzso of four His zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso one zzso zzso and one zzso zzso completely zzso the zzso zzso activity, whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso affected the zzso activity to some zzso These zzso may affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso roles of these zzso in zzso zzso b are zzso This study demonstrates the zzso zzso zzso activities of members of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso
