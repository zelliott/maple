Based on primary structure comparison between four highly zzso zzso proteins zzso displaying differential zzso we have employed in zzso zzso zzso to decipher their zzso mechanism at the molecular zzso The contribution of the 11 zzso acids that differ between the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso was evaluated by replacing these zzso acids in zzso with their zzso zzso Among 11 zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are highly zzso in the zzso zzso have been found to be responsible for the zzso of zzso These zzso acids in combination zzso reduce the zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso at the level of its zzso zzso zzso By replacing these zzso acids in zzso with their zzso counterparts, the zzso zzso was generated with zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso the same strategy, we generated several zzso in the extremely zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso and obtained data consistent with the previous zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso converted the extremely zzso protein zzso to zzso The various forms of zzso proteins were zzso in zzso coli, highly zzso and the zzso of the zzso confirmed by circular zzso zzso The results presented here were zzso on the basis of the X-ray structure of zzso and zzso zzso unpublished zzso and their mechanism was proposed at the molecular zzso The results clearly show that three individual local interactions located at the zzso part of the protein are responsible for the stability of zzso proteins by acting zzso in a common mechanism for zzso
