Plasma zzso zzso transfer protein zzso mediates the transfer of neutral lipids and zzso between the plasma zzso The deduced zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso is zzso but in sodium zzso zzso zzso gels plasma zzso appears as a broad band containing two different molecular forms of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to see if variable zzso zzso could explain the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from stable expression of the zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, appeared as a protein zzso comparable to plasma zzso zzso of plasma or zzso with zzso F zzso zzso to remove zzso zzso resulted in the formation of a lower zzso zzso in which the bottom band zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso labeling of the zzso with zzso and zzso followed by zzso with zzso zzso suggested that the top band of the zzso contained residual zzso carbohydrates resistant to zzso F zzso To explore this hypothesis further, each of the four potential zzso zzso sites of zzso (at zzso acid positions 88, zzso zzso and zzso was eliminated by zzso of zzso to zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso Each zzso zzso showed a lower zzso than zzso indicating that all four sites were occupied by zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
