Two zzso clones for protein zzso zzso were isolated from a rat brain zzso library in zzso zzso 11 with synthetic zzso as zzso The two clones differ in size, but the zzso sequence including the whole coding region of the shorter zzso is completely identical with the corresponding sequence of the longer zzso The open reading frame encodes a zzso of 227 zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso This molecular weight is comparable to those reported for other protein zzso zzso from several animals, which were determined by gel zzso zzso or sodium zzso zzso gel zzso
