zzso zzso and zzso resistance have a significant influence on disease severity and treatment options during bacterial zzso zzso the underlying genetic zzso are zzso on mobile genetic elements zzso In the leading human pathogen zzso zzso zzso that contain zzso resistance genes commonly do not contain genes for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso toxins with a crucial role in immune zzso While all known zzso are core zzso we here describe a previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly expressed in many strains and showed the zzso zzso and zzso characteristics typical of zzso zzso in an zzso zzso strain with low production of core zzso zzso expression of zzso had a significant impact on immune evasion and zzso In addition to providing high-level resistance to zzso acquisition of zzso elements zzso zzso by horizontal gene transfer may therefore contribute to zzso zzso by substituting for the lack of expression of core zzso zzso Thus, our study reveals a previously unknown role of zzso resistance clusters in zzso zzso and shows that important zzso and zzso resistance zzso may be combined in zzso zzso
