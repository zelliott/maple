Using the zzso library constructed at the downstream of the zzso promoter, which zzso the zzso of an inserted DNA fragment, we have attempted to screen the genes affecting growth or development by zzso The zzso strain was transformed using the zzso library and cultured on zzso M zzso media, in which asexual zzso is zzso but sexual development is zzso Over 100,000 strains transformed to zzso were analyzed with regard to any changes in zzso zzso seven strains were isolated for further zzso These strains were designated NOT zzso zzso zzso zzso Four of the strains were of the zzso type, and the remaining strains were of the zzso suppression zzso Two of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes which had been inserted in reverse direction, suggesting that the zzso zzso had been derived from an excess amount of zzso zzso zzso analyses of the deduced zzso from the DNA fragments rescued from the zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zinc zzso zzso
