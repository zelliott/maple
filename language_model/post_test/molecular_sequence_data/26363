In the case of the malaria zzso protein we have shown that there is at least one T cell zzso which is able to bind to and be recognized by most human zzso class II zzso while for the zzso zzso derived from a zzso region of the zzso zzso surface zzso we have identified several zzso recognized by T cell clones in association with different zzso II zzso and zzso In addition, binding analysis of these zzso indicated that most of the peptides are able to bind to multiple zzso forms of class II zzso Although there are important obstacles to malaria vaccine development we believe that, in the light of these results, zzso in humans, caused by zzso zzso might not be a major constraint in development of a zzso zzso
