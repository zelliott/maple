In searching the zzso of zzso zzso to study whether the possession of zzso is ancestral to all zzso the gene for zzso was identified in zzso zzso This flagellate is a member of the zzso one of the earliest lineages of recognized zzso to have zzso This sequence was used to isolate a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso by inverse zzso chain zzso This zzso was also completely zzso and shown to contain the 3' end of the zzso zzso gene and the 3' end of a gene zzso a protein with high similarity to zzso zzso zzso a family which has previously only been identified in animals, plants, and zzso zzso analysis of 50 members of the zzso family zzso at least nine separate zzso one of which includes the zzso zzso zzso and an zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso
