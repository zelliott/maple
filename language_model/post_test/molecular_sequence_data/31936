T box zzso are zzso zzso elements that bind to zzso and sense its zzso state to influence gene zzso Here, we present the zzso resolution X-ray crystal structures of the T box Stem zzso complex and zzso in zzso T box Stem I forms an arched zzso with extensive zzso contacts to two key points of zzso the zzso and zzso Free and zzso zzso exist in significantly different zzso with the contacts stabilizing flexible zzso and a zzso of the zzso Using a designed T box zzso system, we demonstrate that the T box zzso monitors the length and orientation of two essential zzso zzso or orientation zzso engineered into the T box zzso and zzso disrupt the complex, whereas simultaneous zzso of full zzso turns zzso the zzso and restores interaction between artificially zzso T box zzso and zzso zzso
