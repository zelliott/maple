zzso are zzso zzso binding zzso found in many complexes that regulate gene zzso In budding zzso the zzso complex zzso zzso predominantly zzso zzso of zzso genes and requires the zzso of the zzso zzso for full zzso of a number of these zzso This zzso has previously been shown to promote retention of the complex to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso complex mediates zzso zzso zzso we sought to determine to what extent the zzso zzso directly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso reveals that this zzso 1) is required for the cooperative zzso of zzso 2) enhances zzso of an zzso zzso tail when the other zzso tail within a zzso is already zzso and 3) zzso the zzso turnover of zzso previously zzso at zzso 16 of the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso promotes the establishment of zzso zzso through multiple mechanisms and more generally show how zzso recognition zzso can zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso
