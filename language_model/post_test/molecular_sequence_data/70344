A zzso region encompassing the human zzso III zzso gene on zzso zzso was characterized from directly amplified zzso DNA and from six zzso clones in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The gene was mapped with restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were developed for nine zzso sites throughout the zzso The transcribed region spans 58 zzso and contains 12 zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso and 13 zzso ranging from 53 to 374 zzso Northern blots showed a single zzso species of approximately zzso zzso in all zzso zzso Three zzso zzso were zzso a tandem repeat of the sequence zzso with at least six zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction, and a zzso zzso zzso
