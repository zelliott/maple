The high resolution solution structure of a protein containing the three zzso zinc fingers of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso bound to its zzso DNA duplex was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The zzso which is designated zzso binds with all three fingers in the DNA major groove, with a number of zzso acids making zzso zzso The DNA structure is close to zzso Although the mode of interaction of zzso with DNA is similar to that of zzso and other structurally characterized zinc finger complexes, the zzso complex exhibits several novel zzso Each zinc finger contacts four to five zzso and the repertoire of known base contact zzso is extended to include a zzso at position zzso of the zzso zzso 1) and zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso base contacts are made over virtually the entire length of the finger 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in base recognition are zzso zzso in the solution zzso in the case of zzso in particular, this could significantly decrease the zzso cost of DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso which are highly flexible in the zzso zzso adopt ordered zzso on DNA zzso The zzso appear to play an active structural role in stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contact surfaces are formed between adjacent zzso As a consequence of these zzso zzso the orientation of finger 1 in the major groove differs from that of the other zzso Contributions to high affinity binding by zzso come from both direct zzso contacts and from indirect zzso interactions associated with structural organization of the zzso and formation of zzso zzso between adjacent zinc fingers in the DNA zzso The structures provide a molecular level explanation for the large body of zzso and zzso data available for the zzso zzso
