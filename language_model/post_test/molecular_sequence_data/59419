We reported earlier that the levels of zzso zzso are increased in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso relative to control zzso Here we show that these zzso are forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and are expressed in the human zzso zzso zzso to zzso labeled zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso as determined with zzso zzso zzso and the presence of this zzso is confirmed with reverse zzso zzso The cellular distribution of zzso is altered in zzso because zzso of the total 100 zzso zzso activity is found in the soluble fraction of control zzso whereas only 51% is zzso in the same fraction from zzso zzso The accumulated 100 zzso zzso from zzso brain is zzso and can be converted to an active form with zzso zzso zzso also is detected in close proximity to zzso zzso zzso Because a major constituent of plaques is the 4 zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso was incubated with activated zzso The zzso zzso the zzso at several sites, predominantly at zzso within the zzso zzso These results establish that zzso have the capacity to zzso zzso which, on zzso may degrade zzso zzso such as zzso Because the zzso form of zzso accumulates in zzso brain, it is hypothesized that the lack of zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso peptides in zzso
