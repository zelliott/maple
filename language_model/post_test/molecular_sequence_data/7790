Three zzso forms, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are produced from a single gene by alternative usage of the triple zzso 4 (4 zzso 4 zzso and 4 zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso The expression plasmids for the respective zzso were zzso into zzso coli cells, and the zzso alpha and beta were zzso to zzso by a simple zzso though zzso gamma was only partially zzso These zzso are active towards two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a preference for zzso over zzso but they have different zzso values towards these two zzso zzso alpha shows the highest value for zzso These zzso show similarity in optimal zzso zzso stability, and zzso values for both zzso and zzso They are composed of four identical zzso of 40 zzso forming a zzso with a molecular weight of approximately 160 zzso The three zzso are different in primary structure only at the zzso region zzso by the respective zzso zzso zzso this region should be primarily responsible for the distinct characteristics of these zzso
