The zzso zzso and zzso carrier proteins found in the inner zzso of zzso and the zzso protein from zzso in zzso brown zzso zzso belong to the same protein zzso zzso members of this zzso have zzso chains approximately 300 zzso acids long that consist of three tandem related sequences of about 100 zzso zzso The tandem repeats from the different proteins are zzso and probably have similar secondary zzso The common features of this zzso are also present in nine proteins of unknown functions characterized by DNA sequencing in various species, most notably in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The high level expression in zzso coli of the bovine zzso carrier, and the zzso of active carrier from the expressed zzso offers encouragement that the identity of zzso members of known sequence but unknown function may be uncovered by a similar zzso
