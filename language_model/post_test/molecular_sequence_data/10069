A unique zzso zzso highly specific for terminal zzso groups, was isolated from bulbs of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso failed to bind to a zzso affinity column and was zzso by simple gel zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained in zzso form, had a molecular mass of 44 zzso on gel zzso and showed a single zzso band with a molecular mass of 11 zzso on zzso gel zzso indicating it to be a zzso protein composed of four identical zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso zzso showed essentially no zzso with that of other zzso bulb zzso The zzso zzso selectively zzso with the wild type zzso zzso and other zzso carrying terminal zzso but not with those lacking this zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies, zzso zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso Of various zzso those having the zzso sequence showed the highest zzso zzso confirming the strict requirement of zzso for terminal zzso zzso zzso An affinity column of immobilized zzso enabled the complete resolution of zzso zzso and zzso The immobilized zzso may provide a useful tool for zzso and analysis of biologically important zzso and zzso
