zzso is a member of the zzso gene zzso zzso with two zzso zzso expressed primarily on B zzso and zzso Here we describe the cloning of the mouse zzso of human zzso Mouse zzso zzso clones were isolated from a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of mouse zzso was shown to include an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso zzso acid protein composed of a 21 zzso acid leader zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso region, and an 87 zzso acid zzso zzso Mouse zzso shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity zzso considering conservative zzso acid zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso studies mapped the mouse zzso gene to zzso zzso 1 adjacent to the gene for zzso placing it close to the region where other members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the expression of mouse zzso was predominantly restricted to zzso zzso Two species of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The finding that the pattern of expression was restricted to the zzso system and the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso zzso suggests that the function of the zzso zzso may be similar in humans and zzso
