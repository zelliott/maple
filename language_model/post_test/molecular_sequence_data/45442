zzso is a putative zzso zzso zzso complex that is localized to the plasma zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso to the plasma zzso We have identified zzso zzso which did not affect formation or zzso of the zzso complex, but caused a synthetic growth zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso a structurally and functionally redundant zzso of zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso exhibited nearly normal levels of zzso zzso zzso across the plasma zzso suggesting that zzso may have other functions in addition to regulation of the putative zzso activity of zzso at the plasma zzso Similarly, deletion of the zzso zzso region of zzso affected neither the zzso nor the zzso activity of zzso at the plasma zzso but caused a growth zzso in the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso complex may play a role distinct from its plasma membrane zzso activity when it zzso for the zzso complex, its redundant partner in the zzso network zzso
