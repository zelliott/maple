zzso is a new zzso drug belonging to the zzso class which very efficiently zzso the zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso one of the most important pathogens in the zzso In order to map the zzso acid zzso involved in the binding of the drug, we have selected in zzso zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis and diverse zzso zzso Six distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Met, have been identified in the zzso c forming a C ring in the zzso zzso They were studied by evaluating the levels of resistance that they zzso in the selected clones and by using an zzso zzso system in zzso zzso The rates of increase of zzso zzso values zzso to zzso were interpreted by constructing by zzso modeling a structure of the zzso C ring which was used for zzso simulations with zzso Our results suggest that the zzso found to be zzso in the resistant zzso together with a zzso specifically zzso at position 64 in zzso define a zzso located between two adjacent c zzso in the C zzso This zzso which encompasses the zzso site zzso is well fitted to bind zzso at the level of the zzso zzso with the drug being anchored by several zzso hydrogen, and zzso bonds with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data shed light on the molecular interactions allowing zzso to bind specifically and efficiently at the level of the zzso site of the zzso C zzso
