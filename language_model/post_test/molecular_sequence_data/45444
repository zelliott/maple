The zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso for malaria, which is one of the most serious human zzso diseases in the world, causing up to zzso million deaths zzso To contribute to our understanding of zzso zzso and to the transmission of malaria, we have now cloned four zzso related G zzso receptors zzso from this zzso and expressed them in Chinese zzso zzso zzso After screening of a library of zzso insect or other zzso zzso and eight zzso zzso we could identify zzso three of these zzso zzso an zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The fourth zzso remained an zzso although its close evolutionary relationship to the zzso zzso and other insect zzso receptors suggested that it is a zzso for an zzso zzso This is the first published report on zzso related zzso zzso and zzso receptors in zzso
