zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been zzso and genetically validated in zzso zzso as a primary target responsible for the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso D, zzso M, et zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso as novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Liberator zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and molecular characterization of zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso Donald zzso zzso J, Singh zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting of an essential zzso protein zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso B, zzso J, Liberator zzso Donald zzso zzso of a zzso zzso protein zzso inhibitor in treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso Agents zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso the growth of several related zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Native zzso activity has been partially zzso by zzso and zzso zzso exchange zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enriched for a zzso protein detected using zzso zzso contain zzso protein zzso activity that is sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso To enable a more thorough characterization of zzso we expressed a synthetic zzso incorporating zzso zzso zzso preference zzso in zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso with significant zzso as demonstrated by a Hill zzso of zzso Both zzso preference and zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso 1 are similar to that seen with native zzso as well as zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso has zzso and pharmacological properties that are similar to previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 is active against blood cell stages of zzso zzso cultured in zzso In a zzso zzso mouse model of infection, zzso 1 delays the onset of zzso but does not cure the zzso zzso
