A physical map of the zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been constructed, encompassing about 90 rare restriction zzso The 14 zzso zzso together with about 40 genes have been assigned positions on the zzso zzso analysis and gene transfer have been developed in this zzso to enable in zzso analysis of the roles of cloned genes using marker replacement zzso zzso using the available genetic tools have shown that zzso plays a zzso role in controlling several aspects of the transition from exponential growth to stationary phase in zzso zzso These include initiation of zzso zzso of the storage zzso zzso and production of zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes concerned with zzso zzso whose expression is modulated at the onset of zzso contain sequence motifs resembling zzso boxes in their zzso regulatory zzso This invites the speculation that they are under the direct control of zzso and additional data are now required to test this zzso
