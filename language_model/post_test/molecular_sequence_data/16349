In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a full-length zzso clone for the zzso regulatory zzso zzso beta (formerly called zzso of type II zzso protein zzso from a human zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso demonstrated zzso expression of zzso beta zzso in human zzso with the highest zzso levels in zzso and zzso The isolated human zzso clone was zzso zzso zzso in length and contained 166 base pairs zzso of zzso zzso zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso region containing zzso zzso followed by an 89 zzso long zzso The predicted protein contains zzso zzso acids including the start zzso and the estimated zzso zzso of human zzso beta is zzso The zzso sequence within the open reading frame and the predicted zzso acid sequence of human zzso beta are highly zzso compared with partial rat zzso beta zzso displaying zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso preference analysis of the cloned zzso sequence indicated that the two zzso zzso and the hinge region are highly zzso through evolution, whereas the zzso domain displayed a zzso preference pattern indicative of appearance at a later stage of zzso The isolated human zzso detected an zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in rat zzso cells, thus confirming that the cloned zzso represents the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso protein zzso This is the first report documenting the isolation of a full-length zzso clone for the zzso beta of zzso protein zzso
