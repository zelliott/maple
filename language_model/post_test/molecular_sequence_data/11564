zzso of the zzso genes of viral zzso zzso virus zzso and infectious zzso necrosis virus zzso were cloned into a bacterial zzso expression zzso under the control of the zzso zzso Western zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso specific to the zzso demonstrated the zzso expression of the fusion proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso in zzso zzso It was confirmed that an zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso which contains a deletion in the structural gene for the zzso surface protein zzso will provide protective immunity against zzso when used as a live attenuated zzso The zzso viral zzso were then mobilized into zzso for use as a shuttle system for the expression of fragments of the zzso genes of zzso and zzso zzso of rainbow trout with zzso containing the viral zzso resulted in the development of protective immunity against both zzso and zzso This indicates that the use of cloned fragments of the zzso and the use of zzso zzso as a shuttle system constitute a feasible approach to fish vaccine zzso
