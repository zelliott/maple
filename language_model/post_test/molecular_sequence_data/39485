The evolutionary origin of the zzso and the zzso body axes of zzso is a long-standing zzso It is unclear how the main body axis of zzso the sister group to the zzso is related to the two body axes of zzso The zzso antagonism between two zzso factors, zzso zzso in zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is a crucial component in the establishment of the zzso body axis of zzso and could therefore provide important insight into the evolutionary origin of zzso zzso Here, we cloned and characterized two zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as two zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso show that the zzso activity of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso proteins can function as zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis during embryonic and zzso development of zzso reveals zzso expression of all four genes along both the zzso body axis and along an axis perpendicular to this one, the directive zzso zzso zzso and zzso show complex and overlapping expression on the same side of the zzso whereas zzso and zzso are both expressed on the opposite zzso Yet, the two pairs of zzso and zzso only partially zzso suggesting complex zzso of zzso activity along the directive axis but also along the zzso zzso We conclude that a molecular interaction between zzso molecules and their zzso zzso was already employed in the common zzso of zzso and zzso to create zzso zzso but that there is no simple relationship between the zzso body axis of zzso and one particular body axis of zzso
