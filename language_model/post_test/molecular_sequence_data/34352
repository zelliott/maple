Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene expression and induction by zzso were compared for three different zzso populations bearing different resistance zzso ranging from susceptible zzso through intermediate zzso the field parental zzso to highly resistant zzso the zzso generation of zzso selected offspring of zzso A strong correlation was found for zzso gene expression with the levels of resistance and following zzso selection at the zzso stage of zzso with the highest expression levels identified in zzso suggesting the importance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso resistance of zzso zzso Only zzso showed a significant zzso in zzso adult zzso Other zzso genes had similar expression levels among the zzso populations tested, suggesting different zzso genes may be involved in the response to zzso pressure in different zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was further induced by zzso in resistant zzso Taken together, these results indicate that multiple zzso genes are zzso in zzso resistant mosquitoes through both zzso zzso and induction mechanisms, thus increasing the overall expression levels of zzso zzso
