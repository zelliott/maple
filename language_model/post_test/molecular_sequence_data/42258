Of the ten class I zzso zzso those for zzso and zzso are among the most closely zzso In recent work we showed that the zzso zzso acid zzso coli zzso zzso zzso has one zinc bound per zzso zzso may be replaced by zzso zzso zzso with retention of full zzso Bound zinc has been localized to a zzso cluster within an zzso into the zzso binding fold that characterizes all class I zzso zzso which interfere with metal zzso to these zzso yield proteins that are defective in zzso Additional data presented here show that change of the zzso zzso state and coordination geometry of the zzso zzso results in a complete loss in activity, and that zzso which replace any one of the zzso zzso zzso have a small but measurable effect on protein zzso These results further support the importance of the metal for the active zzso We also show that, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso the closely related but larger zzso zzso acid zzso coli zzso zzso zzso contains zzso to 2 molecules of zinc bound per zzso The zzso zzso is active and shows the expected spectrum for zzso coordination to sulfur zzso Although the zzso for metal coordination in zzso zzso zzso has not been rigorously established, one likely sequence element is in a region of the primary structure different from the known metal binding site in zzso zzso zzso Thus, these two closely related proteins have incorporated metal binding sites into distinct parts of their related zzso
