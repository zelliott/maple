The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that encodes resistance to zzso zzso zzso is hypothesized to occur via a circular intermediate and is zzso by zzso zzso resistance elements and low levels of zzso In this work, the ends of the zzso were identified and found to consist of zzso imperfect zzso repeats, with an extra base at one zzso In the circular form, the ends were separated by a zzso zzso zzso which was associated with either the left or the right zzso zzso when the zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso does not duplicate its target site upon zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we showed that the zzso sequence originated from 6 bases of zzso DNA zzso either side of the zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso locus containing a zzso direct zzso zzso occurred before or after the repeated zzso with one integration site between the two zzso These observations are consistent with a zzso model based on zzso zzso In the zzso zzso model for zzso zzso the zzso zzso with the zzso coli zzso via a zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso sequence of zzso is analogous in function to the crossover region of zzso but that unlike the situation in zzso zzso occurs between regions of zzso zzso This ability to recombine into divergent target sites is also a feature of the zzso bacterial zzso zzso
