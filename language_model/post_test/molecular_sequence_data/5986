The zzso zzso switch from zzso to zzso is accompanied by a DNA zzso that joins S zzso the highly repetitive zzso region upstream of the C zzso zzso to the S zzso region upstream of C zzso thereby creating a composite S zzso zzso zzso In human B cells cultured in zzso with zzso to promote the switch to zzso we previously described evidence for S zzso zzso zzso structures, suggesting that some B cells can switch zzso from zzso to gamma and then to zzso similar sequential switching to zzso occurs routinely in the zzso To identify which of the four human gamma genes might be involved in this zzso switching pathway, we cloned and analyzed nine S zzso zzso zzso composite switch regions and studied S zzso gamma junctions from zzso deletion zzso Since only the S gamma 4 sequence had previously been zzso our investigation required determination of the zzso S gamma 1, S gamma 2, and S gamma 3 zzso This analysis showed that S gamma 1 is the longest and most highly repetitive switch region, including nearly identical zzso repeats partially zzso to the zzso repeat of zzso S gamma zzso Of nine cloned zzso S zzso zzso zzso zzso seven were derived from S gamma 1, and one each from S gamma 3 and S gamma 4 (both of which were in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso S zzso gamma junctions demonstrated contributions of S gamma 1, S gamma 2, and S gamma zzso Thus, all four of the human gamma zzso can participate in sequential switching to zzso arguing against a model of directed switching from a specific zzso such as was proposed in the zzso zzso
