There are a number of zzso virus pathogens that represent a serious threat to the health of managed honey bees zzso zzso That some of these viruses are also found in the broader zzso community suggests the wider environmental spread of these zzso with the potential for a broader impact on zzso Studies on the ecology and evolution of these viruses in the zzso community as a whole may therefore provide important insights into these potential zzso We examined managed zzso zzso zzso nearby zzso zzso zzso and other associated zzso for the presence of five commonly occurring zzso zzso viruses of honey bees - black queen cell virus, zzso wing virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus and zzso zzso zzso we observed their presence in several zzso zzso Additionally, detection of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso for zzso wing virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus suggests active replication of zzso wing virus in at least six zzso species and active replication of Israeli acute paralysis virus in one zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso wing virus also revealed that this virus is freely zzso across the species sampled in this zzso In sum, our study indicates that these viruses are not specific to the zzso community and that other zzso species have the potential to be involved in disease transmission in zzso zzso
