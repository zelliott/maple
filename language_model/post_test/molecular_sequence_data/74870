Among the dramatic changes occurring during grape berry zzso zzso development, those affecting the zzso zzso have provoked a number of investigations in the last 10 zzso In addition to producing several compounds involved in the protection of the berry and the dissemination of the seeds, final products of this zzso also play a critical role in berry and wine zzso In this article, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of zzso a zzso isolated from a grape berry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein belonging to the zzso family of zzso factors and displays significant similarity with zzso another zzso factor recently shown to regulate zzso synthesis in zzso The ability of zzso and zzso to activate the zzso promoters of several structural genes of the zzso zzso was confirmed by transient expression of the corresponding zzso in grape zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco zzso zzso leads to an zzso of genes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and results in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso to regulate particularly the zzso and the zzso pathways is discussed in relation to other recently characterized zzso zzso factors in zzso Taken together, data presented in this article give insight into the zzso mechanisms associated with the regulation of the zzso zzso throughout grape berry zzso
