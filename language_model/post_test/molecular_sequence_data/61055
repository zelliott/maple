zzso zzso zzso the metabolism of zzso derived and dietary zzso zzso is a member of a small group of zzso termed zzso zzso which are found either in the zzso or as zzso complexes associated with the zzso zzso channel of the zzso outer zzso In Homo zzso the zzso gene family consists of an zzso locus and several zzso and zzso zzso zzso which, apparently, comprise both functional genes and processed zzso To study the role of the zzso genes in zzso zzso we have isolated two zzso zzso zzso determined their structures and zzso locations, and examined their zzso These sequences are zzso zzso which appear to be zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and are expressed only in the zzso Though both zzso events appear to have occurred prior to the zzso divergence of some zzso million years ago, only one of the zzso zzso gene zzso based upon its zzso location, is zzso with modern zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso genes zzso functional zzso activity, transient zzso of the gene sequences into zzso cells was carried zzso While in zzso translation confirmed that the transcripts could direct the synthesis of proteins of the appropriate size, no zzso activity was zzso Such data suggest that the zzso zzso genes have evolved novel, zzso zzso A comparison of the human and mouse zzso gene sequences demonstrates the evolutionary relationships between each zzso zzso and its corresponding zzso ancestral zzso
