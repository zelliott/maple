The cellular complement of zzso was identified in zzso zzso by zzso association with zzso zzso zzso with molecular mass of zzso zzso and 44 zzso along with minor zzso of 96, 120 and 230 zzso were zzso The zzso zzso were unrelated to zzso zzso based upon zzso zzso and an inability to associate in a zzso way with zzso zzso comprised of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis demonstrated that 44 zzso zzso zzso contained an zzso zzso zzso Five zzso fragments exhibited a total of zzso similarity with zzso a 23 zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso The zzso zzso appeared to comprise a family of zzso based on sequence similarities and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso No evidence was found for zzso in the related species zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso against zzso were localized by zzso along the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso preparations demonstrated that zzso and the zzso zzso cluster were present in this zzso We conclude that zzso family members are not among the zzso zzso proteins that associate with zzso in a zzso zzso Instead, the major zzso zzso comprise a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso
