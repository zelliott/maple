We developed a method for introducing an zzso cassette into proteins at random sites by constructing zzso and expressing it in zzso zzso The protocol zzso four steps: zzso generation of zzso that contain single, zzso blunt end zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the blunt end cuts in zzso formats; zzso selection of the zzso clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into an expression zzso for zzso and expression in zzso zzso This method was evaluated using zzso zzso growth factor zzso as a model zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso each containing an zzso sequence at a random site, were zzso When these clones were expressed in zzso cells, some of the zzso zzso were found to be zzso The method described here should also be zzso for random introduction of functional zzso zzso into virtually any protein of zzso
