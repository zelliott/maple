The currently discussed model of zzso in birds proposes that the direction of the magnetic field is perceived by zzso processes in specialized zzso with zzso suggested as potential candidate molecules zzso magnetic compass zzso zzso studies have shown that magnetic compass orientation takes place in the eye and requires light from the zzso part of the zzso zzso are known to absorb in the same spectral zzso Because of this we searched for zzso zzso in the zzso of European zzso zzso zzso zzso birds that migrate at zzso Here, we report three individually expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso While zzso and zzso are similar to the zzso found in the zzso of the domestic chicken, zzso has a unique zzso zzso In light of the zzso model, our findings support a potential role of zzso as zzso for the perception of magnetic compass information in zzso
