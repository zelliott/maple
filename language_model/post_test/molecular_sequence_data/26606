Most organisms exhibit some kind of zzso in their zzso and/or physiology as an adaptation to the cyclical movements of the zzso In addition to zzso zzso many organisms have an annual zzso in certain activities, such as zzso migration or induction of zzso Current knowledge of the molecular basis controlling seasonal zzso especially in insects, is zzso One element that seems to play an essential role in the maintenance of both zzso and seasonal rhythms in zzso is the hormone zzso In zzso the limiting zzso in its synthesis is the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also present in insects but the precise zzso zzso and the zzso involved in its synthesis are zzso zzso possess zzso distant zzso zzso but their involvement in zzso synthesis still needs to be fully zzso zzso have a seasonally rhythmical life cycle, zzso zzso by zzso in zzso seasons but, in zzso seasons, they produce a single generation of sexual zzso The length of the zzso is the main environmental factor that controls the mode of reproduction in zzso Taking advantage of the availability of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we searched for genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that could be candidates for participation in seasonal zzso We identified four zzso zzso of which at least two zzso and zzso showed highly significant variation in zzso levels depending on the zzso zzso These results are discussed in the context of how zzso can be controlled in zzso
