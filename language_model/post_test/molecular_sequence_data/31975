zzso is a major feature of tumor growth and zzso As such, targeting the tumor zzso is an attractive strategy for effective cancer zzso zzso zzso have strong therapeutic potential as zzso agents in suppressing tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso is a potent zzso zzso Our laboratory previously reported a strategy for expression and zzso of human zzso zzso in a zzso fusion form using zzso coli expression zzso However, the yield of zzso zzso per liter of culture was relatively low and the protein activity was also zzso In this study, the biologically active and soluble zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The yield of the active zzso was about 20 zzso of the zzso zzso culture zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso and confirmed to be biologically zzso The zzso zzso could efficiently inhibit zzso and zzso cell proliferation in zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso showed relatively higher protein activity than zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it can inhibit in zzso zzso tumor growth and prolong the tumor doubling time significantly by zzso zzso Taken together, this is the first report on the zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a highly efficient and cost-effective expression system for large amount production of biologically active zzso zzso for potential therapeutic zzso
