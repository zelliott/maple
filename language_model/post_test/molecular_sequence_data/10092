The regulation of conventional protein zzso zzso by zzso was examined by determining how this zzso affects the zzso 1) membrane binding and zzso function and 2) zzso In the first part, we show that significantly lower zzso of zzso are required to effect zzso membrane binding than to zzso activate the zzso The disparity between binding and zzso zzso is most striking for protein zzso C zzso where the concentration of zzso promoting zzso membrane binding is approximately zzso higher than the apparent zzso for zzso for zzso In addition, the zzso requirement for zzso of protein zzso C zzso is an order of magnitude greater than that for the alternatively spliced protein zzso C zzso these zzso differ only in 50 zzso acids at the zzso zzso revealing that zzso in the zzso zzso influence the zzso zzso zzso In the second part, we use zzso as zzso zzso to show that zzso membrane binding and zzso zzso involve two distinct sets of structural changes in protein zzso C zzso Three separate zzso spanning the entire protein participate in these zzso changes, suggesting significant zzso zzso A highly localized hinge motion between the regulatory and zzso halves of the protein accompanies membrane zzso release of the zzso zzso accompanies the low affinity membrane binding zzso by zzso of zzso too low to promote zzso and exposure of the zzso zzso and masking of the zzso zzso accompany zzso In zzso these data reveal that structural zzso unique to each zzso of protein zzso C dictate the zzso zzso affinity for zzso zzso and show that, surprisingly, some of these zzso are in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso site in the zzso regulatory zzso
