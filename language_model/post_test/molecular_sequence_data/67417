The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins play important roles in plant development and stress zzso In this research, a full-length zzso named zzso zzso zzso protein induced by zzso stress 1) was isolated from zzso zzso possess one zzso domain in the zzso Comparative zzso expression analysis indicated that zzso zzso similar with zzso was induced very quickly by various zzso stresses including salt, drought, cold, and zzso zzso zzso However, the induction of zzso by zzso stress was transient and lasted up to 3 zzso whereas that of zzso maintained zzso The promoter sequence of zzso harbors several zzso including zzso response zzso but the well-known zzso responsive zzso element is zzso The zzso zzso fluorescent zzso fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of rice zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso revealed that zzso was a zzso zzso and bound to zzso recognition sequence zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso zzso with a number of stress-related zzso Taken together, zzso may be an early zzso zzso of stress responses and function in the regulation of zzso gene expression under zzso zzso
