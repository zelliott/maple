A total of zzso domestic pigeons were zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Crude DNA was isolated from blood samples and zzso Two zzso sites were identified in zzso zzso one near the zzso donor site zzso is called site H and the other near the zzso zzso site is called site zzso Interestingly, the zzso changes of both these sites associate perfectly with the A and B zzso of zzso zzso the A zzso with zzso A of site H and zzso T of site zzso while the B zzso with zzso G of site H and zzso G of site zzso In this study, we have identified the molecular difference between zzso A and B of the pigeon zzso zzso The difference at site H in zzso 6 explains the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso groups differ significantly zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was more frequent in the groups of pigeons with elevated zzso performance zzso zzso zzso The functional difference may be due to the change at site B, the potential zzso branch zzso Since zzso activity is associated with the zzso ability, it is possible that during the process of selection for the zzso ability, the zzso zzso has been selected, and is more prevalent in the zzso zzso
