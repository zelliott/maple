To zzso the progression of gastric marginal zone zzso zzso of zzso zzso tissue zzso type, we analyzed a case presenting simultaneously with zzso zzso of the stomach and zzso and a gastric high-grade diffuse large zzso The rearranged zzso heavy chain zzso variable regions were analyzed using a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso relationship was shown between the gastric high-grade and the pulmonary zzso zzso The gastric zzso zzso was not related to the other zzso zzso zzso was not detected in the gastric high-grade zzso zzso zzso at various locations and with different zzso may derive from a common precursor zzso zzso at identical sites may have different stem zzso
