zzso have been described in several animals species frequently associated with zzso especially in young zzso In dogs, zzso particles have been observed sporadically and very little is known about their epidemiology and zzso In this paper, we describe the detection of zzso particles in symptomatic zzso Furthermore, for the first time in this species, the zzso identification made by electron zzso was confirmed by genetic analysis of the viral zzso conducted directly on the clinical zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and partial sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the viral zzso identified the viruses as member of the family zzso The zzso analysis clearly clustered canine zzso in the zzso zzso Relative closest similarities were revealed with a cluster zzso human, zzso and zzso zzso based on the zzso sequences zzso Based on the species definition for zzso and on the data obtained in this study, we suggest a new species of zzso - canine zzso zzso - to be included in the zzso zzso
