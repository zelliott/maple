The zzso region, the zzso of zzso (the breast cancer zzso gene 1 zzso is ubiquitous in several proteins that participate in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA zzso We have previously shown that the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso II binding protein 1) and zzso bound DNA zzso A zzso region, zzso in the zzso zzso gene product zzso also could bind DNA fragments, independently of DNA zzso Five zzso regions were found in the zzso zzso All zzso of zzso bound DNA zzso zzso zzso and treatment with an zzso showed that zzso bound zzso DNA zzso Since some zzso are exceptional common relating elements in tumor suppression, our findings reveal novel aspects of the tumor suppression zzso
