Current methods used to zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and DNA zzso techniques and major outer membrane protein zzso gene analysis, can be imprecise or difficult to zzso To facilitate zzso zzso partial zzso DNA zzso segments from a zzso zzso strain and a zzso zzso strain were amplified by zzso and zzso zzso a zzso region in this segment, including both the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso and domain I zzso zzso 2 zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso from 41 additional strains and from the zzso organisms zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso When both zzso and distance analyses were performed, these sequences were found to have variable regions that grouped the zzso into two lineages zzso zzso and zzso zzso and nine distinct zzso zzso The zzso zzso lineage included human, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso lineage included zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, and zzso zzso abortion, zzso zzso and guinea pig zzso These nine groups were essentially zzso from the genetic root and were zzso with groups identified previously by using zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso analysis, host zzso tissue zzso and/or disease zzso zzso trees based on the zzso zzso or on domain I were zzso with trees previously derived from zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of either the zzso zzso or domain I provides a rapid and zzso method for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
