A new approach is described for analyzing zzso linkage patterns in peptides containing tightly clustered zzso Such peptides are very difficult to analyze with traditional strategies, which require that the zzso chain be split between close or adjacent zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso at pH 3, and partially reduced peptides were zzso by high performance liquid zzso with minimal zzso zzso zzso of free zzso followed by zzso analysis, provided explicit assignment of zzso that had been zzso zzso exchange occurred during zzso of some zzso but correct zzso were still zzso zzso zzso best with exchange when zzso solution was added with rapid mixing to zzso M zzso zzso were developed in which up to three zzso agents were used to label different pairs of zzso allowing a full assignment in one zzso zzso Model peptides used included insulin (three bridges, zzso and zzso zzso zzso pair), zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pair), zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pair), and bacterial zzso (three bridges within 13 zzso two zzso zzso With insulin, all zzso in the reduction zzso were zzso with zzso zzso analysis was carried out successfully for all three zzso zzso In addition to these known structures, the method has been applied successfully to the analysis of several previously zzso structures of similar zzso Rates of reduction of zzso bonds varied widely, but most peptides did not show a strongly preferred route for zzso
