The functional expression of cloned zzso zzso and house fly zzso zzso zzso sodium channels in zzso zzso is zzso and the zzso zzso of the expressed channels are accelerated, by zzso with the zzso zzso a putative sodium channel auxiliary zzso zzso by the zzso gene of zzso zzso These results predict the existence of a zzso zzso in the house zzso Using a zzso zzso probing approach, we isolated zzso clones zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from adult house fly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequence contained a zzso zzso zzso frame zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso The predicted zzso beta protein exhibited zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the entire zzso zzso zzso protein sequence and zzso identity within the two zzso segments identified as probable zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta with the house fly sodium channel alpha zzso zzso in zzso enhanced the level of sodium current expression zzso and accelerated the rate of sodium current zzso zzso Both of these effects were significantly larger in magnitude than the corresponding effects of the zzso zzso zzso protein on the expression and zzso of zzso sodium zzso These results identify a second example of a putative sodium channel auxiliary zzso from an insect having functional but not structural zzso to zzso sodium channel beta zzso
