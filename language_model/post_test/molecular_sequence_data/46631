Some previously unidentified short zzso repetitive elements zzso and long zzso repetitive element zzso were isolated from various higher zzso zzso skates, and zzso and zzso These zzso members of the zzso zzso family, were zzso and were widespread in higher zzso The zzso region of this zzso family was strongly zzso among zzso The zzso members of the zzso LINE family, zzso an zzso acid sequence similar to that zzso by the chicken zzso LINE family, and they contained a strongly zzso zzso region in the 3' untranslated zzso This tail region of the zzso LINE family was almost identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso family and the zzso LINE family provide a clear example of a pair of zzso and zzso that share the same tail zzso Conservation of the secondary structures of the tail regions, as well as of the zzso zzso between the zzso zzso family and zzso LINE family during evolution suggests that zzso zzso the zzso machinery for zzso of zzso through the recognition of zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso A discussion is presented of the zzso of zzso on zzso during the evolution of these zzso
