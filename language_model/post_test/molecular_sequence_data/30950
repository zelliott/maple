Small deletions of 7 to 48 zzso acids have been generated in the zzso zzso domain of the avian zzso protein and the zzso zzso proteins expressed using an avian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso primary chick zzso zzso and leads to abnormal regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the most zzso zzso of the zzso motif zzso a partial zzso affecting some but not all parameters of zzso Complete loss of transforming activity results from deletion of further zzso zzso including one which is not part of the zzso zzso In zzso transformed cells zzso zzso zzso is expressed at a low level and is zzso zzso to induction by serum zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso protein which lacks the zzso does not affect normal zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain of avian zzso is required for both transformation and zzso and suggests that essential zzso zzso within the motif may be spaced differently from those in the zzso of zzso and zzso
