The activity of the zzso zzso of zzso factors is tightly linked to control of the cell zzso zzso and zzso two closely related members of the zzso zzso of negative cell cycle regulators, zzso the activity of the zzso proteins by direct interaction with these zzso To understand the role of zzso and zzso in progression through or exit from the cell cycle, we have characterized the zzso zzso state, zzso and zzso activity of zzso and zzso during terminal differentiation of rat zzso cells into immature skeletal muscle zzso In zzso growing zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a cell zzso manner, and zzso binding complexes containing zzso is zzso in a cell zzso manner, and zzso binding complexes containing zzso can be observed throughout the cell zzso During differentiation of zzso cells, zzso levels are reduced, while zzso protein levels are increased zzso Despite both zzso and zzso becoming zzso during zzso the zzso zzso complexes containing zzso observed in zzso growing zzso are zzso replaced in zzso with complexes containing only zzso In zzso zzso is not associated with zzso proteins that are capable of binding zzso The failure to observe zzso complexes in zzso appears to be due to the zzso induction of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is found in complexes with zzso D3 in zzso and the addition of zzso zzso D3 or zzso to zzso from zzso zzso cells was able to disrupt zzso zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso also forms complexes with zzso D3 as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso We are able to zzso zzso D3 with zzso E from zzso indicating the presence of a zzso complex containing both zzso E and zzso D3 simultaneously bound to zzso Thus, in zzso zzso is normally involved in regulation of zzso proteins during cell cycle zzso while zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso zzso Our results also provide evidence that the apparent positive regulator of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso has a function in terminally differentiated muscle zzso
