zzso synthesis of human zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso has been performed, following by cloning into expression zzso zzso (New England zzso The resulting zzso fusion protein expressed in zzso coli consisted of the zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso at the zzso In this zzso zzso zzso zzso played a role of zzso active zzso capable under certain conditions of zzso zzso resulting in separation of the target zzso As the hybrid protein had several zzso in its zzso in zzso domain, one in zzso and six in zzso it was necessary to work out optimal scheme for zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso As a result of this work, two schemes of the zzso zzso zzso have been developed: according to the first zzso the zzso protein with reduced zzso is bound to the zzso column, the zzso is zzso off and zzso and then zzso to form appropriate zzso zzso In the second zzso the entire hybrid protein is first zzso to form zzso bonds and then loaded to affinity zzso the zzso zzso is zzso off and zzso in its native zzso In spite of the fact that the first scheme is more common and suitable for a variety of zzso zzso in case of zzso zzso the second scheme proved to be more productive and zzso
