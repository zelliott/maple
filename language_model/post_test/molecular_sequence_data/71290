Exchange of zzso zzso with zzso zzso through the zzso carrier is a zzso feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess another type of zzso zzso which exchanges bacterial or zzso zzso for zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The bacterial and zzso zzso are similar but do not share significant sequence similarities with the zzso zzso Recent molecular and zzso studies are providing deeper insight into the functional and evolutionary relationships between the bacterial and the plant transport zzso
