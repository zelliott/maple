zzso protein zzso plays an important role in the acute phase zzso zzso zzso two new zzso molecules zzso and zzso from European common carp have been characterized which has enabled seven zzso genes to be identified in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identity to zzso from zzso common carp occurs and fish zzso genes form a distinct zzso zzso gene organization comprises four zzso and three zzso in contrast to the two zzso zzso organization of zzso zzso zzso Gene expression zzso showed both zzso molecules are zzso expressed in liver, skin, zzso gut, muscle, zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso in serum and zzso were significantly different from other zzso zzso and levels were greatest in the zzso It is proposed that the two carp zzso genes defined differ in their expression profiles which may suggest differences in their biological zzso
