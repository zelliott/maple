zzso zzso of high zzso zzso clay content, prepared from zzso suspensions, suffer from reduced strength and zzso at high relative zzso We address this problem by chemical modification of zzso in zzso zzso zzso by subjecting the zzso to zzso zzso zzso of side chains to enable it to form zzso zzso to zzso groups in neighboring zzso chains or to the zzso zzso The resulting materials are analyzed by zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso analysis, zzso X-ray zzso scanning electron zzso zzso tests, and oxygen barrier zzso We compare the resulting mechanical properties at low and high relative zzso The zzso zzso leads to a strong increase in zzso and strength of the zzso A zzso of 30 zzso for zzso composite at 50% relative humidity compared with zzso zzso for neat zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso of the zzso side chains leads to zzso improved stress transfer at the zzso zzso possibly through zzso bond zzso This enhanced zzso zzso and internal zzso of the zzso zzso preserves the mechanical properties at high humidity condition and leads to a Young's zzso of 21 zzso at zzso
