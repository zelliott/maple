Interest in triple and quadruple DNA zzso built from zzso and zzso strands has recently intensified principally because such structures may occur in zzso but also because of the potential use of zzso both in forming highly zzso complexes for use in zzso mapping and in zzso zzso From zzso zzso data, models for triplex structures with zzso and zzso have been proposed, in which the zzso and one zzso strand are zzso paired in an zzso zzso and the other zzso strand is zzso zzso parallel to the zzso strand along the major zzso A similar zzso scheme involving G and C would require zzso of C for zzso zzso formation, and models for such zzso have been proposed by zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, however, there have been no single crystal or zzso structural data on DNA zzso and no direct observation of the zzso C in such a zzso We present here the first zzso evidence for triplex formation in DNA from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and report direct observation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso in the zzso
