The mouse zzso DNA zzso zzso consists of a regulatory zzso and a zzso zzso domain, which are fused by a stretch of zzso zzso zzso The zzso region contains all of the zzso motifs found in other zzso DNA zzso including the relative position of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso are simpler and lack the regulatory zzso zzso We constructed three hybrid zzso containing the intact zzso of the zzso zzso and most of the coding sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These hybrids are biologically active when expressed in a zzso system and show the specificity of the parental zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso leads to de zzso zzso of both host and viral zzso in a zzso zzso zzso kinetic analyses were performed on the zzso zzso hybrid using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso The zzso has a slow zzso turnover number of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and exhibits zzso higher zzso efficiency for zzso zzso
