Previous controversy has risen from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso channels with zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the association between expression of zzso zzso channels and the process of zzso transformation of cervical zzso zzso We studied the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso currents in various human cervical zzso cells that were representative of different stages of cervical zzso zzso normal cervical zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso in zzso and invasive zzso using the zzso patch clamp zzso The zzso zzso channels, however, were significantly activated only in the four cervical cancer cell lines, primary culture cells of zzso in zzso and invasive cancer of the zzso The expression of zzso zzso currents was independent of the state of human zzso zzso When these cells were exposed to zzso zzso the cells zzso and outward zzso zzso currents were zzso These effects were readily reversed by returning the cells to zzso zzso In addition, zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, none of the cells from normal zzso and human zzso cell lines, the in zzso equivalent of zzso cervical zzso zzso developed substantial zzso currents on exposure to zzso zzso zzso currents were zzso activated in all cervical zzso cells, regardless of the stages of zzso This is the first report suggesting an in zzso association between the development of zzso zzso currents and human zzso
