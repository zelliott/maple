Two low molecular weight zzso zzso were isolated from human pulmonary zzso zzso zzso gel analysis showed one protein zzso zzso to have an apparent molecular weight of 18,000 when zzso and 9,000 D after zzso The second protein zzso 9) migrated at approximately 9,000 D in the presence or absence of reducing zzso Both proteins contain a high number of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of SP 18 was determined to be: zzso A zzso clone isolated from a human adult lung zzso library contained a long open reading frame zzso at an internal position the human SP 18 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and SP 9 and SP 18 were assessed for their capacity to reduce surface tensions on a pulsating bubble zzso The addition of zzso zzso resulted in a reduction of surface tension after 15 s from zzso zzso for zzso alone to zzso and zzso zzso for preparations containing SP 9 and SP 18, zzso In zzso assessment of zzso zzso activity was performed in fetal zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso + zzso SP 18 instilled zzso at delivery resulted in a marked increase in lung compliance, while the incorporation of zzso SP 9 yielded a moderate zzso These data show the ability to produce biologically active zzso by the addition of isolated zzso zzso to defined zzso
