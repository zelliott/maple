We report a zzso and zzso study of the European zzso zzso virus zzso zzso family zzso and a comparative analysis with the American Colorado tick fever zzso virus (the type species of the zzso The previously established, but distant, zzso relationship between these viruses was strengthened by genetic findings zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid identity between 55 and zzso similar zzso terminal zzso suspected zzso phenomenon in segment 9 of both zzso and by indistinguishable zzso zzso Moreover, putative zzso zzso zzso activities were suspected to be carried out by zzso viral proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings, together with the comparative analysis to zzso of southeast Asian zzso support the recent zzso of zzso with 12 segments of zzso within two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and raise interesting questions about the evolutionary origins of zzso The previously proposed hypothesis that zzso virus was derived from an ancestral virus introduced in Europe with the migration of zzso from zzso would imply a divergence date between American and European zzso of over 50 million years ago zzso This analysis allows for the first time to propose an evolutionary rate for virus zzso zzso which was found to be in the order of zzso to zzso zzso a rate similar to that of zzso zzso
