The establishment of zzso and zzso in the early zzso zzso relies on interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and the zzso zzso Twist zzso activate zzso in cell culture and in zzso from a promoter containing binding sites for both zzso zzso surprisingly, a region of Twist outside the zzso zzso domain is required for the zzso In zzso the zzso zzso domain appears to be sufficient for zzso zzso interaction zzso show that Twist and zzso bind to one another in zzso However, this interaction does not appear to be of sufficient strength to yield cooperative binding to zzso Nonetheless, the regions of Twist and zzso required for the binding interaction are also required for synergistic zzso zzso
