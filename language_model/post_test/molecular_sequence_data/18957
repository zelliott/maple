The structure of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso which zzso resembles human DNA zzso I zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso the closed zzso through several zzso interactions between two zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso This zzso is oriented differently in zzso zzso suggesting that the disruption of its interactions with zzso zzso DNA zzso Previously, we demonstrated that the replacement of zzso with zzso improves the zzso zzso Here we report that the combination of the zzso and the elimination of zzso zzso in the zzso forming interactions with zzso effectively enhanced the zzso
