To date, there are no data available on the population zzso of zzso due to the lack of genetic markers and the difficulty of working with such small zzso In the Arctic region of North America and along the Rocky zzso there exist two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which are well differentiated by zzso and molecular zzso However, both are resistant to zzso show other common biological characters zzso low or no zzso to zzso and zzso and produce fertile F1 offspring upon zzso To data, these two zzso have been considered zzso In this study, we detected both zzso in wolves of the same wolf packs in Alaska, suggesting zzso A single zzso zzso present in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso was used as a genetic marker to study gene flow for this character in both a zzso infection model and in larvae from zzso zzso zzso Only F1 larvae originating from a cross between zzso zzso male and zzso zzso female were able to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso originating from a cross between zzso zzso male and zzso zzso female were not reproductively zzso As expected, all F1 larvae showed a zzso pattern for the zzso character upon zzso zzso however, within the zzso population, the number of observed zzso zzso was substantially higher than expected zzso as supported by the zzso index, and was not in the zzso zzso zzso from two of the 16 zzso positive zzso zzso showed the zzso zzso pattern or the zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso live in zzso at least in zzso zzso where zzso zzso occurs more frequently zzso than zzso zzso zzso One explanation for this phenomenon is that glacial periods may have caused a geographical zzso zzso and independent evolution of zzso zzso within the Rocky zzso resulting in a zzso of the zzso zzso Additional studies will be required to test this zzso
