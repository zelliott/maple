The clinically important zzso zzso zzso binds to bacterial cell wall peptides of zzso bacteria which terminate in zzso thereby zzso cell wall synthesis resulting in cell zzso We have removed the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by an zzso degradation and zzso the exposed zzso group of zzso 2 with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups to generate novel zzso zzso The binding of zzso and these zzso zzso to the bacterial cell wall analogue zzso zzso was studied by zzso techniques and zzso zzso The effects that these structural modifications of the zzso binding pocket of zzso have on the zzso recognition process show that a cooperative effect between zzso and zzso forces appears to be partly responsible for the highly efficient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso
