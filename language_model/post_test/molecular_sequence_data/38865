zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso specifically recognizes DNA sites of the form zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso normally requires zzso coordination between two such recognition elements at distinct zzso We have investigated assembly of the zzso complex with zzso and zzso I footprint zzso In the zzso system, zzso binding resulted in a zzso specific shifted band, in a manner requiring both zzso and zzso The binding was specific for zzso DNA and responded to local sequence changes in the same way that zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso for zzso in a modification and zzso zzso A zzso species was formed in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso I footprint analysis showed modest zzso in binding to two sites, and a zzso zzso displayed protection in zzso zzso DNA in addition to the recognition zzso The addition of zzso did not affect the footprint zzso We propose that zzso effects a zzso change in the complex rather than a reorganization of the zzso zzso
