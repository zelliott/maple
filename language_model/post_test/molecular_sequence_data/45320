zzso constitute a family of proteins involved in many essential cellular zzso They have also been identified as a zzso family able to elicit zzso hypersensitivity zzso Moreover, it has been shown that human zzso are recognized by serum zzso from patients zzso to environmental zzso zzso zzso to zzso that have similarity to environmental zzso is often observed in zzso zzso Therefore comparison of the crystal structure of human proteins with similarity to zzso should allow the identification of structural similarities to rationally explain zzso A new zzso from zzso zzso zzso f zzso has been zzso expressed and showed to exhibit zzso in zzso and in zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso s 6) has been determined at zzso A (1 zzso zzso by X-ray zzso zzso belong to space group zzso with unit cell dimensions of zzso A and zzso zzso The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of human zzso A as the search zzso The refined structure includes all 162 zzso acids of Mala s 6, an zzso zzso zzso and 173 water zzso with a zzso zzso and free zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The overall structure consists of an zzso zzso zzso and two zzso covering the top and bottom of the barrel, typical for zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and human structures that are potentially involved in the zzso zzso
