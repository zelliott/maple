In order to test hypotheses about the zzso relationships among living zzso of New World zzso zzso zzso of DNA sequence information was collected for two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the X zzso for 24 species of New World zzso These data were analyzed using a maximum zzso zzso The strict consensus of the three zzso gene trees that result shows support for the following zzso a zzso zzso including zzso within which zzso and zzso are sister zzso an zzso zzso within which zzso is the sister zzso of zzso and which is sister to another zzso containing the zzso and a zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso is the sister zzso of zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso These results are broadly consistent with previously published DNA sequence analyses of zzso zzso and provide additional support for groupings zzso proposed in those earlier zzso Nevertheless, questions remain as to the relative zzso placement of zzso and zzso the branching order within the zzso zzso and the placement of the zzso zzso relative to the zzso and the zzso
