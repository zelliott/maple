Through a zzso analysis of a zzso regulated zzso we present evidence that supports a role for the zzso factor zzso in tumor suppression in zzso zzso cell zzso The human zzso gene was previously shown to be expressed as three zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Whereas the two larger species are expressed at similar levels in all cell lines zzso the zzso zzso zzso is expressed specifically in zzso zzso In this study, the basis for the differential expression of this zzso species was zzso The message was shown to originate from a promoter located within an zzso of the zzso zzso An zzso located zzso 1500 zzso upstream of the start site was required for cell type specific zzso zzso analysis of this zzso revealed an zzso site and five zzso sites which were necessary for full zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA binding activity were found to be as much as zzso higher in the zzso cells relative to the zzso cells, while zzso activity was similar in both cell zzso These results suggest that a signaling zzso targeting zzso may play an important role in tumor suppression in zzso zzso
