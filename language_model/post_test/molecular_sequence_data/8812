zzso resistance zzso to different zzso compounds in the zzso zzso zzso can arise from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso We have raised zzso zzso recognizing the zzso zzso ABC zzso to study its zzso and to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso and indirect zzso experiments showed that zzso is localized in the plasma zzso In addition, zzso zzso of cells and zzso indicated that zzso is a short-lived membrane protein with a zzso of about 60 to 90 zzso A dramatic zzso stabilization of zzso was observed in delta zzso zzso cells defective in zzso zzso and indirect zzso showed that zzso accumulates in zzso of zzso delta zzso zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso turnover requires zzso zzso However, zzso turnover does not require a functional zzso since the zzso of zzso was unaffected in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso defective in the zzso zzso zzso that is essential for zzso protein zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso delivery of zzso is blocked in conditional zzso zzso zzso at the restrictive temperature, showing that zzso delivers zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso
