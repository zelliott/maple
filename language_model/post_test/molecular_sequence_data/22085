Diversity in gene expression is commonly observed as a result of alternative zzso of zzso zzso This is true in the case of zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that additional zzso zzso transcripts are generated in zzso but these transcripts have yet to be observed because of the limitations of currently used detection zzso For this study our objective was to create an zzso zzso to study zzso zzso zzso events in cell lines of diverse zzso Mouse zzso DNA was used as a zzso template to amplify the zzso DNA sequence spanning zzso zzso The resulting zzso DNA was zzso in an expression zzso This resulting zzso zzso was shown to be functionally active by zzso into multiple cell zzso We have successfully cloned an zzso zzso and as a result we describe and discuss novel zzso alternatively spliced zzso
