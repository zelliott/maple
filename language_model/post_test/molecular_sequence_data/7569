Lung zzso zzso activity has been linked to zzso and may produce zzso zzso species and potent zzso acid zzso In lamb zzso oxygen breathing increases lung zzso activity, and zzso of lung zzso zzso activity reduces zzso lung zzso The zzso zzso zzso is present in many lung cells, including zzso cells, and may therefore be involved in the zzso of zzso injury to zzso zzso zzso to test the hypothesis that oxygen regulates zzso gene expression in the zzso we cloned the sheep zzso zzso and examined its regulation by oxygen breathing significantly increased lung zzso zzso levels and that this increase preceded the increase in zzso zzso zzso exposure also promptly increased zzso zzso levels in cultured lamb lung zzso zzso cells but not in zzso cells isolated from the main pulmonary artery or in lung smooth muscle zzso The zzso increase in zzso zzso levels was not serum dependent, was unaffected by zzso treatment, and could not be zzso by treatment of the cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso or by chemical zzso By nuclear zzso zzso in cultured lung zzso cells, oxygen increased the zzso rate of zzso by almost fourfold after 90 zzso of oxygen exposure but had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso We conclude that oxygen tension, but not chemical zzso increases zzso gene expression zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso We speculate that oxygen induction of zzso activity in these cells may contribute to zzso injury during oxygen zzso
