zzso is an zzso protein that zzso zzso zzso by multiple stimuli in a large variety of cell zzso zzso (also known as zzso was identified as a zzso binding protein and shown to promote zzso Previous studies indicated that the zzso two-thirds of zzso contain the zzso required for its interaction with zzso and that this region of the protein is responsible for the majority of the zzso activity of zzso We have performed zzso zzso analyses to further characterize the zzso interaction and the zzso activity of zzso The results obtained indicate that the zzso zzso acid region of zzso is necessary for its binding to zzso Further zzso of this motif shows that zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso 16 of zzso is essential for the zzso zzso zzso analyses conducted in zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicate that these zzso induce zzso through a zzso pathway, and that they kill cells slightly more zzso than zzso zzso zzso is still able to counteract zzso cell death significantly, but not as completely as when tested against zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso ability of zzso zzso is blocked by zzso through several zzso
