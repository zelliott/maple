zzso zzso zzso and zzso constitute a family of proteins implicated in zzso trafficking at distinct stages of the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso of zzso have been zzso including zzso which has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic zzso zzso at the nerve zzso We have characterized zzso clones zzso three additional zzso zzso belonging to this family: zzso and zzso from zzso which are 30 and zzso identical to zzso zzso respectively, and zzso from human which is 38% identical to zzso zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso analysis of 16 zzso proteins from several species is consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of this gene family parallels the specialization of zzso trafficking to distinct zzso zzso By Northern analysis, each of these genes is expressed in all zzso examined zzso zzso zzso liver, skeletal muscle, zzso zzso While zzso binds zzso zzso 2, and 3, zzso zzso and zzso do not bind any of the known zzso We propose that the three proteins bind as yet unidentified zzso zzso involved in zzso trafficking between the zzso apparatus, zzso zzso and the zzso
