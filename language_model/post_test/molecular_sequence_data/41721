The molecular basis of spectral tuning of zzso zzso in two zzso species is zzso The zzso zzso of zzso extracts from zzso zzso zzso max zzso zzso showed a 5 zzso red shift compared with zzso zzso zzso max zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence of zzso zzso zzso was determined from zzso chain reaction zzso amplified fragments by using zzso DNA as zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was compared with that obtained from the previously published zzso sequence of zzso zzso A total of 22 zzso acid differences are present, although only seven can be considered to be zzso zzso Three of these changes occur in zzso zzso regions but only one, the substitution of zzso by zzso at site zzso in zzso zzso involves the replacement of an zzso with a zzso zzso at a site located near the zzso of zzso VI and on the inner face of the zzso zzso The equivalent site is also used for the spectral tuning of zzso cone zzso an example of zzso zzso It is proposed that substitution at this site is responsible for the 5 zzso red zzso The relation between this spectral shift and the maximum depth distribution of zzso zzso of about 200 zzso compared with about 360 m for zzso zzso is zzso An unexpected finding was that the zzso gene of both species appears to lack zzso
