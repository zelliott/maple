zzso zzso zzso exists as at least three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso significance for the existence of more than one form of the zzso however, remains to be zzso In the present study, we examined the expression and distribution of the zzso in mouse zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso raised against each zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses indicated that either the alpha zzso plus zzso or the beta zzso appeared to be the zzso expressed zzso The zzso abundance for the alpha zzso was highest in zzso whereas that for the beta zzso was relatively high in heart and zzso While the native form of each zzso was reported to consist of either zzso or zzso our zzso studies clearly indicated that a considerable part of the active form of the zzso consists of zzso zzso with relatively small parts of activity expressed by zzso and zzso zzso This is the first experimental evidence for the presence of zzso zzso in any zzso Thus our results strongly suggested that the activity of zzso in the cell is controlled not only by the level of each zzso but also by their combination to form the active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to induce zzso activity zzso in zzso zzso Our analysis for the mechanism involved in this induction revealed that the responsible zzso for zzso was zzso not zzso The level of alpha zzso was strongly induced in mouse liver, which resulted in a sustained increase in the amount of the alpha zzso zzso the composition of zzso zzso came to represent up to zzso of the total active molecular form of zzso in zzso liver, whereas it was less than zzso in normal zzso zzso
