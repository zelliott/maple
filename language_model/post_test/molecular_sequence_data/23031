zzso swinging arms are crucial to the reactions zzso by the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso A gene zzso a putative zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso of molecular mass 29 zzso was zzso zzso Crystal structures in the absence and presence of bound zzso acid were solved at zzso A zzso The protein was found to fall into the zzso class and to be structurally zzso to the zzso zzso of class II zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso acid in zzso was bound in the same position as zzso in zzso The structure of the zzso zzso and limited zzso of zzso zzso together highlighted some key features of the zzso zzso A loop zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is proposed as interacting with the zzso ring of zzso acid and discriminating against the entry of zzso A second loop zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding loop in the zzso zzso under zzso conditions rendered the zzso zzso zzso emphasizing its zzso The putative zzso of zzso lacks a zzso domain found in its counterparts in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso A gene zzso a protein that appears to have structural zzso to the additional domain in the zzso and zzso zzso was detected alongside the structural gene zzso the putative zzso in the zzso zzso It is likely that this protein is required to zzso activity on the zzso as currently zzso one protein perhaps zzso the formation of the obligatory zzso zzso and the other transferring the zzso group from it to the specific zzso zzso in the target zzso
