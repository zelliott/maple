zzso regulation through zzso is thought to play a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of zzso Traditionally, zzso technologies were used to probe for specific zzso modifications zzso present on zzso tails, but these methods do not generally reveal the presence of multiple modifications on a zzso tail zzso zzso Here, we describe technology for the discovery and zzso of zzso zzso codes that is based on zzso and mass zzso We applied this methodology to decipher 74 discrete zzso codes on the tail of zzso zzso from human embryonic stem zzso zzso Finally, we zzso the zzso of these codes as human zzso cells undergo differentiation to reveal striking changes in zzso and zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso was observed only in the presence of zzso zzso such zzso patterning exemplifies the power of this zzso
