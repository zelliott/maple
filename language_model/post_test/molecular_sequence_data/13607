In molecular biology, zzso and zzso the expression of zzso fusion proteins is a very powerful technique for the identification and zzso zzso based on the interaction of the zzso stretch with immobilized metal zzso By synthesis of a novel class of zzso zzso this technique was combined with the concept of zzso leading to zzso for zzso and orientation of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Here, the zzso zzso layers were transferred onto solid zzso by zzso fusion and zzso zzso binding of a zzso containing an zzso sequence to these zzso zzso was demonstrated by reflection interference contrast zzso zzso Due to the phase separation zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso interface could be further structured in two zzso zzso and organization of zzso molecules at these two-dimensional recognition zzso was zzso by zzso with a layer thickness resolution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be triggered by adding zzso zzso and disrupted by zzso This concept opens up possibilities for zzso zzso enrichment and organization of zzso fusion proteins at zzso and their application in zzso
