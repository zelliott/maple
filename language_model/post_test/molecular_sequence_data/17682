Two zzso peptides termed zzso III and IV were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts of the zzso zzso zzso The primary structures of zzso III and IV were established as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and shown to have zzso and biological properties identical with those of the native zzso They stimulate visceral muscle zzso of the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and of the zzso of zzso zzso Both peptides exhibit sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso similarity is greater with the fish and zzso zzso (up to zzso than with the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso zzso activity of the zzso is analogous to that of zzso zzso Both chemical and biological similarities of zzso and insect zzso zzso the evidence for a long evolutionary history of the zzso zzso zzso
