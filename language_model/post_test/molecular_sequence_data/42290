The mouse zzso cell line zzso was found to zzso two low zzso zzso into zzso medium zzso The major zzso migrated at approximately 29 zzso and a minor zzso of 24 zzso was also present on western zzso blots zzso Both zzso were zzso from CM by zzso zzso followed by reverse zzso zzso analysis revealed that the first 10 zzso acids of the 29 zzso and the 24 zzso zzso were zzso to corresponding sequences of both human and rat zzso and zzso zzso The 24 zzso zzso also zzso with a new zzso specific for zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso were increased by the addition of zzso zzso or insulin to the cell cultures, with zzso demonstrating the greatest hormonal zzso The effects of zzso on zzso expression were both time and dose dependent, with zzso being more potent than zzso and zzso more potent than zzso The relative zzso of these hormones in stimulating zzso production were consistent with the peptides acting through the zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso analog zzso zzso which has very low affinity for the zzso zzso only slightly zzso an increase in zzso zzso of zzso to the cultures decreased both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso demonstrated that zzso increased the expression of the zzso for zzso whereas zzso decreased zzso Together, these data suggest that the zzso can increase zzso production at both the protein and zzso zzso
