zzso a putative regulator of zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso and its zzso constitute a zzso family known to occur among bacteria, zzso and zzso Distinguished from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso proteins lack a charged loop that can bind to zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso of zzso open reading frames zzso 52 zzso and 53 zzso zzso zzso and zzso Race analyses indicated that zzso of both zzso zzso genes occurs by 12 h zzso and is initiated at a late consensus zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was expressed as a zzso of 23 and 26 zzso in infected zzso zzso cells, while zzso was expressed as a 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the 23 zzso form of zzso was distributed in both zzso and nucleus of infected cells, whereas the 26 zzso form of zzso and zzso proteins were only present in zzso Further analysis revealed that these proteins are associated with the zzso of zzso zzso Using a zzso extraction zzso the zzso and 26 zzso form of zzso proteins were both detected in the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, column zzso analysis showed that the zzso and zzso proteins could interact with zzso zzso It was proposed that zzso zzso might function as DNA binding zzso
