The model zzso zzso zzso grows zzso near zzso on carbohydrates and zzso Its zzso sequence zzso was determined 12 years zzso A genetically zzso strain, zzso was very recently reported, and here we describe its zzso zzso Of zzso zzso in size, it is zzso zzso longer zzso than the reference zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains numerous zzso zzso zzso and single base zzso zzso also has 45 full or partial zzso sequences zzso compared to 35 in the reference zzso strain, and these have resulted in the direct deletion or zzso zzso of 13 zzso Another seven genes were affected by zzso deletions and are predicted to be zzso In addition, the zzso acid sequences of another 102 of the zzso predicted gene products are different in zzso These changes potentially impact various cellular functions, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso and growth at zzso For example, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso resulted in a zzso requirement for zzso Nevertheless, zzso grew on zzso zzso and peptides in complex and minimal media at 98 and zzso to the same extent as did both its parent strain and a new culture collection strain zzso zzso This was in spite of zzso lacking several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is therefore of high zzso and the availability of the zzso sequence will be critical for the future studies of this model zzso
