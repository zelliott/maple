zzso zzso are type 1 zzso proteins that contain a unique domain structure including a zzso zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso two novel members of this family, zzso and zzso which show zzso zzso Three forms of zzso were found that zzso proteins of zzso zzso and 767 zzso zzso All of the zzso acid differences are located in the zzso zzso Two forms of zzso were isolated that zzso proteins of 790 and zzso zzso zzso with the difference in the coding region occurring in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso map to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso An ancestral analysis of all known zzso zzso indicates that the zzso motif in the zzso domain arose once in a common zzso and was subsequently lost by those members lacking this zzso
