zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been known to more efficiently mediate cell zzso than zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso of the zzso domain of zzso significantly enhances surface zzso based on the two criteria: 1) the binding degree of zzso zzso zzso and 2) the ratio of zzso when a zzso zzso was introduced in the interface of domain zzso zzso analysis revealed that the positively charged zzso zzso including very zzso zzso are essential for maintaining the structural transition between the zzso and zzso Despite a strong zzso zzso the zzso zzso lacking an zzso domain zzso or containing R to A substitution in position zzso zzso supported a lower degree of cell zzso than did zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that the native structure of surface zzso is not a zzso but is an intermediate zzso equilibrium structure by which the effectiveness of zzso can be fully zzso
