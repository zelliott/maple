The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows only a distant genetic relationship to other zzso In this report we describe the gene organization of an zzso region of the zzso which contains the zzso zzso The zzso zzso initiation sites were mapped and the sequence and gene organization of an zzso region of zzso were zzso The sequences downstream of the zzso gene showed zzso with the gene organization of other zzso An zzso zzso open reading frame zzso capable of zzso a zzso zzso was found at the 3' end of the zzso zzso followed by an zzso zzso zzso a putative protein zzso zzso with an orientation similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene were found to be unique to zzso and contained two regions consisting of highly repetitive zzso One region, zzso zzso in length and termed sequence repeat region 1 zzso contained a variety of short direct repeats, zzso was found to act as a zzso zzso in a transient expression zzso Additional regions containing different repetitive sequences were identified within the zzso zzso and in sequences located downstream of the zzso zzso
