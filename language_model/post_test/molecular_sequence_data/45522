In zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso hormone with fundamental roles during pregnancy involving fetal growth, zzso and stimulating zzso in the zzso Human zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso with human growth hormone zzso and both hormones bind to the zzso zzso domain zzso the first step in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso A modified surface zzso resonance method was developed to measure the zzso for zzso and zzso binding to the zzso zzso with and without zzso and showed that zzso has about a tenfold higher affinity for the zzso zzso than zzso The crystal structure of the free state of zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution showing the zzso possesses an overall structure similar to other long chain zzso bundle zzso zzso of the free zzso structure with the zzso complex structure of zzso bound to the zzso zzso suggests that two surface zzso undergo zzso changes zzso A upon zzso An 18 zzso zzso was used to characterize the binding energy zzso for the site 1 interface of zzso Individual zzso zzso at five positions reduced binding affinity by a zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso site 1 zzso with that previously determined for zzso indicates contributions of individual zzso track reasonably well between zzso and zzso In particular, zzso involved in the zzso site and zzso constitute the principal binding zzso for both zzso However, several zzso that are identical between zzso and zzso contribute quite differently to the binding of the zzso zzso Additionally, the overall zzso of the zzso changes observed from the zzso of zzso were markedly larger than those determined in the comparative scan of zzso to the zzso zzso The structural and zzso data presented here show that subtle changes in the structural context of an interaction can lead to significantly different effects at the individual zzso zzso
