According to small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons all known zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso only by environmental DNA zzso the zzso Here we report the zzso of a new zzso zzso zzso from a submarine hot zzso This zzso cannot be attached to one of these groups and therefore must represent an unknown zzso which we name zzso and species, which we name zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso and only about 400 zzso in zzso They grow attached to the surface of a specific zzso host, a new member of the zzso zzso The distribution of the zzso is so far zzso zzso to their unusual zzso zzso zzso members remained zzso by commonly used ecological studies based on the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso the smallest zzso zzso it is only zzso zzso in zzso This zzso will provide insight into the evolution of zzso of tiny zzso and of zzso zzso
