alpha zzso zzso zzso is an abundant zzso with the intrinsic capacity for capturing diverse proteins for rapid delivery into zzso After zzso by the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso complexes were rapidly zzso in the zzso zzso Although this is an important zzso for clearance of both alpha zzso and biological targets, little is known about the nature of alpha zzso degradation in the zzso zzso To investigate the possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the disruption of structural and functional integrity of alpha zzso in the zzso system, we examined the capacity of alpha zzso for interacting with zzso E and zzso D under zzso conditions and the nature of its zzso alpha zzso was efficiently associated with zzso E under zzso conditions to form zzso complexes and rapidly zzso through the generation of three major proteins with apparent molecular masses of 90, 85 and 30 zzso Parallel with this reaction, alpha zzso resulted in the rapid loss of its zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequences of these proteins revealed that alpha zzso was selectively zzso at the zzso bond in about zzso downstream of the bait zzso In contrast, little change was observed for alpha zzso treated by zzso D under the same zzso Together, the synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of human alpha zzso which contains the zzso zzso site, was selectively zzso by zzso zzso but not zzso zzso These results suggest the possible involvement of zzso E in disruption of the structural and functional integrity of alpha zzso in the zzso zzso
