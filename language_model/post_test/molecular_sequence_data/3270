zzso is an zzso zzso recently isolated from rat stomach that zzso stimulates zzso release in zzso and in zzso in rat and zzso zzso specifically activates the zzso for the growth hormone zzso zzso and it has been proposed as the zzso zzso zzso by these synthetic zzso Very recently, it was shown in cells zzso with the zzso that short zzso peptides encompassing the first 4-5 zzso of zzso were capable of increasing zzso calcium almost as efficiently as the full-length zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that truncated zzso of zzso are ineffective in stimulating zzso release in zzso rats and do not zzso zzso zzso from binding sites in zzso from human zzso and zzso In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the ability of short zzso to stimulate the zzso in zzso cells is not zzso of their capability to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso
