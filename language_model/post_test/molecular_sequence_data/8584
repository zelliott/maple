zzso sequence analysis of zzso fragments corresponding to the zzso zzso amplified from zzso DNA collected from the four members of a family, two of which had zzso zzso revealed a zzso substitution in the first position of zzso 36 of the zzso gene in the two zzso The zzso substitution was from G to C, leading to a zzso change zzso in the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso The altered sequence was also found in DNA obtained from their mother, but not in DNA from their zzso We zzso expressed the two zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, by zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Neither the binding of zzso nor the responsiveness to zzso measured as zzso formation, appeared to be different in the zzso compared to the zzso Furthermore, the zzso also became zzso when exposed to zzso as did the zzso
