Different approaches to the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were compared in the detection and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and viral DNA zzso zzso zzso in cell suspensions, zzso and tissue zzso Single and multiple primer pairs were compared in the amplification step of indirect zzso zzso and long zzso zzso or internal zzso zzso in the subsequent zzso zzso zzso For direct zzso zzso in which amplification products were directly labeled with zzso during zzso and detected zzso only single primer pairs were used for zzso zzso zzso yielded best results in the cell suspensions and worked less efficiently in zzso or tissue zzso zzso of the results obtained in artificial cell zzso yielded only an approximate correlation between the number of expected and observed positive zzso The specificity of the results was greater with indirect zzso zzso than direct zzso zzso where false positive results were zzso zzso indirect zzso zzso in tissue sections required the use of multiple primer pairs for amplification and zzso zzso for detection by zzso False positive results in direct zzso zzso were caused by zzso but DNA zzso and zzso incorporation of zzso zzso into cellular DNA, possibly related to DNA repair and/or internal zzso zzso results were most marked in tissue sections and were much less frequent in cell zzso zzso zzso includes a number of different techniques, which are not equally zzso to different starting zzso zzso interpretation of the results requires vigorous zzso
