The zzso genes of zzso tuberculosis were zzso By using a set of zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the expected size was amplified by zzso and was used to screen a zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso Three open reading frames with extensive similarity to the zzso genes from other organisms were zzso The locus was mapped on the zzso using an ordered zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso A suicide zzso containing a zzso gene disrupted by a zzso marker zzso was used to construct a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso exchange involving replacement of the zzso gene with the zzso zzso To our knowledge, zzso exchange has not been reported previously in the zzso zzso zzso zzso will be an invaluable genetic tool for deciphering the mechanisms of tuberculosis zzso a disease that causes 3 zzso zzso deaths a year zzso
