A cell line zzso established from acute zzso leukemia zzso had unique zzso of zzso leukemia cells with expression of both T cell and zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso highly expressed a 6 zzso transcript of zzso which is located on zzso zzso zzso we further characterized the zzso zzso by zzso gel zzso near zzso We identified and isolated the zzso zzso at approximately 80 zzso upstream from the zzso end of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed that the whole zzso region from T cell zzso beta zzso at zzso was zzso to the upstream of zzso A zzso zzso zzso transcript was expressed in the zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso occurred as zzso joining zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso segment between zzso and the region zzso to the zzso gene at zzso was zzso to the region zzso to zzso in zzso Since the zzso region of zzso 8 zzso was also zzso to the zzso zzso zzso segment in zzso the zzso abnormalities of zzso were defined as being zzso zzso It is suggested that a zzso zzso element in the zzso locus and/or loss of a negative regulatory element near zzso might function to enhance the zzso zzso zzso the enhanced zzso expression may contribute to the development of a subset of zzso zzso
