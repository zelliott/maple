A newly described zzso terminal repeat zzso zzso element was isolated from the zzso of the Oriental zzso zzso zzso At least 1000 partial copies of the element, which was named zzso were dispersed throughout the zzso of zzso zzso As is usual with zzso zzso it is expected that many zzso elements will be zzso A consensus sequence of zzso zzso of the truncated zzso element was assembled from several zzso fragments that contained zzso zzso The sequence zzso part of the first open reading frame zzso the entire second zzso and, at its zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso a zzso acid binding protein and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that included zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso zzso in that zzso Based on its sequence and structure, and zzso analyses of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso belongs to the chicken repeat 1 zzso lineage of elements known from the chicken, turtle, zzso fish, mosquitoes and other zzso zzso shared equal similarity with zzso from chicken, an zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso from the related blood fluke zzso zzso the level of similarity between zzso and zzso indicated that these two zzso zzso were related but not zzso The findings indicate that zzso have been zzso by at least two discrete zzso zzso Whereas zzso did not appear to have a tight target site zzso at least one copy of zzso has inserted into the zzso region of a zzso gene zzso zzso of as yet unknown zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction in the egg, zzso and adult zzso stages of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso domain was transcribed and suggesting that zzso was replicating actively and mobile within the zzso zzso zzso
