The fifth zzso domain of zzso zzso both with and without the zzso acids that connect the fifth domain to the sixth domain, has been zzso and zzso to form several different zzso zzso The domain without the connecting region formed three zzso zzso upon zzso under zzso zzso Of these three zzso the zzso bonded zzso was the best inhibitor of zzso zzso and also of the zzso interaction that results in protein C zzso but all the zzso were zzso in both zzso The zzso containing an zzso zzso pattern zzso was not found among the zzso zzso The domain with the connecting region zzso acids zzso at the zzso formed two zzso products upon zzso in zzso zzso These products had the same two zzso patterns as the earliest and latest zzso zzso of the domain without the zzso In order to compare the zzso affinities of these zzso to the zzso with the zzso zzso bonds, zzso protection of the second and fourth zzso was used to force the zzso bonds into the zzso zzso zzso zzso measured as zzso of zzso zzso and as zzso of protein C zzso correlated zzso with the number of crossed zzso zzso As was found for the domain without the connecting region, the zzso that was the best inhibitor of zzso zzso and of protein C zzso was the zzso with no crossing zzso bonds zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
