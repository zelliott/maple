The zzso zzso zzso zzso originally isolated from the coastal zzso of Terra Nova Bay in zzso shows a strictly zzso zzso including optimal survival and zzso rates at 4-5 zzso This characteristic makes zzso zzso an ideal model species for identifying the molecular bases of cold adaptation in zzso organisms, as well as a suitable source of novel zzso zzso for industrial zzso In the current study, we characterized the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and its zzso activity was compared to that of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso have consensus motifs zzso in other zzso zzso By analyzing both zzso and zzso zzso activity, we determined the zzso and the optimal zzso temperature dependence and zzso of these zzso We demonstrated that zzso shows the characteristics of a zzso zzso Furthermore, we analyzed the zzso activity of three engineered versions of the zzso in which unique zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso through zzso zzso with zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Pro and zzso zzso Additionally, three corresponding zzso of zzso were also generated and zzso These analyses showed that the substitution of zzso acids with rigid and bulky zzso side chain in the zzso zzso zzso zzso properties similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso and vice zzso This is the first report on the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso The results reported in this paper support the idea that zzso zzso is based mainly on some zzso acid zzso that influence the structural flexibility of zzso and that zzso is an attractive zzso for industrial processes at low zzso
