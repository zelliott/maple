zzso X syndrome is associated with the expansion of the number of zzso zzso tandem repeats at the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso repeats in normal individuals ranges between 5 and 50, in zzso carrier individuals it ranges between 50 and zzso and in affected individuals it is more than 200 zzso zzso In addition, in affected individuals the zzso zzso in the zzso repeats and the adjacent zzso island are zzso and the zzso gene is zzso zzso The most common diagnostic method for the detection of the syndrome is Southern zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso chain reaction zzso could facilitate the rapid screening of large numbers of individuals by accurately determining the number of zzso zzso Current zzso techniques for amplification of zzso repeats are, however, inefficient and unreliable because of their zzso zzso zzso Thus, most of the described zzso protocols require subsequent Southern zzso analysis and zzso We present a novel zzso approach for the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome based on the zzso conversion of C zzso to U by zzso on zzso DNA and subsequent amplification of the zzso strand with specific zzso A zzso with zzso for zzso C zzso will amplify the zzso zzso region upstream to zzso repeats exclusively in affected zzso As a result of extensive mismatch between zzso and zzso DNA, no zzso fragments will be obtained in normal and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso treatment dramatically reduces the zzso component of the zzso thus, the high zzso and the strong secondary structures are no longer obstacles for zzso zzso In normal and carrier individuals, zzso repeats zzso zzso in the zzso strand can easily be amplified and zzso on a gel by zzso zzso zzso We applied our method on 25 males previously diagnosed by Southern zzso zzso All the samples were easily and accurately zzso The method has considerable advantages compared with other diagnostic tests for fragile X zzso
