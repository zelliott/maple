A portion of the zzso zzso zzso B, zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso containing the coding sequence for the zzso terminal 684 zzso acids of the zzso was cloned in zzso zzso zzso zzso was by zzso detection using a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso From the zzso acid zzso peptides were zzso 15 zzso acids in zzso that covered the entire zzso In total, 260 synthetic peptides were zzso and evaluated for their zzso in zzso zzso Thirty-nine peptides were zzso without carrier, and the zzso generated were tested for their ability to bind cells of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso corresponding to peptides from five regions on the zzso zzso bound cells of both bacterial zzso These peptides were then evaluated for their ability to stimulate in zzso zzso zzso zzso after in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Two of the peptides were capable of stimulating zzso as determined by incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequences of these 5 peptides were then compared to sequences found in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso (Kelly et zzso zzso As expected, there was considerable zzso between the zzso peptides zzso and the analogous region from zzso zzso This zzso was not usually zzso and suggests that the zzso bind a face of zzso zzso that is in an zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
