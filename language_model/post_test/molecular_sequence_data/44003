A zzso determined seed zzso has been obtained by zzso of the zzso zzso box genes Floral zzso zzso 7 zzso and zzso These genes have been previously shown to play central roles in the determination of zzso zzso zzso development of the seed coat and zzso zzso of the zzso have been observed in transgenic plants in which these two genes are zzso by zzso Analysis of the expression pattern of zzso and zzso and genetic analysis confirmed the maternal inheritance of the zzso The zzso promoter was cloned and fused to reporter zzso One of these reporter genes was the zzso gene for targeted cell zzso Our results indicate that zzso promoter activity is restricted to the seed coat of developing seeds and that it is completely silent in the zzso derived zzso The zzso used in this study provided a unique opportunity to investigate one of the poorly understood aspects of seed development: the interaction of zzso zzso and maternal zzso
