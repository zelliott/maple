We identified a zzso deletion in a pancreatic zzso zzso that localized to a zzso region at zzso zzso which lay within the zzso locus of familial breast cancer zzso zzso Here we present a physical map of the region, consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso comprises 16 clones that together span the entire zzso zzso The zzso zzso comprises 22 clones that together span the zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were localized within and near the zzso zzso Thirty-five zzso sites were defined and localized within the zzso The map indicates the size of the zzso region to be near 250 zzso and provides mapped and cloned resources for the search for the putative tumor zzso zzso in the zzso
