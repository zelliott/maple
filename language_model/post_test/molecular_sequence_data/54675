zzso cancer zzso is a rare but leading cause of zzso deaths zzso The zzso of zzso is increasing at an alarming rate in the zzso region, and its zzso remains zzso 

A total of 108 patients, 54 with zzso and 54 with zzso diseases zzso were examined for zzso zzso zzso zzso in gallbladder specimens by rapid zzso test, zzso test, zzso culture, zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and partial DNA zzso zzso was done using heat shock zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Forty zzso patients with zzso had zzso Upon culture, zzso zzso colonies were identified in 24 zzso zzso and 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in 20 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso samples upon zzso zzso was positive in 17 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso The DNA isolated from zzso and zzso specimens was amplified by zzso with zzso zzso in 18 zzso patients with zzso and 15 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso These sequences had zzso similarity with the zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso in the National Centre for Biotechnology zzso zzso 

The results revealed that zzso zzso was present in a large population, including both zzso and zzso patients, which indicates its endemic presence in the zzso zzso Thus, it appears zzso zzso might not have a significant role in the zzso of zzso in our zzso
