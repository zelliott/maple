zzso control of vascular smooth muscle plays a major role in the resulting zzso implicated in zzso or pathological circulatory zzso However, a comprehensive understanding of zzso zzso muscle cells zzso zzso is far from zzso Here, we have examined the role of gap junctions and zzso oxygen species zzso in this zzso and we demonstrate an active contribution of zzso to zzso control of zzso zzso 

In small zzso zzso quantitative zzso Western zzso analyses and zzso labeling evidenced zzso zzso 37, 40 and 43 in zzso and/or zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso targeted against zzso 37 and zzso 43 zzso zzso reduced zzso and calcium responses to zzso zzso simultaneously recorded in pulmonary arteries and zzso abolished the diffusion in zzso of zzso loaded in zzso Similarly, zzso and calcium responses to zzso were decreased by zzso zzso and zzso which, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso effects on the responses to zzso were reversed by zzso a NO zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso Electronic zzso resonance directly demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso production originated from the zzso Finally, whereas zzso increased NO production, it also decreased zzso zzso content in isolated intact zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso zzso production in zzso targeting zzso via zzso gap junctions reduces zzso zzso control of pulmonary zzso Such zzso zzso of zzso control may represent a signaling zzso controlling zzso under not only zzso but also pathological conditions that often zzso excessive zzso zzso
