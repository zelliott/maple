zzso zzso catalyze both zzso and respiratory zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, electrons generated by zzso II appear to be zzso by zzso zzso To identify the zzso electron carriers zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso that are involved in transfer of zzso zzso electrons to the terminal zzso deletion zzso for genes coding for these components were introduced into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, and electron flow out of zzso II was monitored in resulting strains through zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso or zzso but not of zzso zzso decreased the rate of electron flow out of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso could not be deleted in a zzso zzso background strain, and also a zzso zzso lacking both zzso and zzso zzso could not be zzso zzso zzso has some zzso with the zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso is a component of zzso zzso in zzso that serves as zzso intermediate between soluble electron carriers and the zzso zzso complex, and that either zzso or zzso zzso can shuttle electrons from the zzso zzso complex to zzso zzso
