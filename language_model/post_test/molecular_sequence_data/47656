A new toxin zzso was zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by a combination of gel zzso and zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was established by direct automated zzso degradation, and is in perfect agreement with the molecular mass of zzso Da found by mass zzso The primary structure of zzso exhibited sequence identity with other zzso toxins such as zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso and zzso zzso The six zzso in the sequence suggested three zzso bridges, the presence of which was demonstrated by mass zzso after zzso zzso Analysis of secondary structure using circular zzso zzso yielded more than 50% zzso and about zzso zzso The extent of the zzso and the presence of zzso bridges suggest a structure of interconnected zzso In addition, a study of zzso interactions was carried out by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso displays moderate zzso ability zzso of about 100 zzso in 1 M zzso but zzso activity was not observed against zzso or zzso zzso As a preliminary zzso the activity of zzso was investigating using zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more than zzso of outward zzso currents in rat zzso zzso zzso This result is reminiscent with the effect described for zzso extracted from the zzso of zzso zzso
