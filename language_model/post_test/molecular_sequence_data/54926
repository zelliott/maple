The present study identified zzso zzso and its target, an zzso zzso gene zzso (here referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso for regulation of leaf zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso defects with zzso altered leaf shape and a shorter zzso zzso of an zzso version of zzso under the zzso promoter zzso and target mimicry zzso resulted in a zzso leaf zzso zzso transgenic plants zzso zzso display a zzso leaf zzso zzso analyses show that there is a certain level of zzso that is optimal for leaf zzso but lower or higher levels lead to abnormal leaf development, indicating that expression of zzso in the leaf zzso is necessary for proper leaf zzso Because the zzso zzso plays a crucial role in leaf zzso and zzso the zzso reporter gene was used to monitor the zzso zzso We show that zzso expression patterns in zzso and zzso plants were significantly different from those in the wild zzso Also, zzso of zzso in zzso plants drastically decreased the expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso whereas increased expression of the genes was found in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and its target zzso are involved in the regulation of leaf zzso
