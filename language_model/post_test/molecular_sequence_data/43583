The diverse forms of protein zzso 1 in zzso result from the association of its zzso zzso zzso with different regulatory zzso one of which is the zzso zzso that targets zzso to zzso particles in zzso Here we report the structure, at zzso A resolution, of zzso in complex with a 13 zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso in zzso that interact with zzso are those in the zzso motif that is present in almost every other identified zzso zzso zzso zzso this motif in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso (which mimics the zzso targeting zzso zzso in stimulating the zzso of zzso prevents these peptides from interacting with zzso A short zzso from the zzso protein zzso that contains the zzso motif also interacts with zzso These findings identify a recognition site on zzso zzso from zzso to humans, for a critical structural motif on regulatory zzso This explains why the binding of zzso to its regulatory zzso is mutually zzso and suggests a novel approach for identifying the functions of zzso proteins whose roles are zzso
