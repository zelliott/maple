Changes in the structure and composition of a zzso community were characterized through the analysis of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso sequences for a zzso bottle incubation using a single sample collected in the western North zzso Cloning and sequencing was used to investigate changes in perceived species richness and diversity as a consequence of environmental zzso The treatments included a control zzso zzso zzso zzso enrichment, and enrichment with a complex organic zzso Five clone libraries were constructed and analyzed at the time of collection zzso zzso and after 24 zzso zzso and 72 zzso zzso h for the control, and at zzso h for the zzso and organic zzso resulting in an analysis of zzso partial zzso zzso sequences that clustered into zzso operational zzso units zzso Analysis of the clone libraries revealed that zzso zzso were highly dynamic and changed substantially at both the zzso level and higher zzso zzso during time frames consistent with many zzso methods used for measuring biological zzso Changes were most dramatic in zzso which yielded community compositions that were strongly dominated by one or a few zzso Changes in community structure during incubation dramatically influenced estimates of species zzso which were substantially lower with longer incubation and especially with amendment, even though all incubated samples originated from the same zzso of zzso zzso and enrichment of the seawater sample led to the detection of otherwise zzso zzso zzso suggesting that characterization of zzso diversity in a sample only at the time of collection could lead to an zzso of unique zzso Additionally, the rapid increase in the relative abundance of some members of the zzso zzso in our results implies an ecological importance of at least some of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso
