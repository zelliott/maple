We describe a new class of DNA length zzso that is due to a variation in the number of tandem repeats associated with zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso The zzso chain reaction was used to selectively amplify a zzso repeat identified in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso DNA of 41 human subjects, and the size of the amplified products was determined by gel zzso Seven zzso were found that differed in size by zzso of three zzso The zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and the overall zzso index was zzso The zzso zzso repeat was located adjacent to a repetitive sequence of the zzso zzso A zzso search of human zzso DNA sequences for the zzso zzso (at least five members in zzso revealed tandem repeats in six other zzso Three of the six zzso repeats were located adjacent to zzso zzso and two of the three (in the genes for zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso in zzso zzso repetitive sequences found in association with zzso sequences may be frequent sites of length zzso that can be used as genetic markers for gene mapping or linkage zzso
