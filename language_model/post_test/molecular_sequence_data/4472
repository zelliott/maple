Several studies have attempted to identify regions of the zzso class II zzso that participate in signal zzso The importance of intact zzso I-A zzso zzso either to zzso the class II zzso to the zzso or to recruit zzso zzso is now well zzso Recent data have also suggested that zzso of the I-A beta zzso are involved in a second distinct signaling zzso In the light of data suggesting that the second zzso activated on zzso of human and mouse class II molecules may zzso we set out to investigate whether the structural requirements for signaling for the human DR zzso are similar to those already described for the zzso I-A zzso We show that zzso DR class II molecules lacking 12 zzso acids of the zzso zzso tail fail to zzso the protein zzso C alpha zzso zzso and zzso beta II zzso following stimulation with an zzso II zzso In contrast, zzso of either or both zzso zzso of the DR zzso has no effect on class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following class II stimulation has been observed in both human and zzso B zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso is present in human B zzso but absent in resting zzso B zzso zzso we conclude that the DR beta zzso tail is requisite for the principal signaling zzso initiated via zzso class zzso These data suggest that the signaling pathways seen in resting vs primed zzso B cells may also operate in human zzso
