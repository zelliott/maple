zzso is one of two zzso proteins closely related to the zzso segment polarity gene product zzso zzso of zzso zzso neural axis zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso is localized to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 92, zzso 1995; Rubenstein, zzso et zzso zzso zzso 1997, in zzso We have carried out a series of experiments to test whether the nuclear zzso of zzso is required for its zzso zzso Prior to the zzso transition zzso zzso is zzso and concentrated in the cortical regions of zzso after the zzso transition zzso zzso accumulates in embryonic zzso The addition of a zzso zzso zzso does not change the timing of zzso nuclear zzso suggesting that it is anchored in the zzso prior to the zzso zzso Next, we constructed two zzso forms of zzso These are exclusively zzso yet both were as effective at producing a zzso axis zzso as were zzso unfettered forms of zzso Moreover, expression of anchored zzso had no apparent effect on the zzso or nuclear levels of zzso These data indicate that zzso can act zzso to generate a zzso zzso Taken together with the zzso effects of a zzso from of the zzso zzso factor, described by zzso et zzso Cell 86, zzso 1996, we speculate that in the early zzso zzso zzso of zzso (or zzso zzso the activity of zzso or a zzso zzso
