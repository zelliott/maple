The ability of zzso zzso to colonize and compete in the zzso is specially relevant for the zzso application of zzso as zzso zzso are one of the best root zzso and they are widely used in zzso zzso and in soil zzso This study analyses the zzso mechanism of the well-known zzso strain zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso region involved in the zzso filament zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and part of the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso in this region were zzso Several zzso zzso affected in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with reduced zzso properties, were zzso These zzso were completely displaced from the root tip when competing with the zzso zzso strain, indicating that the zzso zzso properties are necessary for competitive root zzso A zzso affected in the zzso gene had longer zzso but the same zzso and colonization properties as the zzso However, in rich medium or in the absence of iron zzso it showed a higher zzso suggesting the possibility of improving competitive root colonization by manipulating the zzso zzso
