In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the zzso gene codes for a zzso protein zzso that is capable of binding zzso and zzso as part of the zzso zzso required for the zzso of zzso In this study, we report the zzso structure of the zzso zzso protein with bound zzso The zzso zzso structure is similar to zzso with known three-dimensional structures and consists of two nearly symmetrical zzso separated by a hinge region where the zzso site zzso zzso analysis of different zzso zzso based on sequence alignments revealed three groups of zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso and soil zzso Even though the zzso zzso are zzso into different groups, the zzso hydrogen bonds are mostly zzso except for zzso zzso zzso A detailed discussion of zzso interactions in the active site is presented and two new zzso zzso and zzso are shown to be part of the zzso zzso
