The evolutionary history of the two structural and functional zzso of zzso is controversial but harbors the secrets of early translation and the genetic zzso To explore the origin and evolution of zzso we reconstructed zzso trees directly from molecular zzso zzso structural characters describing the geometry of zzso zzso and three statistical parameters describing zzso and mechanical features of molecules zzso were used to derive zzso trees of molecules and molecular zzso Trees of molecules failed to group zzso according to zzso acid specificity and did not reveal the zzso nature of life, probably due to loss of zzso signal or because zzso diversification predated zzso zzso Trees of zzso derived from both structural and statistical characters support the origin of zzso in the zzso arm and the hypothesis that the top half domain composed of zzso and zzso zzso arms is more ancient than the bottom half domain composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This constitutes the cornerstone of the zzso tag hypothesis that zzso zzso were ancient zzso in the zzso zzso The trees of zzso suggest a model for the evolution of the major functional and structural components of zzso In this model, short zzso zzso with stems zzso to the zzso arm of present day zzso were extended with regions zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso arm was then incorporated into the resulting zzso structure to form a zzso zzso The variable region was the last structural addition to the molecular repertoire of evolving zzso zzso
