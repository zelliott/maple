In sequencing the zzso chain of zzso 5 zzso from zzso cells, we observed three different human zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso that identified different sequences in the untranslated regions zzso zzso and zzso are almost identical zzso clones with approximately zzso zzso However, they are quite different from zzso in both the zzso zzso and the 3' zzso Development of a zzso zzso to specifically detect two of these different forms of the message led to the observation that they were zzso expressed in various cell zzso The message designated zzso zzso and zzso was absent in zzso and zzso and greatly reduced in zzso but was present in eight other zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was present in all cell lines zzso The cell lines that failed to express the zzso form also failed to express the protein based on both zzso and zzso zzso It appears from this data that there are two zzso of the zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso of the zzso play an important role in regulating translation of the zzso zzso Since zzso 5 is lost in prostate zzso the mechanism of control that results in the translation of the two forms of message may be important in zzso
