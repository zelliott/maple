A zzso DNA zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso by its ability to functionally complement a fur zzso in zzso zzso A fur zzso zzso zzso coli strain that contains multiple copies of the zzso DNA zzso produces a zzso protein which zzso with a zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of a zzso of the zzso DNA zzso identified an open reading frame predicted to zzso a protein zzso identical to zzso coli zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso While there is extensive zzso among these zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso differs markedly at its zzso zzso from all of the other zzso zzso It has been proposed that this region is a zzso domain in zzso coli zzso A positive selection procedure involving the isolation of zzso zzso was used to isolate zzso of strain zzso that produce altered zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso produce zzso and zzso A when grown in zzso of iron that normally repress their zzso A zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso fur gene restores zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso A and zzso production in these zzso zzso
