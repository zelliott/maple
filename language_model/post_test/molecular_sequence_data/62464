zzso zzso zzso zzso III recognizes the zzso of an zzso zzso with little sequence zzso In contrast, baker zzso zzso III zzso selectively recognizes zzso zzso even when they are attached to a zzso DNA zzso To comprehend the general mechanism of zzso III zzso recognition, we mapped the zzso binding signal and directly compared its zzso specificity to that of both zzso coli zzso III and zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso bound but did not cleave long zzso duplexes without zzso zzso whereas zzso III zzso zzso all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso duplexes with some preferences for zzso zzso stems under zzso zzso zzso radical zzso indicate that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso zzso and its surrounding zzso In contrast, zzso interaction with zzso zzso was weak and largely zzso Certain duality of zzso recognition was exhibited by zzso but not by bacterial zzso zzso zzso coli zzso III recognized zzso duplexes longer than 11 zzso with little zzso and no specific features were required for zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso long, but not short, zzso duplexes with little sequence zzso zzso zzso of zzso stems shorter than 27 zzso was dependent on the presence of an zzso internal loop two zzso upstream of the zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso zzso have two recognition mechanisms, one that uses specific structural features and another that recognizes general features of the zzso zzso zzso
