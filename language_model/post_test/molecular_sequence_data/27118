zzso I zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso specifically zzso the zzso stage of zzso zzso in zzso It contains six zzso zzso forming three zzso bridges and belongs to the zzso of natural peptides containing the inhibitor zzso knot zzso zzso We produced the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso to examine the mechanism of action of zzso The zzso toxins were consistently produced as two zzso peptides zzso and zzso with different retention properties but identical zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso single quantum correlation zzso revealed that although zzso was highly zzso zzso does not have a stable three-dimensional zzso We used zzso zzso fragmentation of the peptides with a zzso laser zzso tandem zzso flight mass zzso to further investigate the structure of the native peptides in its natural form and produced in zzso zzso The fragmentation zzso of the native peptides were very complex due to the occurrence in the spectrum of zzso resulting from zzso zzso of fragments through a zzso bridge and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso bridges and zzso multiple neutral zzso The tandem mass zzso fragmentation pattern of zzso was similar to that of the natural zzso isolated from crude zzso but zzso had a clearly distinct fragmentation pattern, more closely resembling the fragmentation zzso of reduced and zzso zzso zzso zzso could be attributed to specific fragments by comparing zzso between the zzso and selected zzso with point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso connections in zzso differed from those of the native zzso and showed a rare zzso bridge between zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a very limited fragmentation pattern when analyzed in positive mode but displayed much more fragmentation in negative mode pointing out the importance of the zzso zzso in the fragmentation of zzso Using the reductive zzso zzso promoted strongly in source zzso fragmentation of the peptides in zzso zzso Our findings illustrated the critical role of the electronic environment around the central zzso zzso in zzso in internal fragmentation of the zzso
