In this study, by the generation of a specific zzso zzso we identified zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), a novel zzso zzso that is mostly confined to human natural killer zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that, upon sodium zzso treatment, becomes zzso zzso and associates to zzso zzso 2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is located on human zzso 19 and encodes a novel member of the zzso family characterized by three zzso zzso zzso (one zzso zzso and two zzso and a classical zzso zzso zzso motif zzso in the zzso zzso The highest zzso acid sequence similarity has been found with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Similar to other zzso zzso zzso appears to mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso
