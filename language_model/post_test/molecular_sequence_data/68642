zzso V was zzso in the presence of a high concentration of calcium and the structure refined at zzso A zzso The zzso are zzso zzso with three molecules per zzso unit and zzso zzso reflecting a tendency of zzso to form zzso The overall structure of the protein is similar to that seen in other crystal zzso There are, however, significant changes in domain III, where a new calcium site is zzso The whole region surrounding this site is reorganized in our structure, rendering zzso V more symmetrical and more alike zzso zzso The formation of the new calcium site causes the displacement of zzso from a buried to an exposed zzso a change that has recently been demonstrated by zzso zzso The affinity of the different potential calcium sites is zzso there is no calcium bound in zzso II and IV, while up to two secondary calcium zzso sites (in zzso I and zzso can substitute, depending on the calcium concentration zzso We suggest that zzso can act as a calcium zzso binding or releasing calcium depending on its local zzso Our results also show that zzso displays inherent mobility which, together with its capacity to zzso the calcium affinity of its sites, can be of importance for its function on the membrane zzso
