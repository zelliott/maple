zzso in DNA repair gene may alter an zzso DNA repair capacity and be associated with the risk of various zzso This study was designed to investigate whether zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affect individual zzso to zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and gastric cardiac zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso patients zzso zzso healthy controls and 262 zzso patients zzso zzso healthy controls in a high zzso region of northern China, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by the method of zzso chain reaction zzso detection reaction zzso and zzso chain reaction restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis, zzso 

Family history of upper gastrointestinal zzso zzso may increase the risk of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso patients were not significantly different from that in their respective controls zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the risk of zzso in nonsmokers zzso gender and family history of zzso adjusted odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso was associated with the overall risk of zzso and zzso when compared with the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may reduce the risk of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was not associated with the risk of zzso and zzso in a population of a zzso region in northern zzso
