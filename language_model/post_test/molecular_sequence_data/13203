zzso oxide zzso has been implicated as a zzso zzso in a variety of central nervous system zzso disease states, including the animal model of multiple sclerosis zzso and experimental allergic zzso We have examined zzso brain zzso collected from patients previously diagnosed with zzso as well as zzso collected from the brains of patients dying without zzso Both Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso NO zzso zzso zzso was present in the brain zzso from zzso patients but was absent in equivalent zzso from normal zzso We have also performed experiments identifying the cell type responsible for zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso for the presence of the NO reaction product zzso to demonstrate the presence of a protein zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso was zzso in the brains of zzso of the zzso zzso from seven zzso patients examined but in none of the three normal zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments also demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso of cells that also expressed the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso lineage zzso Additionally, specific labeling of cells was observed when brain zzso from zzso patients were exposed to zzso zzso with zzso zzso but was significantly less plentiful in brain tissue from patients without zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso one of the zzso responsible for the production of zzso is expressed at significant levels in the brains of patients with zzso and may contribute to the pathology associated with the zzso
