A 13 zzso acid zzso corresponding to a potent zzso mouse T cell zzso of zzso egg zzso zzso was zzso zzso at five sites in the d zzso of zzso zzso The resulting zzso proteins were unable to expand T cells capable of being zzso by the zzso zzso and induced T cell populations which either failed to respond or responded at a low level to a normally highly zzso zzso T cell zzso that was present in all zzso The results suggested that substitution of a T cell zzso in zzso may alter the processing of the resulting zzso
