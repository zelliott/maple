zzso P zzso P) is involved in regulation of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which belongs to a class of zzso located in the zzso strand to verified protein coding regions, was cloned for further use in zzso P zzso zzso coli zzso P zzso in zzso of zzso zzso show two zzso sites, one major and one minor in terms of zzso The same result was observed with a partially zzso zzso zzso zzso P activity, both at 30 degrees C and 37 degrees zzso These latter cells are normally grown at 30 degrees zzso zzso of the secondary structure of zzso zzso in zzso show the zzso sites are zzso zzso P recognition zzso A relatively small amount of zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is increased in amount in strains that are deficient in zzso P zzso A deletion of 10 zzso in the zzso gene that does not overlap with the gene coding for a protein zzso in the sense strand shows no defective growth in zzso or zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso P and does not appear as a direct consequence of separate regulatory effects of the zzso on zzso
