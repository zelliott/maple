Cellular zzso of organic zzso is zzso in large part by a gene family of membrane zzso called zzso zzso To study the structural zzso and evolutionary development of the zzso family, we have cloned and functionally characterized a highly expressed zzso primitive zzso from the liver of the small skate, Raja zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso was obtained that encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso The characteristics of this novel skate zzso including tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor selectivity were generally similar to zzso human zzso and rat zzso However, sequence comparisons with other zzso indicate that this skate zzso shares only approximately zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso and with human zzso Further computer analysis revealed that the highest zzso acid identities reside in the first external zzso and internal zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso and 11 zzso We propose that the zzso regions of the zzso zzso family may be critical structural zzso of zzso specificity and zzso
