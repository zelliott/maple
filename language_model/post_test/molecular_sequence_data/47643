Based on protein sequence data and zzso a full length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to the zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso referred to as zzso are characteristic fruit and flower zzso in most members of the zzso which fail to zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed zzso to previously published zzso sequences and exhibited high identity to sequences of several zzso zzso of tobacco and tomato zzso The open reading frame encodes a zzso of 489 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The corresponding zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein displayed identical zzso specificity compared to the native zzso zzso from zzso zzso cell suspension zzso In addition to the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso of zzso zzso in plants, of which the corresponding zzso has been cloned and zzso The results are discussed in relation to molecular evolution of plant zzso zzso
