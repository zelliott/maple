A zzso II zzso zzso analogue containing the zzso p zzso zzso in the sixth position was used to identify zzso sites of the rat zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso bound the zzso expressed in zzso cells with high affinity zzso zzso zzso and was as potent as zzso in the zzso production of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the specific formation of a zzso zzso zzso complex of 60 zzso zzso of the 60 zzso complex with zzso zzso generated a zzso of 17 zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex with zzso zzso produced a short zzso of 4 zzso corresponding to fragments zzso zzso or zzso zzso treatment of the zzso and zzso fragments yielded 2 zzso fragments, defining the zzso site to zzso zzso zzso of the fourth zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to a significant decrease in the overall yield of zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that position 6 of zzso normally occupied by zzso would interact with zzso and/or zzso of the fourth zzso domain of the zzso zzso This information should be of significant value in the study of the interactions between zzso and its zzso zzso
