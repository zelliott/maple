Recent published studies indicate a possible role for zzso in the development of zzso 

The objective of the study was to investigate the expression and regulation of zzso a recently described novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

The studies included a zzso comparative analysis of the zzso locus of zzso across zzso zzso an assessment of zzso zzso in human and zzso cells and zzso an analysis of zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso an evaluation of the effect of zzso on zzso expression in zzso and a comparison of zzso zzso expression between zzso complicated by zzso and control zzso 

zzso emerged as an alternate transcript of zzso late in evolution with the zzso of an zzso sequence into the zzso zzso after the emergence of the zzso zzso about 40 million years zzso zzso is particularly abundant in human zzso and zzso and is also highly expressed in nonhuman zzso zzso The expressed protein has a zzso zzso tail and, like reference sequence zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso with a role in zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso expression in isolated zzso and a zzso cell line, and differentiation into zzso further enhances the effect of zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso transcripts are significantly elevated in patients with zzso compared with normal zzso We speculate that zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso
