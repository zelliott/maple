zzso zzso zzso is a zzso transport protein in the outer membrane of zzso coli with binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of starch by bacteria was found to inhibit swarming of zzso coli in soft zzso zzso the zzso was dependent on the zzso affinity of zzso On the basis of this zzso zzso zzso techniques were developed for the isolation and analysis of zzso with an altered zzso zzso Fifteen zzso zzso generated by zzso and zzso zzso as well as spontaneous zzso were zzso The effects of the zzso on starch and zzso as well as transport zzso were zzso zzso that affect zzso near 8 to 18, 74 to 82, and 118 to 121 were found to affect starch binding and zzso functions zzso confirming and extending previous results with zzso at these zzso zzso and insertions in two previously undefined regions in the zzso in or near zzso zzso and zzso also resulted in defects in zzso functions and indicate that zzso parts of the protein also contribute to the zzso binding and pore zzso There was a zzso transport zzso in all zzso zzso and one zzso caused zzso pore blocking towards both zzso and zzso The highly zzso zzso zzso site was affected by zzso near zzso 9 and 10 and zzso as well as previously established regions near zzso 18, 148 to zzso 245 to zzso and 380 to zzso The significance of these zzso is discussed in the context of a model of the functional zzso of zzso The additional role of regions near zzso 10 and 120 in zzso zzso as well as starch zzso was suggested by the zzso zzso of zzso in strains with one- or zzso zzso at these zzso
