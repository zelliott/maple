A zzso substance, designated zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso culture zzso and the gene zzso the zzso was zzso Both native and zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli significantly activated human V beta zzso and V beta zzso T cells in association with major zzso complex zzso class II molecules on accessory cells, indicating that zzso possesses zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of two segments zzso a signal zzso and a mature 25 zzso protein composed of 212 zzso zzso Three of 34 zzso zzso strains but none of 28 zzso zzso strains examined carried zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso belongs to a family distinct from established bacterial zzso zzso showed around zzso zzso with other zzso at the zzso acid sequence zzso The zzso structure of zzso was predicted by zzso onto zzso zzso zzso C and zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which share highly zzso zzso zzso zzso showed overall structural similarity to both these zzso This is the first study to characterize fully a bacterial zzso from zzso zzso
