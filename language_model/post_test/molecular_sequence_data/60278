The molecular basis of zzso membrane fusion in the pancreatic zzso cell was investigated using an in zzso zzso that measures both zzso zzso membrane fusion and zzso zzso These two fusion events were zzso sensitive to zzso suggesting that they are controlled by different zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso treatment of the plasma zzso caused zzso of zzso 2, the zzso zzso of this zzso but did not affect zzso 4, the zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso 3, the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of plasma zzso abolished zzso membrane fusion, whereas toxin treatment of the zzso reduced zzso membrane fusion and abolished zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso 2 but caused only a small reduction in both zzso membrane fusion and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso 2 is the zzso that mediates fusion between zzso zzso and the zzso plasma membrane of the zzso zzso zzso 3 mediates zzso fusion, which might be involved in compound zzso In contrast, the major zzso on the zzso zzso remains to be zzso
