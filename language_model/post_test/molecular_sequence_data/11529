zzso amplification has been applied to a zzso zzso region of zzso 21 that has been associated with some features of Down syndrome zzso Identification of the majority of genes from this region will facilitate the correlation of the zzso of particular genes with specific zzso of zzso Over 100 gene fragments have been isolated from this zzso zzso zzso The zzso have been characterized by sequence analysis, comparison with public databases and expansion to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso 21 has been determined by zzso to zzso Southern blots and to zzso and zzso clones representing the zzso This has resulted in a higher resolution physical map with a marker approximately every 25 zzso This integrated physical and transcript map will be valuable for fine mapping of DNA from individuals with partial zzso of zzso 21 as well as for assessing and ultimately generating a complete gene map of this segment of the zzso
