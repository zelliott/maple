This report discusses the identification of a zzso and zzso protein of zzso zzso that is abundant in zzso zzso and in zzso from zzso to stage zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso onto zzso and zzso with zzso or zzso The resulting zzso showed binding of both zzso to a zzso designated zzso zzso extraction of zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso to be a zzso zzso When zzso was isolated from zzso zzso by ammonium zzso zzso zzso and zzso it zzso with zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso closely resembled the reported composition of zzso 1 and the molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso 115 zzso corresponded to reported values for zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analyses of five peptides derived from zzso yielded zzso identity to the reported sequence of zzso 1, deduced from the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso Based on these findings, zzso was identified as zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso 1 is the major storage protein for zinc in mature zzso and developing zzso of zzso zzso
