zzso zzso is a recently identified protein precursor zzso by an zzso zzso It is specifically taken up by the zzso and processed to a mature protein that assembles into functional zzso zzso The full mature zzso protein and its zzso zzso were produced to study structural and functional zzso They yielded high quality zzso from zzso solutions which zzso up to zzso zzso zzso The zzso structures of the two proteins resulted very similar to that of human zzso to which they have high level of sequence identity zzso zzso zzso sites were identified in the native zzso and in those soaked in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso center binds zzso iron at the sites A and B, and the structures showed that the A site was always fully occupied by zzso zzso or zzso while the occupancy of the B site was zzso In addition, distinct zzso and zzso sites were found in the zzso axes to block the zzso zzso Other zzso sites, never observed before in zzso were found on the cavity surface near the zzso center and near the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso properties remarkably similar to those of human zzso except for the difficulty in zzso to yield zzso shells and for a reduced ( approximately zzso rate in zzso zzso This was partially rescued by the substitution of the zzso zzso with Ala, which occurs in zzso The zzso is exposed on a channel that connects the zzso center with the zzso The finding that the zzso increased both zzso activity and the occupancy of the B site demonstrated that the channel is functionally zzso In conclusion, the present data define the structure of human zzso zzso and provide new data on the iron pathways within the zzso zzso zzso
