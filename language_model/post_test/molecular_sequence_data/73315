zzso analysis of the proteins bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 11, which were isolated from the latter, resulted in two dominant zzso weight zzso which were referred to as zzso and zzso After zzso of these proteins zzso against the zzso and zzso protein of zzso zzso were zzso Both proteins bound to the surface of zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso of whole cells of zzso zzso and zzso zzso With cells of the zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 11 no specific labeling was zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso and the zzso protein were zzso We found significant zzso between the sequences of the investigated zzso The use of zzso zzso based on the zzso sequences of the zzso protein from zzso zzso to identify the corresponding structural genes in various zzso libraries zzso
