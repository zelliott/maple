The zzso cassette (ABC) proteins play an important role in drug resistance and zzso in various zzso Here we isolated zzso a new member of the zzso resistance zzso zzso of ABC proteins in zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso acid identity to its most closely related zzso zzso which was previously isolated from the same zzso zzso that zzso zzso showed significant resistance to zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso was relatively higher in the log phase than the stationary phase, and a lower zzso of zzso was observed in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in zzso of zzso but functionally different from zzso
