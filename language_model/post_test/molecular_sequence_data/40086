zzso provides a possible solution to the severe shortage of zzso organ zzso The zzso which shares many zzso similarities with humans, makes it an optimal species for zzso zzso and clinical zzso zzso 2 zzso is a potent growth factor zzso primarily by T helper zzso and it is vital to the cellular expansion required for a productive immune response and the development and peripheral expansion of zzso regulatory T zzso zzso it is essential to understand of the zzso of zzso between pigs and zzso 

We first compared the zzso and protein sequences and the crystal structures of human and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso to induce T cell proliferation was determined by zzso incorporation and cell cycle zzso 

zzso zzso induced very limited proliferation of human zzso while it functioned well on zzso zzso Human zzso had remarkably reduced effects on zzso zzso whereas it worked well on human zzso 

Our present study showed that the interaction of zzso and zzso across species might have zzso Together with the wide zzso functions of zzso our data indicated that zzso disorders could be caused by the poor function of zzso donor zzso on host cells in full zzso zzso Our data suggested an additional potential advantage for the mixed zzso zzso
