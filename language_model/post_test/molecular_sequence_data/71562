The zzso of zzso to tobacco zzso cells deprived of zzso for 3 d induced cells to zzso re-enter the cell cycle from a zzso zzso Though the addition of zzso to zzso tobacco zzso cells also induced cell division zzso et zzso zzso some major differences were observed between these two zzso zzso cells lost the ability to re-enter the cell cycle after prolonged periods of zzso zzso but in contrast retained this ability after longer periods in the absence of zzso By differential zzso screening we identified a zzso gene zzso zzso was rapidly induced by the addition of zzso with transcript levels starting to decrease by the start of DNA zzso zzso does not share any significant zzso with any gene with known functions over its full zzso However, the zzso shared some zzso with plasma membrane zzso suggesting that it may be involved in some process of zzso zzso of the zzso gene product revealed that it rapidly accumulated in the zzso prior to the start of zzso and nuclear DNA zzso These results are discussed in relation to the role of zzso in inducing plant cell zzso
