zzso formation of zzso zzso of prion protein zzso requires targeting zzso by zzso zzso zzso anchors to zzso zzso zzso zzso the cellular zzso of prion protein zzso to zzso pits by creating zzso zzso molecules with four different zzso zzso zzso prevented the formation of zzso To determine if these zzso zzso segments prevented zzso from zzso into zzso by altering the structure of the zzso we fused the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso segments differing by a single zzso direct the zzso protein to zzso pits or the zzso form to zzso zzso was formed from zzso zzso but not from zzso zzso Our findings argue that zzso formation is restricted to a specific zzso compartment and as such, it is likely to involve auxiliary zzso found within zzso
