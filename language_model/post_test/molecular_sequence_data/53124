zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of a zzso zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of complex zzso via zzso We have cloned the zzso DNA which encodes the human zzso gene ( zzso ) and analyzed its zzso It was found that the gene consists of at least nine zzso spanning more than a 50 zzso zzso region, and the coding sequence is divided into eight zzso The translation initiation zzso was located at zzso 2, and thus zzso 1 encodes only zzso zzso zzso initiation site of zzso was determined by zzso amplification of the zzso end and a zzso analysis using the total zzso isolated from zzso cells, which have a high level of zzso zzso We then characterized the zzso promoter region by a reporter gene zzso The zzso reporter zzso indicated that the zzso region of zzso 1, which covered about 1 zzso zzso the promoter activity in zzso zzso This region contains potential binding sites for some zzso factors, such as zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso sequences found in zzso and the zzso for the zzso suggest the presence of an additional zzso at the upstream of the first zzso identified in this study, and therefore, the zzso of the gene would be regulated by multiple zzso
