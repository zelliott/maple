The zzso gene is similarly zzso in zzso zzso from both healthy elderly people and patients with zzso arthritis zzso because of impaired zzso activity of the zzso sequence in its promoter zzso Other genes important for the zzso cell function may share that sequence and may be similarly regulated and zzso We searched zzso for possible zzso zzso and then compared zzso activities of the respective genes in the zzso cells of young and older healthy individuals and those with zzso by real-time zzso We show here that genes zzso one of the zinc finger proteins zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and the zzso adapter protein zzso contain sequences with various zzso zzso degrees of zzso to the zzso sequence near their zzso These genes are transcribed in human zzso zzso the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso are significantly decreased in a correlated manner in the cells of patients with zzso compared with those of healthy zzso In zzso patients, the extremely reduced expression of zzso does not depend on the zzso age, apparently zzso a zzso zzso whereas that of zzso and zzso occurs mostly in the cells of relatively younger patients, making them similar to the zzso of healthy elderly in this zzso
