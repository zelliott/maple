We isolated a zzso clone for zzso zzso from fetal bovine skeletal muscle using a DNA zzso of human zzso zzso 2 as a zzso The complete coding sequence of zzso as well as the zzso and part of the zzso sequences zzso and 66 zzso zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequence predicted from the zzso sequence was in agreement with that determined in the zzso protein from adult bovine cardiac muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso except for eight zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When the zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter, zzso was zzso as a functionally active zzso which bound molecular oxygen zzso The amount of zzso reached nearly zzso of the total zzso protein in the zzso zzso sequence analysis of the produced zzso revealed a zzso zzso at the zzso indicating that as in native muscle the zzso Met was removed in zzso by zzso
