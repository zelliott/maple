zzso zzso cells of human prostate contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has not been identified, but like the zzso it is lost in the early stages of zzso zzso 

zzso exchange and affinity zzso were used to purify zzso from human prostate zzso zzso zzso was used to remove zzso zzso zzso The core protein was isolated using zzso gel zzso zzso zzso with zzso and identified by zzso mass zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was detected as a broad zzso on Western blots with an apparent molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was susceptible to zzso with zzso II and zzso zzso F defining it as highly zzso and zzso to the core zzso The core protein was identified, following zzso and zzso as zzso and subsequently confirmed by Western zzso using an zzso zzso 

The zzso associated with zzso in normal prostate zzso is zzso While the role of zzso in zzso zzso is well established, its function in the prostate zzso process is not zzso It's potential to facilitate packaging of zzso in zzso to act as a tumor zzso and to mark the early stages of zzso transformation warrant further zzso
