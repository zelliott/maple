Like all zzso yet tested, the zzso zzso zzso contains a reverse zzso Here we show that it contains also a DNA zzso The genes zzso and zzso zzso the two zzso of a DNA zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso The zzso zzso II DNA zzso A zzso is more similar to zzso zzso zzso A zzso than to zzso zzso IV zzso zzso C zzso The difference is especially striking at the zzso domain, which zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso DNA zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso and zzso to zzso using a zzso zzso This zzso DNA zzso has an optimal activity around zzso degrees zzso In contrast to plasmids from zzso zzso which are from relaxed to positively zzso we found that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso became positively zzso after addition of zzso to cell cultures, indicating that its negative zzso is due to the DNA zzso of the host zzso The findings concerning DNA zzso and negative zzso in zzso put into question the role of reverse zzso in zzso
