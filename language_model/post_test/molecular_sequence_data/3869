The zzso salmonella zzso zzso encodes a tail protein with a high degree of sequence similarity to the tail protein of the biologically unrelated zzso salmonella zzso zzso The zzso tail gene is flanked by an upstream region that contains a promoter and a downstream region that contains a putative zzso zzso zzso giving it a cassette or modular structure almost identical to the structure of the tail genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso It now appears that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are very closely related but have different tail fiber zzso giving them different host zzso
