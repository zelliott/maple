In zzso cells, the zzso apparatus receives newly zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso and delivers them after zzso modification to their destination in the zzso These proteins move from the inside zzso face to the zzso side zzso of the zzso through a stack of zzso towards the zzso network zzso but very little is known about how proteins are moved through the zzso zzso In a model known as the maturation model, no special transport process was considered necessary, with protein movement along the zzso being achieved by maturation of the zzso zzso proteins could be transported by zzso or membrane zzso Although little is known about zzso zzso the molecular mechanism for zzso transport is quite well zzso occurring through zzso of zzso on the zzso with those on the target zzso We have now identified a protein of relative molecular mass zzso which is associated with the zzso zzso The zzso domain of this protein or zzso raised against it zzso inhibit transport in zzso from the zzso to the zzso acting at a stage between the zzso and the zzso This zzso which behaves like a zzso and has been named zzso (for zzso zzso of zzso is identical to zzso a protein implicated earlier in zzso zzso Our results suggest that protein movement from zzso to the zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso
