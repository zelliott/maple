A zzso protein predicted by the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene contains a domain that bears a striking resemblance to a family of zzso zzso characterized by the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso Previous work indicated that the product of the zzso gene is required for zzso and that zzso assembly does not occur in its zzso However, its precise role in zzso and the nature of its zzso activity remained zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso we cloned the gene by zzso of a zzso zzso and determined its DNA zzso We discuss here the possible roles for an zzso zzso in zzso and for the activity of the zzso zzso
