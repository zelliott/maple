zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a widespread distribution in the insect nervous zzso zzso zzso and/or regulates various behavioral patterns of insects as a zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso belong to one of the families of G zzso receptors zzso The binding of zzso to zzso is coupled to the zzso of the specific G zzso which zzso the release of zzso second zzso such as zzso and/or zzso We previously reported the isolation of an zzso zzso from zzso zzso In the study presented here, five zzso zzso were constructed with a point zzso in the putative binding zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to retain the zzso response to zzso as does the zzso zzso but such function was impaired in the other four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, competition binding zzso using zzso and calcium zzso zzso gave results that were approximately consistent with those of the zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicate that zzso and zzso are involved in the binding and zzso of zzso with zzso through zzso or hydrogen bond zzso but zzso does not appear to participate in this zzso zzso seems to be involved in one of the active forms of zzso These findings should prove helpful in designing new zzso control zzso
