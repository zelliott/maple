Ion channels formed by the zzso zzso A in zzso zzso zzso have been reported to react very sensitively upon zzso of the membrane by zzso radiation zzso by zzso light zzso or by visible light in the presence of appropriate zzso zzso zzso In all three cases the effect is due to the presence of the four zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of these zzso zzso to an interaction with free zzso formed upon water zzso or due to light zzso been found to reduce the membrane zzso by many orders of zzso The present study was intended to correlate functional changes, observed at the level of single zzso channels, with changes of the molecular structure identified by mass zzso About zzso of the zzso channels showed a single-channel zzso of virtually zero, while about zzso of the channels present before zzso are converted to a state of reduced zzso (and reduced zzso On the structural level, zzso in the presence of the zzso Rose Bengal was found to produce zzso and fragmentation of the zzso at the positions of the zzso zzso Our results provide evidence that the main effect of zzso or of zzso treatment, is the zzso of the zzso backbone leading to immediate closure of an open zzso zzso
