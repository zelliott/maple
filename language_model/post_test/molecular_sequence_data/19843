zzso zzso is the most extensively studied zzso cassette (ABC) coded by zzso zzso To date, 29 single zzso zzso zzso have been zzso but only zzso zzso has been correlated with zzso zzso expression levels and shown to influence the zzso of orally taken drugs that are zzso zzso zzso zzso for the T zzso have more than fourfold lower zzso expression compared with zzso zzso We developed a one step primer based zzso specific zzso method to detect zzso at zzso to investigate the distribution of this zzso in the local zzso 

DNA was extracted from 5 zzso of whole blood using standard zzso zzso zzso were designed specific to 3' end which amplify the zzso of zzso The method was validated by direct DNA zzso Seven hundred and zzso healthy blood donors zzso of three major ethnic groups in Malaysia were recruited and DNA subjected to zzso of zzso using this zzso 

The method was found to be robust and zzso in detecting zzso of zzso zzso variations in zzso and zzso frequency were observed in zzso among the ethnic zzso In comparison to both the Caucasians and the other Asian countries, the Malay and Chinese showed a higher frequency of zzso C zzso while the Indian exhibits a lower frequency zzso similar to other Indian zzso 

Using a new simple method to investigate the distribution of zzso we found that the zzso frequency of zzso showed zzso between the different ethnic groups within the Malaysian zzso
