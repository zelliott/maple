We zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level zzso to zzso and at the protein level zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cultures highly enriched in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso positive zzso prepared from newborn rat cerebral zzso cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso percentage of zzso positive zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso and zzso For comparison, we also determined zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in different brain zzso By Northern zzso analysis zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in primary rat cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of low level of zzso proteins of the same size of those identified in zzso as zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes varied depending on the brain area used as starting material for the preparation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were mainly expressed in cortical cultures, while zzso expression predominated in zzso derived zzso Interestingly this pattern of expression zzso with that observed in the intact brain, where high levels of zzso zzso and low levels of the other zzso zzso were found in the zzso In conclusion our results confirm the existence of zzso zzso receptors of the zzso type in primary zzso cultures and suggest that zzso is the main zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells of the central nervous zzso
