We have studied the role and regulation of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso an abundant and environmentally relevant freshwater zzso A zzso 1 zzso zzso and promoter region was cloned from zzso liver and the zzso expressed in zzso zzso The translated protein displayed 51% and 50% zzso acid identity to zzso zzso zzso We identified two zzso zzso binding motifs for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso displayed a strong preference towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and lesser activity towards the zzso zzso zzso Based on sequence identity and zzso preferences, the zzso was classified as zzso zzso zzso expression was highest in the liver and kidney with low levels expressed in brain, zzso and zzso zzso males displayed higher zzso zzso zzso expression compared to zzso Analysis of the promoter region revealed several putative half zzso zzso response elements zzso
