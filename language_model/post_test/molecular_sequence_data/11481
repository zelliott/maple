Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for a zzso major zzso protein zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso 409 was zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso reacted with zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic observation revealed that zzso zzso zzso 409 possessed zzso thin zzso on their zzso zzso electron zzso also demonstrated that zzso zzso bound to the zzso examined with the gold particles arranged along the zzso array originating from the cell surface of the zzso These findings suggested that zzso zzso zzso was identifiable as another zzso zzso zzso zzso different from the zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of a zzso Using zzso zzso synthesis technology, 102 sequential overlapping peptides covering the entire zzso zzso stretch of zzso zzso were zzso Seven zzso regions within zzso zzso protein zzso which definitely reacted with the serum of patients with zzso diseases, were zzso
