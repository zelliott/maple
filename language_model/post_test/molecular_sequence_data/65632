zzso is an extensively used zzso zzso in agricultural and residential areas and has been routinely detected in many surface and ground zzso This study reveals various zzso and zzso genes associated with hypoxic stress in zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae zzso by using restriction zzso differential zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated zzso and zzso zzso expressions decreased by 36 and zzso respectively, in zzso exposed to zzso at 1 zzso for zzso zzso zzso gene expression was associated with elevated oxygen consumption in zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso at 1 zzso increased their oxygen consumption by zzso whereas zzso exposed to zzso at 1000 zzso for zzso increased their oxygen consumption by zzso Our study demonstrates for the first time that zzso at environmentally relevant zzso can elevate zzso possibly zzso zzso measures at the zzso level to adapt to oxygen zzso in an ecologically important aquatic zzso Our results further suggest that the ability to zzso both the quantity and quality of zzso serves as an zzso response to counteract the initial onset of oxygen zzso induced by zzso in zzso
