Plants integrate different regulatory signals to control their growth and zzso Although a number of zzso observations suggest that there is zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as with zzso zzso the molecular basis for this hormonal zzso remains largely zzso Here, we show that zzso transport is reduced in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso and zzso We further show that this reduced zzso transport zzso with a reduction in the abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso plants and that zzso protein levels recover to zzso levels following zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the regulation of zzso protein levels cannot be explained by a zzso regulation of the zzso genes but that zzso zzso zzso at least in the case of zzso the targeting of zzso proteins for zzso zzso In genetic studies, we reveal that the reduced zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso with an impairment in two zzso growth zzso zzso zzso differentiation and root zzso zzso Our study thus presents evidence for a role of zzso in these growth responses and for a zzso zzso of zzso turnover that may be zzso for these differential growth zzso
