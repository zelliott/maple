zzso zzso is one of the four member zzso family of zzso factors identified by their ability to enforce skeletal muscle differentiation upon a wide variety of zzso cell zzso In this study the mouse zzso zzso gene was disrupted by targeted zzso Animals zzso for the zzso zzso a deletion of the functionally essential zzso domain, displayed defective zzso zzso and rib pattern formation, and they died at zzso zzso in zzso between zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso provided evidence for three distinct zzso regulatory programs zzso in the zzso which correlate temporally and zzso with three waves of cellular recruitment to the expanding zzso The first program zzso marked initially by zzso expression and followed by zzso began on schedule in the zzso zzso at day 8 post zzso zzso A second program zzso was highly deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal expansion of the zzso zzso Moreover, expression of downstream zzso zzso including zzso which is a candidate regulator of zzso zzso did not occur zzso The onset of zzso expression around zzso in zzso zzso marks a third zzso program zzso the execution of which was somewhat delayed in zzso zzso zzso but ultimately led to extensive zzso in the zzso By zzso it appeared to have largely compensated for the defective zzso program in zzso zzso zzso zzso animals also showed improper rib pattern formation perhaps due to the absence of signals from cells expressing the zzso zzso Finally, a later and relatively mild zzso was detected in zzso muscles of newborn zzso
