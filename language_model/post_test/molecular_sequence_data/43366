zzso is a zinc finger protein that was thought to be restricted to zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso active zzso cells but not in terminally zzso zzso We report here the isolation of a novel form of zzso which we show is also expressed in zzso zzso Most unexpectedly, we find both forms in zzso where a surprising zzso pattern was zzso While zzso zzso expression occurs in zzso active germ cells, protein was not detected until the zzso stage, where zzso localized to the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Near the end of zzso zzso also accumulated in the zzso and zzso sheath surrounding the zzso zzso a perfect zzso acid zzso zzso targeting sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Shore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso Moreover, three distinct zzso zzso zzso gave this unusual pattern of zzso zzso zzso which was confirmed by cell zzso zzso Our findings suggest a unique role for zzso in zzso within the developing zzso and a role for one of the protein forms in germ cell zzso zzso Its zzso with the zzso suggests that it may also perform a special function during or shortly after zzso
