The structural gene for translation initiation factor zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with extensive zzso within its G domain and C zzso with the equivalent regions of zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region does not display any significant zzso to other known zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a single protein which zzso with zzso to zzso coli zzso and was able to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is distinguished from all other zzso by a sequence of 160 zzso near the N zzso that has an unusual zzso made up essentially of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Within this zzso the pattern zzso is repeated nine zzso Complete deletion of this sequence did not affect the zzso function in initiation of translation and even increased its capacity to complement the zzso coli zzso zzso
