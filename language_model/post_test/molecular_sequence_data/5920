To identify essential molecules capable of inducing terminal zzso maturation and cell death of zzso zzso cells, we isolated zzso clones by functional expression cloning using a library constructed from zzso zzso acid zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso which induced zzso changes in zzso cells from zzso cells to mature zzso zzso were zzso The isolated positive zzso clone was demonstrated to zzso an zzso zzso for zzso c zzso zzso derived from a zzso gene zzso When zzso was expressed in zzso cells with the zzso switch system, zzso cell zzso became zzso after zzso incubation with zzso and cell death was observed after 3 zzso Also, high molecular weight DNA fragmentation was observed after 36 hours in zzso Similar results were observed using zzso from human zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was transcribed in both zzso and zzso systems, and also in human blood zzso zzso Following zzso with zzso c zzso expression zzso zzso high molecular weight DNA fragmentation in zzso cells and zzso cells was inhibited in these zzso These results indicate that zzso changes in zzso cells and the process of cell death may be induced by zzso respiratory zzso and also that the zzso gene zzso may be used as one of the candidates for gene supplementation therapy for the acute zzso
