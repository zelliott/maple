Several zzso B and T cell zzso of the zzso zzso blood stage zzso zzso a vaccine candidate, are located in the central zzso and zzso zzso zzso repeat regions of the zzso Here we have attempted to functionally analyze human T cell responses to some of the T cell zzso For this purpose short synthetic peptides corresponding to these zzso were used to study the induction of in zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and B cell help for zzso zzso In individual malaria immune donors these different T cell activities were not zzso The findings emphasize the importance of examining multiple parameters of T cell zzso when zzso the total proportion of individuals responding to a defined zzso zzso zzso was expressed in activated T cells of donors who had elevated serum zzso of zzso to the zzso used for T cell zzso These results suggest the involvement of zzso producing T helper cells in the induction of zzso specific zzso production in individuals in which immunity has been induced by natural zzso Taken together, these findings also suggest that functionally distinct zzso T cells occur in humans similarly to what has been described in zzso In further experiments, we have also attempted to establish zzso class II restriction of the immune response to these zzso at the level of the donor zzso When studying zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso derived peptides and some of the T cell responses could be paired within the twin pairs, indicating a genetic regulation of their B cell zzso Whether or not this regulation reflects zzso class II zzso or other factors needs to be zzso
