Motor zzso make synaptic connections with specific muscles, and this specificity unfolds during development as zzso growth cones make specific zzso choices and ultimately recognize and zzso on their specific muscle zzso The zzso clueless zzso was identified previously in a genetic screen for zzso that disrupt zzso guidance and zzso We show here that clueless is zzso to zzso The abrupt gene is required for the embryonic formation of specific synaptic connections between a subset of zzso and a subset of zzso zzso in abrupt also reveal its role in establishing and maintaining muscle attachments, adult sensory cell formation, and zzso of adult zzso The abrupt gene encodes a zinc finger protein with a zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in muscle zzso but not zzso suggesting that abrupt controls the muscle expression of molecules required for correct zzso zzso as well as molecules required for correct muscle zzso
