The function of zzso zzso proteins is to neutralize the host zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bridges a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and mediates their degradation by zzso Recent studies have found that zzso uses different zzso to bind to zzso and zzso A zzso domain binds to zzso zzso binds to zzso and zzso binds to both zzso and zzso Here, we report another functional domain of zzso Previously, we demonstrated that human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso failed to mediate zzso zzso degradation when all 16 zzso were zzso to zzso Here, we show that zzso and to a lesser extent zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso and zzso are part of a zzso zzso zzso represents zzso K, or zzso motif that is found in most zzso zzso and that shows zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso in this motif regulated zzso specificity only for zzso whereas the zzso zzso regulated zzso specificity for both zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso did not directly mediate zzso interaction with either zzso or zzso Previously, other groups have reported an important role for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a novel functional domain that regulates zzso activity toward both zzso and zzso and is a potential drug target to inhibit zzso activity and block zzso zzso
