The zzso degradation of the zzso protein zzso zzso B alpha in response to zzso stimulation is a prerequisite step in the zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso Analysis of the expression of human I zzso B alpha protein in stable zzso of mouse zzso cells shows that, as for the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso B alpha is zzso in response to zzso of zzso B activity, such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso of the cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso this zzso degradation and, in agreement with previous studies, zzso a zzso form of the human I zzso B alpha zzso By expressing zzso forms of the human protein in this cell line, we have been able to delineate the sequences responsible for both the zzso zzso and the degradation of I zzso B zzso Our results show that deletion of the C zzso of the I zzso B alpha zzso up to zzso acid 279 zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further analysis reveals that the zzso zzso of I zzso B alpha maps to two zzso in the N zzso of the protein zzso 32 and zzso and that the zzso of either zzso is sufficient to abolish zzso degradation, whereas both zzso must be zzso to abolish zzso zzso of the zzso We propose that treatment of zzso cells with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso a zzso activity which zzso zzso 32 and that these zzso target the protein for rapid zzso degradation, possibly by the zzso zzso pathway, thus allowing zzso B to zzso to the nucleus and to activate gene zzso
