One approach to understanding the function of zzso 1 zzso is to discover those proteins with which it zzso Evidence for a function in zzso patterning came from zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso was identified by screening for zzso of a zzso in zzso a gene which specifies cell zzso However, this genetic experiment cannot determine which proteins directly interact with zzso zzso we zzso the two hybrid system and zzso zzso to identify a novel zzso termed zzso which interacts with zzso and is principally expressed in zzso The zzso are a gene family related to the zzso gene in zzso some of which appear to have dual zzso are components of zzso zzso zzso and may serve as zzso in the zzso zzso signaling pathway, which, like zzso is also responsible for a variety of zzso signaling zzso In the zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso with zzso the family member with the greatest zzso to zzso zzso and zzso interactions are zzso by the zzso zzso which may form a signaling complex with zzso and zzso zzso zzso to regulate the function of the zzso zzso
