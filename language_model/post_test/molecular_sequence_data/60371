DNA zzso of a family of over 20 human zzso zzso genes was used to derive zzso with increased zzso and zzso activities in zzso zzso A clone with zzso improved specific activity over zzso was obtained in the first cycle of zzso After a second cycle of selective zzso the most active clone was improved zzso relative to zzso and zzso relative to zzso zzso the three most active clones were more active than the native zzso zzso These zzso are derived from up to five parental genes but contained no random point zzso These results demonstrate that diverse zzso gene families can be used as starting material to rapidly evolve zzso that are more active, or have superior selectivity profiles, than native zzso zzso
