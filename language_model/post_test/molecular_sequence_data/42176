zzso of zzso zzso zzso sugar chains in experimental zzso of zzso cells and their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated by using zzso zzso zzso which increased zzso binding to the cell surface without increasing zzso A or wheat germ zzso zzso The zzso binding to cell surface increased in parallel with the experimental zzso ability in zzso zzso cells, and this increase in zzso ability was suppressed when the cells were treated with zzso before zzso injection of zzso zzso A and wheat germ zzso did not have such zzso zzso Increased zzso binding was observed on zzso of zzso zzso and was suggested to be due to reduced zzso of zzso sugar chains on these zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cells, the increase in experimental zzso ability was also associated with increased zzso binding to cell surface and zzso zzso zzso Although the mechanisms of these effects of zzso are unknown, these results suggested that the reduced zzso of zzso sugar chains on zzso zzso is related to the increased experimental zzso ability of zzso zzso melanoma zzso
