zzso zzso has been thought to act only through the well-known zzso zzso involving hormone binding to nuclear receptors zzso and subsequent zzso of gene zzso However, there is increasing evidence for zzso zzso effects of zzso in a variety of zzso in zzso and it seems likely that a membrane zzso zzso is causing these zzso The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize an zzso zzso distinct from the zzso A zzso clone was isolated from zzso zzso DNA by zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso acid protein that, based on computer zzso analysis, possesses seven zzso zzso and is distinct from the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso and corpus zzso by zzso In zzso cells that zzso a zzso fluorescent protein fusion zzso the zzso zzso was localized to the zzso zzso and not the plasma zzso zzso binding of zzso to membrane zzso was demonstrated in zzso cells that expressed the zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells that expressed zzso zzso in zzso medium zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso cells zzso with empty zzso This rise in zzso zzso is believed to be from the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso is absent when zzso zzso cells are first treated with zzso to zzso zzso stores from the zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue distribution, cellular zzso steroid zzso and a functional response for a unique zzso zzso in the sheep are zzso
