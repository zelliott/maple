zzso are proteins zzso by many bacterial cells to kill related bacteria of the same zzso To avoid their own suicide through zzso of zzso zzso these bacteria protect themselves by zzso of immunity proteins in the compartment of zzso zzso In zzso coli the zzso M zzso is zzso by the interaction with the zzso immunity protein zzso We have zzso and solved the structure of zzso at a resolution of zzso by the recently developed zzso zzso phasing program zzso The zzso structure of the mature zzso protein comprises a long zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of this fold is zzso by an extended interface of hydrogen bond interactions between the zzso and the zzso zzso of the symmetry related zzso Two zzso zzso bridges zzso connect this zzso to further lock this zzso The zzso protein resembles an example of a zzso domain swapping being stalled through physical zzso The zzso is a highly charged complex with a significant surplus of negative charges presumably responsible for interactions with zzso zzso of zzso was also demonstrated to occur in zzso Although the zzso complex is unique among bacteria, the general fold of zzso is representative for a class of zzso proteins which are known to be zzso into the external medium by some zzso zzso
