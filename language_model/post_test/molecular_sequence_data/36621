The development of a new zzso zzso for zzso Y zzso is zzso Two zzso zzso directed against distinct zzso of zzso are used, one as a capture zzso zzso and the other one as an indicator zzso zzso this latter zzso being labeled with alkaline zzso The zzso zzso curve was performed over zzso of 1 to 250 zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of variation zzso ranged from zzso to zzso whereas the zzso zzso was comprised between 5 and zzso The limit of detection of this zzso was 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso Y levels are related to sampling zzso zzso zzso of zzso with low zzso are found when less than zzso zzso of blood is taken in zzso tubes, the sample is zzso at 4 degrees C, and immediately zzso zzso spontaneously zzso rats exhibited higher zzso plasma zzso than zzso zzso controls zzso zzso 7 zzso and 25 zzso 2 zzso respectively, mean zzso zzso p zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels are similar in 16- and zzso zzso In conclusion, this technique makes it possible to zzso a large number of samples within 24 h without requiring zzso
