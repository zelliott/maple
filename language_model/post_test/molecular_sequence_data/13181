zzso primates such as the zzso zzso zzso show zzso for the middle- to zzso sensitive cone zzso Each zzso carries a gene for only one of three possible zzso All males are thus zzso but some females will be zzso We have investigated the responses of cells of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso systems within animals from a single zzso zzso The middle- to zzso zzso of zzso was identified zzso zzso could readily be distinguished from zzso by the presence of a high proportion of zzso opponent zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed with genetic zzso The pattern of inheritance was consistent with current genetic zzso In zzso zzso the properties of cells resembled in detail those of cells from the zzso and zzso of the zzso In zzso cell responses resembled those of zzso (except for the lack of zzso in zzso zzso showed sustained and zzso transient responses, with a lower contrast gain for the former zzso One difference was that a proportion of zzso in zzso showed strong rod input even at high levels of retinal zzso Thus, in zzso zzso the presence of two middle- to zzso zzso appears to permit the zzso of all the zzso properties associated with zzso
