zzso protein zzso is a zzso serum zzso that is an important constituent of the innate immune defense because it activates the complement system via the zzso zzso While the pig has been proposed to be an attractive source of zzso zzso and zzso little is known about zzso zzso In our previous studies, zzso but not zzso was found to be an effective inhibitor of the zzso zzso activity of newborn zzso serum against some rough strains of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso activities of zzso and zzso were very similar in the case of zzso zzso activity against rough strains of zzso coli K-12 and zzso Based on these findings, we zzso that an zzso zzso with slightly or completely different zzso binding specificity might exist in newborn zzso serum and be responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso we report that a novel zzso zzso zzso of 33 zzso under reducing conditions was isolated from both newborn and adult zzso serum and zzso zzso zzso functionally activated the complement system via the zzso zzso triggered by binding with both zzso zzso and zzso which, unlike zzso was effectively inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our observations suggest that zzso zzso plays a critical role in the innate immune defense from the newborn stage to zzso and the establishment of a newborn zzso experimental model for the innate immune system studies is a valuable step toward zzso of the zzso function and molecular mechanism of zzso zzso
