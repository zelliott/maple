The recognition sequence of the zzso restriction zzso is known to be a strong hot spot for zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by the chemical zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to define a zzso zzso for this zzso hot spot, we have investigated the role of the bases zzso the central zzso zzso repeat in the zzso sequence zzso on the zzso frequency induced by the zzso Construction and random modification with zzso of the 16 plasmids resulting from the replacement of Na and zzso by zzso and C, respectively, have been zzso All 16 sequences tested are found to be zzso zzso zzso hot zzso Indeed, a level of modification of approximately five zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso a zzso frequency ranging between 500 and zzso above zzso The zzso observed are mainly zzso deletion of a zzso zzso in the targeted sequence zzso Previous studies on zzso zzso zzso have shown that only zzso zzso at zzso in the template for lagging strand synthesis induce zzso zzso zzso at a high zzso When the zzso data obtained in this work are analyzed as originating essentially from zzso to zzso in this zzso we find that it is the zzso zzso located 3' to the central zzso zzso repeat that strongly zzso the zzso frequency, while the zzso Na located on the zzso side has little zzso Our present model of zzso zzso at zzso sites involves a zzso zzso step with a zzso slipped zzso zzso In the context of this model, the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso located two zzso 3' from the putative zzso site in the template strand can be explained in view of the fact that the replication complex encounters this zzso before it encounters the zzso
