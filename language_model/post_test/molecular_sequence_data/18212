It has been documented that when furnished with an zzso signal sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso resulting in the nearly complete loss of zzso zzso To enable use of zzso as a reporter protein in zzso and zzso targeting studies, one of the two putative zzso zzso sites within the zzso gene was altered by zzso zzso The second zzso zzso site was not altered because sequence analysis of zzso sequences around the second putative zzso site revealed that the published sequence was zzso and that no such site zzso
