zzso zzso a potent rat liver zzso that binds zzso to the zzso position of zzso zzso in DNA, is an effective zzso zzso The zzso are distributed zzso in that most are located at a few specific DNA sequences zzso zzso hot zzso Among these hot spots, the zzso I sequence zzso is especially susceptible to the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to the nature of the zzso I zzso zzso three different molecular events, each involving the deletion of two zzso base pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso can give rise to the observed end point zzso To compare the potential role of each of the three possible zzso zzso in the zzso I site to induce the zzso zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso molecules containing a zzso zzso bound to one of the three zzso zzso Using these zzso we found that only the zzso in the zzso position zzso the zzso zzso zzso This strong effect of the position of the zzso zzso within the zzso I site is discussed in relation to the possible involvement of an unusual DNA zzso in the zzso zzso
