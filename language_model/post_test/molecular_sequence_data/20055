The regulated zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso plays a key role in determining the magnitude and duration of zzso zzso and hence the zzso outcome of zzso In zzso cells, an important component of this control is zzso by the differential expression and activities of a family of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso share a common structure in which zzso zzso recognition is determined by sequences within an zzso zzso domain whereas zzso binding often leads to a zzso change within the zzso zzso domain resulting in increased zzso zzso zzso can either recognize and zzso a single class of zzso zzso as in the specific zzso of zzso signal regulated zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso or can regulate more than one zzso zzso as illustrated by the ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the cell zzso These properties, coupled with zzso regulation of zzso expression in response to stimuli that activate zzso zzso suggest a complex negative regulatory network in which individual zzso activities can be subject to negative feedback control, but also raise the possibility that zzso through multiple zzso pathways may be integrated at the level of regulation by zzso
