We investigated the zzso of zzso acid bacteria zzso isolated from two apples variety to zzso zzso at different initial pH zzso zzso surface contained average levels of bacteria ranging from log zzso zzso zzso to log zzso zzso zzso zzso for Red zzso and Golden zzso zzso zzso Thirty-one strains able to develop in presence of zzso at low pH were zzso and zzso identified as belonging to zzso zzso and zzso zzso In general, they did not produce zzso from zzso when cultivated in zzso medium with zzso zzso at pH zzso or zzso When this zzso was zzso only six strains belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso species formed higher zzso amounts in zzso as compared to zzso This was correlated with zzso zzso and it was more pronounced at pH zzso than zzso Analysis of zzso production confirmed the zzso zzso in these bacteria by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was observed for zzso zzso zzso at the two pH zzso In this strain zzso was formed at higher rate than zzso which was detected in concentration lower than 1 zzso Thus, main zzso species found on apple surfaces with abilities to degrade zzso by the zzso zzso under different conditions were reported here at the first zzso The results suggested that the zzso zzso in apples zzso might not be mainly relevant for their survival in the acid natural zzso despite leading to the zzso formation, which may contribute to the increase in zzso coping the acid zzso
