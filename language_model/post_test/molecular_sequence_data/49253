zzso codes for a protein essential in Ras to zzso signaling leading to zzso zzso Three genes highly zzso to zzso were discovered, thereby defining a novel gene zzso Here, we report the zzso structure of zzso and the zzso genes in human and zzso We performed zzso searches against the zzso Human Genome and Mouse zzso zzso The mouse fragments were manually zzso and the organization of both human and mouse genes was zzso The gene structures in zzso zzso of the human and mouse zzso were compared to outline zzso and zzso We also compared the zzso family gene structures predicted by zzso with those predicted by zzso Moreover, we performed a virtual analysis of the expression of the zzso gene family members by using the zzso Database in zzso Finally, we analyzed the domain organization of the gene products and their evolutionary conservation to define novel putative zzso thereby helping to predict novel zzso of action for the members of this gene zzso The data obtained will be instrumental in directing further experimental functional characterization of these zzso
