The mechanism of zzso of tissue zzso by zzso zzso 3 zzso was investigated by kinetic and sequence zzso zzso slowly activated zzso by zzso of the zzso bond to generate a fully active zzso of Mr zzso zzso The specific zzso activity of this species was 27,000 zzso (1 unit zzso 1 zzso of collagen zzso in 1 zzso at 37 degrees zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso or plasma zzso gave zzso of Mr zzso zzso These zzso underwent rapid zzso zzso via zzso the zzso bond, to give a zzso species of Mr zzso zzso that exhibited only about zzso of the zzso specific zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso activated zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso bond to generate a zzso species of Mr zzso zzso but with only about zzso of the zzso specific zzso zzso incubation of the zzso species with zzso resulted in zzso full zzso and generated the zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso species, the action of zzso was approximately 24,000 times faster than that on the native zzso This indicates that the removal of a portion of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso changes around the zzso bond, rendering it readily susceptible to zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso with zzso in the absence of zzso also generated a zzso zzso but this species had only zzso of the full activity and contained zzso and zzso as zzso zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso bond by zzso is crucial for the expression of full zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso by zzso is regulated by two zzso one with zzso slow zzso by zzso and the other with rapid zzso in conjunction with tissue and/or plasma zzso The latter event may explain an accelerated degradation of zzso under certain zzso and pathological zzso
