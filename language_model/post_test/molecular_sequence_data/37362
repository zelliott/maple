The large number of zzso genes emerging from zzso sequencing projects has resulted in a need for quick and reliable screening methods for protein expression zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso zzso system (as previously zzso to develop a series of zzso for rapid screening for expression in zzso zzso A high level of zzso protein expression is a requirement for zzso of protein for structural determination and other zzso In other applications, successful zzso of a missing zzso activity in zzso coli, as well as directed evolution studies and zzso engineering, often require a much lower level of protein zzso In this report we describe the construction of a number of new zzso zzso that can be screened for both low- and high-level zzso We isolated a zzso zzso for zzso zzso that exhibited a more optimal level of expression for zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli, our functional zzso for the alternative zzso We then demonstrated the use of our system to rapidly screen for both optimal functional expression and optimal zzso of the alternative zzso as well as two other members of a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso terminal zzso and zzso zzso
