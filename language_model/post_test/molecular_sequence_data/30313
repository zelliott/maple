The zzso of heat shock genes in response to zzso stress requires zzso of heat shock zzso factor zzso Although the zzso response is most commonly induced by temperature zzso the zzso events involved in zzso zzso in zzso can also be triggered at normal zzso temperatures by chemicals that inhibit zzso zzso We have used a zzso zzso system in which zzso zzso is activated by conditions that affect protein zzso including increasing zzso of hydrogen zzso zzso or zzso zzso Treatment with calcium zzso also results in a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso with each of these zzso conditions reduces the temperature dependence for zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso is activated either directly by undergoing a zzso change or indirectly through interactions with unfolded zzso
