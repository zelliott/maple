The zzso zzso zzso zzso is among the most widespread zzso The broad host cell range of the zzso can be explained by zzso zzso screening analyses that have demonstrated the ability of the zzso zzso adhesive zzso zzso to bind to a wide spectrum of zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigate by further zzso analyses in a zzso format the differential binding of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, two novel synthetic fluorinated zzso of zzso and zzso were identified as highly potent zzso To understand the structural basis of the zzso binding specificity of zzso we have determined the crystal structures of zzso zzso adhesive repeat zzso zzso in complex with five zzso zzso These crystal structures have revealed a specific, zzso hydrogen bond network that accounts for the preferential binding of zzso to arrayed zzso zzso zzso and the high potency of the fluorinated zzso Furthermore, we provide strong evidence for the first observation of a zzso hydrogen bond within a zzso zzso Finally, detailed comparison with other zzso complexes in the zzso Data Bank zzso reveals a new family of zzso binding sites from zzso in zzso bacteria, and zzso
