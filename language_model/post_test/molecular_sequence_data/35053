The respiratory defects associated with zzso in human zzso zzso genes can be zzso in zzso which is the only zzso easily amenable to zzso zzso This approach has shown that zzso of several nuclear genes coding for factors involved in zzso protein synthesis can alleviate the respiratory defects both in zzso and in human zzso The present paper analyzes in detail the effects of zzso zzso and human zzso translation zzso factors zzso We studied the suppressing activity versus the function in zzso translation of zzso versions of this factor and we obtained indications on the mechanism of zzso zzso from a more extended search for zzso genes we isolated factors which might be active in zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso factors as well as their high zzso of expression levels can account for the variable severity of zzso diseases and might suggest possible therapeutic zzso
