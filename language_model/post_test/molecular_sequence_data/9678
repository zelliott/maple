zzso is a new member of the recently recognized zzso zzso channel zzso This 395 zzso acid zzso has four zzso segments and two P zzso In adult human, zzso transcripts are found in zzso zzso zzso small zzso and zzso zzso properties of zzso were determined after expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso currents are zzso instantaneous and zzso They show an outward zzso when external zzso is low zzso zzso 2 zzso which is not observed for high zzso zzso zzso The zzso can be zzso by the zzso current equation that predicts a zzso of the zzso plot in zzso zzso zzso This strongly suggests that zzso lacks intrinsic zzso zzso The absence of zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso independence are characteristic of zzso referred to as leak or background zzso For this reason, zzso is designated as a background zzso zzso zzso is very sensitive to variations of zzso pH in a narrow zzso zzso as much as zzso of the maximum current is recorded at pH zzso and only zzso at pH zzso This property is probably essential for its zzso function, and suggests that small pH variations may serve a communication role in the nervous zzso
