The requirements to transform a short zzso of the zzso zzso into an zzso zzso were investigated through the generation of zzso zzso of zzso in which the zzso zzso was zzso for zzso in different positions along the zzso zzso Any attempt to create an active zzso zzso zzso motif within the specificity loop of zzso was zzso zzso the whole zzso of zzso by the zzso of zzso was neither sufficient for zzso zzso binding specificity to this zzso zzso zzso zzso other than the zzso loop sequence per zzso are thus required to transform a zzso scaffold from the zzso zzso into another scaffold from the zzso zzso Moreover, our results provide zzso that the zzso short zzso have potentially been recruited into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso independently from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences from a number of zzso across zzso including snakes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso clearly showed that genes coding for zzso zzso existed long before the split of zzso and zzso thus predating the recruitment of the zzso precursors of zzso providing strong support for the view of an independent evolutionary history of the zzso and the zzso zzso of short zzso
