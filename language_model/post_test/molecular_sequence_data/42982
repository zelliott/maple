A zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was used to test for the presence of zzso zzso in rat skeletal and cardiac muscle zzso Standard indirect zzso methods for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for electron zzso were applied to zzso muscle zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso was found to zzso appropriately for zzso In zzso sections of skeletal muscle, the zzso was apparent as a strongly fluorescent zzso zzso Gold particles were observed by transmission electron zzso in association with zzso structures on either side of zzso and on either side of, but not adjacent to the zzso This appearance is consistent with the zzso zzso and the known distribution of zzso In competition binding experiments, neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso with the binding of each other and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso differs in its relative molecular weight from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was isolated and zzso by zzso The zzso was found to zzso with the zzso fraction from cell zzso and could be released from this fraction with the addition of reducing zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates that the zzso zzso may be an zzso of zzso which zzso intermediate filaments and zzso
