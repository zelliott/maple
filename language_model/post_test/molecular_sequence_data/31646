zzso zzso is an economically important gastrointestinal zzso that zzso primarily sheep and zzso To survive inside the host, the zzso must overcome the host immune zzso In this study, we have identified and characterized a zzso protein zzso from this zzso employing zzso and molecular biology zzso Initially, a truncated form of the protein was isolated from the zzso products of the zzso using zzso column that facilitated its identification by mass zzso zzso the parent zzso was generated in zzso coli, and sequence analysis confirmed it as zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with the zzso raised against the truncated zzso and the truncated protein reacted with zzso zzso The protein inhibited complement function as measured by zzso zzso and membrane attack complex zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso animals reacted with zzso as well as the truncated form of the zzso which further lend support to protein zzso Thus, the zzso property of zzso zzso zzso is a new function, and it represents a new entity of zzso zzso Identification and characterization of zzso should facilitate development of new zzso considering a key role of this protein in immune zzso
