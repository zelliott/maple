The crystal structure of the zzso zzso formed upon zzso of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso by zzso has been determined at a zzso effective zzso The chlorine atom is still present in this zzso zzso in contrast to the previously reported structure of the zzso complex where the chlorine atom has been replaced by an zzso zzso The zzso group forms hydrogen bonds with the zzso group and zzso zzso group of zzso and the zzso zzso group has been twisted out of the zzso zzso zzso modeling indicates that the orientation of the initial zzso zzso complex is quite different from that of the zzso zzso since simple reconstruction of the zzso ring would result in zzso interactions with zzso and zzso zzso models were used to design a series of new zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso as zzso zzso All the zzso were better zzso than those in the zzso series due to better interactions with the zzso pocket of zzso The best zzso inhibitor also contained a zzso group at the zzso of the zzso Due to a predicted interaction with a small zzso pocket on the surface of zzso this zzso and a related zzso zzso are among the best irreversible zzso thus far reported for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 12,000 zzso zzso zzso studies of the stability of zzso complexes suggest that many zzso are zzso the active site zzso at pH zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso while at pH zzso the zzso zzso appears to be simple formation of a stable zzso zzso zzso
