zzso and zzso are zzso peptides that stimulate zzso zzso by zzso a common set of zzso zzso signaling molecules located on the zzso surface of zzso High zzso zzso similar to the pH occurring within the fluid zzso domain at the zzso surface of the zzso markedly enhances the zzso zzso responses of zzso human zzso cells to zzso In contrast, a zzso acidity of pH zzso renders zzso essentially zzso zzso cells were used as a model zzso to further explore the concept that zzso acidity zzso zzso selectivity for zzso of the zzso receptors for zzso and zzso thus providing a rationale for the evolution of these related zzso At an zzso zzso pH of zzso zzso is zzso more potent than zzso but at an alkaline pH of zzso zzso is more potent than zzso in stimulating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relative affinities of zzso and zzso for binding to receptors on the zzso surface of zzso cells is influenced dramatically by zzso zzso which explains the strong pH dependency of the zzso and zzso zzso responses to these zzso The zzso affinities for zzso interaction were reduced by zzso at pH 5 versus pH 8, whereas the affinities of zzso for these receptors were increased zzso by zzso pH zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso demonstrated that these zzso are responsible for the increase in binding affinities that are observed for zzso at zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso evolved distinctly different structures, which enables both peptides to zzso in a zzso fashion, the activity of receptors that control zzso salt and water transport via zzso
