The zzso surface protein zzso of zzso zzso mediates binding to diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso adherence to zzso cell lines, resistance to complement zzso zzso and is required for mouse zzso Using zzso zzso we attempted to zzso the relationship between structural zzso and functions of zzso In a first approach we could abrogate collagen binding by chemical modification of zzso zzso of zzso zzso This result prompted us to substitute zzso zzso zzso of zzso regions of zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of binding to zzso zzso of cell zzso and in reduction of mouse zzso whereas zzso serum complement resistance and zzso formation remained zzso A striking result was obtained from the zzso zzso model: the zzso zzso retained the ability to colonize the small zzso and to invade and multiply within the zzso patches but was impaired in colonizing zzso zzso zzso and zzso in comparison to the zzso zzso
