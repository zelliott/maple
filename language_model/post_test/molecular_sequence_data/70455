The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is split into three zzso and spans zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analysis revealed two zzso initiation sites located approximately 210 zzso zzso of the first zzso The zzso zzso region lacks typical zzso and zzso boxes but contains several potential regulatory elements including binding sites for zzso zzso zzso and a zzso response zzso A zzso zzso repetitive B2 element is located in the zzso region, but did not exert a negative effect on the zzso promoter activity in transient zzso experiments with reporter zzso zzso protection zzso showed expression of zzso zzso in several zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso in zzso zzso revealed transcripts in the cortex, but not in the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may play a role in the development of zzso
