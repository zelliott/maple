A zzso zzso in body shape is observed among zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which feed on land zzso We hypothesized that this zzso has resulted from divergent ecological specialization for feeding on zzso land zzso zzso we examined whether the geographic variation in the body shape of zzso zzso a representative zzso species in Japan, is correlated with the size of zzso a zzso of land snails frequently consumed by zzso zzso An analysis of zzso specimens from the whole distribution area of zzso zzso determined that more slender zzso populations occurred in localities harboring larger zzso whereas more stout zzso inhabited localities harboring smaller zzso This pattern could be zzso because slender zzso exhibit high feeding performance for large snails by inserting their heads into the shells, whereas stout zzso do so for small snails by crushing the zzso The zzso zzso populations showed a clear genetic zzso pattern, which could be effective in promoting such local zzso Thus, food resources as well as geographic isolation may have promoted zzso divergence of external zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
