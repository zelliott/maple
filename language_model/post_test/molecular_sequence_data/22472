We previously reported that zzso zzso is not zzso expressed in nervous or muscular tissue and has reduced zzso activity compared with its human zzso Here we characterize the tissue expression pattern and zzso activity of a second zzso zzso zzso sequence tag analysis of adult zzso lens revealed the presence of a novel zzso transcript designated zzso and the resulting protein zzso The deduced protein sequence was zzso and zzso identical with human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is expressed predominantly in lens but, reminiscent of zzso zzso also has lower zzso expression in heart, brain, skeletal muscle and zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso by measuring its ability to prevent the chemically induced zzso of zzso and zzso At 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, zzso zzso showed greater zzso activity than human zzso and at 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C, the human protein provided greater protection against zzso zzso gel zzso indicated that zzso makes up approximately zzso of total zzso lens zzso zzso is the first species known to express two different zzso zzso in primary structure, expression and zzso activity suggest that the two zzso zzso perform divergent zzso zzso After gene duplication, zzso zzso maintained the widespread protective role also found in zzso zzso while zzso zzso adopted a more zzso zzso role in the zzso Gene zzso may have allowed these functions to separate, providing a unique model for studying zzso relationships and the regulation of zzso expression zzso
