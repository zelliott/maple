While zzso receptors zzso have received considerable attention for their biological activity in a diversity of zzso functions and have become targets for therapeutic intervention in many diseases, the function of the cell zzso zzso of zzso remains poorly zzso Within this group, the family of brain zzso inhibitor molecules zzso has become increasingly appreciated for their diverse roles in biology and zzso In particular, recent findings suggest emerging roles for zzso in the regulation of phenomena including zzso zzso and the zzso of tumor growth and zzso via the processing of its zzso domain into zzso zzso Here we zzso the known biological features of the zzso zzso including their structure, zzso events, and interacting partners, and their recently identified ability to regulate certain signaling zzso Finally, we discuss the potential of the zzso as zzso or targets for diseases as varied as cancer, stroke, and zzso
