zzso cacao zzso an economically important crop for developing countries, can be zzso zzso by zzso zzso Because of their potential roles in zzso a gene candidate strategy was initiated to find gene zzso of the members of the leafy zzso family of zzso zzso A zzso of the leafy zzso zzso that encodes the zzso 3 zzso of the zzso zzso factor, was found in the zzso zzso zzso The translated zzso shared a high zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts mainly accumulated in young and immature zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, in young and immature zzso zzso In zzso zzso specified the zzso of the transcripts as being mainly in embryonic cells of young zzso the zzso cells of the shoot and root zzso of immature zzso and in the zzso and zzso of young and immature zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not show zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene could partially rescue the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting a similarity of function in zzso zzso
