The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso protein 3 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicates that zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In particular, the zzso results zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso with which it shares a high zzso acid sequence identity zzso zzso transcripts are accumulated primarily at an early stage of sunflower zzso High levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been detected in the developing zzso proper, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, while in zzso zzso zzso zzso was present at rather low zzso In an attempt to examine the involvement of zzso on zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that produces zzso zzso and zzso structures, arranged in clusters along leaf zzso was zzso We found that the zzso proliferation of zzso zzso on zzso leaves was associated to zzso zzso zzso The detection of zzso transcripts was evident in zzso zzso at the zzso and early zzso On the contrary, no signal related to zzso transcript zzso was observed in zzso leaves characterized by the presence of zzso zzso Together, these results support the conclusion that the zzso of the zzso gene is maintained both in zzso and in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells around the vascular zzso of zzso leaves opens the possibility that zzso could also be involved in switching zzso cell fate towards zzso zzso
