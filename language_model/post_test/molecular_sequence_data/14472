A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a sea zzso zzso zzso collected from the South Sea, Korea, and was characterized to determine its zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso at 30 zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell within the zzso zzso zzso species and exhibited zzso similarity to the type strains of recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso as the major fatty acid, which is consistent with data for zzso zzso The major polar lipids detected in strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso properties, together with zzso zzso demonstrated that strain zzso can be distinguished from recognized zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
