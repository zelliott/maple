The mouse zzso growth factor 2 zzso locus is a complex zzso region that produces multiple transcripts from alternative zzso zzso at this locus is regulated by parental zzso However, despite the existence of putative zzso control elements in the zzso upstream region, imprinted zzso repression is abolished by zzso zzso at the linked zzso zzso To clarify the extent to which the zzso upstream region contains autonomous zzso control elements we have performed functional and comparative analyses of the region in the mouse and zzso Here we report the existence of zzso overlapping imprinted zzso zzso sense and zzso transcripts that are associated with a tandem repeat in the mouse zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso the repeat exhibit zzso parental zzso zzso patterns, suggesting the existence of zzso control elements in the upstream zzso Studies in zzso zzso mice indicate that both parental zzso zzso and zzso expression of the upstream transcripts depends on an intact zzso gene acting in zzso The zzso region in human zzso is structurally zzso with the significant exception that it does not contain a tandem zzso Our results support the proposal that tandem repeats act to target zzso to imprinted genetic zzso
