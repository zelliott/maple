Five zzso zzso zzso genes were cloned through zzso screening of zzso zzso libraries with the zzso zzso from zzso These five genes were named zzso (for zzso zzso zzso An analysis of zzso and 2 has been presented previously zzso Here we present an analysis of the genes zzso 4 and zzso On the basis of sequence and expression patterns, these three genes belong to the class II zzso of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso Southern analysis suggests several additional members of the class II genes exist in the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of the three genes share extensive zzso outside of the zzso including zzso between zzso and zzso Northern analysis shows that although all three genes are expressed in all zzso zzso the level of zzso zzso is highest in young zzso zzso and roots, zzso zzso level is strongest in leaves and young zzso and zzso zzso level is highest in zzso The specificity of these patterns was confirmed by zzso fingerprint zzso zzso and 4 are zzso as they show reduced expression in zzso zzso and also in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
