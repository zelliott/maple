Among the zzso zzso groups, zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso share a common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L or zzso zzso such as zzso hormone zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso goldfish zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides zzso also share a zzso zzso zzso Such a similar zzso structure suggests that these two groups may have zzso from a common ancestral zzso In this study, we sought to clarify the evolutionary origin and divergence of these two groups, by identifying novel zzso peptides from the brain of sea zzso one of only two extant groups of the oldest lineage of zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso using the zzso against zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not contain a zzso zzso zzso but had the sequence zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the precursor zzso one zzso zzso and two related zzso These related zzso which also had the zzso zzso zzso were further identified as mature zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso precursor belongs to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the regions predicted to be involved in neuroendocrine and behavioral zzso This is the first demonstration of the presence of zzso peptides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides are considered to have retained the most ancestral features of zzso zzso
