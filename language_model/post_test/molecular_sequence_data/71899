zzso zzso regulator protein zzso is a zzso protein that regulates zzso outer segment membrane zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso activates zzso at free zzso zzso below 100 zzso characteristic of zzso zzso and zzso zzso when free zzso zzso are above the 500 zzso level, characteristic of zzso zzso We have mapped functional zzso in zzso by using deletion zzso and zzso proteins in which parts of zzso were zzso with corresponding fragments of other closely related zzso proteins that do not regulate zzso We find that in addition to the zzso zzso centers there are three regions that contain zzso sequences essential for regulation of zzso 1) The region between zzso and zzso determines whether zzso activates outer segment zzso in low or high zzso zzso zzso of this domain with the corresponding region from zzso causes a paradoxical behavior of the zzso zzso They activate zzso only at high and not at low zzso zzso 2) The zzso acid sequence of zzso between zzso and zzso that includes the zzso motif zzso is essential both for zzso of zzso at low zzso and zzso at high zzso zzso Most of the remaining zzso region can be zzso with zzso or zzso sequences without loss of zzso zzso 3) Region zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso contributes to zzso of zzso but it is not essential for the ability of zzso zzso to inhibit zzso Other regions of the zzso can be zzso with the corresponding fragments from zzso or zzso or even partially deleted without preventing zzso from regulating zzso zzso of these three zzso in zzso with corresponding zzso sequences also affects zzso of individual zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso
