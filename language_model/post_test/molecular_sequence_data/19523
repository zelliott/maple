zzso zzso zzso zzso m 2) is a major zzso zzso Previous studies have indicated that zzso zzso m 2 expressed in insect cells has zzso activity and zzso binding comparable with that of native zzso m zzso In contrast, zzso m 2 expressed in zzso coli does zzso In this study, we characterized the zzso side chains of zzso m 2 expressed in insect cells, and compared our data with the established zzso structure of native zzso m zzso We assessed both the zzso and the zzso content of zzso zzso m 2 using zzso zzso zzso and zzso To identify the zzso acid zzso at which zzso occurs, we zzso zzso zzso m 2 with zzso zzso and identified the fragments that contained zzso by specific zzso zzso zzso m 2 expressed in insect cells contains zzso zzso and zzso as well as trace amounts of zzso and zzso and the zzso analysis is consistent with zzso zzso chains consisting of two to seven zzso No zzso acid or zzso were zzso These results are similar to published data for native zzso m 2, although some zzso components appear to be absent in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso indicates that of the four candidate zzso sites, zzso chains are attached at zzso 115 and zzso zzso zzso m 2 expressed in insect cells has zzso activity and zzso binding comparable with the native zzso and its zzso composition is very zzso
