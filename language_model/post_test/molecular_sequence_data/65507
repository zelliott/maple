The zzso gene zzso a putative zzso and zzso protein was found to be present in all zzso tuberculosis complex strains (by zzso and its zzso was shown by zzso in all but zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso peptides specifically recognized the native protein by Western zzso and were able to locate this protein on the zzso tuberculosis membrane by zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells lines were used in binding zzso involving synthetic peptides covering the whole zzso zzso High zzso zzso zzso zzso (281 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso presented high specific binding to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso specifically bound to a zzso and a zzso zzso cell membrane zzso High activity binding peptides zzso zzso and zzso were able to inhibit zzso tuberculosis invasion of zzso zzso Our results suggest that these sequences could be part of the binding sites used by the zzso for interacting with target cells, and thus represent good candidates to be tested in a future zzso zzso zzso zzso
