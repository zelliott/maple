The association between the zzso E1 and zzso proteins is an important regulatory interaction, zzso coordinated control of viral zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso we have characterized the interactions between zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA in solution at zzso For these studies, two zzso zzso zzso were zzso The first fluorescent zzso designated zzso and containing a single zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the affinity of zzso for its DNA binding zzso zzso zzso bound zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and consistent with a single class of zzso zzso The second zzso designated zzso contained both E1 and zzso sites in sequence derived directly from the zzso origin of zzso Under zzso conditions identical to those used for zzso the zzso protein exhibited reduced affinity for zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso E1 binding to zzso was of very low zzso zzso of excess zzso E1 to zzso lowered the zzso constant for the zzso interaction to 2 zzso This effect was not dependent upon zzso or zzso zzso Fluorescence polarization and other data suggest formation of a complex containing six E1 molecules and a single zzso of zzso bound to a single zzso zzso zzso zzso from the final complex did not zzso In zzso physical interaction between E1 and zzso increases the DNA binding affinity of zzso The role of this energy zzso may be to promote zzso binding of both E1 and zzso to zzso
