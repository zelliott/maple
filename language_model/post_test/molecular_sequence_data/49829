zzso of zzso genes occurs around birth in the last stage of zzso cells differentiation and is zzso in case of nerve zzso Previous studies showed that zzso of the zzso zzso system, using as zzso zzso fused to its soluble zzso zzso causes induction of zzso genes such as zzso basic protein zzso and zzso protein zero zzso in embryonic zzso root zzso zzso zzso We also reported that in zzso melanoma zzso cells, zzso causes a zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso of the zzso factor zzso The present work demonstrates that these zzso zzso cells undergo zzso to a zzso zzso zzso characterized by induction of the zzso activities of both zzso and zzso promoters and zzso of zzso gene zzso For both zzso and zzso zzso a repression by zzso and stimulation by zzso can be zzso Because after zzso zzso disappears from the zzso cells (as it does in mature zzso zzso zzso whereas the level of zzso rather increases, we modulated the relative level of these factors and show their involvement in the induction of zzso gene expression by zzso In addition, however, we show that a zzso zzso box in the zzso promoter is required for zzso by zzso as well as by zzso zzso and identify a zzso zinc finger factor acting through this zzso box, which stimulates zzso promoter zzso
