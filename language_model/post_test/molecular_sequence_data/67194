The gene zzso coding for bovine zzso gene zzso was cloned and expressed as a component of fusion proteins destined for use in vaccine studies in zzso and for in zzso zzso This zzso of complement protein zzso zzso has been shown to enhance B cell responses when zzso with zzso Three potential vaccine zzso were engineered to contain one, two or three zzso units linked to a zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso an economically important pathogen of cattle that causes a zzso pneumonia in zzso A zzso zzso zzso protein (for use in in zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso in zzso coli by means of the zzso zzso zzso All zzso proteins incorporated zzso tags and were zzso by zzso zzso then analyzed by zzso and Western zzso The identity of zzso was confirmed by mass zzso since zzso zzso to zzso were not zzso To date, published research into the zzso activities of zzso has been limited to experiments in mice and zzso using zzso unrelated to diseases occurring naturally in these zzso The zzso fusion proteins expressed in this study will provide the basis for zzso trials in cattle and studies of zzso binding and cell zzso of bovine zzso
