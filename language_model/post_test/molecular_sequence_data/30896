zzso is a member of the insulin family of zzso hormones and is known to exert its biological effects on various parts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso active human zzso has been chemically zzso based on the zzso sequence obtained from an zzso zzso zzso In the present study synthetic human zzso was zzso by zzso with zzso protein zzso and zzso to a specific activity of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso on zzso exchange high performance liquid zzso and was shown to zzso with zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Mass zzso revealed a single zzso site on the B chain of zzso The zzso was able to bind to a goat zzso zzso and this binding could be displaced by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso A comparison of the concentration responses of cellular zzso production zzso by zzso and zzso zzso in a primary human zzso cell line showed that zzso did not affect the in zzso biological efficacy of zzso This made it suitable for in zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding sites in rat zzso zzso and brain tissue zzso zzso of the binding of 100 zzso zzso by 100, 10, and 3 zzso zzso zzso but not by 100 zzso insulin, zzso growth zzso and an zzso growth zzso zzso demonstrated the high affinity and specificity of such zzso We conclude that zzso human zzso is biologically and zzso active and that this novel probe binds zzso and with high affinity to classical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
