zzso for the zzso region zzso of zzso play a crucial role in the immune system and host protection against zzso In the present study, we describe the zzso sequencing and characterization of zzso zzso By screening a translated zzso database with the protein sequence of the human zzso zzso we identified a putative zzso zzso Using rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso we isolated the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso from peripheral blood zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso long, zzso a 297 zzso acid zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso zzso a zzso region and a zzso tail with an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence was found to be zzso and zzso zzso with human and mouse zzso zzso indicated zzso zzso transcripts expressed in liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso with the pig zzso zzso were able to bind chicken zzso zzso with zzso zzso Identification of zzso zzso will aid in the understanding zzso zzso and may help in developing new zzso zzso
