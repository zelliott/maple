zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced against the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity groups of zzso zzso were defined according to the zzso in indirect or capture zzso with bovine zzso B, for bovine zzso B coated at pH ranging from zzso to zzso and for zzso with naturally occurring zzso zzso such as bovine zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ten zzso zzso appeared to be zzso for bovine zzso 58 zzso zzso recognized only zzso zzso and 1 recognized all zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso was also studied with zzso zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso Critical zzso involved in the zzso of nine classes of zzso zzso were zzso Moreover, 5 zzso zzso were able to discriminate between a fresh solution of zzso and a solution that had been stored for zzso or zzso 2 d at 4 degrees C, and 3 zzso zzso distinguished bovine zzso that has been zzso by gel zzso from that zzso by salt zzso This array of zzso zzso could be efficient zzso for characterizing zzso structures involved in biological properties of zzso zzso interaction with zzso and hypersensitivity zzso and for studying zzso changes occurring upon physical treatments such as heat zzso
