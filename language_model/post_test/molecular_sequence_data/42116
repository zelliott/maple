We tested zzso zzso derivatives on the guinea pig trachea zzso and compared their zzso activities to zzso in this tissue and to published reports using similar zzso in different zzso systems, such as vascular zzso zzso Six zzso zzso with no zzso zzso bridges and/or with the substitution of one or more zzso acids at position 7 and/or 21 were zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso did not affect the zzso activity of zzso on the zzso zzso of the zzso decreased the potency and intrinsic activity, but not as much as had been reported on vascular zzso However, modifications involving one or both zzso bridges, combined with zzso of the zzso yielded zzso with very weak zzso zzso These findings, when compared with the zzso activity of zzso zzso in other zzso systems, suggest that a different population of zzso probably zzso zzso an zzso zzso different from the one reported to be involved in zzso binding or activities in rabbit pulmonary artery or in rat zzso or zzso is present and responsible for zzso zzso on the zzso
