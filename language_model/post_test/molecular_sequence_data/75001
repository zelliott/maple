zzso zzso A4 is a zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and cerebrovascular deposits in patients with Alzheimer's disease and zzso syndrome zzso zzso and may be involved in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso Recent molecular genetic studies have indicated that zzso protein is zzso as part of a larger protein by a gene on human zzso 21 zzso zzso The zzso protein precursor zzso gene is expressed in brain and in several peripheral zzso but the specific zzso events leading to deposition of zzso are not zzso We have now screened complementary DNA libraries constructed from peripheral zzso to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso is identical to that expressed in brain, and we identify a second zzso zzso that encodes an additional internal domain with a sequence characteristic of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The alternative zzso zzso is present in both brain and peripheral zzso of normal individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease, but its pattern of expression differs from that of the previously reported zzso zzso
