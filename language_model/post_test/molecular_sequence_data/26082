An zzso zzso has been screened from a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression library using zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso I fused to zzso with the molecular weight of approximately 150,000 was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso analysis of the cloned zzso revealed that it consisted of zzso zzso By comparison of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso and the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein zzso 1 to 18, determined by protein zzso the zzso was found to lack 44 zzso at its zzso end corresponding to zzso 1 to zzso zzso the mature zzso zzso I) was deduced to be composed of 375 zzso acid zzso and the molecular weight of its protein was calculated to be zzso zzso et zzso reported that the zzso zzso acid sequence of an zzso zzso from zzso commune was zzso with the active site of various zzso zzso type zzso and the zzso offered evidence for a zzso mechanism in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso et zzso also pointed out that some zzso acid zzso was found between zzso I from zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso T4 zzso zzso 45, zzso From the result of sequence alignment of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso and four kinds of zzso there was a possibility that the zzso from zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso cellulose by a zzso zzso
