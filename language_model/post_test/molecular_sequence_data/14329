zzso coli zzso was identified as an emerging pathogen during the spring and summer of 2011 and was responsible for a widespread outbreak that resulted in the deaths of 50 people and zzso over zzso Traditional zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso field gel zzso zzso and zzso sequence typing zzso permit identification and zzso of bacterial zzso but cannot accurately resolve relationships among zzso similar but zzso different zzso To understand the evolutionary origins of zzso coli zzso we zzso two strains isolated in Ontario, zzso One was zzso linked to the 2011 outbreak, and the second, unrelated zzso was obtained in zzso zzso analysis indicated that both zzso are of the same sequence type zzso but zzso sequencing revealed differences in zzso and zzso zzso Through comprehensive zzso analysis of five zzso zzso zzso we identified 167 genes in three gene clusters that have undergone zzso zzso with zzso related zzso coli zzso These zzso events have resulted in unexpectedly high sequence diversity within the same sequence zzso Failure to recognize or adjust for zzso zzso can result in zzso zzso zzso the extent of zzso zzso among different strains of the same sequence type may explain the zzso differences between the zzso and zzso strains and help shed new light on the emergence of this new zzso
