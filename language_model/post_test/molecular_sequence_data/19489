zzso weight zzso statistical modeling for the identification and characterization of motif sites in a set of zzso zzso sequences is zzso This paper describes and zzso a new algorithm, the zzso zzso Algorithm for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso called deterministic zzso zzso for comparison with zzso its zzso zzso The gold standard example, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso binding zzso together with other biological zzso is used to illustrate the performance of the new zzso and compare it with other popular zzso zzso The convergence of the new zzso is shown by zzso The in zzso experiments using simulated and biological examples illustrate the power and zzso of the new zzso zzso in de zzso motif zzso
