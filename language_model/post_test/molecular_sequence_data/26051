We determined the distribution of zzso sites, previously identified in the control domain of the zzso zzso in three other genes displaying diverse spatial patterns of expression in the sea zzso zzso Competitive zzso reactions were carried out using zzso from the zzso zzso with competitor fragments isolated from the previously defined control zzso of the other zzso zzso is expressed only in zzso zzso zzso the other genes studied were zzso also expressed in zzso zzso zzso expressed in many different cell zzso and zzso expressed only in zzso zzso All four genes are activated at about the same time in late zzso Where competitive interactions indicated a functionally comparable binding site (in zzso a sequence zzso was zzso and in most cases could be zzso An interesting pattern of putative regulatory site usage zzso Of 10 zzso interactions tested, three only were unique to the zzso gene with respect to the set of four genes zzso one believed on previous evidence to be a zzso regulator was shared by all four zzso and the remainder were shared in various zzso of the four zzso
