A previous report has demonstrated that normal zzso zzso could direct extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso effects, and that greatly enhanced specificity could be achieved upon zzso substitution of terminal zzso zzso In this report, we extend our previous observations to show that zzso zzso also direct substantial inappropriate zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be capable of efficiently directing zzso H when the central zzso section was reduced to just two zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso sites was found to be zzso or minimal in extent, when zzso H was directed by such zzso In addition, we show that analogue structures which contain three, or fewer, zzso zzso in otherwise zzso molecules were imported into cells via the comparatively more efficient route taken by zzso rather than by zzso zzso which is generally characteristic for zzso zzso Evidence is presented that the primary process responsible for enhanced zzso is an active zzso Nevertheless, a proportion of the applied zzso zzso which demonstrate zzso zzso appear to have penetrated into the zzso cellular zzso The present results suggest that zzso molecules of the type we describe here may show considerable utility as zzso zzso due to their increased cellular import, access to the zzso zzso and their highly efficient and specific direction of zzso zzso
