zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins are zzso regulators of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Their expression levels are low under zzso conditions, but they are zzso in response to zzso stimulation in many immune and inflammatory zzso zzso of zzso in zzso clones abrogates the zzso zzso zzso expression of many zzso genes and the release of related zzso by blocking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by binding the zzso site of zzso with its zzso zzso zzso acting as a zzso of the zzso In the present study, we screened a focused zzso zzso library of zzso to identify new peptides able to mimic its function with an improved affinity towards the zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso method, zzso zzso that are crucial for the interaction with zzso were zzso In this way, the zzso sequence was restricted to a shorter segment and zzso zzso were replaced by different zzso acids following a simplified zzso zzso We selected a new zzso sequence able to bind to zzso with zzso values in the zzso zzso This zzso was tested in human zzso cultures and reduced the zzso of zzso and the expression levels of zzso zzso regulatory zzso
