The zzso of zzso expressed proteins such as zzso and zzso are commonly subject to rapid zzso zzso and zzso zzso turnover is determined in part by association of certain proteins with consensus zzso motifs zzso in the zzso region of the zzso Here we report a modification of differential zzso display zzso to detect zzso expressed rapid turnover zzso containing zzso motifs from zzso cancer zzso and cell zzso zzso of normal and zzso cancer zzso was zzso displayed using a zzso primer to the zzso tail and an arbitrary zzso incorporating an zzso zzso The appropriateness of the strategy was established by its ability to display known early response zzso such as zzso zzso using partially zzso zzso To test whether the novel zzso isolated coded for transcripts subject to rapid zzso they were used as zzso for Northern blots of zzso from zzso human zzso zzso cell lines treated for varying periods with either zzso or zzso zzso A number of novel zzso expressed zzso fragments were isolated from human zzso zzso zzso zzso among them a zzso with zinc finger motifs and zzso to other zinc finger zzso Using this zzso to probe a zzso library, a full-length zzso zzso was isolated that was zzso zzso in length and contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to multiple transcripts in a zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso and 2 zzso that increased after zzso treatment and decayed zzso h after addition of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in three of six zzso zzso zzso as compared with paired normal zzso tissue zzso The data presented here support the use of a targeted zzso approach for the isolation of rapid turnover zzso many of which may be interesting candidate zzso
