An expression zzso containing two zzso located promoters zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso recognized by two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso was zzso Human alpha 1 zzso gene zzso were cloned in this zzso and their expression was studied in zzso coli strains containing zzso coli zzso zzso or devoid zzso coli zzso of the gene for the zzso zzso zzso We report that simultaneous activity of the two promoters reduces the level of gene expression when compared with the levels of expression corresponding to either zzso or zzso promoter zzso
