The zzso dependence of the transport of three zzso zzso synthetic zzso carrying a net charge of zzso 0 or zzso has been investigated in a brush border membrane zzso preparation obtained from rat zzso zzso zzso studies are consistent with the transport of all peptides studied being through a single zzso The extent and time course of zzso in response to an inwardly directed zzso zzso of zzso differed for each zzso For the zzso zzso zzso this zzso did not stimulate the initial rate of zzso while for the neutral zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso stimulation was zzso However, the effect on zzso was more marked than that on zzso and the zzso zzso differed for these two zzso The calculated Hill zzso for the two zzso peptides were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, providing evidence that the zzso of zzso zzso is different for each zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies on zzso are compatible with this zzso The zzso and molecular implications of this model are discussed, as are the zzso of the conclusions to secondary active transport systems more zzso
