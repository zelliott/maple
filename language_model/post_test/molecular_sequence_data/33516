zzso have significant importance in broad industrial application including zzso zzso Although zzso are widely distributed in zzso plants and animals, it has been sought for new zzso from various sources with special industrial zzso In this study we zzso isolated and characterized a novel zzso zzso from Korean pine zzso zzso was zzso to zzso level with zzso fold of zzso using several techniques such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange and starch affinity zzso The zzso zzso showed two bands in zzso with molecular weight of 44 and 45 zzso The apparent molecular weight of native zzso was calculated to be zzso zzso Internal zzso sequencing confirmed that the zzso zzso was a novel zzso The optimum pH and temperature for zzso activity were pH zzso and 65 degrees C, zzso This zzso was fully stable for zzso at 50 degrees C and retained zzso activity up to zzso The zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of high zzso stability and a broad range of pH stability, the pine seed zzso showed a good prospect of industrial zzso
