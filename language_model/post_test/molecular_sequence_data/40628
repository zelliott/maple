zzso zzso are one of the major zzso components present on the surface of zzso zzso complex zzso that belong to opportunistic pathogens distributed in the natural zzso The zzso of zzso up to around 30 types, are defined by the variable zzso portions of the zzso zzso studies show that zzso 4 is the most prevalent type, and the prognosis of pulmonary disease caused by zzso 4 is significantly worse than that caused by other zzso However, little is known about the zzso of zzso zzso zzso particularly the formation of the zzso portion that determines the properties of zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we focused on one segment that included functionally unknown genes in the zzso zzso gene cluster of a zzso 4 zzso In this segment, a putative zzso protein zzso zzso and its downstream gene were found to be responsible for the formation of the zzso zzso which is unique to zzso zzso zzso Moreover, functional characterization of the zzso gene revealed that it encodes a zzso that transfers a zzso zzso via zzso linkage to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is a key zzso leading to the synthesis of zzso of zzso zzso zzso These findings may provide clues to understanding the biological role of zzso zzso zzso in MAC zzso and may also provide new insights into zzso which generates structural and functional diversity of zzso
