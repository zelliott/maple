A zzso zzso zzso is localized to the zzso division plane before the formation of the zzso zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, and zzso and zzso zzso in the division zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso the direct interaction between zzso and zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso to the division plane, and the formation of the zzso ring and division zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which induce bundling of zzso zzso are also localized to the division zzso during zzso The zzso zzso has two zzso zzso but lacks the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso probably zzso zzso filaments in a zzso insensitive manner during zzso The evidence also indicates that zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in the division zzso In this review, we propose that the zzso signal and its target protein zzso zzso regulate the determination of the division plane, and that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso play pivotal roles in regulating the organization of the zzso ring zzso
