The structure of a zzso zzso zzso complex shows that it contains two zzso zzso that pack against a central domain whose fold resembles that of an zzso binding zzso Comparisons of this structure to that of a zzso in zzso zzso reveals a dramatic zzso in the position of the zzso zzso domain with a shift of up to 60 A and the formation of a totally different interface to the central zzso This zzso appears to be triggered by zzso changes of the switch II region in this domain in response to zzso zzso Modeling studies suggest that this motion represents transitions between the zzso and zzso states of the zzso the effect of which is to alternately expose and bury a positively charged face of the central domain that we suggest is involved in zzso recognition as part of the possible role of this zzso in zzso zzso
