A critical component of zzso cellular differentiation is the acquisition of sensitivity to a restricted subset of zzso hormones and growth zzso This accounts for the unique capability of insulin (and possibly zzso growth zzso but not other growth factors, to stimulate zzso zzso and anabolic metabolism in heart, skeletal muscle, and zzso zzso This selectivity is faithfully zzso in the cultured zzso line, zzso which responds to insulin, but not zzso growth factor zzso with increased zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso which have been implicated as zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and protein zzso were shown to mirror this selectivity in this tissue culture zzso This was particularly apparent in zzso zzso zzso an zzso form of zzso in which insulin activated zzso zzso better than zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso only insulin zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Other signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso did not demonstrate this selective responsiveness to insulin but were instead activated comparably by both insulin and zzso Moreover, concurrent treatment with zzso and insulin did not diminish zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating that zzso did not simultaneously activate an zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and insulin comparably zzso both zzso zzso as well as numerous other signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that differential zzso of zzso in zzso may contribute to zzso exclusive mediation of the zzso events involved in zzso zzso Moreover, they suggest a novel mechanism by which zzso hormone selectivity is zzso through the suppression of specific signaling pathways operational in zzso cell zzso
