Studies on zzso metabolism in the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso grows rapidly on zzso (but not on zzso as sole zzso and energy zzso zzso is initially converted into the zzso zzso intermediate zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subsequently converts zzso into zzso which is used partly for the zzso of aromatic zzso zzso and is partly zzso via zzso and the zzso zzso zzso studies and analysis of zzso clearly showed that the single zzso zzso present in zzso zzso has a dual function, the first example of a zzso zzso zzso involved in both the zzso of zzso and the zzso of aromatic zzso zzso This zzso was zzso over zzso to zzso Its further characterization indicated that it is a Type II zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a large zzso structure zzso zzso 135 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso of aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggested that genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are genetically linked but their zzso results in the synthesis of two separate zzso
