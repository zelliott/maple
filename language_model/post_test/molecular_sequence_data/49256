Recent studies in zzso zzso mice have shown that the targeted zzso of zzso leads to pathological changes of the zzso intermediate filament zzso as well as structural and functional abnormalities of zzso in zzso zzso Here, we report on a novel zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso in a 40-year-old patient with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso leads to a zzso and a truncated zzso zzso Using zzso studies in zzso and zzso cells, we show that the zzso zzso zzso is incapable of forming a zzso intermediate filament zzso Furthermore, it zzso the collapse of a pre-existing zzso zzso alters the zzso distribution of zzso and leads to abnormal zzso protein zzso reminiscent of zzso zzso material seen in the zzso analysis of the patient's zzso Analysis of zzso function in isolated zzso skeletal muscle zzso from our patient showed decreased zzso rates of zzso with the zzso zzso combination zzso and zzso as well as a higher zzso sensitivity of zzso indicating an in zzso zzso of complex I zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a dominant negative effect on the zzso process of zzso intermediate filaments and affects not only the zzso distribution, but also zzso properties of zzso in diseased human skeletal zzso As a consequence, the intermediate filament zzso zzso dysfunction may contribute to the zzso process leading to progressive muscle dysfunction in human zzso
