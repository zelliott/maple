The marine zzso zzso whose simple nervous system zzso study of the neural basis of behavior, was used to investigate the role of zzso zzso in feeding zzso Several novel zzso zzso were zzso and localized to identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated that these peptides are released when the zzso fire at zzso that occur during normal behavior, and that the peptides modify the relationship between muscle contraction zzso and relaxation rate so as to maintain optimal motor output when the intensity and frequency of feeding behavior zzso
