Heat shock proteins zzso are a family of highly zzso cellular proteins present in all organisms, zzso a range of essential zzso and zzso functions as well-known molecular zzso and recently as regulators of the immune zzso By zzso suppression zzso three zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso embryonic cells zzso after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso proteins all possess the zzso zzso domain, a signature motif of the zzso zzso Based on different protein structure and zzso analysis, they can be zzso into two zzso zzso for Type I zzso zzso and zzso for Type II zzso Further expression analysis revealed two very different types of zzso in response either to heat shock or to virus infection, with a marked induction for zzso and a weak one for both zzso and zzso A very distinct tissue distribution of zzso was also revealed among the three zzso even between zzso and zzso This is the first report on the zzso induction of zzso in zzso zzso fish cells, and the differential expressions might reflect their different roles in zzso and stressed zzso
