Adult bone zzso zzso contains a source of zzso stem cells zzso that have the capacity to zzso and differentiate into multiple zzso zzso These rare cells can be zzso indirectly by the formation of zzso zzso containing stem cells and their differentiated progeny in long-term zzso If zzso and their associated zzso and precursor populations are to reach their full therapeutic potential, markers will be required to identify and characterize specific bone zzso zzso zzso We sought to use zzso display to generate zzso against bone zzso zzso cells zzso enriched for colony forming zzso Initially, we identified our target cell population by comparing the colony forming efficiency zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso gave the greatest enrichment zzso of colony forming cells and in light of these findings, we generated zzso zzso against zzso zzso by simultaneous zzso zzso A dominant clone zzso generated after 3 rounds of selection, has been isolated and zzso then characterized for cell and tissue zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso and zzso gene segments of zzso aligned most closely to the zzso and zzso zzso V segments found in the synthetic zzso zzso bound to zzso of freshly isolated zzso and localized to zzso cells and zzso zzso cells in areas of active bone formation in sections of zzso zzso binding was zzso in cultured bone zzso zzso cells zzso and was also detected on zzso cell zzso This report demonstrates that zzso display is a powerful tool for the isolation of zzso against rare cell zzso and provides a platform for the future application of this technology in the search for zzso on zzso and other rare cell zzso
