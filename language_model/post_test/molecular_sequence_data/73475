zzso and zzso zzso have recently been shown to bind to snake zzso zzso and to zzso its penetration into zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso we analyze the zzso domain of zzso using 10 zzso from Taiwan and African zzso zzso We also performed computer modeling to obtain more information of the binding at molecular zzso The results provide a molecular model for interaction of zzso complex where the zzso belt of the zzso zzso on the zzso surface of three finger zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso molecules followed by specific binding of zzso zzso near the tip of loop 2 of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso differ by as much as 4 orders of zzso ranging from approximately 140 zzso for toxin gamma to approximately 20 zzso for zzso zzso depending on the presence of zzso zzso near the tip of loop zzso High affinity zzso binding becomes possible due to the presence of zzso zzso or the so-called consensus zzso binding sequence of zzso near the tip of the zzso The well defined zzso loop structure of zzso provides an interesting template for the design of high affinity zzso zzso with zzso zzso The finding that several zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind to zzso with different affinity may provide information on the synergistic action of the two zzso zzso
