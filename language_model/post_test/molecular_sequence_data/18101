The isolation and sequence of a zzso clone zzso the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso Taking advantage of the zzso chain reaction technology partial zzso clones from the central part, the 3' part and the zzso part of the zzso were obtained with zzso based on directly determined zzso acid zzso zzso two complete zzso clones for zzso were zzso with a sense primer corresponding to the zzso sequence of the zzso terminal end of zzso and two zzso zzso corresponding to the major alternative zzso sites found in the zzso The zzso acid zzso for zzso and zzso binding identified by X-ray zzso for pig heart zzso zzso are zzso in the 320 zzso acid long mature zzso zzso A zzso of 27 zzso acids is present at the zzso terminal end of the precursor zzso
