The zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to grow on zzso as a sole carbon zzso Under these conditions, high levels of a zzso zzso are zzso into the zzso After zzso and characterization of this zzso we have isolated both the zzso zzso and the zzso sequence by using zzso derived from partial zzso acid zzso sequences of the zzso zzso The gene is approximately zzso zzso in zzso and comparison of the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso and the zzso clone revealed the presence of ten zzso and nine zzso All zzso zzso junctions exactly follow the zzso rule, except for the seventh zzso which shows zzso zzso zzso zzso The immediate zzso region of the first zzso contains one putative zzso consensus sequence and a perfect zzso zzso zzso extension analysis revealed two zzso start points located 38 and 34 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso A sequence of 23 zzso representing a typical signal zzso is present at the N zzso of the deduced zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of total cellular zzso indicated that zzso encodes a zzso transcript which is induced by zzso The zzso sequence of zzso shows considerable zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from different bacteria, zzso and zzso
