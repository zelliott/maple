To date there are few compounds known to zzso discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso The present study stemmed from an observation that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso act with much lower zzso efficacy at zzso zzso than at zzso zzso We sought to understand the structural basis of this difference to provide insights relevant to the development of zzso zzso as leads for the development of new zzso zzso Using zzso of zzso and zzso zzso we identified the structurally divergent zzso zzso segment and zzso tail as a specific zzso of the efficacy zzso Because zzso of individual zzso zzso zzso had little influence on zzso zzso the reduced zzso efficacy at zzso zzso is most likely a distributed effect of all zzso zzso zzso Given the lack of contact between zzso and other zzso zzso the efficacy differences are probably zzso by differential interactions with the surrounding zzso zzso This may explain why zzso zzso zzso differ among expression systems where membrane zzso composition is not zzso It may also explain why zzso zzso efficacy increases at high expression zzso as this would increase the propensity of receptors to cluster thereby inducing zzso segments of neighboring receptors to zzso This strong influence of zzso primary structure on partial zzso efficacy suggests that the relatively poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso segment may be a promising domain to target in the search for zzso zzso zzso
