zzso forms of zzso zzso human factor H binding protein zzso are undergoing clinical trials in candidate vaccines against invasive zzso zzso B zzso We report an extensive survey and zzso analysis of the diversity of zzso genes and predicted protein sequences in invasive clinical zzso obtained in the period zzso 

zzso sequences of zzso genes were obtained from zzso invasive zzso zzso zzso B zzso strains from the United States, Europe, New Zealand, and South zzso zzso sequence typing zzso analysis was performed on a subset of the zzso 

Every strain contained the zzso zzso All sequences fell into 1 of 2 zzso (A or B), with zzso zzso acid identity between zzso and at least zzso identity within each zzso One zzso sequence may have arisen via zzso zzso zzso B sequences were found in zzso of the zzso and zzso A sequences were found in zzso Multiple zzso zzso were detected in each of the common zzso zzso zzso All major zzso complexes include strains in both zzso A and zzso zzso 

The diversity of strains observed underscores the importance of studying the distribution of the vaccine zzso itself rather than relying on common zzso surrogates such as zzso
