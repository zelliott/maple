We have constructed a zzso zzso for the cloning and stable expression of foreign genes in the zzso of attenuated zzso zzso Using this zzso expression zzso zzso we expressed the zzso zzso gene of the mouse malaria zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso Mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso mount a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that attenuated zzso can elicit a specific zzso response to a foreign protein in zzso The ability to easily and zzso express foreign genes from the zzso zzso and the generation of specific zzso greatly expands the potential of zzso as an zzso zzso
