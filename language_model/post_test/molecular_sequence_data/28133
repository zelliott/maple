The significance of zzso zzso upstream zzso sequences zzso for differential zzso fix and zzso gene expression was investigated by two zzso zzso hybrid zzso and zzso zzso were constructed by zzso a zzso zzso in front of their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated carrying specific zzso deletions or zzso zzso insertions within the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not affected, and expression of zzso decreased only to zzso when the respective zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso This shows that in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of at least the zzso promoter does not require the presence of a closely adjacent zzso zzso of the zzso in front of the zzso gene not only reduced the expression of zzso down to zzso but, surprisingly, also resulted in a reduction of the zzso zzso level to less than zzso This suggests that the zzso may exert a long-range effect on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cluster I or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in front of the zzso and zzso promoters strongly enhanced zzso and zzso zzso
