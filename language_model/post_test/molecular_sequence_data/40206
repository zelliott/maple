zzso zzso type 2 zzso causes acute zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is prone to genetic evolution and has undergone several zzso that produced different strains like zzso zzso New zzso New zzso and zzso in the past three zzso zzso affecting the zzso gene of zzso have been responsible for evolution of different zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene of the virus and subsequent characterization is important for molecular zzso The present study was conducted to isolate and to characterize the virus by amplifying partial zzso gene and further sequence analysis and also to estimate zzso relationship of field virus with the reference zzso Out of 77 samples, 51 samples were found to be positive by zzso and all the 51 samples were subjected for virus isolation in zzso cell zzso Sixteen viruses could be isolated and 10 randomly selected zzso were subjected to sequence analysis along with four random clinical zzso All the 10 zzso and 4 clinical samples were characterized as New zzso zzso with zzso One of the field zzso was found to be zzso closely related to New zzso strains of Japan and zzso another field zzso was found to share ancestral origins with New zzso strains of Korea, USA, Italy, Brazil, Germany, Taiwan and zzso rest other sequences had distinct lineage but shared molecular relationship with New zzso reference zzso
