zzso zzso zzso belong to the family of zzso acid zzso We have cloned the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso by the zzso zzso sequence consists of 463 zzso acids and has a Mr of zzso The protein deduced from the zzso zzso sequence consists of zzso zzso acids corresponding to a Mr of zzso Both predicted zzso acid sequences exhibited high identity zzso to zzso to known zzso This high level of identity allowed the zzso of all available zzso zzso based on the three-dimensional structure coordinates of the zzso zzso zzso By this approach we identified 21 zzso acids which are zzso in zzso zzso zzso and are part of the zzso forming the zzso zzso Furthermore, potential zzso sites were identified and compared between the aforementioned zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
