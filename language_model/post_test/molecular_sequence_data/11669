The identification of transcripts zzso putative zzso receptors in zzso germ cells zzso has generated the hypothesis that zzso receptors may serve a zzso role in zzso zzso during zzso We have sought to identify and zzso these receptors and their regulatory machinery in rat zzso in order to gain further insight into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We conducted reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso directed against sequences zzso across members of the known zzso zzso family to identify transcripts from zzso and round zzso Western analysis and zzso were performed using zzso raised against two zzso sequences zzso among zzso receptors and using fusion protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso 

We detected transcripts zzso putative zzso receptors in both zzso and round zzso of the adult zzso zzso zzso of the zzso products demonstrated the existence of multiple gene zzso Two zzso zzso zzso specifically recognized a 64 zzso band in rat zzso preparations by Western zzso The proteins zzso and zzso implicated in zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso extracts using Western zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso and to the zzso of mature zzso 

The specific zzso of zzso receptors to the respiratory center of mature zzso is consistent with a role for these proteins in zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso it is plausible that zzso and zzso function in zzso to regulate putative zzso zzso
