zzso zzso was found to stimulate zzso zzso zzso II only and not mouse zzso zzso zzso To identify the molecular region of zzso that defines species zzso we constructed six hybrid zzso molecules consisting of three regions from zzso and/or zzso cell zzso and examined their activity in terms of zzso zzso II specificity and suppression of zzso sensitivity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the region zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso is indispensable for specific interaction with zzso zzso zzso II in zzso and for suppression of zzso sensitivity in zzso The corresponding region of zzso cell zzso the region zzso was also shown to be essential for its interaction with mouse zzso zzso zzso This region is known to be less zzso than the zzso and zzso regions in the zzso family suggesting that it is important in the interaction with zzso machinery proteins in a tissue and/or zzso zzso
