The zzso proteins zzso named as zzso zzso constitute a large zzso of zzso widespread among zzso and zzso zzso zzso from both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes zzso for zzso zzso are also present in the zzso of some zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fingerprint of this zzso family is the conservation of a zzso structural core, built by a zzso domain, at the zzso region, zzso a zzso zzso site, and a zzso domain, containing one zzso zzso These zzso have a significant zzso oxide zzso activity, and there is increasing evidence that they are involved in microbial resistance to zzso zzso In this review, we will discuss available data for this novel family of zzso including their zzso properties, structural and zzso zzso zzso properties and the molecular genetic approaches so far used to tackle their zzso
