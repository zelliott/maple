A zzso highly zzso zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome zzso virus zzso zzso vaccine strain was derived from the zzso zzso strain by passage 92 times in the African green monkey kidney zzso cell line zzso We found that the zzso of the zzso strain to zzso was decreased greatly from passage zzso To identify zzso associated with zzso of the zzso vaccine strain, we determined the zzso changes that arose during zzso passage of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso strain contains a 360 zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion and a 118 zzso zzso that resulted in 48 zzso acid zzso Analysis of the complete zzso sequences of intermediate zzso viruses zzso zzso and zzso showed that 31 zzso of the 48 zzso acid zzso occurred in zzso 7 zzso occurred in zzso 7 zzso occurred in zzso and 3 zzso occurred in zzso The 120 zzso acid deletion occurred from zzso to zzso zzso we hypothesized that the 31 zzso acid zzso distributed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the continuous 120 zzso acid deletion in the zzso region from zzso provide a strong potential molecular basis for the observed attenuated zzso
