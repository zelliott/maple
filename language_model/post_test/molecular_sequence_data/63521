zzso resistance to zzso agents is an important clinical problem during the treatment of zzso The resistance process is zzso To realize the total factors involved in zzso resistance, we analyzed the zzso expressed proteins of zzso and zzso cells and we investigated one of the zzso proteins zzso using zzso to determine its role in zzso zzso 

zzso protein expressions between zzso zzso zzso cell line) and zzso zzso zzso resistant cell line induced by zzso were identified by zzso coupled with mass zzso Meanwhile, we confirmed the differential expression of zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso cells by Western zzso zzso Furthermore, we used zzso interference to silence the zzso gene zzso 

Among the 9 zzso expressed zzso 3 were zzso in zzso cells, while 6 were zzso in the zzso cells compared with its parent cell zzso The expression of zzso was zzso significantly in zzso cells, and it can be decreased by zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso resistance of zzso cells was efficiently reversed by silence of zzso gene zzso 

The data provided the zzso expressed proteins in zzso and its resistant cell line and highlights the power of zzso for the discovery of resistance markers in zzso We found zzso may be a new protein involved in the zzso resistance of zzso zzso
