An zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso times baseline levels, the presentation of synthetic zzso peptides to zzso T cell zzso by an exchange mechanism at cell surface zzso class II zzso Two differing activities, to promote the release of zzso zzso in the presence or absence in solution of a second zzso zzso were characterized with zzso zzso through zzso for release or binding of human zzso basic protein zzso (*) zzso zzso on zzso zzso 1) release of bound zzso zzso from zzso in the presence or absence of free zzso zzso in solution, 2) exchange of zzso zzso from solution with zzso zzso on zzso and 3) binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso released zzso zzso zzso from zzso without free zzso zzso in zzso They also exchanged zzso zzso from solution for zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso released zzso zzso only when free zzso zzso was in zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso released zzso zzso without zzso zzso in zzso Either type of zzso accelerated zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso Competitive binding zzso with zzso zzso or several zzso zzso zzso with respective not zzso forms, demonstrated that the zzso zzso binding site was distinct from the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso
