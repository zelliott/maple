The zzso zzso zzso human alpha zzso zzso zzso and chicken zzso have been compared with respect to their zzso region sequences and interactions with two human zzso zzso zzso and zzso A stretch of 34 zzso acid zzso of the zzso bait region sequence was determined and the zzso zzso zzso sites zzso zzso zzso a zzso bond where X was unidentified, whereas the major zzso site by zzso was at the zzso bond, 4 zzso on the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the alpha zzso bait region at the zzso bond, and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso similarity in the bait region of members of the zzso family is zzso zzso The kinetic studies indicate that alpha zzso is a zzso better zzso for zzso than type I zzso zzso predictions based on the bait region sequences suggest that a zzso triple zzso structure is not a prerequisite for the efficient binding of tissue zzso to a zzso The binding of zzso to alpha zzso is slower than that of zzso zzso zzso with zzso even more zzso Despite the preference of chicken zzso for zzso human alpha zzso a far less selective zzso zzso more rapidly with zzso and zzso These results suggest that alpha zzso may play an important role in regulating the activities of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
