The zzso zzso sequence of the entire coding region of the zzso gene of zzso zzso virus type 2 zzso is zzso The zzso acid zzso sequence deduced from the zzso sequence has been compared to analogous zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso gene that causes cell zzso The zzso sequences are zzso zzso and contain a highly zzso region of 90 zzso These results identify some of the zzso regions in the coding sequences between the two zzso
