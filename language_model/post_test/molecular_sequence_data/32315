The zzso fungus zzso zzso has a zzso respiratory zzso Several alternative zzso aside from the zzso complex I zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso Based on zzso searches in the zzso zzso we have tentatively identified one of these zzso The corresponding gene was zzso by the generation of zzso point zzso and a zzso strain was zzso This zzso is deficient in the zzso of zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso Thus, a fourth zzso alternative zzso zzso named zzso was recognized in zzso zzso Interestingly, a combination of Western zzso analysis of cell zzso and the in zzso detection of the protein fused to the green fluorescent protein revealed that it is also located in the zzso zzso In contrast to the other zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene is zzso in the late exponential growth phase of zzso zzso The absence of the protein results in an zzso of the zzso transcript in this phase of growth, suggesting that the proteins are important in specific stages of zzso zzso The identification of the proteins responsible for the entry point of electrons from zzso into the respiratory chain of zzso zzso is likely zzso
