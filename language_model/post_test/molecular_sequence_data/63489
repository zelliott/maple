Two zzso peptides encompassing the seventh zzso section of zzso a from zzso from zzso zzso were studied as complexes with zzso zzso by CD and zzso zzso with the goal to use zzso to provide a zzso environment for the zzso CD zzso was used to obtain the overall secondary structure of the zzso whereas zzso zzso provided information about the local environment of their zzso zzso The zzso results indicate that both peptides are trapped by zzso and the CD results that they adopt a zzso zzso This result is in contrast with previous work that showed that the same peptides are zzso in zzso zzso and organic zzso These observations are discussed in the context of zzso zzso properties and zzso zzso structural zzso
