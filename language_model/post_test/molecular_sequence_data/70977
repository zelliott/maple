zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses against at least four distinct zzso zzso C, D, and zzso Recent studies have shown that the main component of the zzso response against the zzso tumor is targeted against zzso zzso and zzso The gene zzso has been well zzso It encodes the zzso zzso in the form of a zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso and zzso which are recognized by different zzso Here, we report the identification of the zzso zzso Using a zzso library derived from tumor zzso we identified the gene coding for zzso We also characterized the zzso zzso that zzso zzso recognize on the zzso class I zzso zzso The zzso zzso results from a zzso within an zzso expressed gene zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that is believed to be important in the protection of proteins against the zzso of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso mice zzso with zzso tumor cells zzso that were constructed to express zzso and zzso did not induce resistance against live zzso even though a strong zzso zzso response was observed with zzso from zzso zzso
