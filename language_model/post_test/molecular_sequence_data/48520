zzso is a major zzso that acts in many cellular events such as zzso degradation and membrane zzso Its specificity depends on a set of zzso zzso most of them containing the zzso regulatory X zzso zzso Using a differential zzso system, we isolated a zzso protein that is expressed during the early phase of male zzso development in the crop zzso zzso and isolated and characterized its closest zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed broadly in both the zzso and zzso due to regulation zzso by its first zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was assigned mainly to the nucleus in both the zzso and in zzso mirroring the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts specifically with zzso in zzso as well as in zzso in the zzso This interaction was zzso through the zzso zzso domain, which is located at the protein zzso while an zzso zzso domain zzso its interaction with zzso zzso with those results, a zzso hybrid analysis showed that zzso can act as a bridge between zzso and zzso suggesting a role in targeted protein zzso It is likely that zzso acts zzso with other members of the zzso zzso family because a zzso zzso zzso does not display obvious zzso zzso
