During T zzso immune response, zzso center B cells accumulate zzso zzso in their zzso zzso genes and give rise to zzso B zzso We tested several culture conditions for triggering zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells after zzso their membrane zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced proliferation and zzso switch without zzso zzso In contrast, after zzso with zzso cloned T cells, zzso zzso accumulated in a fraction of zzso B zzso zzso included shared as well as independent events in zzso related zzso allowing zzso of zzso trees generated in zzso zzso zzso B cells sorted for zzso expression can be induced to mutate their zzso zzso gene upon zzso with activated T cells, thereby providing a model to study zzso zzso in zzso
