zzso is a zzso zzso factor required for the normal development of zzso limb structures, the zzso basement zzso the anterior segment of the eye, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause nail zzso syndrome zzso To further understand zzso gene regulation and to identify zzso zzso within the coding region, a detailed analysis of zzso gene structure was zzso zzso zzso and primer extension identified a long zzso zzso region of zzso zzso that contains two upstream zzso frames zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that sequences required for zzso promoter activity extend no further than 112 zzso zzso An additional 47 zzso have been identified in the coding region, as well as nine deletions of large portions of the zzso but not in the promoter or highly zzso zzso zzso The range of zzso and the identification of zzso suggest further complexity in the regulation of zzso zzso
