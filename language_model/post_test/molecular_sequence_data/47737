We have cloned six fluorescent proteins zzso to the green fluorescent protein zzso from zzso zzso Two of these have spectral characteristics dramatically different from zzso emitting at yellow and red zzso All the proteins were isolated from zzso reef zzso demonstrating that zzso proteins are not always functionally linked to zzso The new proteins share the same zzso fold first observed in zzso and this provided a basis for the comparative analysis of structural features important for zzso The usefulness of the new proteins for in zzso labeling was demonstrated by expressing them in zzso cell culture and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
