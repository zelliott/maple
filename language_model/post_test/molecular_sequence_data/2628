Five clones that zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso gene were obtained by screening a human zzso library in a zzso zzso The zzso of two of these clones were partially zzso and found to contain a region with considerable zzso to part of the zzso zzso These two clones were found to contain zzso family repeating zzso This finding is discussed in relation with possible functions of the zzso zzso As the zzso family is zzso the zzso gene may be zzso by zzso at this zzso zzso Another possibility related with the DNA binding properties of zzso and zzso family proteins is also zzso
