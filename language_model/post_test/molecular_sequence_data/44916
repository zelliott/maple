Cystic zzso is a human zzso genetic disease caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a membrane protein which functions as a zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso The most frequent zzso a deletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso is located in the first zzso binding domain of zzso zzso This zzso leads to a folding zzso in zzso responsible for an incomplete maturation of zzso The absence of zzso at the surface of zzso cells causes the zzso zzso of the three-dimensional zzso structure of zzso is a key step to understanding the zzso induced by the zzso In the absence of any experimental data, we have chosen to build a zzso model for zzso This model was built by zzso zzso starting from zzso the only protein of known zzso structure in the zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso This new model defines the central and critical position of zzso predicted in the zzso core of zzso zzso indeed could be involved in zzso interactions to ensure a correct folding zzso Moreover, this model enables the zzso of the zzso sequence (a highly zzso sequence in the ABC zzso in a loop, at the surface of the zzso This reinforces the hypothesis of its role for mediation of zzso interactions of functional significance for the channel zzso Finally, the model also allows zzso of the ends of zzso within the zzso zzso These zzso are defined by the secondary structure elements that are involved in the zzso zzso They lead to reconsideration of the zzso limit which was initially defined by the end of zzso zzso
