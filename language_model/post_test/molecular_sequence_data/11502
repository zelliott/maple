As suggested by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced very small amounts zzso U zzso of an inhibitor protein zzso that shows an zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and that is localized in the zzso of cells at the optimal growth temperature of 25 degrees zzso A zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes produced 20 U of zzso zzso that is also localized in the zzso of cells at 25 degrees zzso However, a large amount of zzso zzso zzso was zzso produced at the zzso growth temperature 37 degrees C from the zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso from the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso grown at 37 degrees C, and some zzso properties were zzso zzso had a zzso value of about zzso and was a zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso was produced from a precursor zzso by zzso of a signal zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The inhibitor was stable in boiling water for up to 30 zzso The zzso of zzso can be attributed to its zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso by formation of a zzso complex with a zzso ratio of zzso and showed a high zzso zzso which inhibited only zzso among the various zzso we zzso
