zzso and chemically distinct aquifers were screened for the presence of two genes coding for key zzso of the reverse zzso acid zzso cycle in zzso bacteria, zzso : zzso zzso zzso and the beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From 42 samples investigated, zzso genes were detected in two and zzso genes in six samples retrieved from zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were represented by a single zzso of almost identical sequences closely affiliated with zzso zzso zzso In contrast, sequences analysis of zzso genes revealed diverse zzso mainly related to sequences from zzso zzso
