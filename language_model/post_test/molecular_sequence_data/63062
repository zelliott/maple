Together with zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family of bacterial zzso zzso pathogens use a type III zzso system zzso to zzso an assortment of zzso zzso zzso both within and outside the locus of zzso zzso zzso into the zzso host cell, leading to the formation of zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso among zzso pathogens and shares identity with zzso a type III zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso cells requires a functional zzso and signals located at its zzso zzso zzso of zzso is not significantly reduced in zzso lacking the zzso regulators zzso and zzso however, zzso protein levels are highly reduced in these zzso as well as in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso zzso restores zzso levels even in the absence of zzso Our results indicate that the efficient engagement of zzso in active zzso is needed for its stability, thus establishing a zzso regulatory mechanism that zzso zzso levels with the expression of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a moderate zzso during the colonization of zzso mice at early stages of zzso
