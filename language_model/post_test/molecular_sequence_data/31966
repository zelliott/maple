In the era of functional zzso the role of zzso factor zzso binding affinity is of increasing zzso for example, it has recently been proposed that zzso zzso binding events, though zzso are functionally zzso Here, we investigate the role of binding site affinity in the zzso interpretation of zzso zzso zzso zzso We noted that enhancers of several zzso zzso genes have low predicted affinity for zzso the zzso family zzso that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to our initial hypothesis, improving the affinity of zzso sites in enhancers of zzso wingless and zzso by zzso optimal sites from the patched zzso did not result in zzso responses to zzso zzso Instead, we found that these enhancers require zzso binding sites for normal zzso in regions of relatively low zzso When zzso sites in these enhancers were altered to improve their binding zzso we observed patterning defects in the zzso response that are consistent with a switch from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso transgenic reporters containing isolated zzso sites confirmed this finding in zzso zzso We propose that the requirement for gene zzso by zzso in the regions of zzso zzso zzso results in evolutionary pressure zzso weak binding sites in enhancers of certain zzso target zzso
