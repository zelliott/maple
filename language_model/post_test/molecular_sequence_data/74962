The activity of zzso zzso zzso an zzso which plays a regulatory role in the synthesis of cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso has been measured in the developing zzso of the sea zzso zzso activity increased at least zzso during development from the zzso egg to the zzso stage zzso zzso experiments suggested that the low level of zzso activity found at early stages was not due to the presence of zzso in the egg or zzso The zzso in the sea zzso zzso exhibited properties different from that found in zzso only a fraction of the activity could be zzso from zzso and mild zzso zzso the zzso without releasing any of it from the zzso in soluble zzso To further study the sea zzso zzso zzso a zzso clone was identified by zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this clone revealed a coding region that shares a high degree of zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels using a restriction zzso derived from the zzso clone revealed a zzso zzso zzso that increased zzso during development from the egg to the zzso stage and then decreased zzso at the zzso zzso Since the relative increase in zzso zzso zzso was less than the increase in zzso activity zzso versus zzso factors in addition to the level of zzso may control the activity of this zzso during zzso
