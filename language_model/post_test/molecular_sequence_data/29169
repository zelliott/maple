zzso P zzso P) is a ubiquitous zzso that zzso precursor zzso to generate mature zzso zzso Although zzso P from all zzso of life have been found to have essential zzso zzso the number and size of the protein zzso ranges from one small protein in bacteria to at least nine proteins of up to 100 zzso In zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso the zzso is composed of ten zzso a single zzso and nine essential zzso The spatial organization of these components within the zzso is not yet zzso In this study we examine the likely zzso zzso and zzso zzso interactions by using directed two- and zzso tests in zzso Only two protein zzso zzso and zzso specifically bind the zzso zzso zzso also zzso with seven of the other eight protein zzso The remaining protein zzso all showed one or more specific zzso interactions with the other integral protein zzso Of particular interest was the behavior of zzso the only protein zzso found in zzso P but not in the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts strongly with itself as well as with zzso Similar interactions with self and zzso were also detected for zzso the only unique protein zzso so far identified in zzso zzso This observation is consistent with zzso and zzso serving analogous functions in the two zzso This study provides a zzso map of the zzso architecture of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso P from zzso zzso
