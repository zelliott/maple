zzso zzso a zzso green zzso that can tolerate an extreme variation of salt concentration is being studied as a model system to analyze the tolerance of zzso stresses at the molecular zzso Upon abnormal zzso levels, new transcripts were abundantly expressed in cells of the zzso zzso gene discovery efforts utilizing zzso cells had identified one zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with significant similarity to a zzso zzso related gene zzso from zzso zzso and to early light zzso genes zzso of higher zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso zzso a 190 zzso acid deduced zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The three zzso structure of zzso modeled by computer zzso modeling techniques showed that the protein possessed three predicted zzso zzso and six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clearly demonstrated that zzso zzso can be rapidly induced by high light intensity and salt zzso The results presented in this work are consistent with the earlier proposal zzso et zzso 2001 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2003 Plant zzso zzso that the zzso protein is an zzso response to zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and plays a key role in the protection and/or repair of the zzso zzso
