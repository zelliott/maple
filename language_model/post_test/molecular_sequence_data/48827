A novel zzso moderately zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from water of the zzso lake zzso in Iran and characterized zzso using a zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso rods and produced zzso zzso at a central or zzso position in swollen zzso zzso zzso was a strictly zzso zzso zzso and zzso The strain was able to grow at zzso zzso of zzso % zzso with optimum growth occurring at zzso % zzso zzso The optimum temperature and pH for growth were 40 zzso and pH zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strain zzso was shown to belong to the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and showed the closest zzso similarity with the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of the type strain of the novel species was zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso : 0 and zzso : 0, and the polar zzso pattern consisted of zzso zzso two unknown zzso an unknown zzso and an unknown zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso All these features confirm the placement of isolate zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed low levels of zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (19 zzso On the basis of zzso evidence from this study, a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
