This is the first detailed report about the zzso zzso of the teeth of zzso zzso We have examined the fine structure of the zzso zzso and zzso organ of zzso during zzso by light and transmission electron zzso An zzso analysis with an zzso against bovine zzso an zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso against the zzso middle region and zzso of zzso zzso has also been performed to examine the zzso zzso zzso present in these zzso Their zzso contain fully developed zzso apparatus, rough zzso zzso and zzso zzso During zzso zzso formation, an zzso fine zzso zzso containing no collagen zzso is found between the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso is distinguishable from zzso because of its higher density and differences in the arrangement of its zzso The fine structural features of zzso zzso in zzso are similar to those of tooth zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso shows intense zzso to the zzso and zzso against zzso zzso and to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the proteins in the zzso of zzso contain zzso that closely resemble those of bovine and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which exhibits positive zzso to zzso zzso extends to the cap zzso surface, zzso that zzso proteins are zzso by zzso as a thin zzso layer that covers the cap zzso after zzso zzso
