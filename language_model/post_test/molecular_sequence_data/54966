The importance of zzso carrier family 11 zzso in zzso zzso transport has been well zzso The core zzso zzso and zzso of the proteins were modeled as a zzso but zzso zzso arrangement with respect to membrane zzso In this article, the structures and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso incorporated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were explored using circular zzso fluorescence, and attenuated total reflection zzso transform infrared zzso zzso The segments zzso were inserted in zzso zzso mainly as an zzso with zzso of zzso along membrane zzso The tilt angles of the zzso were in an order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso In contrast, zzso was partly inserted in zzso leaving partial segment at membrane zzso The amount of the zzso component with zzso charged zzso had an effect on both the zzso and orientation of the zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso maintained similar zzso in various zzso
