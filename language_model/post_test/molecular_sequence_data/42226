A zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified using a zzso zzso probe generated by zzso and cloned in zzso zzso zzso sequences were generated by inverse zzso The two cloned fragments partially zzso and sequencing of zzso zzso revealed the presence of four open reading frames in the order zzso zzso encodes a 39 zzso protein of unknown function which shows considerable sequence zzso with the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The downstream zzso showed high zzso to the zzso and zzso genes of other zzso The zzso protein has a characteristic zzso deletion exhibited by all the known zzso proteins of zzso zzso In many bacteria the zzso and zzso genes are found as part of the same zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is unusual in that the zzso gene is followed by a putative zzso zzso and a fourth large zzso which shares no zzso with the zzso genes of other bacteria but has a small degree of zzso with various membrane zzso zzso promoter sequences are found upstream of both zzso and zzso A 12 zzso zzso repeat is found upstream of the putative promoter of zzso and an 8 zzso zzso repeat is found between this promoter and the zzso initiation zzso These repeats are thought to be involved in regulation of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is induced approximately zzso on heat shock at 42 degrees zzso
