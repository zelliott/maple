Plant zzso initiate the synthesis of zzso by catalyzing the incorporation of molecular oxygen at the zzso carbon atom of fatty zzso Previously, zzso has been shown to display zzso activity and to be implicated in plant zzso In this study, we investigated the function of a second zzso zzso zzso in tomato zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso the conversion of a wide range of fatty acids into zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was found in zzso and increased during zzso induced by detachment of zzso In contrast, microbial infection, earlier known to increase the expression of zzso did not alter the expression of zzso or zzso The tomato zzso zzso characterized by early zzso and zzso zzso carries a zzso at the zzso locus and was chosen for functional studies of zzso zzso changes in such zzso showed the zzso of genes playing roles in zzso and zzso zzso the latter being in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso partially zzso the compromised zzso in mature plants and fully zzso it in zzso thus indicating the functional zzso between zzso from tomato and zzso However, deletion of zzso in zzso plants did not provoke any visible zzso zzso indicating that the relative importance of zzso in plant physiology is species zzso
