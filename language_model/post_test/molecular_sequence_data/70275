zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been prepared by chemical and/or zzso methods with single sites of zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (75 and 125 zzso zzso zzso of 1-3 have been zzso yielding zzso zzso and zzso spin zzso zzso that were used to assess zzso ring and zzso bond zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso mobility of the zzso ring in 3 is altered when incorporated into zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso spin zzso across the zzso linkage suggest a zzso zzso angle different from that observed in the crystal zzso appears zzso zzso between the strength of the zzso effect and hydrogen bonding in solution may be responsible, in part, for the apparent zzso flexibility of zzso In addition, spin zzso in 2 and 3 have been compared to those measured previously in zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, as a means to study the effect of zzso and zzso substitution on the solution zzso of the zzso zzso The conversion of 4 to 2 is accompanied by minimal zzso change, whereas a significant change accompanies the conversion of 5 to 3, showing that the effect of substitution on ring zzso depends highly on ring zzso before and after zzso
