In the zzso zzso four zzso zzso factors have been found involved in the regulation of milk protein zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso milk protein binding factor zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso gene promoter contains motifs highly zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso consensus zzso These zzso factors were zzso simultaneously using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso on nuclear protein extracts derived from pregnant or zzso rabbit zzso zzso The specificity of these complexes was zzso in zzso zzso zzso It was shown that in the rabbit zzso zzso the zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso change during pregnancy and zzso zzso extracts of zzso isolated from zzso zzso of 15-day pregnant rabbits form zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the extracts from zzso zzso of late pregnant zzso 25) and zzso zzso 5) rabbits additional zzso highly specific zzso complexes are zzso Their appearance changes in parallel with the zzso of zzso gene expression as measured by zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso
