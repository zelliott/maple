zzso zzso zzso the growth of several cell types in zzso including bovine pulmonary artery zzso smooth muscle cells zzso In initial studies we discovered that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having zzso groups with zzso chain length was more potent inhibitor of zzso than the starting zzso We prepared several zzso zzso derivatives having zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso carbon zzso chain lengths to determine the optimal zzso chain length for maximum zzso properties of zzso The starting zzso was prepared from zzso zzso by sodium zzso treatment followed by sodium zzso zzso The zzso salt of this zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso separately to give respective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was used to examine the average molecular weights of those zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the presence of one zzso group per zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso as a function of zzso chain length shows two zzso at a carbon chain length of 6 zzso zzso and at a carbon chain length zzso zzso and zzso zzso A solution competition zzso study was performed to test the ability of different zzso zzso derivatives to inhibit zzso growth factor zzso 1 and zzso binding to zzso zzso All the zzso derivatives bound to zzso and zzso but each exhibited slightly different binding zzso
