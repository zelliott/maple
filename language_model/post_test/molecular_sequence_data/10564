To study the zzso of zzso and zzso we prepared a series of synthetic regulatory sequences that contained various numbers and combinations of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The ability of the synthetic zzso to function as regulatory sequences was tested using an zzso reporter zzso As observed zzso synthetic zzso containing both zzso and zzso zzso strong zzso zzso Likewise, a lone zzso did not show any zzso zzso By contrast, zzso containing tandem zzso but no zzso zzso strong promoter zzso This zzso activity was not dependent on position or orientation of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso However, it was dependent on both zzso and zzso These results suggest that the ability of zzso to bind zzso sites in zzso is not absolutely dependent on zzso Eleven independent zzso of zzso were isolated that zzso weak zzso activity to a single zzso Five zzso has single zzso in zzso zzso domain and displayed slightly higher affinity for the zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso and zzso play the central role in zzso gene expression and that the function of zzso is to facilitate the binding of zzso to its zzso
