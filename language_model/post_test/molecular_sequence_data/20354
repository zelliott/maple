zzso A zzso zzso is an zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso To restrict the zzso mobility, we zzso several zzso zzso zzso zzso on solid phase utilizing zzso zzso zzso between the side chains of zzso zzso zzso incorporated in positions 2, 5, and/or zzso zzso between the side chains of zzso gave reasonable yields zzso of all of the desired zzso zzso Both the zzso and trans zzso were obtained for all of the zzso zzso with the ratio of zzso to trans zzso depending on the position and zzso of the zzso Most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso examined exhibit low zzso binding affinity for zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso In two of the three cases, the zzso of the double bond has a significant influence on the zzso zzso affinities and zzso zzso All of the peptides inhibited zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner with full or close to full zzso zzso These potent zzso A zzso are the first ones zzso by zzso
