zzso antibiotics are considered a new class of zzso zzso Of these, an zzso zzso zzso termed zzso 4, a relative of zzso zzso has been shown to be an zzso of relatively high zzso Similarly, zzso B zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cell membrane and acts against zzso zzso As zzso 4 and zzso exhibit almost identical zzso acid sequences at their zzso we hypothesized that laboratory synthesis of peptides with an zzso structure and having similar zzso properties could lead to products with zzso zzso zzso three such peptides - zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso properties compared with recognized zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4, against two zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso agents were zzso and their secondary structures evaluated according to a previously described protocol of zzso and zzso zzso Agents zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains were oral zzso from a human zzso zzso zzso zzso and a healthy zzso zzso A standard concentration of zzso was exposed to a range of zzso of the agents for a specific duration and the cell death zzso in terms of the zzso colony forming units zzso was zzso 

zzso 4, showed the most zzso zzso and was the least zzso while zzso and zzso showed the highest zzso potential, and demonstrated total kill of zzso and zzso at 5 and 10 zzso zzso respectively whilst zzso killed both zzso at a zzso zzso zzso Of the three new synthetic zzso zzso zzso was the most potent zzso kill of zzso strains at zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso kill of zzso strains at zzso zzso while zzso zzso was the least potent as a 25 zzso concentration was required to kill either strain of zzso On further analyses of the relationship between zzso value of the peptides and their zzso activity, a significant positive correlation was zzso In order to rule out a zzso effect of the new synthetic peptides we compared the zzso and zzso activities under similar incubation conditions using freshly isolated zzso and all three peptides exhibited no zzso zzso zzso an concentration of 100 zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso B that zzso significant initiation of zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that laboratory synthesis of agents with an zzso structure and having zzso properties similar to known, natural zzso agents may be a promising avenue to generate products with improved zzso zzso
