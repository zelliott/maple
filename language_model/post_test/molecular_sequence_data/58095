zzso is believed to be caused by bacteria which inhabit zzso zzso The identification of these zzso pathogens by currently available methods requires considerable time and zzso In this study, we have used a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso that is zzso relatively simple, and can detect low numbers of a putative zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso gene of zzso zzso were selected from the published sequence and used for amplification of a zzso sequence of zzso zzso The zzso detected as few as 100 zzso zzso cells obtained from pure zzso Three other bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are also putative zzso pathogens yielded no zzso product at any of the cell zzso zzso This zzso was also used for detection of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Five of 13 zzso bacterial plaque samples obtained from four advanced adult zzso patients and two samples from a prepubescent child with advanced zzso contained zzso zzso The protocol developed is relatively simple and can be completed within four hours of the time of sample zzso
