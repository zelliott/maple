zzso zzso has multiple functions in zzso embryonic development: maternal da activity is necessary for proper sex determination, and zzso da activity is necessary for formation of the peripheral nervous zzso We have cloned the region containing da and have found that five zzso lethal da zzso map to a single zzso zzso A predicted protein product of this zzso unit has sequence similarities with the zzso zzso with the gene zzso which is involved in zzso determination, and with the zzso zzso complex, which is involved in zzso precursor zzso The role of da as a gene controlling cell determination in multiple zzso pathways is zzso
