zzso zzso are potentially a powerful tool for the therapeutic manipulation of genes associated with zzso However, pharmacological applications of zzso have been hindered by the inability to effectively deliver these compounds to their sites of action within zzso In this study, we have prepared zzso zzso with the intent of improving zzso zzso The zzso zzso component of the zzso was complementary to a site zzso the zzso of the message for zzso a membrane zzso associated with zzso resistance in tumor zzso Two types of zzso zzso zzso but not mismatched control zzso provided substantial zzso of cell surface expression of zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso were more potent in the presence of serum than when used under zzso zzso this is in striking contrast to most other approaches for zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was attained with zzso zzso of zzso zzso under zzso zzso The combination of relatively modest molecular size and good efficacy in the presence of serum proteins suggests that zzso zzso zzso may have significant promise for in zzso therapeutic zzso
