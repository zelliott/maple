Natural human zzso zzso has mainly zzso zzso sugar chains and scarcely has zzso zzso We attempted to zzso the sugar chain structures using zzso as a model zzso To obtain the branching zzso of zzso we introduced the genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells producing human zzso The parental zzso cells produced zzso with zzso sugar chains zzso When the zzso activity was increased, zzso sugar chains with a branch produced by zzso increased up to zzso of the total sugar zzso When the zzso activity was increased, zzso sugar chains with a corresponding branch increased up to zzso of the total sugar zzso When the zzso and zzso activities were increased at a time, zzso sugar chains increased up to zzso of the total sugar zzso The proportion of these zzso sugar chains corresponded to the zzso activities of zzso and zzso What is more, zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis indicated that the zzso structure of the sugar chains was increased not only on zzso one of the zzso zzso but also on almost zzso cellular proteins by introducing either or both of the zzso zzso The results suggest that the branching structure of sugar chains of zzso could be controlled by cellular zzso and zzso zzso This technology can produce zzso out of natural zzso which should enlarge the potency of zzso zzso
