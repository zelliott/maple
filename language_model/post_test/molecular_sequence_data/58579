zzso have been identified in the protein C gene in 21 patients with zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein C zzso In 20 zzso single zzso were the only abnormalities identified by sequencing all coding regions, zzso zzso boundaries and the promoter region back to zzso In one zzso 2 zzso were identified and in another family 2 zzso were identified (but not both in the zzso Of the 23 zzso 18 resulted in predicted zzso acid zzso 3 were zzso resulting in stop zzso one was a zzso within a consensus zzso sequence and another a 9 base pair zzso within zzso 5 (this region within zzso 5 is proposed as a zzso hot zzso A novel zzso was also, zzso identified in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso in a zzso from Hong zzso zzso of the protein C gene zzso with protein C zzso could be determined in 13 zzso In a further family, zzso protein C zzso and the genetic zzso zzso in only zzso zzso The first zzso incident occurred in the zzso between the ages of 11 and 59 years and 12 individuals suffered zzso zzso zzso occurred in at least one other family member in zzso families, but in 2 of these it was zzso associated with protein C zzso An independent genetic risk factor, factor V zzso zzso zzso was identified in 2 zzso (and 3 family zzso and in 4 protein C deficient members of a third family but not in the zzso The results suggest that in the majority of zzso with zzso and zzso protein C zzso a single protein C gene zzso is associated with zzso However, it is also possible that additional unknown genetic risk factors contribute to the zzso zzso An added, acquired, risk factor leads to zzso at an early age zzso 25 zzso
