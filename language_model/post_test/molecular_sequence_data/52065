To determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the size distribution of fat cell populations in human zzso zzso abdominal and zzso subcutaneous fat tissue zzso were obtained from seven patients affected by familial zzso These patients were characterized by massive zzso of zzso in the zzso state due to defective zzso of plasma zzso zzso They had no zzso plasma zzso zzso activity and their fat zzso were deficient in zzso zzso zzso The size distribution of zzso examined by scanning electron zzso were similar to zzso observed in control zzso Patient fat cell diameters were not statistically different from control fat cells obtained from subjects of similar body mass zzso zzso fat cells contributed to zzso of the total fat tissue mass in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso can thus be attributed to mature zzso and not to zzso growth of immature fat zzso It is concluded that normal zzso tissue zzso is maintained in these patients in spite of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso
