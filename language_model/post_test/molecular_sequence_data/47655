Previous studies have identified the zzso and zzso binding zzso of the zzso and zzso binding sites of zzso In this study the zzso sequences within or near to the terminal zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso binding sites of bovine liver zzso zzso zzso were identified using zzso labeling with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Without zzso light, zzso exhibited zzso effects on the zzso reaction similar to zzso zzso as expected, produced zzso effects similar to those of zzso zzso into zzso by both zzso exhibited zzso effects in agreement with the respective kinetic zzso zzso of labeling was supported by specific and effective reduction of zzso of zzso and zzso into zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Using a combination of immobilized zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides located within or near the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sites were zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso primarily modified a zzso near the middle of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso modified a single zzso corresponding to the sequence zzso near the zzso zzso Using these results and the data from the previously identified zzso domain peptides the orientation of zzso and zzso within their respective binding sites in the zzso zzso of zzso is proposed and explained on the basis of a proposed three-dimensional zzso model structure derived from the bacterial zzso
