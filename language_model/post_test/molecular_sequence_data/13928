A zzso zzso zzso was generated during bacterial expression and zzso of zzso bovine zzso protein zzso type I alpha regulatory zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso alpha from which the zzso was derived contained a point zzso allowing its B domain to bind both zzso and zzso with high affinity while leaving its A domain highly zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso indicating that it zzso the entire predicted B zzso Although the zzso and zzso exchange rates of the isolated B domain were increased relative to the B domain in intact zzso zzso the zzso exchange rate was comparable to that of the B domain of full-length zzso alpha containing an unoccupied A zzso A zzso zzso only the isolated B domain was zzso in zzso coli, and a zzso form of the B domain was zzso that had identical properties to the zzso generated fragment, indicating that all of the elements for the zzso zzso B domain are contained within the 128 zzso acid zzso zzso of the R zzso zzso induction of the B domain in zzso coli or storage of the zzso protein resulted in the formation of a zzso that could be reverted to the zzso by incubation in zzso zzso caused an approximate fivefold increase in the rate of zzso zzso exchange relative to the zzso The results show that an isolated zzso domain can function independently of any other domain structures of the R zzso
