zzso of the zzso zzso appears to be restricted to cells in the early stages of development, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso cells are induced to zzso zzso expression is drastically zzso To identify zzso DNA elements responsible for this type of regulation, we constructed a zzso in which cat gene expression was driven by about 1 zzso of upstream zzso human DNA zzso including the putative promoter, and zzso it into zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso cells as prototypes of cells which express or do not zzso respectively, the zzso zzso This zzso was essentially inactive in both cell types, and the addition of more than 8 zzso of DNA sequences upstream of the zzso promoter did not lead to any increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, when we inserted in this zzso DNA sequences which are 3' of the human zzso coding zzso we could detect a significant stimulation of zzso zzso Analysis of these sequences led to the identification of zzso DNA elements which are part of the 3' zzso region of zzso zzso 3 and promote zzso expression only in zzso mouse zzso or human zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso or differentiated zzso cells, therefore mimicking the zzso expression of the zzso zzso Similar elements are also present in the 3' region of the zzso zzso zzso in a region showing high zzso to the human zzso zzso These regulatory elements can promote zzso expression from zzso promoters in an zzso manner, suggesting that they interact with a specific cellular zzso zzso whose expression is zzso zzso
