zzso factor zzso is the first zzso zzso to interact with a nascent zzso chain as it emerges from the zzso Here, we have used a spin down zzso to estimate the affinities for the binding of zzso to zzso nascent chain complexes zzso with peptides of varying lengths and zzso An in zzso system for protein synthesis assembled from zzso zzso coli components was used to produce zzso stalled on truncated zzso The affinity of zzso to zzso exposing zzso zzso sequences increased with the length of the nascent zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso with significantly higher affinity than to inner membrane protein leader zzso and zzso zzso The latter two zzso are zzso for signal recognition zzso suggesting complementary affinities of zzso and signal recognition particle to nascent peptides targeted for zzso and zzso
