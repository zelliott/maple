The zzso zzso zzso zzso have multiple roles during cancer development and is currently considered as an important target for zzso targeted zzso zzso knowledge of how compounds interact on zzso zzso site could guide zzso drug design strategies towards more effective and selective zzso drug zzso However, although 17 crystal structures of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are publicly available zzso zzso there are still open questions regarding the prediction of zzso binding zzso We have applied molecular modeling and molecular mechanics to analyze the distribution of zzso interaction energy on zzso zzso and deduced a new model of the active site allowing for an zzso identification of zzso binding zzso We demonstrate that the binding of known zzso on the zzso zzso site involves seven identified zzso zzso Five of these match the generic zzso zzso binding site model built by Novartis scientists in the 1990s, while the two others are distinct zzso regions that can be exploited by second generation zzso zzso such as zzso We show here that zzso can accept both such kinds of zzso zzso a very unusual feature in the zzso family that opens new grounds for highly specific drug zzso
