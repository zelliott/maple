Previously we described a large collection of cloned human zzso that zzso chemically defined zzso zzso within the zzso protein zzso zzso We determined that biologically inactive zzso zzso zzso resulted primarily from point zzso targeted to two internal segments of the zzso sequence and designated these functionally critical regions as zzso B and zzso Further, we zzso that structural zzso within zzso B and D are required for proper incorporation of the zzso protein into nascent 40 S zzso particles and/or for the normal function of mature zzso zzso In this study we have used zzso to monitor the zzso trafficking of zzso labeled human zzso protein zzso zzso expressed by cultured Chinese zzso zzso Data obtained distinguish zzso zzso of zzso which zzso proteins that are not incorporated into zzso zzso particles from zzso zzso whose products are compatible with normal zzso assembly processes but result in functionally inactive zzso 40 S zzso zzso zzso assigned to the first zzso class involve zzso acid replacements located within zzso zzso B and zzso whereas zzso assigned to the second class are distributed throughout the zzso zzso zzso
