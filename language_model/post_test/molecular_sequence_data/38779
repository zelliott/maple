The zzso plant zzso zzso shows zzso zzso variation, caused by zzso zzso segments or zzso zzso zzso at the ends of the short arms of three pairs of zzso A DNA sequence zzso specific to the zzso zzso segments was cloned and zzso zzso was about 730 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso zzso zzso segments on several zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso but not in the zzso of Y or B zzso zzso was zzso arranged in the zzso and the copy number varied between plants from zzso to zzso copies per zzso corresponding to the relative amount of zzso zzso segments per zzso These results indicate that the zzso variation caused by the zzso zzso segment was generated by amplification or reduction of the tandem repeats of zzso
