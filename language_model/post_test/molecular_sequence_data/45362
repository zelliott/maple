A zzso zzso was isolated from a saline lake located in zzso zzso zzso of the strain, designated zzso were zzso zzso and zzso by means of polar zzso zzso of strain zzso were white to cream in zzso zzso turning brown after 7 days of zzso they were blue in zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso in which it forms a distinct lineage together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso The most closely related zzso according to zzso analysis of the zzso gene is also zzso zzso (90 % zzso The zzso gene also showed low similarity zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with respect to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso genes confirms that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso forming a branch together with zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to grow in zzso % zzso Growth occurred between 4 and 37 degrees C zzso 28 degrees zzso and at pH zzso zzso was negative on marine zzso zzso zzso was found to be sensitive to the zzso agent zzso It reduced nitrate to zzso produced zzso and zzso zzso but did not produce zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso used several carbohydrates and fermented zzso zzso and zzso The most abundant fatty acids were summed feature 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso and/or zzso : 0 iso zzso zzso : 0 zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso results, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso should be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
