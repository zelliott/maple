The zzso zzso channel 1 zzso is a key zzso for zzso zzso Although numerous structural and functional studies have been performed on this channel, the structural dynamics underlying the gating mechanism remains zzso We used normal mode analysis, zzso and zzso methods to explore the relationship between the inherent dynamics of zzso and its gating zzso Here we show that a series of collective motions among the zzso and zzso of zzso correlate with its zzso zzso The normal mode analysis result reveals that the intrinsic rotation of the zzso domain and the collective motions between the thumb and finger induced by zzso binding drive the zzso to experience a deformation from the zzso domain to the zzso domain, triggering the channel pore to undergo zzso zzso The movements in the zzso domain indicate that the likely position of the channel gate is around zzso These motion modes are compatible with a wide body of our complementary zzso and zzso zzso This study provides the dynamic fundamentals of zzso zzso
