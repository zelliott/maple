To investigate the relationship between zzso folding and zzso zzso we have carried out a detailed kinetic analysis of four structural derivatives of the hairpin zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences were studied in conjunction with stabilization of zzso 4, which supports formation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso kinetic studies strongly support a model in which each of the zzso zzso partitions between two major zzso leading to active and inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso rates for zzso zzso and zzso binding to both zzso zzso were zzso zzso rates (3 zzso were typically zzso greater than zzso rates zzso zzso demonstrating that the hairpin zzso is an efficient zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso binding is very rapid zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso complex is very stable zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 4 increases the proportion of zzso molecules folded into the active zzso and enhances zzso association and zzso zzso These effects can be explained by stabilization of the zzso core of the zzso zzso consideration of zzso zzso and their intrinsic kinetic properties was necessary for development of a kinetic scheme for the zzso zzso
