We have continued to map and identify genes zzso a family of zzso zzso These proteins are zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and assemble in zzso into zzso zzso zzso The genes for several zzso proteins exist in zzso rings zzso on zzso zzso zzso A randomly primed zzso zzso designated zzso zzso in zzso to zzso and was shown on Northern blots to originate from a zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso The partial zzso sequence contained zzso zzso including one open reading frame zzso zzso 160 zzso acids zzso A striking feature of the zzso was the periodic distribution of zzso zzso zzso which occurred approximately every 22 zzso A zzso zzso sequence was selected for chemical zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso were incubated with a Western zzso containing zzso proteins they reacted specifically with a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso studies showed that zzso and its zzso were present in zzso zzso throughout the fourth zzso zzso Thus zzso and a family of zzso zzso proteins are zzso by a class of genes that are expressed throughout the fourth zzso This contrasts with the zzso regulated expression of the zzso and zzso genes whose expression is zzso during the zzso stages of zzso zzso
