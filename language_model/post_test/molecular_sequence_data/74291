A three-dimensional zzso model of the human zzso H 4 zzso was developed to investigate the binding mode of a series of structurally diverse H zzso zzso zzso zzso and the recently described selective, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso of these zzso in a zzso zzso model revealed two essential points of interactions in the binding pocket, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It is zzso that zzso interacts in its zzso state, whereas zzso interacts in its neutral zzso The hypothesis was tested with the point zzso zzso and zzso For the zzso no binding affinity toward any of the zzso could be zzso This is in sharp contrast to the zzso zzso which discriminates between various zzso The affinity of zzso zzso was decreased approximately a zzso whereas the affinity of all other zzso remained virtually zzso The proposed model for zzso binding as well as zzso zzso calculations for zzso and zzso zzso explain the observed differences in binding to the H zzso zzso These studies provide a molecular understanding for the action of a variety of H 4 zzso The resulting H 4 zzso model will be the basis for the development of new H 4 zzso
