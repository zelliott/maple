The zzso zzso between strains of 5 toxin types (A to zzso of zzso zzso were examined by analysis of differences in the zzso sequences of zzso C genes zzso zzso among 10 zzso including 3 strains for which the zzso gene sequences have been previously zzso A zzso gene was also cloned from a zzso zzso type A strain and zzso to analyze the zzso diversity of zzso zzso zzso trees constructed by the zzso method revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso strains is not related to toxin zzso in agreement with the results of a comparative zzso mapping study by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cole, zzso zzso zzso zzso Various zzso zzso zzso C zzso were zzso from cultures of zzso coli cells into which the zzso zzso genes had been zzso All of the zzso showed the same specific zzso On the other hand, the level of zzso transcripts differed greatly (up to zzso from one zzso zzso strain to zzso No significant difference in the zzso sequence of the zzso promoter region was observed for any of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the variation in zzso C activity among different strains is not due to zzso in the zzso coding region but to that in an zzso zzso The evolution of zzso zzso zzso C is discussed on the basis of similarities and differences between zzso zzso zzso
