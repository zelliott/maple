zzso immune zzso is caused by zzso zzso zzso that bind tightly to zzso zzso only when drug is zzso How drugs mediate this interaction is not yet zzso Several studies indicate that sites recognized by zzso tend to cluster in specific structural zzso suggesting they may recognize a limited number of distinct zzso To address this issue, we characterized the binding sites for 16 zzso zzso thought on the basis of preliminary studies to be possibly specific for a single zzso on zzso zzso zzso Fourteen of the zzso reacted with a zzso zzso zzso zzso only the zzso hybrid and zzso zzso zzso However, studies with zzso zzso and the blocking zzso zzso zzso showed that the 14 zzso recognize at least 6 and possibly more zzso but zzso structures involving zzso zzso 50 to zzso The findings suggest that even zzso specific for restricted zzso on a target zzso may each have a slightly different fine zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized by zzso may be rare or zzso The observations are consistent with a recently proposed model in which drug zzso zzso with both target protein and zzso to promote binding of an otherwise zzso zzso
