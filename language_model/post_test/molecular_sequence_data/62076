Plant zzso are zzso zzso essential for plant metabolism and zzso zzso activity is regulated on a zzso level via zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in crop plants has high zzso zzso However, little zzso and up to now no detailed structural information is available about this class of plant regulatory zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the cell zzso zzso inhibitor zzso from tobacco at a resolution of zzso The structural model reveals an zzso zzso bundle with an uncommon zzso extension that appears to be critical for the structural integrity of the zzso zzso analysis of a second crystal form grown in the presence of zzso reveals two metal binding zzso zzso is highly zzso and retains full zzso activity after cooling to ambient zzso The structure of zzso provides the first three-dimensional information source for the zzso regulation of plant zzso Based on the recently discovered sequence zzso between zzso of zzso and zzso zzso our structural model is likely to represent a scaffold also used for the regulation of the latter zzso which do not share sequence similarity with zzso Thus, our structural model sets the zzso for the investigation of zzso regulation of zzso as well as zzso zzso
