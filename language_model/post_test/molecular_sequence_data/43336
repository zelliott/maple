The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein prevents infected cells from passing through zzso by arresting them in the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso is zzso among all zzso zzso suggesting an important role in the virus life zzso Moreover, in this study we show that the ability to cause cell cycle arrest is also zzso in zzso proteins from a wide variety of both tissue zzso and zzso human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso African green monkey zzso and zzso monkey zzso zzso However, this property is cell type specific and appears to depend on the particular zzso species from which the cells are zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins are capable of arresting African green monkey cells but are completely inactive in human zzso By contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins function in both zzso and human cell types, although zzso zzso functions more efficiently in zzso cells than it does in human zzso Neither differential protein stability nor zzso zzso explains the zzso activities of these zzso These results thus suggest that zzso exerts its zzso arrest function by interacting with cellular factors that have evolved differently among the various zzso zzso
