The zzso essential for bacterial zzso zzso are attractive targets for zzso drug zzso One of these is zzso which contains zzso as a zzso and zzso the zzso reduction of zzso zzso to zzso zzso This study examined the roles of the zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso which are located near the active site in zzso crystal zzso Seven of 11 zzso zzso zzso genes lost the ability to complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the seven zzso zzso proteins revealed that they cannot carry out the reduction of zzso although they can all catalyze the zzso reduction of zzso via zzso zzso analyses of the oxidized form of the zzso proteins in the presence and absence of zzso or zzso revealed that these essential zzso acid zzso play four distinct roles in zzso zzso zzso is essential for maintenance of the electronic state of zzso zzso is required for interaction with zzso zzso is required for interaction with both zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not apparently required for interaction with either zzso The results presented here identify for the first time the zzso acid zzso of zzso that are required for the interaction with zzso and zzso
