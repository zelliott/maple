A study was conducted to develop a zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Forward and reverse zzso were designed that bind at zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso To assess its zzso zzso zzso was conducted on DNA extracted from different zzso zzso zzso zzso from Nigeria, Ethiopia and Venezuela, zzso zzso Savannah type, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso camel and human zzso The zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso was compared with that of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso on a dilution series of zzso zzso DNA in zzso The diagnostic performance of the three zzso was compared on 411 Ethiopian bovine blood specimens collected in a former zzso zzso zzso proved to be fully specific for zzso zzso irrespective of its geographical zzso Its zzso sensitivity was lower than that of zzso zzso On these bovine zzso zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso infections while zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected respectively zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The study demonstrates that a zzso zzso based zzso could be used, preferably in combination with zzso zzso as a zzso diagnostic test for zzso zzso infections zzso
