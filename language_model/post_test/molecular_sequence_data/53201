zzso zzso coli zzso expresses a broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most prevalent among the zzso strains lacking any of the defined colonization factors zzso in zzso An zzso strain, zzso zzso to zzso cells and exhibited a zzso zzso protein band upon sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso An zzso against this protein inhibited zzso zzso to zzso cells and bound to very thin zzso structures on the bacterial zzso A zzso zzso zzso failed to adhere to zzso cells and lacked zzso surface zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the structural zzso showed zzso zzso to that of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, the molecular size of zzso zzso was different from that of zzso as revealed by zzso and mass zzso Both proteins are zzso zzso yet not zzso since an zzso against the zzso protein reacted solely with zzso after zzso with bacteria bearing zzso Moreover, only under low stringency conditions could DNA from strain zzso be amplified by zzso using zzso derived from the zzso sequence of zzso Thus, from the DNA sequence obtained from the zzso zzso product, it could be deduced that the zzso protein differed in 30 zzso from that of zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strains from zzso however, it appeared restricted to this zzso We propose the designation zzso for the zzso identified zzso zzso of human zzso
