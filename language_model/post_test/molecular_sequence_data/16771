zzso zzso is a major zzso agent of zzso and exhibits zzso and adherence zzso We previously succeeded in molecular cloning the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso designated zzso that is recognized in zzso from zzso patients, and identified the zzso zzso as a zzso A zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso known to be a useful vaccine against zzso zzso has four large, contiguous, direct repeats and the repeat unit is believed to contain the zzso zzso Because production of zzso zzso was low in the zzso coli host, it was difficult to obtain large amounts of zzso zzso In this study, we attempt to zzso the gene zzso the useful zzso from zzso in an effort to obtain large zzso A zzso designated zzso zzso a fusion protein of zzso zzso and zzso protein was successfully constructed, and the novel clone produced relatively large amounts of zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences of the zzso insert demonstrated that the zzso protein contained a short zzso motif and a direct repeat unit zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso and rabbit zzso was zzso The zzso was capable of zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso These findings suggest that novel zzso zzso zzso proteins can be produced efficiently from zzso coli hosts and these may be useful in developing zzso against zzso infected by zzso zzso
