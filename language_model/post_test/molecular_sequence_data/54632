zzso has a negative impact on the farming industry in both developed and developing countries, rather than a public health zzso This study was performed to identify zzso zzso from different definitive hosts zzso zzso and zzso based on the molecular parameters and zzso zzso adult zzso were collected from zzso of slaughtered animals at zzso in different zzso in zzso zzso examination of the analyzed zzso showed many normal zzso in the seminal zzso zzso suggesting that they have the ability of zzso This study showed that no zzso zzso species occurred in zzso zzso analysis was performed utilizing zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Whereas 16 animals proved to have infection with a single zzso species, 2 were infected with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results indicated that sheep were prone to zzso zzso (8 out of 10 zzso more than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso region indicated that the zzso were zzso into 3 groups zzso zzso (47), zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso possessed sequences of both types indicating an existence of different zzso at the same zzso zzso overlapping of zzso bases were detected in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on results of zzso gene markers zzso and zzso zzso were classified into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected at both zzso zzso and zzso sequences of Egyptian strain of zzso zzso showed pronounced diversity compared with relevant sequences at zzso
