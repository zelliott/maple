The zzso complex recognizes various zzso zzso in DNA and zzso global zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a novel functional interaction between zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso which zzso base zzso repair zzso of zzso zzso generated by spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by promoting the release of zzso from zzso sites that result from the zzso of mismatched T zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso had an additive effect on the zzso turnover of zzso without significantly zzso the subsequent action of zzso Our observations suggest that zzso may participate in zzso of zzso zzso thereby contributing to the suppression of spontaneous zzso that may be one of the zzso factors for the promotion of zzso in zzso zzso genetic zzso group C zzso
