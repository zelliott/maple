zzso in the zzso zzso gene are associated with limb zzso muscular zzso type zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel zzso transcript that we named zzso zzso zzso zzso This transcript differs from the currently known zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso in the sequence of the entire first zzso which spans 232 zzso This unique first zzso is derived from zzso 1 of zzso and has an immediate upstream zzso untranslated region containing zzso islands and sequences consistent with zzso factor binding zzso zzso 1 of zzso shares zzso sequence zzso and has similar zzso organization with the first zzso of mouse zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso transcript spans zzso zzso and is expressed in human skeletal muscle, heart, zzso brain, zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso retains zzso zzso and shows similar expression pattern as the currently known human zzso
