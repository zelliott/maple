zzso are expressed in zzso patterns and typically mediate zzso zzso zzso also mediate zzso zzso providing the opportunity for zzso attachment to zzso zzso The best characterized example of zzso zzso to a zzso cell zzso zzso as opposed to a vascular zzso zzso zzso is the interaction between zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso However, the molecular basis for an zzso interaction is not well zzso zzso that the zzso domain adopts a zzso similar to the zzso zzso fold suggested that zzso recognition of zzso might be similar to recognition of zzso zzso zzso Thus, we modeled domain 1 of human zzso and studied the role of zzso zzso that connect zzso zzso beta zzso zzso analyses localized the zzso zzso recognition site to the top of domain 1 at the face formed by the BC and zzso zzso a site distinct from the region recognized in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso vascular cell zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso by their zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso binding site is distinct from the zzso binding site on zzso These studies provide a conceptual basis for zzso binding and extend the model that an zzso fold can serve as a scaffold for zzso
