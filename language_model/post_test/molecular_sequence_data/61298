From a clone mapping to human zzso zzso we have identified zzso the human zzso of the rat nuclear zzso protein zzso zzso The expression pattern of the human copy is much more complex that that of the zzso although conservation of the potential specific function of zzso in male germ cells can be seen for one of the five zzso The zzso organization of the zzso gene shows the presence of at least three alternate 3' ends, and Northern analysis indicates the possible presence of alternate zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid mapping revealed additional related copies of zzso on human zzso 5, 6, and 14, although it is not known if these are functional zzso
