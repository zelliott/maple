In recent years, two methods have been developed that may eventually allow the targeted regulation of a broad repertoire of zzso The engineered protein strategy involves selecting zzso zinc finger proteins that will recognize specific sites in the major groove of zzso The small zzso approach zzso pairing rules for zzso zzso that target specific sites in the minor zzso To understand how these two methods might complement each other, we have begun exploring how zzso and zinc fingers interact when they bind the same site on opposite grooves of zzso Although structural comparisons show no obvious source of van der zzso collisions, we have found a significant zzso zzso when the two classes of compounds are directed to the overlapping zzso zzso available crystal structures suggests that this may reflect differences in the precise DNA zzso especially with regard to zzso and depth of the zzso that is preferred for zzso These results may give new insights into the structural requirements for zinc finger and zzso binding and may eventually lead to the development of even more powerful and flexible schemes for regulating gene zzso
