The role of the extra zzso alpha zero in the zzso extension of the zzso beta alpha barrel of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by point zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 by zzso of the zzso from zzso coli affected neither zzso nor zzso but deletion of 8 zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso The similarly truncated zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso and had the same zzso value as the zzso protein but a zzso greater zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso portion of zzso alpha zero provides for strong binding of the zzso but is not essential for stabilizing the bound transition zzso Thus, three zzso of zzso zzso operate essentially as zzso zzso beta alpha barrels, as required for their divergent zzso
