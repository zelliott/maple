In humans, the zzso light chain variable region gene zzso locus evolved in part by zzso of four large zzso Similarly, some portions of the human heavy chain constant region gene locus are zzso Recently, we found that the zzso zzso gene is highly zzso to the reported zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso length zzso study of the human zzso locus with a zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso gene zzso zzso suggested that the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso might be generated by zzso from a zzso zzso gene zzso To assess this possibility, we mapped the zzso region of the isolated zzso zzso beginning from 2 zzso upstream, and zzso the adjacent zzso gene zzso zzso located 10 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso The result showed that zzso shared zzso zzso with the zzso zzso located about 11 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that the zzso region and the zzso region arose by a zzso of a common zzso zzso gene zzso
