zzso difference analysis zzso a technique for the isolation of differences between highly similar complex zzso was employed for isolation of zzso zzso These markers can be easily adapted for a high zzso zzso zzso in which multiple specimens can be simultaneously identified based on the zzso of amplification zzso One of the important features of zzso performed on zzso of different species zzso zzso is its ability to zzso isolate families of repetitive sequences that are unique to one of the compared zzso Such families of repetitive DNA are zzso characters that can be used for cost-efficient, mass identification of specimens in a variety of situations ranging from zzso studies to screenings of egg or zzso zzso
