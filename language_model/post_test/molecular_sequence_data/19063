The zzso zzso zzso are an established class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of zzso Their unique zzso zzso allows binding to the zzso zzso of the zzso with extraordinary zzso Here, we report the characterization of the first gene clusters for the zzso of natural zzso The clusters for zzso the lead compound for the zzso drug zzso and for zzso were identified in the zzso producer strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, using a modified protocol for Ion zzso zzso zzso zzso Both gene clusters code for a hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso produced in zzso zzso zzso via whole zzso zzso Moreover, we employed mass spectral molecular networking for a new comparative zzso approach in a zzso system and discovered a number of putative zzso zzso With this study, we have definitively linked zzso zzso zzso and their zzso genes for the first time in any zzso which will now allow for their detailed zzso zzso
