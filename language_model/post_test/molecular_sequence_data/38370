The zzso gene is a zzso of the zzso zzso group zzso gene zzso of zest, a crucial regulator of zzso gene zzso Several lines of evidence suggest a critical role for the zzso protein during normal and zzso development of the zzso and central nervous zzso Indeed, the zzso protein has been shown to associate with the zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso the product of a mental zzso zzso The zzso gene was previously reported to be located on zzso zzso and was proposed as a candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome zzso We report here the zzso structure and fine mapping of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the functional gene actually maps to zzso zzso and that the sequence previously isolated from a zzso 21 zzso zzso to a zzso Finally, the nature of the zzso protein and its mapping to the critical region for zzso zzso disorders lead us to propose the zzso gene is involved in the zzso of zzso aberrations in zzso zzso
