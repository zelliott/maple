An organic zzso tolerant zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was successfully cloned and expressed with zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso in length which coded for a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso comprised of a signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mature protein of 390 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in an zzso increase in activity, upon the induction of zzso zzso zzso after a 10 h incubation zzso Interestingly, this zzso was stable in various organic zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso zzso zzso and zzso Literature shows that most of the organic zzso stable bacterial zzso were produced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso but very few from zzso zzso This zzso demonstrates great potential to be employed in various industrial zzso
