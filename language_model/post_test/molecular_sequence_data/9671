zzso zzso encodes a zinc zzso zzso factor expressed in zzso and temporally restricted patterns during zzso zzso zzso targets and the mechanism of zzso action have been studied extensively during the early zzso process, but only little is known about zzso requirement during later zzso We report the identification of a target gene of zzso termed knockout zzso isolated by virtue of zzso in zzso binding zzso Loss and gain of function experiments show that zzso activity maintains zzso expression in a subset of zzso zzso encodes a novel protein expressed in several embryonic zzso including zzso zzso zzso of zzso deficient for zzso activity are zzso Their muscle pattern is normal, but the patterns of zzso zzso are specifically zzso The results suggest that the zzso target gene zzso is required for proper zzso of specific muscles by zzso zzso
