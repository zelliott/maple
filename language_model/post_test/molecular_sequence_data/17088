The crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso with zzso and zzso acid zzso has been determined at zzso resolution, clearly revealing the zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso In zzso the zzso strictly zzso in SK forms a hydrogen bond and zzso with zzso and assists in positioning the zzso group of zzso for zzso zzso The zzso group of zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso groups with zzso and zzso The crystal structure of zzso will provide crucial information for zzso of the mechanism of zzso reaction and for the development of a new generation of drugs against zzso
