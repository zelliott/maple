We have discovered in the zzso zzso zzso gene a single zzso zzso substitution that causes complete zzso zzso zzso in a zzso with three affected zzso The zzso a zzso transition, occurs at zzso number zzso and changes the sense of zzso zzso from zzso to a translation stop zzso zzso zzso is in zzso 4, so the zzso predicts the synthesis of a truncated zzso that lacks most of its zzso zzso The substitution zzso a recognition sequence for the restriction zzso zzso zzso of zzso 4 by the zzso chain reaction followed by double zzso with zzso and zzso permits facile recognition of zzso and zzso carriers of the zzso
