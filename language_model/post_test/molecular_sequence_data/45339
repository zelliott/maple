The zzso zzso located in the southern zzso zzso is known to actively bubble with gas containing methane and hydrogen zzso from numerous fissures in the large zzso zzso Although ecological studies regarding zzso and bacteria from zzso zzso have been zzso conducted, the community structure and ecological importance of microbial zzso zzso have not yet been zzso In the present study, we directly extracted DNA from zzso of the zzso zzso at a depth of 640 m and constructed genetic libraries of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso sequences of several types of zzso zzso were retrieved from the surface of the zzso all other sequences (just below the zzso surface to approximately 9 zzso below zzso zzso were derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, sequences of the internal transcribed zzso of zzso zzso retrieved from the same zzso were identical to that of zzso zzso originating from zzso zzso The diversity of microbial zzso in the zzso zzso zzso seems to be extremely low and significantly different from that of other marine environments previously zzso
