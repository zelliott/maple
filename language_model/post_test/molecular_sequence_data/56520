A zzso coding for the human zzso zzso protein zzso was used to isolate the corresponding gene by screening two human zzso libraries constructed in zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso One of the zzso clones isolated, zzso contains the whole zzso alpha zzso composed of eight zzso and seven zzso spanning zzso zzso As in other zzso zzso zzso the promoter and the first zzso of the zzso alpha reside within a zzso zzso Furthermore, similar to the other higher zzso zzso genes characterized so far, the human zzso alpha gene has a C as the major zzso start point localized in a zzso region and lacks a zzso zzso zzso We show that 130 zzso of the human zzso alpha gene zzso region represent the minimal element required to promote its zzso This element is zzso zzso between the mouse and human zzso alpha zzso Finally, a comparison of the human zzso alpha gene coding sequence and the predicted zzso acid zzso sequence with the sequences of mouse zzso rat zzso and the zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso sequence has been highly zzso during zzso
