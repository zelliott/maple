zzso is a unique member of zzso family of zzso without zzso intrinsic zzso zzso Our previous study showed that zzso is a tumor zzso gene and its expression is zzso in gastric zzso However, the mechanism underlying the zzso expression of zzso in gastric cancer has not been zzso zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso modification on the zzso expression in gastric cancer cells was zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso were detected by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso showed zzso was significantly zzso in three gastric cancer cell zzso A promoter zzso zzso of zzso and its five truncated zzso were cloned into zzso zzso for the activity analysis by zzso reporter zzso Treatment with zzso A, a zzso zzso zzso enhanced not only the activity of zzso promoter, but also the zzso and protein expression of zzso in three gastric cancer cell lines, whereas treatment with zzso a DNA zzso zzso affected neither zzso promoter activity nor zzso zzso No synergistic effect was observed in cells treated with both zzso Our results suggested that zzso expression in gastric cancer cells was regulated by zzso zzso but not by DNA zzso at the zzso zzso
