Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cerebral deposits of zzso zzso (AP) as senile plaque core and vascular zzso and a complementary DNA zzso a precursor of this protein zzso has been cloned from human zzso From a zzso library of a human zzso cell line, we have isolated a zzso identical to that previously reported, together with a new zzso which contains a zzso zzso The sequence of the 56 zzso acids at the zzso of the protein deduced from this insert is highly zzso to the basic zzso inhibitor family, and the zzso from zzso cells zzso with the longer zzso zzso showed an increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso DNA zzso zzso showed that the 225 zzso are located in two zzso At least three zzso zzso species, apparently transcribed from a single zzso gene by alternative zzso were found in human zzso We suggest that zzso zzso by the longer zzso could be related to zzso zzso zzso
