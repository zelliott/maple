zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso is an important industrial zzso for the production of zzso acid, which is a precursor for zzso zzso Single zzso of six zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were previously shown to result in enhanced levels of zzso conversion, with activities ranging from 129 to zzso of the zzso zzso In this study, these zzso were paired to investigate their effects on zzso zzso The zzso results showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso X is zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso in combination with zzso substantially increased the conversion of zzso the activity was up to zzso of the zzso zzso Similar improvements were observed for converting zzso (up to zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso (up to zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso double zzso exhibited lower activities for zzso G conversion, and activities that were 40 to zzso of zzso zzso activity were zzso Based on kinetic studies using zzso it was clear that the increases in the activities of the double zzso relative to those of the corresponding single zzso were due to enhanced zzso binding zzso These results also validated the finding that the zzso and zzso zzso are ideal for increasing the zzso binding affinity and turnover rate of the zzso zzso This study provided further insight into the zzso interaction of zzso with different zzso zzso thus providing a useful platform for further rational modification of its zzso zzso
