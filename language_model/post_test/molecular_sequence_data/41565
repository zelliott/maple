zzso of zzso DNA is one of the most important zzso zzso which have become a center of scientific attraction, especially because of its important role in the regulation of transcription, zzso zzso zzso process, and zzso of various zzso Currently, there are wide ranges of methods available to produce quantitative and qualitative information on zzso DNA zzso The vast majority of these methods rely on the zzso of the efficient zzso zzso However, all the available methods for zzso treatment suffer from major zzso such as large amount of starting material, poor conversion efficiency as well as low recovery and integrity of DNA after zzso zzso Here, we developed a simple, zzso and convenient zzso zzso treatment method by improving the several critical steps, which leads to consistent zzso conversion rate zzso zzso zzso % recovery of DNA after zzso zzso In addition, it is commercially viable and requires very less amount zzso zzso of zzso
