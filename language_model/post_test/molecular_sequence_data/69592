zzso zzso play essential roles in the development of zzso zzso These zzso display various degrees of sequence similarity in their zzso zzso This conservation has allowed the identification of protein zzso in a variety of organisms, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, sequences related to those zzso zzso protein zzso were amplified by zzso from DNA of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso cells specifically for nitrogen zzso called zzso under conditions of combined nitrogen zzso zzso from Southern zzso and sequencing of zzso products suggest the presence of a family of similar protein zzso in this zzso One of the corresponding genes zzso was isolated from a gene zzso The zzso region of its zzso acid sequence shows significant similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso of this gene was found to be zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to colonies that appeared light green and rough in the absence of combined zzso zzso filaments produce fewer zzso than zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is required for both normal cellular growth and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso
