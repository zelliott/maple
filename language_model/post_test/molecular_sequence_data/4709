zzso familial and zzso zzso zzso is a rare disease characterized by zzso zzso inherited in an zzso dominant zzso Recently, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso We describe a Japanese family with an zzso dominant inheritance of zzso An in zzso colony zzso demonstrated hypersensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in affected family zzso zzso analysis of zzso products amplified from the zzso region of zzso transcripts in affected family members revealed that they were all zzso for C and T bases at position zzso which suggested a genetic zzso zzso to zzso on one zzso of zzso This zzso gave rise to a translation termination zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso Thus, the resulting zzso is a truncated protein product lacking all 74 zzso acids downstream of the zzso To date, all genetic zzso affecting a family with zzso including this one, have been located in the zzso negative regulatory region of the zzso All zzso gave rise to truncated zzso receptors between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso in this region of zzso have been demonstrated to be binding sites for zzso zzso Therefore zzso is presumably brought about as a result of genetic zzso which cause the loss of the zzso binding site in the zzso region of zzso
