DNA zzso beta functions in both base zzso repair and zzso Errors committed by zzso beta during these processes could result in zzso Using a zzso system, in which rat DNA zzso beta zzso for DNA zzso I of zzso coli, we previously isolated a DNA zzso beta zzso in which zzso was altered to zzso zzso The zzso zzso is dominant to zzso DNA zzso beta and possesses an intrinsic zzso zzso We now have expressed the zzso DNA zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells, which have zzso DNA zzso beta zzso We demonstrate that expression of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells results in an zzso increase in the spontaneous zzso frequency of zzso zzso compared with expression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in at least a zzso increase in the frequency of deletions of three bases or more and a zzso increase in point zzso Our results suggest that the zzso we observe in zzso result directly from the action of the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a zzso zzso resulting from expression of a DNA zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This work raises the possibility that zzso zzso may act in a dominant fashion in human cells, leading to genetic instability and zzso
