zzso labeling studies suggest that zzso zzso contains many zzso that are anchored in the zzso zzso by zzso membrane zzso zzso anchors were zzso from a crude zzso membrane protein fraction and analyzed by two-dimensional zzso zzso fast atom zzso zzso compositional and zzso linkage zzso as well as chemical and zzso zzso The zzso zzso anchors consist of the following zzso zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso where R is mainly Man alpha zzso zzso with some Man alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso and Man alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso The core region of the zzso anchors zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso is identical to the zzso core region found in zzso anchors from zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso anchors are mainly zzso consisting mostly of zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso However, the zzso zzso of the zzso anchor of the zzso zzso protein is a zzso or zzso containing zzso fatty zzso This suggests that zzso adds different zzso components to the zzso anchors of different zzso
