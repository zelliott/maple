To determine whether zzso fusion exists in zzso syndrome zzso patients, explore the relationship between zzso fusion and clinical zzso and observe and reveal the expression of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso in zzso of zzso and the biological significance zzso 

zzso of peripheral blood were collected from 4 zzso patients diagnosed based on the criteria of zzso et zzso Total zzso was extracted from zzso and zzso was zzso by reverse zzso zzso was used to amplify the target fusion gene and the positive zzso fragments were zzso zzso Total protein of the peripheral zzso was zzso Western zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso protein in the zzso zzso 

zzso fusion genes were found in 3 of the 4 zzso zzso The break points in zzso were all located at zzso 12, while in zzso the break points were highly zzso located at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 8 zzso The patients with zzso fusion were susceptible to cardiac zzso The expression of zzso protein was zzso in zzso positive zzso patients, while zzso protein expression was negative in zzso patients without zzso zzso 

zzso fusion has a universal significance for zzso The identification of zzso zzso is a useful molecular mark for zzso diagnosis and works as the therapeutic target of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso a downstream signal of the zzso fusion, indicates that zzso is a zzso zzso disease of the zzso zzso
