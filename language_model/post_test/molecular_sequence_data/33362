zzso zzso zzso causes disease in farmed zzso fish and is divided into different genetic zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of the zzso and zzso untranslated regions zzso of a zzso isolated from Atlantic salmon in zzso The sequences of the zzso are very similar to those of zzso and zzso but single zzso zzso are present, also in the 3' - zzso sequence element zzso zzso of the zzso secondary structure suggested putative zzso structures in both the zzso and zzso similar to those of zzso from the zzso environment, indicating that the general zzso replication initiation strategy for zzso is also zzso by zzso A DNA zzso zzso zzso based upon a zzso backbone and the zzso zzso was constructed, and the zzso zzso proteins were used to express a reporter gene controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso cell lines resulted in expression of the reporter zzso confirming that the cloned zzso replication apparatus and zzso are functional in fish zzso
