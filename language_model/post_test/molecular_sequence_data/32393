We identified a zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso by searching the expressed sequence tag database of zzso zzso and subsequently obtained the full-length zzso for this gene via rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso We designated this gene zzso and showed by sequence analysis that it belongs to a novel zzso zzso The tissue specificity of zzso zzso expression was examined in fifth zzso larvae by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and transcripts were zzso in the silk zzso gut, fat body, and zzso zzso A zzso form of zzso was then expressed using a zzso zzso zzso gene fusion system, and it was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit zzso activity toward zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso zzso showed considerable activity toward zzso and also zzso zzso although the zzso are not zzso by this zzso
