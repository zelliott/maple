The zzso zzso zzso contains at least 22 regions with a variable number of tandem zzso repeats zzso within coding DNA sequences zzso In this work, the zzso zzso were zzso in order to evaluate their degree of variation, possible correlations with zzso properties, and their potential to be used as a basis for a strain typing zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso in five zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on published zzso sequences and on amplified and zzso DNA zzso These zzso are distributed among 12 zzso most of which zzso putative surface zzso including known zzso The number of repeat units in any of the zzso is highly variable among the zzso zzso but they are, without exception, zzso in frame, and, therefore, code for a variable number of zzso repeats zzso These zzso determine putative zzso zzso and zzso variations in the corresponding zzso with potential implications for aspects associated to zzso zzso zzso such as cell zzso and interactions with the host immune zzso Considering that the characterized zzso are relatively stable, at least in zzso and their sizes are zzso we have developed a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso strain zzso useful for zzso pneumonia zzso diagnosis, strain zzso and distinction of circulating field zzso from vaccine strains in animals vaccinated against zzso
