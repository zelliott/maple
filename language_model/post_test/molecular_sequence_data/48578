Although it is widely assumed that species zzso of zzso G zzso receptors will be activated by the same zzso produced zzso variation in zzso particularly in cases in which more than 1 zzso responds to the same hormone, can result in challenges in defining the contribution of individual receptors in different zzso This can create considerably greater issues when using synthetic chemical zzso and, in some cases, may result in a complete lack of efficacy of such a zzso when used in animal models of zzso In man, the concept that distinct responses of individuals to medicines may reflect differences in the ability of such drugs to bind to or activate single zzso zzso zzso of receptors is more established as a concept but, in many cases, clear links between such zzso that are associated with disease zzso and substantial differences in zzso zzso pharmacology have been more difficult to zzso zzso we consider each of these issues for the group of free fatty acid zzso zzso defined to be activated by free fatty acids of varying chain zzso which, based on their production by 1 tissue or location and action in distinct locations, have been suggested to possess characteristics of zzso
