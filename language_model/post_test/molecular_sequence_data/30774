Acid zzso or acid zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso to zzso and is deficient in zzso storage disease type zzso Previously, we isolated a partial zzso zzso zzso for human zzso we have now used this zzso to isolate and determine sequence in longer zzso from four additional independent zzso zzso zzso extension studies indicated that the zzso extended approximately 200 zzso zzso of the zzso sequence zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso sequences that overlapped the previous zzso sequence and extended an additional 24 zzso to an initiation zzso within a zzso consensus zzso The sequence of the zzso clone revealed an zzso junction 32 zzso zzso to the zzso indicating that the zzso leader sequence was interrupted by an zzso The remaining 186 zzso of zzso untranslated sequence was identified approximately 3 zzso zzso The promoter region upstream from the start site of zzso was zzso rich and contained areas of zzso to zzso binding sites but no identifiable zzso or zzso zzso The combined data gave a zzso sequence of zzso zzso for the coding region from the zzso to a stop zzso predicting a protein of zzso zzso zzso The 3' untranslated region contained 555 zzso with a zzso signal at zzso zzso followed by 16 zzso prior to a zzso zzso This sequence of the zzso coding region differs from that reported by zzso et zzso (1988) in three areas that change a total of 42 zzso zzso zzso determination of the zzso acid sequence in one of these areas confirmed the zzso sequence reported here but also disagreed with the directly determined zzso acid sequence reported by zzso et zzso zzso At two other areas, changes in base pairs predicted new restriction sites that were identified in zzso from several independent zzso The zzso acid changes in all three zzso increased the zzso to zzso zzso zzso we believe that our zzso sequence for zzso is more zzso We have also identified single zzso zzso at 18 sites for human zzso some of which are not zzso
