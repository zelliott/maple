The gene zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso producer of the zzso drug zzso B, encodes a protein of 272 zzso acids identified as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso generated a zzso of zzso zzso zzso that produces no zzso B, but accumulates zzso zzso zzso as the major new zzso together with a small quantity of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso coli yielded a zzso zzso zzso which efficiently zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso but not that of zzso or zzso zzso zzso S was zzso poorly, if at all, by the zzso to produce zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not require a zzso zzso for zzso zzso While zzso or zzso zzso the zzso activity slightly, zzso zzso and zzso are strongly zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso are zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso is zzso The results indicate that zzso is a direct precursor of zzso zzso and that zzso of the zzso zzso group must zzso the zzso zzso They also suggest that zzso S is not the precursor of zzso zzso in zzso B zzso but rather an zzso zzso
