For bacteria, the structural integrity of its cell wall is of utmost importance for survival, and to this end, a rigid scaffold called zzso comprised of sugar molecules and zzso is zzso and located outside the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso of this zzso layer has for many years been a prime target for effective zzso namely the zzso and zzso Because this rigid layer is zzso by a zzso zzso numerous additional targets also exist that have no counterpart in the animal zzso Central to this zzso are four similar zzso zzso which add zzso groups to the sugar zzso and interrupting these steps would ultimately prove fatal to the bacterial zzso The mechanisms of these zzso are well understood and the structures of all four of these zzso are now zzso A detailed comparison of these four zzso shows that considerable zzso changes are possible and that these changes, along with the recruitment of two different zzso binding zzso allows these zzso to bind a zzso which at one end is identical and at the other has the growing zzso zzso Some insights into the zzso relationships in these zzso is zzso
