The aim of the present work was to investigate single zzso zzso zzso of growth hormone zzso zzso gene zzso 10, characterize the genetic variation in three Chinese indigenous goat breeds, and search for its potential association with cashmere zzso In this study, a zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso zzso protocol has been developed for rapid zzso of the zzso gene in zzso One hundred zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Inner Mongolia White zzso zzso and zzso Grey zzso breeds in China were zzso at zzso locus using the protocol zzso In all goat breeds investigated, a zzso in zzso 10 of zzso gene has been identified by analyzing zzso zzso The zzso consists of a single zzso substitution zzso resulting in two zzso named, respectively, A and G based on the zzso at the zzso The zzso A was found to be more common in the animals investigated, and seems to be more consistent with cattle and zzso at this zzso site found in zzso The zzso equilibrium of zzso zzso of zzso locus was verified in zzso zzso and Inner Mongolia White zzso zzso According to the zzso of zzso information content zzso zzso Grey was less zzso than zzso zzso and Inner Mongolia White zzso breeds at this zzso The zzso tree of different species based on the zzso sequences of zzso gene zzso 10 is generally in agreement with the known species zzso No significant association was found between the zzso revealed and the cashmere traits analyzed in present zzso
