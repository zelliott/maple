zzso zzso zzso have been shown to promote single zzso exchange in zzso zzso A zzso zzso was designed to introduce an A to C zzso conversion at the zzso position of the rat factor IX zzso The zzso were zzso in positive, neutral, and zzso charged zzso containing zzso or zzso with zzso zzso The zzso were evaluated for stability and efficiency in targeting zzso via the zzso zzso Physical characterization and electron zzso revealed that the zzso were efficiently zzso within the zzso with the positive and negative zzso remaining stable for at least 1 zzso zzso efficiencies in isolated rat zzso approached zzso with each of the zzso However, the negative zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided the most intense nuclear zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the three different zzso zzso resulted in A to C conversion efficiencies of zzso In addition, zzso zzso was also highly effective in zzso zzso DNA into isolated zzso The results suggest that both the zzso and zzso zzso are simple to prepare and stable and give reliable, zzso zzso They provide efficient delivery systems to zzso for the introduction or repair of genetic zzso by the zzso zzso zzso
