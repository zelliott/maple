The paper is aimed at studying the diversity of zzso zzso community from Paris zzso zzso zzso and to provide a scientific basis for the zzso value of the zzso zzso as zzso material zzso In the present study, zzso zzso were isolated from roots, zzso and leaves of wild zzso zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso zzso county and zzso city of Yunnan province, and identified and classified by zzso methods together with its ITS sequence zzso Seven and zzso strains of zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso They were identified belonging to 41 zzso In these 41 zzso 3 zzso exist in root only, 12 zzso only exist in zzso and 8 zzso only exist in zzso There was difference in zzso zzso isolated from different sample zzso zzso zzso diversity from zzso of zzso site was the zzso zzso zzso similarity zzso was low among different sites and zzso Based on these results, it is reasonable to propose that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from different tissue and different sample sites has a certain difference which is possibly relate to their different zzso different structure and composition of each zzso
