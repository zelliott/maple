The success of zzso is dependent upon closely coordinated interactions between zzso cells and germ zzso To identify specific molecules that mediate interactions between zzso cells and germ cells in the rat zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso differential display were zzso Two zzso clone 1 zzso zzso and clone 2 zzso zzso were zzso when zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso or round zzso Northern zzso analyses confirmed the differential display expression zzso zzso analyses indicated that clone 1 was similar to a von zzso zzso protein zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso and clone 2 was identical to a region of the Huntington disease zzso The von zzso protein zzso was induced after 4 h of zzso while the Huntington disease protein required 18 h of zzso for zzso The von zzso protein was induced in germ cells by a zzso zzso cell zzso smaller than 10 zzso that is sensitive to freezing and zzso or zzso The Huntington disease protein was induced in germ cells by a zzso cell zzso zzso larger than 10 zzso which survives freezing and zzso but is zzso by zzso
