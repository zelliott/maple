zzso support for the concept that zzso molecules circulate throughout the plant, via the zzso is provided through the zzso of zzso from zzso sap of mature pumpkin zzso zzso leaves and zzso One of these zzso zzso is a member of the zzso domain gene family, some of whose members have been shown to be involved in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso in the companion zzso element complex of zzso stem and root zzso zzso and zzso sections showed continuity of transcript distribution between zzso and sieve elements of the zzso suggesting zzso zzso transport over long distances and zzso in zzso root and floral zzso In zzso zzso studies conducted on zzso confirmed the results obtained using in zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso zzso was proved directly by zzso studies between pumpkin and cucumber plants, in which zzso transcripts were shown to accumulate in cucumber scion zzso and zzso zzso Similar experiments were conducted with 7 additional zzso zzso zzso these studies established the existence of a system for the delivery of specific zzso transcripts from the body of the plant to the shoot zzso These findings provide insight into the presence of a novel mechanism likely used by higher plants to integrate zzso and zzso processes on a zzso zzso
