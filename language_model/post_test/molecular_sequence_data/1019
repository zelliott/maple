zzso analysis of large-scale zzso and zzso plant gene expression changes occurring during a susceptible zzso interaction revealed different gene expression profile changes in cotton root and zzso zzso In zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased expression of zzso genes was observed, whereas few changes in the expression levels of zzso genes were found in infected root zzso In infected roots, more plant genes were zzso than were zzso especially at the earlier stages of zzso Although many known cotton defense responses were identified, including induction of zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso potential new defense responses also were identified, such as the zzso of zzso Many of the stress-related gene responses were common to both zzso The repression of zzso proteins such as zzso in both roots and zzso represents a previously zzso response of a host to pathogen attack that may be specific to vascular zzso zzso Gene expression results implicated the zzso zzso and zzso in the disease zzso zzso analysis of hormone level changes supported this zzso
