It is rapidly becoming accepted that the zzso neural tube, in particular the zzso develops into a segmented zzso After segment formation, cells in the neural tube do not cross zzso zzso and zzso gene expression is zzso However, it is not known what zzso cues instruct the neural tube to express genes in this restricted zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso whose expression in the neural tube at zzso is restricted to a segment of the zzso known as zzso zzso A study of its expression pattern earlier in development revealed that prior to the start of zzso zzso zzso is expressed within a zzso to the embryonic zzso that will participate in zzso zzso With the onset of zzso expression then becomes zzso in the neural plate as well, but only in the part that zzso the zzso zzso it is not detected in the more anterior zzso that will form the future zzso and zzso On the basis of these findings, we propose that the zzso is providing cues that serve to instruct the zzso zzso with respect to its position along the zzso axis and that zzso zzso in or reflects this zzso As zzso continues and individual segments form, a second phase of expression is detected in the neural tube in which high levels of zzso transcripts become restricted to zzso zzso zzso expression is also detected in the developing zzso arch units of the zzso region, in a pattern that suggests to us that here, too, zzso is providing a localized signal that zzso zzso zzso in this case in zzso of the zzso and in superficial zzso In general, we interpret the expression patterns of zzso in the zzso region as suggesting that the specific mechanisms of pattern formation in zzso are fundamentally similar to those of zzso and zzso - zzso zzso zzso information is acquired by zzso zzso zzso zzso values within zzso zzso and zzso and both events occur within a restricted window of zzso
