zzso zzso zzso zzso type 9 zzso plays a key role in regulating plasma zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso However, the association of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene and serum zzso levels is inconsistent in several previous zzso The present study was undertaken to detect the association of zzso zzso zzso and several environmental factors with serum zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Han zzso 

A total of zzso subjects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso participants of Han were randomly selected from our previous zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were determined via zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso length zzso combined with gel zzso and then confirmed by direct zzso 

zzso levels of total cholesterol, zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were lower in zzso zzso zzso than in Han zzso zzso zzso for zzso The frequency of G zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in Han zzso zzso zzso There was significant difference in the zzso and zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and Han zzso zzso zzso between normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and between normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso between normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or between normal zzso ratio zzso zzso and low zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso in zzso The G zzso carriers in Han had higher serum zzso levels and the ratio of zzso to zzso than the G zzso zzso The G zzso carriers in Han had higher serum zzso and zzso levels than the G zzso zzso in males zzso zzso zzso for each), whereas the G zzso carriers had lower serum zzso levels and higher the ratio of zzso to zzso than the G zzso zzso in females zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in Han were correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and serum zzso levels and the ratio of zzso to zzso were associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is mainly associated with some serum zzso parameters in the Han zzso The G zzso carriers had higher serum zzso and zzso levels in zzso and lower serum zzso levels and higher the zzso ratio in females than the G zzso zzso
