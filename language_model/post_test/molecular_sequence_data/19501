zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and salicylic acid zzso in zzso fruit were determined using zzso analysis in this zzso Both the zzso and zzso enhanced the resistance of zzso fruit and delayed the initiation infection of zzso zzso When zzso zzso tandem mass zzso was used, a total of 25 proteins could be identified as significantly zzso or zzso in response to at least one zzso According to the function, these proteins were attributed to protein zzso defense response, transcription, energy zzso and cell zzso Among them, 6 zzso and 3 zzso zzso proteins were induced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The induction results of these proteins were related to treatment zzso Six other proteins were identified as the zzso which catalyze the reactions of zzso and zzso acid zzso In addition, both the zzso and zzso treatments enhanced the transcript and translation expression of the zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso associated with sugar zzso were involved in resistance of zzso fruit induced by zzso zzso and zzso
