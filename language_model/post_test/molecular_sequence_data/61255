zzso of zzso zzso in proteins to zzso zzso can be reversed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned the gene zzso a human zzso zzso of the zzso which has an zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the bovine version zzso With dot zzso analyses based on zzso from human zzso expression of zzso was found in all zzso tested, with highest zzso levels in adult kidney and zzso followed by liver, heart zzso bone zzso and zzso In fetal zzso expression was highest in the zzso No expression of zzso was detected in leukemia and zzso cell zzso To test if zzso is functional in cells, we zzso its effect on the zzso time course of the zzso zzso channel zzso since this channel property strongly depends on the zzso state of a zzso zzso in the zzso part of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso significantly accelerated zzso showing that the cloned zzso is functional in an in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the activity of a zzso zzso fusion protein was demonstrated in zzso by measuring the reduction of zzso zzso zzso
