A human zzso clone for zzso a member of the zzso gene family, has been obtained by zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso corresponding to highly zzso regions within an zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso The gene was mapped to zzso zzso In in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso more efficiently from a synthetic element containing both an zzso site zzso and a zzso zzso response element zzso than from one containing an zzso zzso The zzso of a synthetic zzso site by zzso was likely to involve a zzso zzso protein capable of zzso with zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso zzso activated the zzso without making an apparent zzso zzso The zzso between zzso and zzso may be attributed to the enhancing effect of zzso on the zzso activity of zzso because zzso increased zzso zzso activity by more than zzso in an zzso system using a variety of fusion proteins between a zzso zzso domain and a portion of zzso This enhancing effect of zzso required the zzso portion of zzso
