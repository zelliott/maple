Genes zzso to zzso accessory genes are scattered over the whole zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed and showed no zzso zzso zzso of the respective genes in maturation of the zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso of the additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are specific for zzso zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in a different metal zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso and zzso could be increased by the addition of nickel, suggesting that zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso into the active site of the zzso The zzso activity of all the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was the same as in zzso zzso zzso there seems to be no common function for these two zzso genes in zzso and zzso maturation in zzso zzso searches in the whole zzso yielded zzso as the best candidate for the zzso zzso The respective deletion zzso had no zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso activity but resulted in a zzso unable to grow in a medium containing the metal zzso zzso Growth was resumed upon the addition of zzso or zzso Because the latter is zzso by a zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a good candidate for a zzso zzso in zzso
