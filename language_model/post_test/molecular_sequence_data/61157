A zzso neutral and zzso zzso acid transport system zzso plays an important role in many cells and zzso however, the molecular basis for this transport system is still zzso To identify new zzso the expressed sequence tag database was zzso and zzso fragments with sequence similarity to the zzso neurotransmitter zzso family were zzso Based on these zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends of human zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes a zzso acid protein named zzso acid zzso zzso Human zzso zzso is a novel member of the zzso neurotransmitter zzso family with the highest sequence similarity to the zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis identified transcripts of approximately zzso zzso and approximately 2 zzso in the zzso Another tissue survey suggests expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stomach, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were used to functionally characterize the zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso was found to transport both neutral and zzso zzso zzso with the highest affinity for zzso zzso acids and the lowest affinity for zzso zzso acid transport was zzso and zzso and was attenuated in the presence of zzso acid, a system zzso zzso These characteristics are consistent with system zzso zzso acid zzso Thus, zzso is the first cloned zzso zzso acid zzso
