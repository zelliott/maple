zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is widespread in environmental soil and zzso as well as in animal zzso It is also a zzso agent of diseases in humans and other animals, and it produces numerous zzso zzso and zzso Although these toxins have been characterized in detail, regulators of toxin genes are less well zzso The present study identified zzso and zzso as novel regulators of toxin gene zzso zzso and zzso are zzso as an zzso and the zzso proteins have a zzso zzso motif at the N zzso of their zzso acid zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso control the target genes as zzso zzso The expression of several genes zzso toxins was changed in both a zzso zzso and a zzso deletion zzso zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that zzso and zzso zzso regulate their target zzso zzso protein was zzso with zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso and zzso proteins form a stable complex in zzso zzso under their native zzso Although the small zzso that regulates several genes under the zzso zzso system zzso positively affected zzso zzso zzso it did not control expression of the zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso and zzso regulate a different set of toxin genes from the zzso zzso
