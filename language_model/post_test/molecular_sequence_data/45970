zzso to zzso stress in zzso coli depends on the zzso of zzso normally zzso by the membrane protein zzso zzso is released in response to stress through the successive zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that free it from zzso are zzso We isolated a zzso zzso that alleviated zzso and zzso zzso The zzso encodes a novel small zzso zzso Its activity required the zzso protein zzso We used the property that small zzso are often involved in zzso interactions to capture zzso putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso two major outer membrane zzso were zzso zzso activity was shown to zzso an zzso coordinate zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso is shown to be no longer essential in a strain lacking zzso and zzso we conclude that zzso which is required for normal zzso zzso prevents toxicity due to the presence of two specific outer membrane proteins that are zzso by zzso
