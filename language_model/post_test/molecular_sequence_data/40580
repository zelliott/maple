zzso family zzso are critical regulators in determining and maintaining cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso play important but distinct roles in regulating polarized zzso and overall zzso zzso is highly polarized during bud emergence and is specifically required for zzso at this zzso In contrast, zzso appears to play an important role during the zzso growth of larger zzso Using a novel zzso zzso against zzso we find that zzso zzso to the cell surface in a dispersed pattern which is clearly distinct from that of zzso Using zzso forms of these zzso we demonstrate that a small region at the N zzso is necessary and sufficient to zzso zzso zzso and function onto zzso Analysis of this domain reveals two essential elements responsible for distinguishing zzso First, zzso of a zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is required both for the switch of function and the switch of zzso properties of this zzso Second, two basic zzso zzso to the zzso site are required for regulating binding affinity with the zzso and zzso zzso This demonstrates the importance of zzso and zzso binding in determining how these zzso evolved specific functions at distinct stages of polarized zzso
