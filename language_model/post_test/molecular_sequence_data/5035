We have shown that in zzso cells treatment with 75 zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso increase in zzso zzso as part of an zzso response to chemical zzso In these cells the zzso in zzso zzso level was found to be accompanied by an increase of between zzso and zzso in the level of the 73 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the 31 zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were increased by up to zzso in zzso cells in response to zzso To study the zzso regulation of zzso we zzso zzso zzso of the upstream region of the human zzso gene zzso from a zzso clone isolated from a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso promoter reporter zzso and treated with zzso This resulted in an induction of between zzso and zzso in reporter activity, indicating that zzso regulation of zzso is likely to contribute to the induction of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region demonstrated the presence of putative zzso elements including zzso sites and an zzso element, which might be involved in the observed induction of the zzso zzso
