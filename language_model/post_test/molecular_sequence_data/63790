zzso study of gene diversity of zzso compounds in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has made it possible to identify zzso and zzso peptides zzso zzso for by conventional chemical screening zzso Here we report the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso gene responsible for the zzso of an zzso zzso using a genetic zzso Isolation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved using zzso zzso specific to the zzso domain of zzso The complete zzso of zzso is zzso zzso in zzso Based on comparisons with other known zzso the domain arrangement of zzso is most likely to be zzso The other zzso found upstream of zzso designated zzso is zzso zzso in length and shows high similarity to members of the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene was conducted by gene zzso and the missing zzso in the zzso was zzso Chemical analysis revealed the structure of the zzso to be a zzso zzso which has been found in other zzso A zzso of zzso revealed a wide range of biological activities other than zzso zzso which have been previously reported, thus making zzso an interesting candidate for future structural zzso This study is the first evidence for a gene involved in the zzso of zzso
