zzso is a type I zzso protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso This zzso is zzso expressed in activated T zzso and may function as signaling zzso during zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso organization of the entire mouse zzso zzso zzso The gene spans a zzso region and consists of five zzso (with a length ranging from 88 zzso to 395 zzso and four zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In agreement with zzso expression in activated T cells, consensus elements for zzso factors involved in zzso development and zzso were identified in the zzso zzso region, including a consensus element for zzso Two highly significant binding sites for zzso and one binding site for zzso were also found, suggesting involvement of zzso in muscle zzso The zzso gene contains 17 zzso initiation sites distributed over a zzso region, all used with the same zzso We localized zzso to the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso where other 4 zzso members zzso including zzso and zzso These results further indicate that zzso shares several features with zzso zzso and zzso suggesting the existence of a new zzso of the zzso family, as also confirmed by the similarity of their zzso zzso
