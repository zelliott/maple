A novel zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from the zzso tract of a fish, and its zzso position was investigated by a zzso zzso The sample was collected from the coast of Tokyo Bay, zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso type of the isolate was zzso zzso was the diagnostic zzso zzso The only zzso detected was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso was detected as a major zzso zzso The polar lipids were zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso formed a zzso cluster with a zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso zzso zzso zzso was clearly distinguishable from the zzso zzso in terms of its zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso and zzso zzso a new zzso and species is proposed for strain zzso with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis of the zzso zzso and related zzso zzso descriptions of the families zzso and zzso are proposed to accommodate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
