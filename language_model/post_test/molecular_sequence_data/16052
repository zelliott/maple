A zzso called zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso It was found expressed as zzso at low to medium abundance in early zzso of the B zzso in zzso and mature B lineage cell lines, in normal resting B zzso and in zzso activated B cell zzso The gene was not expressed in zzso in cell lines of the zzso the T zzso or the zzso zzso nor in zzso liver, heart, zzso lung or zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene encodes a putative membrane zzso with 220 zzso zzso which includes a leader zzso a putative zzso domain with two potential zzso sites, a zzso portion and a putative zzso zzso The partial sequence of a human zzso zzso shows nearly zzso zzso in zzso as well as zzso acid sequences to the zzso form of a stretch of the putative zzso zzso zzso raised against a fusion protein of zzso with protein A, affinity zzso for their zzso zzso stained zzso and mature B cell lines on their surface, but did not stain T cell lines and zzso zzso raised against a stretch of 20 zzso acids of the putative zzso domain with zzso zzso between the mouse and human protein did not stain the surface of any cell lines zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
