The T cell repertoire is shaped by the processes of positive and negative zzso We have previously shown that mice are tolerant to a native zzso mouse zzso zzso but they respond vigorously when challenged with different zzso peptides zzso zzso In this study, we have addressed the issue of the zzso significance of both the hierarchy zzso of zzso within zzso and the zzso self zzso T cell zzso Our results demonstrate that there are several zzso peptides that bind well to zzso but are totally zzso when tested for zzso T cell response and zzso zzso a subset of these peptides presumably represent the originally dominant zzso of zzso which have rendered the T cells tolerant during zzso zzso Other zzso zzso which bind well to zzso and are zzso zzso to the cryptic zzso of zzso T cells against cryptic zzso zzso escape tolerance zzso Thus, the mature T cell repertoire against zzso bears the direct imprint of the hierarchy of self zzso Interestingly, zzso egg white zzso could prime T cells in zzso that were zzso with certain cryptic zzso zzso and vice versa, without requiring any zzso with the foreign zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso deliberate zzso and expansion of T cells by zzso egg white zzso zzso zzso enhanced T cell response to such zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a previously zzso but zzso role in the expansion and diversification of zzso clones in the zzso zzso
