zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the synthesis of zzso The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso and has been proposed to zzso a putative zzso In the present paper, we report the cloning of zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso and a detailed zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso Similar to other zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of an zzso regulatory domain followed by a zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain and shows high zzso specificity for zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and is zzso at zzso zzso to zzso in zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso However, zzso is devoid of characteristic regulatory mechanisms present in zzso such as negative zzso for the zzso zzso zzso or feedback zzso exerted by zzso zzso of the zzso Thus zzso activity in zzso zzso displays a weaker regulation in comparison with the human zzso resembling a zzso active zzso Overall, our data suggest that the intricate regulation characteristic of zzso zzso might have evolved from more simple models to adjust to the increasing complexity of the higher zzso neuroendocrine zzso
