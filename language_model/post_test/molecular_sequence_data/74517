zzso zzso with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso is a familial zzso syndrome characterized by zzso and genetic zzso It was associated with zzso in the zzso zzso sodium channel zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso acid receptors genes zzso zzso We investigated the roles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was extracted from peripheral blood zzso of 23 zzso and their family zzso The sequences of zzso zzso and zzso genes were analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso and direct zzso The major zzso of affected members in the 23 zzso families exhibited zzso and zzso whereas rare zzso zzso generalized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso were also zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was identified in one family and another novel zzso in zzso zzso in another zzso However, no zzso zzso was zzso The combined frequency of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso extending the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso to Chinese zzso zzso There were still unidentified genes contributing to the zzso of zzso
