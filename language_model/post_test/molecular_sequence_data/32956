The zzso sodium channel is expressed in zzso zzso zzso where it contributes to spontaneous pain behavior after peripheral zzso Here, we used a newly developed zzso to investigate the distribution of zzso in rat and mouse zzso zzso zzso nerve endings and in enteric nervous system zzso In zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso of small- and zzso zzso zzso zzso was present along zzso zzso fibers and at terminals in lip skin and dental zzso In the zzso zzso was detected within the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso type II, zzso and zzso zzso zzso data were correlated with the detection of persistent zzso zzso currents sharing similar properties in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our data support a potential role of zzso in the transmission of zzso pain and the regulation of zzso zzso zzso might therefore constitute a molecular target for therapeutic treatments of zzso pain and gastrointestinal zzso
