We have examined the functional properties of a putative regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso in chicken cardiac zzso light chain 2 zzso gene promoter by zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso by zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the element A zzso which resembles the zzso zzso zzso zzso box, plays a role in defining the zzso initiation site in zzso zzso This is accomplished via repression of a potential zzso initiation at site zzso and promoting the initiation at zzso One of the two other zzso sequences zzso zzso located zzso to initiation site zzso serves as the zzso promoter while the zzso zzso rich element B zzso in tissue specific zzso of the zzso
