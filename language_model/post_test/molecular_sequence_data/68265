A zzso in the gene for zzso protein has been identified, using amplification by the zzso chain reaction, restriction zzso zzso and zzso separation by zzso gel zzso The zzso is located in the transcribed zzso region, a region with potential regulatory zzso The zzso consists of a single base pair zzso into a zzso III restriction site, producing a larger rare zzso of 409 zzso as compared with the more frequent 325 zzso zzso The gene for zzso protein is on the X zzso thus the males are zzso for the rare zzso and the females are zzso zzso The zzso occurs with a frequency of zzso in a population of European origin and also has a rare frequency in multiple sclerosis zzso
