zzso zzso is a zzso containing a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso The reaction proceeds through the formation of a zzso zzso zzso after which, water addition takes zzso zzso located near the zzso of the zzso has been proposed to act as an active site zzso To test this hypothesis, we have addressed the properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, together with the crystal structure of zzso suggests that the zzso replacements do not induce major structural zzso However, in zzso and zzso 50 and zzso respectively, of the zzso is zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is required for zzso zzso is zzso less active, and the other zzso zzso are about zzso less active than wild type zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is caused by slow zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso proteins have lost the capability of forming a stable complex between reduced zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are considerably decreased compared with wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso This supports the idea that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso of the reduced zzso thus increasing the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso is involved in the process of zzso zzso and is crucial for efficient zzso zzso
