The zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso zzso to zzso zzso that binds zzso zzso We report here that the zzso zzso is a major site of zzso expression in zzso based on zzso of human tissue zzso In this zzso zzso cells at the base of the zzso do not express zzso but its expression increases with differentiation along the zzso zzso zzso expression is concentrated in the zzso of these differentiated zzso zzso The progression from normal zzso to zzso to zzso is associated with significant changes in zzso nuclear zzso and zzso In all zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was not present in the nucleus but was localized in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from normal zzso and zzso revealed no specific zzso that could account for this loss of nuclear zzso We also observed a zzso to zzso decrease in zzso zzso levels in cancer compared to normal zzso as well as a significant reduction in the amount of zzso protein zzso These observations suggest that zzso exclusion from the nucleus and its decreased expression may be related to the zzso progression of colon zzso
