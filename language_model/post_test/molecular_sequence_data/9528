zzso are renowned as the zzso of Earth's zzso However, little is known about the zzso communities that flourished under the zzso conditions that characterized most of their evolutionary zzso zzso mats in the submerged Middle Island zzso of Lake zzso provide opportunities to investigate zzso under such persistent zzso zzso Here, venting groundwater rich in zzso and low in zzso supports a unique zzso zzso of purple-colored zzso zzso Beneath the mat is a layer of zzso that is enriched in zzso and to a lesser extent zzso In zzso zzso metabolism chambers revealed that the mats are net sinks for zzso suggesting primary production mechanisms other than zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso studies of zzso production show variable contributions from zzso and zzso photosynthesis and zzso presumably because of supply of zzso These results suggest the presence of either zzso zzso zzso or a mix of zzso types of zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed a remarkably zzso mat community dominated by just one zzso most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso for which an essentially complete zzso was zzso Also recovered were partial zzso from a second zzso of zzso and several zzso Despite the zzso zzso diverse zzso genes zzso involved in sulfur zzso were identified, suggesting a diversity of zzso zzso The dominant zzso zzso reflects versatile metabolism and physiology that is specialized for a communal lifestyle under fluctuating zzso conditions and light zzso Overall, this study provides zzso and zzso insights into zzso zzso mat zzso that played crucial zzso roles over long stretches of Earth zzso
