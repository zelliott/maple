DNA amplification zzso zzso is a strategy for genetic typing and mapping that uses one or more very short zzso or zzso 5 zzso arbitrary zzso to direct the zzso amplification of discrete portions of a DNA template resulting in a spectrum of products characteristic of the DNA starting zzso zzso from simple zzso patterns are useful as genetic markers while more complex and zzso patterns are suitable for DNA zzso The use of zzso gel zzso and silver zzso can adequately resolve the spectrum of zzso products into detailed and zzso zzso
