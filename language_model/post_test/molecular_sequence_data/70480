We have used zzso differential display to compare gene expression in normal and zzso zzso dwarf zzso and report here the characterization of one zzso expressed zzso which shows significant sequence identity to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated from a chicken liver zzso library and an additional sequence was obtained using zzso rapid amplification of zzso zzso A complete zzso probe zzso to three transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso on Northern blots of chicken liver zzso which differ in the length of the 3' untranslated zzso All three transcripts are expressed at higher levels in normal vs dwarf zzso as expected for a zzso zzso The expression of this zzso zzso was also detected in skeletal muscle, but not other zzso The administration of zzso to chickens increased the zzso expression within 1 zzso suggesting this zzso could be directly regulated by zzso zzso activity, using zzso or zzso as zzso is detected in cells zzso with an expression zzso containing the full-length zzso The sequence of this zzso does not show significant similarity with any zzso of the zzso and its zzso zzso is presently zzso However, we speculate that zzso zzso of zzso activity could play a role in reducing zzso of zzso steroid hormones in zzso target zzso These results demonstrate the usefulness of differential display in this model system to identify genes that play a role in zzso zzso zzso
