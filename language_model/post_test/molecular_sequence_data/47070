zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso family, is a zzso zzso in contrast to the more zzso members of this protein family including zzso zzso zzso from zzso In a previous study zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso the membrane association of zzso was correlated to a 53 zzso acid segment in the interior of the primary sequence by construction of a zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso segment in zzso was deleted and replaced with the corresponding 34 zzso acid segment from the soluble zzso Though zzso was zzso it was an inefficient, zzso zzso that involved a different transition state for the zzso reaction from that of the zzso zzso In the present study, it is shown that the zzso segment in zzso is somewhat zzso approximately 39 zzso zzso zzso or total deletion of this segment zzso membrane zzso of zzso This segment is not important for zzso zzso zzso A new zzso zzso was created by replacing this shorter zzso segment from zzso with the corresponding 20 zzso acid segment from zzso The soluble zzso is very similar to the zzso zzso zzso in its zzso properties, zzso zzso zzso activity, kinetic zzso and lack of zzso toward zzso zzso it should prove to be a highly useful model for structural studies of zzso
