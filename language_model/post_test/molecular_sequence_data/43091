zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of four zzso zzso units into the linear zzso zzso necessary for the formation of zzso and zzso in plant zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed based on zzso acid sequence data zzso by mass zzso for zzso zzso zzso from pea zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were used in zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification to produce partial zzso and nuclear zzso fragments zzso the zzso zzso a zzso zzso was isolated by screening a zzso library constructed in zzso zzso from leaf zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso encodes an approximately zzso zzso containing a zzso acid zzso transit zzso and a mature protein of 323 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the mature pea zzso is similar to zzso zzso from other species and contains the zzso zzso and zzso zzso previously implicated in zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that the pea gene zzso zzso zzso is expressed to varying levels in zzso zzso and is subject to light zzso
