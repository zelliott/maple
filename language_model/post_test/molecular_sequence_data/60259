A recently discovered family of proteins that function as copper zzso route copper to proteins that either require it for their function or are involved in its zzso In zzso zzso the copper zzso function is performed by the zzso protein zzso This paper describes the zzso structure of zzso obtained using zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso studies of the impact of zzso binding on the zzso zzso The protein has a zzso fold, where the four zzso form an zzso twisted zzso and the two zzso are located on the same side of the zzso A sequence motif zzso in the loop between the first zzso and the first zzso contains the primary zzso which bind zzso zzso of zzso caused major structural changes in this molecular region, as zzso by the fact that most zzso signals of the loop and the zzso part of the first zzso were broadened beyond zzso This effect was strictly zzso because the remainder of the zzso structure was maintained after addition of zzso zzso relaxation data showed a decreased correlation time of overall molecular tumbling for zzso when compared with zzso indicating zzso of zzso The structure of zzso is the first three-dimensional structure of a zzso for which the metal zzso is an zzso zzso rather than an integral part of the zzso zzso of the present structural work for the in zzso function of zzso are discussed, zzso it is of special interest that the distribution of charged zzso on the zzso surface is highly uneven and suggests preferred recognition sites for other proteins that might be involved in copper zzso
