zzso zzso is part of zzso zzso type 2 zzso of zzso fatty acid zzso The zzso protein from zzso contains in the same zzso chain two zzso (A and B), which possess difference in zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso AB zzso consisting of zzso A and B, determined at the resolution of zzso shows overall similarity with the zzso counterpart from zzso but also important differences that explain the zzso specificity differences zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso A binds the zzso fatty zzso chain of a zzso zzso zzso as bent into the binding pocket, whereas the zzso zzso are zzso by two zzso zzso a zzso zzso group zzso does not reach the zzso contacts needed for zzso the zzso into the active zzso and zzso zzso in the loop above the zzso zzso attracts zzso zzso away from the active zzso zzso B, which can use a zzso zzso has a more shallow binding pocket and the zzso is correctly placed for zzso Based on the current structure, and together with the structure of the zzso zzso 2 unit of zzso zzso it becomes obvious that in zzso and zzso zzso despite basically identical functional zzso the assembly of these zzso into a mature, zzso zzso zzso is very zzso
