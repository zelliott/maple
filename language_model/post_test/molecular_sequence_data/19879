A strain zzso an zzso within the promoter of the zzso gene of zzso zzso was zzso This gene was previously shown to be essential for zzso formation and growth in zzso and is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso zzso gene expression analysis was used to identify several genes whose zzso during zzso depends on zzso These include the zzso zzso gene zzso and several other genes which like zzso are predicted to zzso G zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed several zzso genes which may zzso factors determining cell wall structure or function, either through the zzso of cell wall components or by association with the cell zzso One zzso gene predicted to zzso a class zzso zzso zzso was deleted, leading to dramatic consequences on the zzso development of the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso a zzso reduction in zzso content of zzso spores was found and the zzso was hypersensitive to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso A green fluorescent zzso zzso was found to have nuclear zzso within zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that zzso encodes a zzso factor required for the zzso of several genes which participate in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
