We engineered a zzso expression zzso zzso the zzso reverse zzso zzso We grew zzso coli zzso carrying the zzso in a zzso stirred tank zzso and zzso zzso zzso under native conditions to apparent zzso zzso zzso zzso than or equal to 5 zzso was not stable, and was rapidly processed to its 51 zzso zzso zzso until zzso levels were approximately zzso These latter zzso preparations were zzso as zzso and had approximately fivefold higher specific zzso zzso activities compared with those containing predominantly zzso zzso zzso under dilute zzso (less than or equal to zzso zzso was zzso in solution, resistant to zzso processing for weeks at 4 degrees C, but also had low specific zzso zzso zzso To attempt the preparation of homogeneous zzso with specific zzso zzso activities equivalent to zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso during extensive dialysis zzso zzso zzso zzso (less than or equal to zzso zzso was zzso in solution and had identical specific zzso zzso activities, zzso for zzso and zzso by zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso The data indicates that zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso coli under native conditions is extensively processed at zzso promoting zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso yields apparently homogeneous zzso zzso with specific zzso zzso activities equivalent to zzso zzso
