The zzso distribution of the gene coding for bacterial alkaline zzso zzso was examined in nine species of enteric bacteria closely related to zzso zzso The zzso and protein sequences from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes are zzso The spatial distribution of replaced zzso acid zzso in the aligned sequences is shown to be highly zzso and can be correlated with specific regions within the zzso structure of the zzso There is an avoidance of replacements within the beta sheet of the zzso and there is an excess of replacements elsewhere, particularly in zzso zzso In addition, all positions across alpha zzso do not accept replacements with equal zzso there is a bias toward acceptance of replacements in the zzso ends of zzso To examine this further, zzso within the zzso coli zzso gene were created using zzso zzso The patterns seen from the sequence comparisons were verified in the zzso zzso The average activity of zzso within or near the beta sheet was approximately one-third of that within or near alpha zzso and multiple zzso within the zzso ends of alpha zzso always possessed greater activity than did multiple zzso within the corresponding zzso zzso The results indicate that identifiable regions within the protein are under different selective pressures and are therefore evolving at different zzso
