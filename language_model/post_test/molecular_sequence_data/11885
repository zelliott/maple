zzso of zzso proteins in the periphery may result in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso It is not clear why some zzso induce zzso whereas others activate zzso T zzso The physical nature of the zzso the zzso timing of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and the level of zzso expression are possible factors determining the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso of the whole zzso large T zzso zzso zzso transformation of T zzso cells in zzso and this phenomenon has been zzso to be the triggering event that leads to zzso in some transgenic mouse zzso Here we present a model in which a zzso yet zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is expressed specifically in pancreatic zzso zzso In contrast to whole zzso transgenic mice, zzso mice that are also transgenic for a zzso specific for the zzso are ignorant of zzso in zzso They do not respond in zzso to the zzso zzso zzso even after zzso but are fully responsive in zzso This zzso ignorance cannot be broken after activated zzso zzso T cells are transferred into zzso zzso mice expressing the zzso zzso However, similar adoptive transfer experiments in mice zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cells specifically lead to zzso recognition and zzso This demonstrates that in some circumstances the presence of zzso zzso T cells is not sufficient to break zzso rather, zzso is additionally required to elicit an zzso zzso This also suggests that zzso cellular transformation is important for the zzso response directed against zzso in other zzso transgenic zzso
