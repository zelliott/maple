The large zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains a zzso and a zzso maintenance stability zzso zzso on adjacent zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso on the zzso C zzso was confirmed, and the complete sequence of the adjacent zzso O zzso was zzso It shows zzso to part of the transfer zzso zzso of the F zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso region containing a zzso of the F zzso gene was sufficient to zzso zzso However, the zzso open reading frame could be interrupted without zzso zzso zzso analysis implicated the involvement of two small open reading zzso zzso and zzso that fully overlap zzso in the opposite zzso These open reading frames are closely related to the zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and to open reading frame pairs in the F zzso region and in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to promote zzso distribution of zzso copies and is a zzso zzso zzso The F zzso does not itself zzso stability but exerts zzso against the activity of the zzso zzso zzso is likely to zzso either an active partition system or a zzso killing zzso It shows little similarity to previously studied zzso stability zzso but the genetic organization of zzso and zzso resembles that of zzso killing zzso
