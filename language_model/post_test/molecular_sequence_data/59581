zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared in the peripheral and pulmonary vascular beds of the cat and in the isolated zzso zzso pig zzso zzso injections of zzso and zzso produced zzso changes in systemic zzso pressure whereas zzso injections of zzso caused only decreases in zzso zzso When blood flow to the hind limb and zzso vascular beds was maintained constant, zzso and zzso caused zzso zzso changes in zzso pressure, whereas zzso only decreased zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso more potent than zzso and the zzso component of the zzso response was blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance, and all three peptides had significant zzso activity in the isolated zzso zzso pig zzso Although all three peptides decreased coronary vascular resistance, only zzso and zzso increased left zzso zzso with zzso approaching zzso in zzso The results of these experiments show that zzso zzso and zzso have significant effects on zzso tone that depend on the vascular bed studied and the contribution of adrenal zzso
