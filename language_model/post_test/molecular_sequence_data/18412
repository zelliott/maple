The objective of this study was to evaluate zzso the contribution that zzso zzso and zzso bonds make to protein stability using a model protein with zzso secondary, zzso and zzso zzso This de zzso protein consists of two identical zzso zzso zzso chains arranged in a zzso structure, which are stabilized by nine pairs of zzso zzso interactions from zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins differ from the zzso only at positions 16 and 19 of each chain which contain either zzso zzso Ala, zzso or zzso instead of zzso zzso The stability of each protein was determined in its reduced and oxidized form from zzso zzso zzso experiments using circular zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing the zzso bond were essentially zzso zzso in benign medium zzso M zzso zzso pH 7, containing zzso M zzso with transition zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso M zzso zzso Reduction of the zzso bond had little effect on the zzso but resulted in significant decreases in zzso of the other zzso The order of protein stability of these zzso remains the same in the absence or presence of the zzso bond zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso Interestingly, the more stable the protein was in the absence of the zzso bond, the larger the contribution the zzso bond made to protein zzso The identical zzso in the zzso bridge protein had a much greater effect on protein stability than in the reduced zzso This suggests that the zzso bond controls the zzso of the zzso some zzso zzso further along the zzso chain (the zzso bond is between positions 2 and 2' and the closest zzso site in the zzso is at position 16 and zzso In contrast, in the absence of the zzso bond, the zzso is more flexible and can accommodate the zzso more easily by adjusting the zzso packing around the zzso zzso The zzso tendency of zzso zzso was deduced in this study by comparing the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso buffer containing 50% zzso where they exist as zzso zzso zzso is an important factor in determining the zzso forming tendency of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
