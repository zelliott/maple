zzso is preceded by a large increase in gap junctions between zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso 43 is the major structural protein of zzso gap zzso To explore zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso we used zzso I zzso zzso mobility shift and transient zzso zzso to examine a 312 zzso promoter region zzso to zzso of the zzso utilizing human zzso cell cultures and nuclear zzso The zzso I studies showed four regions of zzso zzso Protection of region 1 zzso to zzso zzso an zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso to zzso and two zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso consensus zzso zzso 2 to 4 included the zzso initiation site zzso to zzso an zzso consensus sequence zzso to zzso and a zzso region zzso to zzso zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso demonstrated zzso and zzso binding at the zzso and zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and transient zzso analyses combined with zzso and zzso zzso studies indicate that both zzso and zzso are required for zzso promoter activity and, therefore, may positively regulate zzso of zzso zzso during the initiation of zzso
