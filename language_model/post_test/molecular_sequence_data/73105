The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was identified and localized on three zzso restriction fragments zzso size zzso zzso The fragments were cloned and zzso The zzso gene had an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a putative protein with a predicted size of 115 zzso zzso analysis indicated that the putative protein contained 14 potential zzso sites zzso zzso that are probably not used since the protein zzso on zzso as a 115 zzso zzso The protein is rich in zzso zzso zzso which explains the need for reducing agents when zzso the zzso bodies with zzso The zzso gene sequence contains motifs characteristic of the late genes of zzso These include the typical zzso sequence at the beginning of the coding region and two early gene termination signals zzso in the untranslated region of the zzso The promoter region has three zzso termination signals immediately upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso among different zzso There was zzso identity and zzso similarity at the zzso acid level between the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Less conservation was seen with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso gene by Northern blots showed that the transcript had a size of approximately 3 zzso which is in agreement with the length of the zzso zzso extension results, anchor zzso and sequencing confirmed that there was a zzso zzso tract at the zzso end of the zzso gene transcript, a structure typical of late gene transcripts of zzso
