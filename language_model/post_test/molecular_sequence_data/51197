The zzso properties of zzso zzso an zzso zzso associated with pathological states in plants, have been investigated by zzso zzso and CD zzso and by the synthesis of relevant model zzso zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thomas zzso in zzso 1990, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that a significant contribution to the zzso was due to the presence of a zzso acid zzso in the zzso acid zzso The model peptides zzso zzso and its zzso zzso lacking the zzso bond, were zzso using standard solution chemistry, and a detailed investigation was made in which the zzso of the models and that of zzso (an zzso closely related to zzso E but without a zzso zzso were compared with those of zzso E under a variety of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso E clearly showed the presence of the zzso zzso while the CD zzso were complex, environmentally sensitive, and contained contributions from both the delta zzso and zzso zzso In the course of these studies extinction zzso were obtained for zzso E and its zzso zzso The origins of the zzso and CD zzso are discussed in detail, and a comparison is made with the zzso of other, similar zzso zzso Finally, a structural model for zzso is proposed in which the changes induced in the spectrum by zzso in the zzso environment are zzso
