zzso zzso B zzso is a member of the second zzso family of zzso zzso that has been implicated in signaling pathways downstream of growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of the human zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in a number of human zzso with zzso and protein levels elevated in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and zzso After zzso into zzso or zzso cells, zzso is activated zzso to zzso by zzso and survival zzso zzso was due to zzso on zzso and zzso which zzso to zzso and zzso implicated in the regulation of zzso Both zzso and zzso were prevented by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was zzso activated when zzso in zzso zzso Although the specific activity of zzso was lower than that of zzso toward zzso as a zzso zzso zzso compared with 178 zzso for zzso both zzso showed similar zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso results in its nuclear zzso within 20 to 30 zzso after zzso These observations provide evidence that zzso zzso nuclear zzso upon zzso zzso and support a role for zzso in signaling from zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus through zzso zzso
