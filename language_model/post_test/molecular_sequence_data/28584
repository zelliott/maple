zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of a novel family of zzso proteins localized in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins contain multiple zzso growth zzso zzso a putative zzso spanning domain and a short zzso zzso zzso signals to the zzso are zzso in this short zzso We established previously that zzso serves as an zzso for two soluble zzso zzso and zzso Here, we present the characterization of zzso and three additional members of this family, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with having sorting signals localized in its zzso tail, zzso exhibits a classical type I membrane zzso during its transport along the zzso zzso and during storage in the zzso zzso is processed at the zzso probably in the zzso network, and the zzso site has been precisely zzso Additionally, like other members of the zzso anonymous protein family, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso near their zzso domain upon discharge by zzso We also provide evidence that zzso escorts another recently described soluble zzso zzso This suggests that the existence of zzso protein complexes is not an exception but rather the zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the rapidly dividing zzso while zzso and zzso genes are predominantly expressed in zzso where they presumably also serve as zzso
