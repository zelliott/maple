The genes zzso the zzso joining and constant regions of human zzso light chains have been localized to the short arm of zzso zzso However, several zzso genes lie outside of the zzso a single copy cluster of five zzso genes is located on zzso zzso an isolated but amplified zzso gene is found on zzso 1; and several isolated zzso genes are on zzso zzso other than zzso zzso zzso genes not contained within the zzso locus are termed zzso We have attempted to gain insight into the mechanism of zzso of both the zzso 22 cluster and the several amplified zzso genes by searching in the zzso locus for a parent copy of the former, and by analyzing the junctions between zzso zzso segments and adjacent zzso zzso The zzso 22 zzso cluster must have been zzso zzso zzso features at the junctions of this and other zzso regions are direct and zzso repeats, and, in one case, an zzso zzso These unusual features may have predisposed the zzso regions to zzso by serving as target sites for zzso involved in zzso
