The rate of progression to AIDS in human zzso virus type 1 zzso individuals is determined by a complex series of interactions between the host and zzso Here we evaluate zzso properties and host responses in two men zzso infected with zzso from the same sexual zzso individual progressed to AIDS in less than 2 years, and the other remains zzso 3 years zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular immune responses were zzso with the slower zzso exhibiting generally stronger and broader responses, except for zzso zzso responses early in zzso Virtually zzso homogeneous virus populations were found in both patients in the first sample zzso however, a second unrelated zzso virus population was also found in the fast zzso Whether the second population zzso from an additional source of infection or the two were transmitted from the original source could not be zzso The virus population in the slower zzso turned over and diversified zzso whereas both virus populations in the rapid zzso evolved at a much slower zzso In addition, the character of zzso changes underlying these zzso appeared to be zzso with a bias for diversifying selection developing in the slower zzso and a zzso bias towards zzso selection maintained in both populations in the fast zzso Thus, the rapid evolution that is a hallmark of zzso replication may be a reflection of strong host resistance against emerging virus zzso and a longer period of zzso zzso Furthermore, rapid progression was not linked to a collapse of any appreciable immune response following zzso of some threshold of zzso diversity but rather to a failure to drive this diversification and a condition of relatively zzso expansion of zzso with zzso zzso capacity within the zzso
