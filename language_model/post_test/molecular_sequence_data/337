The zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso bacteria adapted to zzso including previously recognized and emerging human zzso We report the zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso one of the most prevalent zzso species in wild zzso Comparative zzso revealed that zzso zzso species have higher copy numbers of genes for putative zzso factors than the related zzso zzso Many of these gene clusters are located in a highly dynamic region of 461 zzso Using zzso to a zzso designed for the zzso zzso zzso we observed a massive, zzso zzso zzso replication of this zzso We also identified a novel gene transfer agent, which packages the bacterial zzso with an zzso of the amplified DNA, in 14 zzso zzso This is the first observation zzso the products of zzso replication with a gene transfer zzso Because of the high concentration of gene clusters for zzso proteins in the amplified region, and since the genes zzso the gene transfer agent and the zzso origin are well zzso in zzso we zzso that these systems are driven by zzso We propose that the zzso of zzso replication with gene transfer agents promotes diversification and rapid spread of zzso factors, zzso host shifts in zzso
