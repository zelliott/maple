The structure of the binding site of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was modeled utilizing web zzso modeling zzso and zzso Although zzso experiments performed with an aromatic zzso acid as model zzso were unsuccessful with the zzso structure, zzso binding was achieved with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso flexibility within the binding site resulted in a protein structure that zzso binds to the zzso of the model zzso In addition to four hydrogen bonds that are formed between zzso acid zzso in the binding site and the zzso a number of zzso interactions are involved in the formation of the zzso zzso The aromatic side chain of the zzso interacts with a zzso and a zzso zzso in the binding site through zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso investigations also suggest the presence of zzso zzso in the binding site, as zzso binding causes an enhancement of the zzso intrinsic zzso at an zzso wavelength of 350 zzso Based on the modeled zzso structure, the zzso of the model zzso cannot access the binding site due to zzso zzso Additional zzso experiments performed with zzso and zzso showed that these zzso are bound to the zzso in a way analogous to the zzso of the model zzso
