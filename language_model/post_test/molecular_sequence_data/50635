A new zzso zzso located in the X open reading frame and immediately upstream of the core gene promoter, has recently been identified in the zzso of zzso B zzso We have studied the functional constituents of this new zzso in different cell zzso zzso can be divided into two functional zzso A and B, corresponding to two major binding sequences for nuclear protein zzso zzso A alone gave very low zzso however, it was a zzso element important for zzso zzso zzso B was shown to be the basic functional element of zzso which retained about zzso of the zzso activity of the complete zzso in zzso zzso zzso B can be further dissected into three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which act zzso A zzso sequence is identified as the core sequences of element zzso A model for the mechanism of zzso function is zzso
