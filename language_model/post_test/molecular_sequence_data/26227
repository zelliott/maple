Models of zzso and zzso backbone zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso were determined by comparing geometrical similarity among the previously found low-energy backbone structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The present zzso zzso resembles a zzso bend in the zzso backbone zzso on the zzso zzso Two slightly different models were found for the zzso zzso both of them are more extended than the zzso zzso and include a zzso (or a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso side chains were also determined for the zzso and zzso The present models of zzso and zzso share geometrical similarity with the low-energy structures of zzso and the zzso
