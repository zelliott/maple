zzso type 3 receptors zzso are members of the zzso gated zzso channel zzso zzso In this study, the interactions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the binding site of the zzso were investigated at an atomic zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso B and E along with our earlier published results from zzso within zzso A, C, and D provide comprehensive data on the interaction of zzso and zzso with zzso Using this data we have constructed a refined zzso model of the zzso that considers all of the available experimental zzso zzso and zzso were zzso into the newly constructed zzso model and the zzso acid zzso critical in binding of these zzso were compared and zzso Our zzso results reveal many similar binding interactions for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all found to play key roles in binding of both zzso and zzso However, the results also revealed two important differences that exist between the interactions of the two zzso In our model, a hydrogen bond is formed between the zzso hydrogen of zzso and the zzso zzso This interaction is not present in the case of zzso zzso a hydrogen bond exists between zzso and a zzso nitrogen of zzso which does not exist in zzso Our modeling results were found to be in accordance with experimental zzso
