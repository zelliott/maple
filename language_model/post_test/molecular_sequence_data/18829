zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso family together with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been thoroughly characterized as components of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity and the respective genes were also discovered in marine sponges where the zzso system is zzso In this study the zzso zzso from several zzso animals and their closest zzso relative, a zzso were expressed in a bacterial expression system and their zzso activities were zzso We demonstrated zzso zzso activities of zzso from the marine sponge zzso zzso a representative of the zzso oldest zzso zzso zzso from an zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and from a zzso species, a zzso fish zzso zzso zzso However, the expressed proteins from an zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and from a zzso the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso did not show zzso zzso zzso zzso from other studied zzso zzso from the marine sponge zzso was able to catalyze the formation of zzso having both zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso from sponges and zzso higher animals have similar zzso mechanisms which still include different affinities and possibly different structural requirements for the zzso zzso Considering their zzso and zzso sponge zzso could represent a link between zzso earlier zzso zzso and zzso zzso from higher zzso
