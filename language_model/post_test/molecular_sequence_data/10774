To develop a putative zzso cassette using zzso zzso accessory gene derived from zzso clinical specimens as a component of a DNA vaccine for zzso 

zzso genes were cloned from zzso patients and the sequence variation present within the patients was zzso zzso genetic zzso were selected and the ability of these clones to induce zzso and cellular immune responses was studied in zzso The selected protective genetic zzso were biologically characterized through zzso zzso using primary cells infected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Analysis of zzso zzso from different patients revealed that zzso is highly zzso with the open reading frame remaining intact in zzso It was shown that attenuated zzso clones from zzso subjects can effectively induce both zzso and cellular responses against zzso protein in zzso zzso of the cellular responses in zzso using human cellular targets infected with a clinical zzso isolate showed that zzso clones could induce cellular responses capable of destroying the zzso 

The zzso zzso developed in this study exhibited zzso zzso yet were capable of inducing specific immune responses against zzso These zzso could be used as part of a DNA vaccine strategy for zzso This vaccine adaptation strategy could be used for the development of zzso for any pathogen resulting in zzso immunity and attenuated gene zzso
