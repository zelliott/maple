The zzso of zzso zzso isolated from hog gastric zzso was investigated by various zzso Following protein separation on sodium zzso zzso reducing gels and transfer to zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso A was confined to the zzso band which zzso to the zzso zzso In contrast, wheat germ zzso binding occurred in a region below the zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso region, and also to protein just above the zzso zzso Treatment with zzso F removed most of the zzso A zzso and also the wheat germ zzso zzso found below the zzso region, but spared the higher molecular weight wheat germ zzso zzso zzso During the zzso experiments a protein of zzso was zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso generated zzso fragments of the zzso protein show at least zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of the carbohydrates by zzso and zzso zzso showed that the sites of labeling were zzso and were confined to the wheat germ zzso zzso zzso Two molecular weight regions, below the zzso region, of 60 and 85 zzso were zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso techniques showed that both zzso A and wheat germ zzso zzso occurred on the zzso face of the gastric zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
