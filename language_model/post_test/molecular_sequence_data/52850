zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen that exhibits numerous zzso factors, including the zzso of a zinc zzso and the production of a zzso We have cloned and zzso a gene from zzso zzso that is a zzso of the positive zzso regulator, zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This gene encodes a zzso single complete open reading frame designated zzso which shares greater than zzso zzso identity with zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso protein is more than zzso identical and zzso similar to that of zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso possesses a member of the family of zzso genes recently described in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Our data also demonstrate that, in addition to zzso zzso all six zzso zzso tested contained genes that zzso with the zzso zzso We also present evidence that this regulatory protein was inherited from a common zzso and that the gene is ancient and widespread in marine zzso zzso
