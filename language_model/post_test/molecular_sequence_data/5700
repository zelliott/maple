The complexity of the zzso gene family in higher plants was investigated by identification and sequencing zzso clones from the zzso zzso database showing zzso to zzso zzso zzso We identified plant counterparts for each of the 14 zzso zzso zzso Moreover, several of them were highly related zzso zzso data indicate a random distribution of the zzso genes over the zzso zzso
