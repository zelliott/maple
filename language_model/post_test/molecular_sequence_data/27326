To identify the genetic zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

Two Chinese families with zzso dominant zzso zzso 12 affected and 14 unaffected individuals, were zzso Fifteen known genes associated with zzso dominant zzso cataract were screened by zzso linkage analysis with gene based single zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso variations were zzso zzso zzso wild type or zzso zzso was expressed in human lens zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso distribution were analyzed by western zzso and zzso zzso 

A novel zzso change, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso cataract in one family and a known zzso zzso zzso in the other zzso zzso family members and 103 unrelated control subjects did not carry these zzso Similar to the wild type zzso zzso zzso was zzso soluble and was located in the zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed raised local zzso and the creation of a hypothetical zzso zzso II zzso zzso 

A novel zzso zzso caused zzso zzso cataract in a Chinese zzso zzso possessed similar properties to the wild type zzso but its predicted increase of zzso and putative zzso site could lead to protein zzso subsequently causing zzso in zzso
