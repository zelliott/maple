zzso zzso repair zzso plays a central role in maintaining zzso integrity by detecting and repairing a wide variety of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso group A protein zzso is an essential component of the repair machinery, and it is thought to be involved in the initial step as a DNA damage recognition and/or confirmation zzso Human replication protein A zzso and zzso have been reported to interact to form a DNA damage recognition complex with greater specificity for damaged DNA than zzso zzso The mechanism by which these two proteins recognize such a wide array of structures resulting from different types of DNA damage is not zzso One possibility is that they recognize a common feature of the zzso such as zzso of the zzso zzso We have tested this idea by determining whether human zzso and zzso proteins can recognize the zzso zzso induced by a DNA triple zzso a zzso DNA structure that has been shown to induce DNA repair, zzso and zzso We measured binding of zzso and zzso together or zzso to zzso containing zzso with three, two, or no strands zzso linked by zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso alone recognizes all zzso triplex structures, but also forms zzso zzso DNA zzso at higher zzso zzso by itself does not recognize the zzso but it binds them in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso decreases the zzso DNA zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that the zzso machinery is targeted to zzso zzso and demonstrate that zzso can recognize damaged DNA even without zzso
