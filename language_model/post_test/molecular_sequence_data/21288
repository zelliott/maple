zzso in the human zzso gene zzso many zzso diseases, including zzso muscular zzso zzso however, a zzso link between the effect of zzso on zzso filament assembly and disease zzso has not been zzso We studied the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso in human zzso A and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso filaments in zzso revealed zzso in the lateral assembly of zzso zzso zzso which causes abnormal organization of zzso zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was found in nuclear zzso in zzso stages along with zzso zzso also caused zzso of zzso away from the nuclear zzso consistent with a decreased ability of zzso zzso to associate with zzso zzso filaments in zzso zzso animals had zzso defects and muscle structure zzso These results show that changes in zzso filament structure can translate into zzso zzso via altering the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso and suggest a model for how the zzso zzso zzso may cause zzso in zzso
