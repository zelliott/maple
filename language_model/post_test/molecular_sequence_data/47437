The zzso regulatory particle of the zzso zzso zzso consists of six related zzso zzso zzso and at least 11 zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso encodes an zzso component of the zzso regulatory particle and is essential for zzso To determine which zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso we attempted to screen for zzso that cause synthetic zzso in the presence of the zzso (formerly zzso zzso Among the candidates recovered was a new zzso of zzso (formerly zzso This zzso zzso was designated zzso on its own this zzso caused no zzso change, whereas the zzso zzso double zzso was zzso suggesting a strong interaction between zzso and zzso The site of the zzso zzso was determined by DNA sequencing of the zzso locus retrieved from the zzso and a single zzso zzso was zzso This changes zzso acid zzso of the zzso product from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in all zzso zzso except zzso but no function has yet been assigned to the region that contains zzso We propose that this region is necessary for zzso to interact with zzso The terminal zzso of the zzso zzso double zzso was not cell cycle specific, suggesting that in the double zzso cells the function of the zzso zzso is completely zzso thereby inducing multiple defects in cellular zzso
