Six hundred and thirty primary breast cancer were screened for abnormalities in zzso 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the structure of the zzso gene zzso was performed with the zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso zzso method and with direct sequencing of amplified zzso In a breast zzso case from a zzso patient, we found a deletion of 36 zzso in zzso 5 and no zzso zzso for zzso We amplified and zzso the zzso region between zzso 4 and 7 and showed that the deletion causes the skipping of zzso zzso The resulting zzso sequence had a zzso that yields an inactive protein with a truncated C zzso These results show the first example of zzso deletion causing zzso skipping at the zzso gene zzso
