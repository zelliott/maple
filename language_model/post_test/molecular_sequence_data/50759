zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso to their biologically active zzso zzso We have derived a zzso Chinese zzso zzso cell line that zzso significant quantities of active zzso zzso production was increased by selection for zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was monitored by Southern zzso analysis, zzso activity, and zzso protein throughout the selection zzso The soluble zzso is zzso as determined by the ability to convert either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by a simple zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is partially zzso and the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso were separated on a Con zzso zzso The kinetic zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the same for both forms of zzso In addition, zzso is competitive vs zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso the presence or absence of zzso zzso does not affect the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells greatly enhances expression of the zzso zzso implicating a feedback mechanism on the zzso zzso
