Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso tail zzso zzso peptides can zzso the zzso of zzso As zzso CT contains an zzso zzso region, a series of zzso zzso and zzso peptides were generated to determine if zzso CT can zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in comparison to zzso and to identify the minimal zzso sequences in zzso zzso Using zzso structures and molecular models as guides, the initial peptides for study zzso the zzso zzso sequences of zzso CT zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso a turn motif zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso cells with the peptides revealed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso but not vice zzso The zzso capacity of these peptides was mapped to the central zzso region which was zzso by zzso but only partially by zzso zzso and zzso activated both zzso zzso while V-4 and zzso were zzso The use of zzso and zzso peptides confirmed the importance of the turn motif for zzso activity and identified the zzso of zzso as a critical zzso zzso The difference in the zzso zzso capacity of zzso and zzso peptides and their capacity to influence the assembly of zzso with zzso zzso reveals a possible divergence in the regulatory control of the two zzso zzso
