zzso zzso channels are members of a zzso family and are responsible for generation and propagation of the action potential in excitable zzso We have zzso in a zzso zzso a full-length zzso clone zzso the rat brain type III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with in zzso zzso zzso expressed functional rat brain zzso channels from such zzso zzso zzso We found that type III zzso currents in whole cell zzso zzso clamp and in zzso patch recordings decayed much more slowly than any other reported zzso zzso In addition, we saw typical and additive effects of zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso channel zzso itself contains functional and distinct toxin binding zzso
