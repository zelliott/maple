The membrane zzso regions of zzso alpha and beta zzso are highly zzso in zzso In particular, all zzso alpha zzso share the zzso sequence at the beginning of their zzso zzso Previous work has shown that this domain is important in zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso we show that the native zzso zzso of both zzso must be present for efficient zzso Most zzso zzso alpha 1 and beta 1 zzso with zzso swapped zzso zzso zzso selectively into collagen IV receptors expressed at high levels on the zzso However, these zzso which bind zzso zzso are deficient in a variety of zzso binding events, including zzso association and induction of zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of the zzso alpha zzso domain in the swapped zzso leads to zzso focal contact zzso which also occurs in zzso zzso when the zzso zzso domain is zzso These results show that proper zzso assembly requires opposed alpha and beta zzso zzso and this opposition prevents zzso focal contact zzso Our working hypothesis is that these two zzso may associate during zzso assembly and provide the mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
