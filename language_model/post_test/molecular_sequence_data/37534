zzso type zzso play a critical role in the maintenance of zzso zzso in plant zzso zzso are also involved in plants' defense against environmental zzso This research examined the expression and regulation of the zzso zzso of the zzso type zzso in zzso zzso and the effect of environmental stress on multiple transcripts generated by this zzso 

Evidence suggests that zzso A of the zzso type zzso is zzso by a single gene in zzso zzso Genome zzso analysis showed no indication of a second zzso A gene being zzso The single gene identified was shown by whole zzso zzso analysis to be transcribed in all zzso of the zzso zzso A was shown by sequencing the 3' end of multiple zzso clones to exhibit zzso site zzso Four different zzso zzso tail attachment sites were zzso zzso were performed to determine the response of transcript levels for zzso A to environmental zzso A zzso based strategy was devised to amplify the four different transcripts from the zzso A zzso 

zzso of zzso generated from zzso exposed to cold, salt stress, and zzso showed that transcript levels for zzso A of the zzso type zzso in zzso were responsive to stress zzso Cold and salt stress resulted in a 2-4 fold increase in all four zzso A transcripts zzso zzso resulted in a slight increase in transcript zzso All four transcripts appeared to behave zzso with respect to stress conditions tested with no significant differential zzso
