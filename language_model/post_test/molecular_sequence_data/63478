To bring zzso production under the control of the sex promoter zzso contained within zzso zzso zzso a zzso cassette was previously inserted downstream of zzso This insert should eliminate zzso zzso zzso which normally contain 101 zzso acids zzso at their N zzso Thus males zzso for the zzso insert should be zzso as was briefly stated to be so in the initial report of this transgenic zzso But zzso flies whose only zzso form is zzso have now been found to court zzso zzso females displayed no appreciable zzso actions except courtship rejection zzso yet, they developed a zzso abdominal zzso No zzso against the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso But zzso neural signals were observed in zzso or zzso zzso zzso and adults after applying an zzso that detects all zzso zzso transgenic females displayed reduced expression of such zzso zzso rationalized these findings: zzso transcripts include anomalous zzso forms from which zzso was removed, allowing zzso lacking M zzso to be produced in zzso patterns in both zzso Within zzso such defective proteins promote neural differentiation and function that is sufficient to support spirited zzso zzso But zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is tempered by the finding that zzso sequences zzso these 101 zzso are highly zzso among zzso relatives of zzso zzso
