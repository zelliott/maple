A model of zzso and zzso structure of zzso coli zzso is zzso According to this model, the zzso consists of two independent zzso One of them is formed by the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso chain and is responsible for zzso zzso The other consists of the central region of the zzso chain and composes that part of the molecular zzso that forms the zzso zzso It is suggested that different artificial zzso structures can be constructed from zzso molecules by varying the surface domain, zzso the central part of the zzso chain, and by using the domain responsible for zzso properties as a universal block for zzso The simplest possible artificial zzso structures that can be constructed from zzso of different strains are zzso
