zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso zzso from the opportunistic zzso zzso zzso zzso and belongs to the family of zzso zzso that includes zzso To understand the zzso mechanism of zzso we determined the structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex and the zzso complex to zzso A, zzso A and zzso A resolution, zzso These structures reveal a novel zzso mechanism that involves an zzso domain rotation of 30 degrees and a newly described zzso hole zzso requiring a zzso zzso change that is induced by zzso zzso zzso binding also evokes a zzso transition that completes the formation of the zzso binding zzso A zzso zzso zzso which is located at the bottom of the zzso site, functions as the switch for domain zzso The synergistic structural changes that occur upon zzso binding zzso the zzso and the zzso gamma zzso from zzso and zzso position the zzso for zzso Finally, the zzso A resolution structure of an zzso complex reveals the basis for the higher affinity binding of this zzso over zzso and thus provides a scaffold for the design of new zzso and subversive zzso that target the zzso zzso zzso
