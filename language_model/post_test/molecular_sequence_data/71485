We have prepared a model zzso containing a zzso cluster zzso in the zzso domain of the bovine zzso scavenger zzso and have shown that it has a similar binding specificity to the native scavenger zzso The native scavenger zzso is reported to bind the zzso structure of zzso In this study, we analyzed the model zzso binding of zzso with various structures, random, parallel or zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was carried out by direct binding zzso using labeled zzso or surface zzso zzso and by an zzso zzso using Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the scavenger zzso The results showed that the zzso forming the zzso structure did not exhibit any zzso Only the zzso forms of the zzso could bind to the model zzso They also inhibited the degradation of zzso low density zzso by zzso cells expressing the native scavenger zzso whereas zzso that did not bind to the model zzso had no effect on cellular zzso low density zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso structure is not essential but may be required for the formation of the zzso zzso which can interact with the scavenger zzso
