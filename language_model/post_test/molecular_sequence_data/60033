zzso models of the zzso receptors zzso delta and zzso were constructed using zzso an in-house program to build de zzso models of zzso coupled receptors at the atomic zzso Once the three zzso receptors were constructed and before any energy zzso models were assessed for their zzso with the results available from zzso zzso carried out on these zzso In a subsequent step, three selective zzso to each of three receptors zzso zzso and zzso were zzso onto each of the three receptors and subsequently energy zzso The nine resulting complexes were checked for their ability to explain known results of zzso zzso Once the models were zzso analysis of the distances between different zzso of the receptors and the zzso were zzso This analysis permitted us to identify key zzso tentatively involved in direct interaction with the zzso
