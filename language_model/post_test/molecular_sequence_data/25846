We describe the construction of a novel zzso zzso virus zzso zzso containing a unique zzso restriction zzso cloning site in an zzso position in the short unique zzso zzso zzso can be inserted at this site with high efficiency by zzso with zzso zzso zzso A series of plasmids has been designed for use with this zzso These allow protein coding sequences to be placed under the control of various zzso regulation signals and then isolated as zzso fragments ready for zzso into the zzso The zzso fragments also contain the zzso gene thereby zzso selection of zzso virus by screening for blue zzso A zzso of the zzso has been made based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso which expresses only immediate early zzso genes at zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a reporter gene to assess the zzso of expression of sequences cloned into this zzso Under these circumstances zzso and early zzso promoters were shown to behave as expected in both zzso and zzso zzso
