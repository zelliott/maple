The zzso zzso gene family has two members, zzso and zzso that zzso integral membrane zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso where it is found in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause zzso to infection by zzso the capacity of zzso to control zzso microbial zzso zzso is highly similar to zzso but is expressed in several zzso and cell zzso The zzso protein family is remarkably zzso throughout evolution, and recent data suggest that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso transport zzso zzso We tested whether structural similarity between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso proteins results in functional zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins were expressed in a zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso of this zzso zzso was zzso zzso but not zzso was found to complement hypersensitivity to zzso of the zzso zzso under zzso stress conditions zzso zzso We also observed that the zzso double zzso is hypersensitive to growth at alkaline pH zzso zzso and that zzso could complement this zzso as zzso zzso by zzso was specific and required a functional protein as independent zzso in zzso highly zzso in all members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso Since zzso was the only zzso zzso capable of completely suppressing both the zzso and pH zzso our results suggest that zzso can transport zzso in zzso
