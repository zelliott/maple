The entire zzso sequences of all six internal genes of six human H5N1 influenza A viruses isolated in Hong Kong in 1997 were zzso in detail from a zzso point of view and compared with the evolutionary patterns of the zzso and zzso zzso Despite being isolated within a single year in the same geographical location, human H5N1 viruses were characterized by a variety of zzso acid zzso in the zzso complex zzso zzso PA and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso proteins 1 and 2 and zzso zzso proteins 1 and zzso The presence of previously reported zzso acid sequences specific for human strains was confirmed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence identities of the six internal genes of H5N1 viruses examined here were separated into at least two zzso zzso In agreement with the above result, zzso trees of the six internal genes of human H5N1 viruses were generally composed of two minor zzso Additionally, variable zzso zzso suggested that zzso among viruses contributed further to the genetic zzso of these zzso As a result, it became clear that human H5N1 viruses are characterized by divergent gene zzso suggesting the possible occurrence of genetic zzso between viruses of the two evolutionary zzso
