zzso zzso zzso typing is usually performed with zzso methods based on zzso zzso The recent development of molecular techniques has allowed the molecular typing of several zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene from six unrelated individuals (three zzso and three zzso were amplified and cloned to establish the molecular basis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences revealed three zzso two zzso 308 and zzso are silent zzso zzso one is a G to A transition corresponding to an zzso acid difference in position zzso Val zzso in zzso , Met zzso in zzso zzso These zzso were identified via two zzso 282 zzso after zzso of a specific zzso chain reaction product with zzso III followed by zzso zzso 308 and zzso by a zzso technique using zzso zzso These molecular typing results zzso exactly to those obtained zzso moreover, the three zzso defining the zzso and zzso zzso are always associated in a strict linkage zzso
