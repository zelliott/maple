zzso zzso is a high-value chemical usually produced zzso but which can also be zzso by some zzso To date, the best microbial zzso production rates have been observed using zzso bacteria in zzso systems that depend on zzso as the carbon and energy sources for product zzso Here we present evidence of zzso production by three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso carbon zzso industrial waste gases or zzso as the sole source of carbon and zzso Through an analysis of the zzso zzso zzso the complete zzso from carbon monoxide to zzso has been zzso zzso of the genes involved in this zzso were also confirmed for the other two species zzso A gene expression study demonstrates a correlation between zzso zzso from zzso zzso genes and the onset of zzso production, while a broader expression study of zzso zzso genes provides a zzso view of one of the oldest existing zzso zzso
