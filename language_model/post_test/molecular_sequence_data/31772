zzso bacteria often have an especially rich source of zzso zzso which allow them to zzso zzso carbohydrates from the food or the zzso The species zzso zzso is present in the zzso tract of zzso of humans and has been implicated in zzso diseases such as inflammatory zzso diseases zzso Here we zzso the ability of two zzso zzso human zzso E1 and zzso zzso to zzso host zzso We showed that although both strains could zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to grow on zzso as a sole carbon zzso Comparative zzso analysis of the two zzso zzso strains highlighted potential clusters and zzso zzso zzso responsible for the breakdown and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and functional activity zzso confirmed the importance of specific zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso we uncovered a novel zzso by which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid from zzso zzso Our results also demonstrated the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso and zzso as the end products of metabolism when grown on zzso and zzso zzso These new findings provide molecular insights into the zzso of zzso zzso adaptation to the gut environment advancing our understanding of the role of gut zzso in health and zzso
