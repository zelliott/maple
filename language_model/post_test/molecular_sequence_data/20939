zzso zzso and peripheral zzso have been linked to zzso in genes zzso nuclear envelope zzso however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders remain zzso Nuclear envelope protein zzso is a protein of unknown function zzso by a gene at zzso zzso zzso levels are significantly reduced in human muscle as cells differentiate from zzso to zzso however, its levels are not similarly reduced in all differentiation systems zzso Because zzso has been linked to zzso muscular zzso zzso and some adjacent genes are reportedly zzso in the disorder, levels of zzso were analyzed in muscle samples from patients with zzso Although zzso was increased in most cases, an absolute correlation was not zzso Nonetheless, zzso zzso in normal muscle differentiation suggests that in the cases where its gene is inappropriately zzso it could affect muscle differentiation and contribute to disease zzso
