The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the major zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This is a large complex protein with regions similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso and neural cell zzso molecules zzso In this study, we extend our earlier work and demonstrate that a number of complex zzso of this protein are expressed through alternative zzso We identified three major classes of zzso zzso a short form lacking the zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso a medium form containing the zzso region, but still lacking the zzso zzso and a newly identified long form that contains all five zzso present in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we reveal a complex spatial and zzso expression pattern for these zzso zzso As well, using a series of zzso affecting different regions and thus different zzso of zzso we demonstrate that the medium zzso zzso are sufficient for zzso lattice assembly in developing zzso zzso zzso Neither short zzso nor zzso containing the zzso zzso region are essential for zzso assembly or muscle cell attachment, and their role in development remains zzso
