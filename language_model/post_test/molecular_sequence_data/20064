Guard cell movement is induced by environmental and hormonal signals that cause changes in zzso through changes in zzso or release of zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso these zzso at the plasma membrane have been zzso however, less is known about transport at zzso zzso a member of a poorly understood zzso zzso gene family in zzso zzso zzso is zzso and highly expressed in guard cells as shown by zzso activity and by zzso zzso Interestingly, three independent zzso zzso carrying zzso insertions in zzso showed zzso reduction in zzso zzso opening compared to zzso zzso To test the zzso function of zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso that lacks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso pumps zzso zzso zzso did not enhance tolerance of zzso to moderate zzso or high zzso zzso Instead, it restored growth of the zzso on medium with low zzso at slightly alkaline zzso but had no effect on growth at zzso zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was localized mainly to zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso opening of the zzso zzso was insensitive to external pH and was impaired at high zzso The results are consistent with the idea that, in exchanging zzso for zzso zzso maintains zzso zzso and influences pH under certain zzso Together, these results provide genetic and zzso evidence that one zzso protein plays a critical role in zzso through zzso zzso and possibly pH zzso of an active zzso system in guard zzso
