It is well known that the activities of the zzso zzso zzso are tightly regulated by their zzso zzso zzso Here we report a new inhibitor of zzso zzso isolated from sea zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is an zzso protein with zzso zzso and molecular weight of zzso It binds tightly and rapidly to zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ki zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ki zzso zzso zzso The lower affinity for zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be due mainly to a lower second order association rate constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor is composed of 128 zzso acids forming two repeated zzso with zzso zzso Neither of the zzso shows any sequence zzso to zzso but they do show a significant zzso to zzso zzso zzso A highly zzso consensus sequence motif of zzso together with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is present in major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso chain, zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso domain zzso pancreatic zzso marker proteins zzso and zzso salmon egg zzso zzso zzso In each of the zzso of the zzso the three zzso are similarly zzso and the sequences zzso and zzso are present in zzso a and zzso zzso We suggest that zzso belongs to a new zzso of protein zzso of zzso zzso named zzso zzso domain zzso This zzso currently includes zzso major zzso complex class zzso associated zzso zzso chain fragment, and zzso salmon egg zzso zzso zzso
