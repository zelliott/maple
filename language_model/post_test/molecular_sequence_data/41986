The authors used the zzso chain reaction zzso to detect the zzso for zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso specific zzso in small zzso They carried out these experiments to assess the feasibility of applying this technique to small tumor zzso zzso excised tumor samples from four zzso were zzso zzso zzso isolation by acid zzso zzso extraction was followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso used were zzso zzso 3' in zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso 3' in zzso 4 zzso zzso included an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from normal human zzso All samples amplified the same size band if zzso Three tumor samples contained zzso zzso as indicated by amplified 234 zzso zzso These three samples showed a high zzso protein level by slot zzso and zzso for zzso detected by northern zzso zzso zzso of one of these samples revealed a well differentiated tumor with numerous zzso zzso In the fourth zzso a poorly differentiated zzso no zzso zzso was zzso The zzso results showed a qualitative variation of zzso zzso levels, usually related to the zzso zzso with zzso expressed in well differentiated tumors as well as in the normal human zzso in contrast to a poorly differentiated tumor with no zzso zzso The feasibility of the reverse zzso zzso technique to detect zzso zzso in small zzso tumors, was zzso
