The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a site of zzso The present study was conducted to determine the zzso structures necessary for zzso It was found that although zzso could be tolerated at the zzso C zzso the blocking of the zzso zzso group with the addition of an Ala prevented zzso zzso from strain zzso was not zzso by zzso zzso zzso even when the zzso zzso was converted to zzso Substituting the zzso loop region of strain zzso zzso with that of strain zzso allowed zzso to take zzso Neither conversion of zzso zzso zzso loop zzso zzso to Ala nor the deletion of segments of this structure prevented zzso It was noted that the zzso zzso zzso loop environment was zzso whereas that of strain zzso zzso had an overall positive zzso zzso of a positive charge into the zzso zzso zzso loop of a zzso containing zzso at the C zzso allowed zzso to take zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso containing zzso at its zzso resulted in robust zzso These results suggest that the terminal zzso is the major zzso zzso recognition feature and that this zzso cannot be zzso at its zzso zzso Although no other specific recognition features are present, the zzso surface must be compatible with the reaction apparatus for zzso to zzso
