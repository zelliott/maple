Recently, a novel zzso zzso was identified in the tumor necrosis factor region of the zzso complex, 4 zzso zzso of the zzso beta zzso By analyzing several full-length zzso clones and the zzso DNA, we identified seven zzso and four zzso spanning zzso zzso Isolation of mouse zzso zzso clones established the open reading zzso zzso zzso is characterized by four alternative zzso initiation sites and extensive alternative zzso The derived zzso vary with regard to the presence of the zzso zzso and in short internal zzso In addition, alternative zzso results in zzso zzso zzso different zzso zzso zzso is predominantly transcribed in zzso and zzso levels increase upon stimulation with zzso with a zzso change in the zzso pattern resulting in an enhanced expression of the short zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may have a specific role in zzso and possibly also in T zzso Moreover, we found that the recently published zzso zzso is zzso just zzso of zzso
