zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso toxin consisting of 18 zzso acid zzso that is zzso as a precursor of zzso zzso acid zzso 1 to zzso pro zzso acid zzso 20 to zzso and mature zzso acid zzso 55 to zzso zzso The precursor zzso in the zzso is zzso across the inner membrane by the general export zzso consisting of zzso zzso The zzso region functions as a leader zzso and is zzso during zzso However, it remains unknown how the resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso across the outer zzso In this study, we investigated the structure of the zzso that passes through the outer membrane to determine how it zzso through the outer zzso The results showed that the pro region is zzso in the zzso zzso The generated zzso becomes the mature form of zzso which happens to have zzso bonds, which then passes through the outer zzso We also showed that zzso with a zzso zzso consisting of 3 zzso acid zzso passes through the outer zzso whereas zzso with a zzso composed of 37 zzso does zzso zzso acid analysis of zzso zzso zzso from culture zzso revealed that the zzso composed of 37 zzso acid zzso was zzso into fragments of 5 zzso acid zzso In addition, analyses of zzso with a zzso at the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso strain revealed that the formation of an zzso zzso bond within zzso is not absolutely required for the mature region of zzso to pass through the outer zzso
