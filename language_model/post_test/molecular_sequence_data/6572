The two proteins from bovine brain previously shown to be required for the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso transport zzso termed zzso and zzso have been definitively identified as members of the zzso factor zzso family by zzso zzso analysis of the intact zzso and of their zzso zzso zzso zzso information obtained from this analysis identified zzso and zzso as bovine zzso and zzso zzso The sequence of bovine zzso which had not previously been determined, appears identical to that predicted from the rat and human zzso zzso Further analysis of the zzso zzso fragments of both bovine zzso demonstrates zzso zzso solely with the zzso fatty acid zzso This finding establishes that the previously reported zzso difference between zzso and zzso in the zzso transport zzso is not due to zzso zzso at the zzso This finding also indicates that the zzso of zzso zzso groups previously observed on other zzso proteins is not zzso
