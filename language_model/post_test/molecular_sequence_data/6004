We screened 30 gastric zzso and 72 gastric zzso for four genetic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso genes and loss of zzso at the zzso genetic zzso which are known to occur during zzso zzso We used zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to detect zzso Loss of zzso zzso at the zzso locus was zzso directly by performing zzso on the variable number of tandem repeats within the zzso zzso of the zzso gene were not detected in any gastric zzso or zzso zzso zzso were detected in 20 per cent zzso of the zzso but in only zzso per cent zzso of the zzso In contrast, the zzso gene was frequently zzso in zzso (35 per zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso at the zzso locus was a frequent occurrence in zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso but was zzso in zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes occurred frequently both in differentiated and in zzso gastric zzso The considerable differences in the zzso of genetic zzso between gastric zzso and zzso indicate that the sequential development of gastric zzso from zzso is uncommon in gastric zzso
