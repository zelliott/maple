The zzso gene product of zzso zzso zzso the activity of the positive zzso protein zzso in response to increased levels either of fixed nitrogen or of oxygen in the zzso In order to demonstrate that the responses to these two zzso are discrete we have subjected zzso to zzso zzso and isolated zzso zzso that are impaired in their ability to respond to oxygen but not to fixed zzso Two such zzso were zzso and shown to be single base pair changes located in different parts of zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso shows limited zzso to the zzso protein zzso which comprise the sensing component of bacterial zzso regulatory zzso In the light of the location of one of the zzso zzso zzso we have zzso this zzso and we suggest that the zzso region of zzso may facilitate interactions between zzso and zzso
