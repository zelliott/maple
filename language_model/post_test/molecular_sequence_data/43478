The zzso for a fourth member of the zzso zzso zzso family, termed zzso has been cloned from a zzso zzso zzso library and expressed zzso in zzso cells as a zzso functional zzso zzso zzso based upon regions that are zzso among the known zzso members of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used in zzso chain reactions to identify and clone this new zzso zzso preferences for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were readily zzso zzso zzso a broader range of synthetic zzso zzso in contrast, the zzso zzso zzso a single zzso among the panel of 11 peptides zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, a zzso message of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso embryonic zzso as well as the adult zzso zzso stomach, zzso small zzso zzso zzso and zzso with lower levels detected in zzso liver, heart, brain, zzso and zzso Thus, the pattern of expression for zzso is more restricted than for the three previously reported zzso of the zzso The variation in expression patterns and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family suggests that differential expression of these zzso may be responsible for the zzso repertoire of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso
