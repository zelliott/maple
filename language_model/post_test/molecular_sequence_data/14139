The zzso zzso p 7 from zzso zzso has been defined by molecular cloning and shown to be an important specificity in 50% of zzso zzso 

This study compares the zzso sequence and zzso zzso of zzso f 7 from zzso zzso with zzso p zzso 

zzso zzso zzso f 7 was amplified by zzso chain reaction, zzso and expressed as a fusion with zzso for zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso 

zzso f 7 zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing a predicted 17 zzso acid leader zzso no zzso and a single zzso site similar to zzso p zzso The predicted 196 zzso mature zzso had zzso identity to zzso p 7 and a calculated molecular weight of zzso No zzso were found in searches of the data zzso The zzso f 7 fusion protein showed a single band of 46 zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and reacted with zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso The degree of binding was usually zzso of that to zzso p 7 consistent with the exposure of the patients to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against zzso p 7 reacted with zzso f 7 but zzso studies showed a zzso difference in zzso 

zzso f 7 has a predicted zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso p zzso
