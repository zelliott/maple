zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is one of the newly discovered pairs of a zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso protein of the zzso species, and has been shown to regulate the production of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso transcribed zzso gene is situated 259 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso and the zzso protein has been shown to be highly zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is thought to be a zzso zzso for zzso another member of the family of zzso zzso the in zzso function of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in this study by zzso and zzso comparison between zzso zzso zzso and a zzso deletion zzso With the same growth rate as zzso zzso zzso on both solid and liquid media, the zzso zzso showed no apparent changes in its zzso zzso indicating that zzso does not participate in zzso control in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso became more sensitive to zzso zzso than did the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso compared with zzso 200 zzso zzso and exhibited reduced zzso and zzso zzso The zzso production was not restored by zzso addition of zzso suggesting that zzso per zzso is not a zzso zzso of zzso but a zzso regulatory protein controlling zzso zzso DNA sequencing of a zzso zzso downstream region of zzso revealed the presence of five open reading frames zzso zzso zzso a zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analyses of the downstream five genes together with those of the three upstream genes zzso zzso zzso a regulatory zzso and zzso zzso a zzso S specific zzso revealed that, in the zzso zzso the transcriptions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were completely zzso and those of zzso and zzso were zzso Because free zzso zzso in the absence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso through binding to a specific DNA sequence zzso element, zzso overlapping the zzso zzso start site, the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso suggested that the in zzso function of zzso was impaired by the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso easily lost its zzso activity in the absence of zzso but that the zzso was restored by the presence of zzso zzso as a fusion with zzso protein zzso whereas zzso itself showed no zzso activity, indicating that zzso is likely to be a zzso of zzso enforcing the zzso activity of zzso through zzso zzso
