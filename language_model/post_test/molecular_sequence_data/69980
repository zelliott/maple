The role, if any, of the human zzso zzso gene in the establishment of a cellular zzso state is zzso To address this problem, and as part of a wider investigation of zzso zzso zzso and its applications in zzso cells, we have been using zzso to disrupt the zzso gene in human cell lines zzso zzso zzso & Porter, zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso We describe here the design and use of zzso and zzso targeting zzso based on a zzso bacterial zzso gene that is activated by zzso with the zzso zzso In zzso cells, both targeting zzso underwent zzso zzso with a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso In a previously targeted clone derived from the zzso cell line zzso the replacement construct underwent zzso with either the modified or the unmodified zzso zzso The latter events generated doubly disrupted zzso clones that failed to express any zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso of infected zzso cells showed that expression of the zzso gene was not required for the induction by zzso of an zzso state against zzso virus, zzso forest virus or zzso zzso
