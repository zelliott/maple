DNA zzso are a family of zzso altering the zzso of DNA by concerted breakage and rejoining of the zzso backbone of zzso zzso and zzso type zzso zzso including zzso I, zzso III, and reverse zzso are crucial in regulation of DNA zzso and maintenance of genetic zzso The crystal structure of full length zzso I from zzso zzso was determined at zzso resolution and represents an intact and fully active bacterial zzso zzso It reveals the zzso structure of the zzso zzso core domain zzso zzso zzso and a tightly associated zzso zinc ribbon domain zzso zzso packing against domain IV of the core zzso The previously established zzso of the functional activity of zzso zzso I is further supported by its crystal structure as no zinc zzso is bound to domain zzso However, the structural integrity is preserved by the formation of two zzso bridges between the four zzso zzso zzso A functional role of domain V in DNA binding and recognition is suggested and discussed in the light of the structure and previous zzso zzso In addition, implications for bacterial zzso I are zzso
