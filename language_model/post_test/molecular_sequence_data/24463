We created a construct zzso a zzso known to mimic the binding properties of zzso fused to the zzso of a zzso zzso that binds a scorpion toxin zzso This fusion protein was produced in the zzso of bacteria and zzso to zzso by zzso affinity zzso on zzso with a yield close to 1 zzso DNA sequencing, dot zzso and mass zzso analyses demonstrated the integrity of the soluble zzso Fusion to the zzso zzso did not affect the ability of the zzso to recognize its zzso with a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso property was not impaired in the fusion zzso Thus, the zzso was zzso and had a low molecular mass of 28 zzso This enabled us to develop rapid and sensitive zzso for the specific detection of the toxin zzso accurately to zzso zzso opening up new perspectives for the diagnosis of zzso
