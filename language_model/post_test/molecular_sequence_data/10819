Human zzso virus type 1 zzso accessory genes including zzso zzso and zzso are important factors that determine the replication and zzso of zzso The state of zzso is also important for the replication of zzso We evaluated the properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso or zzso cell cultures which had been activated through zzso molecules in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In activated zzso or zzso cultures, replication of zzso zzso was markedly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso zzso showed that zzso the presence of an zzso zzso zzso domain zzso acid zzso 72 to 75) in the zzso protein was critical for the enhancement of viral DNA zzso resulting in increased virus growth rate, and zzso zzso that form part of zzso zzso 3 binding domain were not essential for viral zzso We also confirmed the importance of sites by using an zzso animal model, the zzso mouse system, representing zzso replication and zzso in activated zzso T cells in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso viral replication in activated zzso T zzso
