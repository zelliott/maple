Previous studies have suggested that the human zzso virus long terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso sequences contribute to the replication ability of zzso in different zzso zzso zzso of these sequences can alter zzso zzso We have zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso of zzso that exhibit specific zzso for human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso T zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso sites in an infectious molecular clone of zzso type 1 were replaced with sequences derived from the zzso Tax response elements zzso from the zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso exhibit selective replication and cell killing in zzso human zzso T cells, but not in zzso T zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso interactions could account for the observed replication zzso The zzso zzso zzso were zzso activated by the zzso zzso and zzso Tax zzso These results demonstrate that it is possible to specifically target zzso replication and zzso to zzso zzso human T cells, on the basis of zzso zzso and provide a model for the development of specific, zzso zzso gene therapy zzso for zzso cells based on zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso They also suggest that zzso zzso can cooperate with zzso zzso zzso such as Tax, which act through upstream binding sites without directly binding to zzso
