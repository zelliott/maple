zzso zzso and its derivatives are introduced into the environment through numerous sources, including wood zzso and zzso Environmental contamination by zzso is associated with human health risks, zzso the development of cost-effective zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is potentially feasible because it contains a zzso group and is suitable for direct phase II zzso In this study, we present a system for zzso zzso based on sugar zzso by zzso a zzso putative zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed the highest zzso activity among all reported zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significantly enhanced zzso to zzso and zzso zzso plants also exhibited a zzso higher capacity to remove zzso from their zzso This work indicates that zzso zzso zzso in zzso may be an efficient method for zzso and degradation of zzso Our findings have the potential to provide a suitable zzso strategy for sites contaminated by zzso
