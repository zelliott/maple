Energy zzso depends on the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso an zzso hormone whose circulating levels communicate body energy zzso zzso activates the zzso factor signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso in zzso zzso including zzso zzso producing zzso protein zzso a zzso that stimulates zzso Previous studies have suggested a model in which high levels of zzso zzso during zzso represent a default state that is actively zzso by zzso induced by zzso signaling in the fed zzso We identify putative zzso binding elements in the zzso promoter that have been highly zzso during zzso zzso Using a reporter zzso in transgenic mice that faithfully zzso normal regulation of zzso we show that these sites are required, but in a way opposite to that predicted by the existing model: zzso of the sites leads to a default state characterized by a low level of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso We also find that removing zzso zzso from zzso zzso has no zzso effect on zzso levels of zzso zzso in the fed or zzso zzso These results suggest a new model for zzso regulation of zzso zzso in which the default level of expression is low in the fed state, and zzso zzso in response to zzso is zzso by factors other than zzso
