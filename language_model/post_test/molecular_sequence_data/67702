The treatment of cancer such as zzso or peptides requires efficient delivery zzso A novel zzso zzso previously derived and identified in our laboratory showed remarkable ability to target highly zzso tumors both in zzso and in zzso even at the early stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso moderately inhibited tumor cell zzso although not enough to deem it an efficient killer of tumor zzso In this study, we sought to enhance the zzso activity of zzso To do this, we fused it to an zzso zzso zzso and termed the resulting zzso zzso We found that zzso could trigger rapid zzso in human prostate and gastric cancer cells through both the zzso zzso zzso and the death zzso zzso Furthermore, direct injection of zzso into mice with prostate and gastric zzso zzso resulted in reduction of tumor volumes and a significant delay in tumor progression and zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso may serve as a powerful therapeutic agent for zzso zzso
