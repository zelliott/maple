zzso is a zzso unique to the zzso and has been shown to be a vital component of their zzso zzso However, little is known as to the role of zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso activity was detected in extracts of zzso major, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso No zzso zzso activity was detected in any of these zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and shown to be a zzso complex of three zzso with a relative molecular weight of zzso This zzso complex was specific for the zzso zzso and zzso and only used zzso from a range of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the three components were the zzso zzso and gamma zzso of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complex suggested that the zzso activity was associated with the gamma zzso Moreover, zzso blue was found to be a tight binding inhibitor and zzso blue 4 an irreversible zzso inhibitor that zzso modified only the gamma zzso The rate of zzso by zzso blue 4 was increased more than zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso blue protected the zzso from zzso by zzso confirming that these zzso interact with the active site zzso Two zzso genes were cloned from zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso activity, suggesting that zzso is unstable in the absence of the other zzso
