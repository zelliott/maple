Previously, zzso a zzso structural zzso was found to have zzso activity for zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we have isolated and characterized the corresponding protein from zzso zzso one of zzso that have a different host zzso In zzso zzso consists of a highly zzso zzso domain, internal repeats of zzso zzso motifs and a zzso domain occupied by zzso tandem repeats of a zzso zzso However, zzso was found to have a slightly different zzso construction where the zzso repeats were not in the zzso but zzso zzso zzso with a specific zzso revealed that the zzso region containing the zzso repetitive motifs from zzso and zzso was responsible for binding to Chlorella cell zzso Furthermore, by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was localized at a unique zzso of the zzso particle and was found to be masked through binding to the host zzso These results suggested that zzso is localized at a unique zzso on the zzso with the zzso repetitive units outside for cell wall zzso
