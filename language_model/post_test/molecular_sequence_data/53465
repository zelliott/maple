zzso zzso segregation depends on the zzso zzso apparatus, a bipolar array of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso nucleation requires attachment of zzso ring complexes to a zzso zzso core, but the zzso underlying this attachment remains zzso In budding zzso this attachment is provided by the zzso protein zzso which links the zzso zzso complex to the core of the zzso zzso Here, we show that the large zzso protein zzso is a human zzso of zzso We identified zzso by its zzso zzso site, which shares zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically to zzso throughout the cell zzso zzso regions of zzso share significant sequence zzso with zzso a previously identified zzso zzso component known to interact with zzso In zzso human breast zzso cells containing abundant zzso structures, zzso is found only at zzso associated with zzso zzso
