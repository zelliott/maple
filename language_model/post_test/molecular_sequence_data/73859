zzso zzso sequences were determined from the coding regions of the attachment zzso zzso zzso of eight zzso of bovine respiratory zzso virus zzso The zzso characteristics of 18 field and reference zzso were analyzed using the zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso directed against the human respiratory zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso fusion protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reaction patterns demonstrated some random zzso differences among the zzso but for the most part were zzso to the viral protein zzso especially on the F zzso zzso differences in the F and P proteins were observed among zzso zzso the P protein migrated at three different apparent molecular weights on PAGE zzso zzso and structural variation occurs among zzso however, the structural differences in the P protein did not correlate with the zzso differences among the zzso N and P zzso The G zzso zzso sequence identities were high, ranging from zzso to zzso and the predicted zzso acid sequence identities ranged from zzso to zzso zzso was due to substitution point zzso The G protein zzso contained areas of sequence divergence zzso a highly zzso region, with four zzso zzso which is analogous to the putative zzso zzso binding zzso The high sequence and zzso acid identities and random zzso diversity among the zzso indicates that the zzso zzso analyzed belong in a zzso zzso
