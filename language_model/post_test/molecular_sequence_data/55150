To determine whether the zzso frequency variation of the zzso zzso of the zzso heavy chain zzso 3' regulatory region zzso locus represents a risk factor for systemic lupus zzso zzso and to identify a possible functional difference in the two most frequent zzso zzso and zzso in binding nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The frequency of the zzso zzso zzso was determined in two zzso of patients with zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso were carried out with B cell nuclear extracts with different zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to map the consensus binding sites of the nuclear zzso A zzso cohort of 121 patients with zzso was also zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was significantly increased in patients with zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso experiments showed the presence of the zzso binding site in both zzso whereas only zzso zzso carried the consensus for the zzso zzso The presence versus absence of zzso zzso in patients with zzso correlated with a higher concentration of zzso levels and with the expression of B cell zzso factor zzso zzso 

The increased frequency of zzso zzso in patients with zzso identifies a new genetic risk factor for zzso A possible biological effect of the zzso could be the difference observed in the zzso of an zzso binding site which is specific for zzso zzso and absent in zzso zzso These observations suggest a functional effect of the zzso zzso in this zzso
