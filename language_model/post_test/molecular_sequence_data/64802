The zzso are zzso cell zzso molecules that facilitate the initial attachment of zzso to the vascular zzso by binding to a zzso zzso as exemplified by the zzso zzso Lewis X zzso An important property of the zzso interaction is its ability to withstand the zzso force of the blood zzso zzso we used zzso dynamic force zzso zzso to identify the molecular zzso within zzso that give rise to the dynamic properties of the zzso zzso Our atomic force zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of the zzso complexes involves overcoming at least two zzso zzso The inner barrier, which determines the dynamic response of the complex at high forces, is governed by the interaction between the zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso whereas the outer zzso barrier can be attributed to interactions involving the zzso acid zzso of zzso Due to their steep inner zzso zzso the zzso complexes are less sensitive to high pulling zzso zzso besides its contribution to the bond energy, the zzso zzso also grants the zzso complexes a zzso strength that is crucial for the zzso rolling of zzso
