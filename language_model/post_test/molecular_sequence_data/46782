zzso extract prepared from zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed nine multiple alcohol zzso zzso bands on active zzso in native zzso gel zzso Their molecular basis was investigated and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned from zzso zzso zzso When the two genes were expressed in a zzso host, an alcohol zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso partially zzso growth zzso of the host strain on zzso While expression of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso strain gave a single zzso band corresponding to the band with the largest and smallest mobility among the nine zzso bands, respectively, zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in multiple band zzso Mixed zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso also gave nine multiple zzso From these results, we concluded that the nine multiple forms of zzso observed on zzso represent two zzso and seven zzso of zzso and zzso Using this zzso analysis, we also found that zzso was preferably produced at low methanol zzso in the media, while zzso was produced at higher methanol zzso This shows distinct regulatory features of the two zzso genes in this zzso zzso
