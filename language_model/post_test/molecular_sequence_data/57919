A zzso zzso zzso which specifically recognizes the zzso tract zzso located upstream of the 3' long terminal repeat zzso of human zzso virus zzso zzso DNA via triplex formation is shown to have a dramatic effect on in zzso zzso from the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso cell zzso a shorter zzso transcript is obtained in the presence of the zzso zzso This truncated zzso lacks about 200 zzso from its 3' zzso The zzso sequence is not responsible for this zzso Instead, this process involves a zzso sequence in the gag zzso located around position zzso The imperfect hybrid formed between the zzso zzso and zzso is precisely zzso by zzso H contained in zzso cell zzso These data show that sophisticated control experiments must be designed before any conclusion can be drawn on the effect of zzso used in zzso and in cell zzso
