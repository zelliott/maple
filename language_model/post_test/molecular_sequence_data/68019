The use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 47, zzso 1977) and of zzso zzso to block free zzso groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 56, zzso zzso is well established in the zzso Since the two zzso apparently do not react with each other, their combination offers a convenient and quite general method for the complete characterization of free zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We review some of the characteristics of the reaction of these zzso with zzso in peptides and proteins and some of the properties of the zzso zzso The review includes reactions with model compounds zzso zzso and zzso proteins such as zzso from zzso and rabbit muscle, containing only free zzso a zzso zzso containing only zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso containing both free and zzso zzso In all cases the direct comparison of the zzso or zzso peptides derived from the products of parallel reactions of the protein with zzso alone and with zzso together with zzso permitted the determination of both free and total zzso in the zzso zzso the fluorescent zzso established the position of the zzso zzso in the primary zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
