The majority of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso level of this acid zzso is directly determined by its level of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which lacks 11 of 12 zzso sites is only poorly zzso We have isolated and characterized both zzso and zzso zzso which are partly able to restore the zzso of acid zzso Our data indicate that the improved zzso is caused by zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso repeated zzso zzso resulting in the restoration of zzso sites in zzso Two different zzso mechanisms, unequal zzso exchange and zzso gene conversion, are responsible for these zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso between zzso and zzso sequences are able to restore the ability of zzso zzso cells to zzso acid zzso
