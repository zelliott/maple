DNA zzso contain active sites that are structurally zzso and highly zzso in zzso To assess the significance of this preservation and to determine the zzso burden that active sites can zzso we randomly zzso a stretch of 13 zzso acids within the zzso zzso site zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso After selection, by using genetic zzso we obtained a library of approximately 8, zzso active zzso DNA zzso of which 350 were zzso and zzso This is the largest collection of zzso active zzso zzso We find that all zzso of motif A, except one zzso are zzso while preserving zzso zzso A wide variety of zzso acid zzso were obtained at sites that are zzso zzso and conservative zzso predominate at regions that stabilize zzso zzso Several zzso exhibit unique properties, including DNA zzso activity higher than the zzso zzso or the ability to incorporate zzso zzso zzso dependent on these zzso zzso for survival are fit to replicate zzso The high zzso of the zzso active site in zzso and the ability to evolve altered zzso may be required for survival in environments that demand increased zzso The inherent zzso of the zzso active site must be addressed relative to the constancy of zzso sequence found in zzso
