The crystal structure of the complex of zzso zzso bound to zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso protein zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The zzso zzso binds to switch 2 and zzso zzso to orient zzso zzso for zzso but it supplies neither zzso nor other zzso acid side chains to the zzso active zzso In the complex, the zzso region appears to be zzso suggesting that zzso could stimulate zzso zzso while zzso maintains an interaction with its zzso the zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso directly zzso in the zzso reaction, accelerating zzso zzso a further zzso in an zzso zzso Thus, a zzso complex controls the zzso zzso reaction triggering zzso of zzso zzso zzso
