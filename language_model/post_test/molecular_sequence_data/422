There has been an increase in the number of individuals administered zzso therapy zzso in India but treatment outcome is hampered by increasing development of drug zzso Previous reports from India have shown zzso as the zzso zzso in treated zzso However, there is no evidence for any zzso zzso in these zzso This study was done to observe the zzso zzso patterns observed in reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of zzso C zzso strains from individuals showing treatment failure in zzso 

The zzso was done by sequencing the zzso and zzso genes of the zzso strains from 18 individuals failing zzso Analysis was carried out using Stanford zzso drug resistance database zzso The sequences were also submitted to the zzso population resistance tool of zzso and zzso zzso zzso typing zzso zzso analysis and quality control were performed with Mega zzso 

Among the 20 zzso 19 showed resistance to both zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso one strain to zzso and five strains showed zzso zzso zzso resistance and zzso zzso The most common zzso zzso zzso resistance was zzso zzso while zzso zzso was the most common zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was seen in zzso of the zzso zzso 

Resistance testing to check the prevalence of drug resistance zzso that arise following failure of the first line regimen to establish guidelines for second line regimens in India is a zzso Studies are needed to confirm if zzso patterns that arise among zzso C following failure of ART are the same as for zzso B zzso
