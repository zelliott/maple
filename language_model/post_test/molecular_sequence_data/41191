The zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of the family zzso includes two members, human zzso zzso and avian zzso zzso causing respiratory tract infections in humans and birds, zzso zzso enter host cells by fusing the viral envelope with a host cell zzso zzso fusion of zzso appears to be unique, in that fusion of some zzso strains requires low zzso Here, we show that the fusion zzso proteins of zzso promote fusion in the absence of the attachment protein and low pH is not zzso Furthermore, there are notable differences in zzso fusion among zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso fusion induced by zzso B but not zzso A and zzso The F protein of zzso zzso A was highly zzso whereas those from zzso B and C were zzso By construction and evaluation of zzso F proteins composed of zzso from the F proteins of zzso A and B, we localized a region composed of zzso acid zzso 170 to 338 in the F protein that is responsible for the zzso zzso of the F from zzso zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso in this region collectively contributed to the zzso Taken together, we have identified a region in the zzso F protein that zzso the extent of membrane zzso A model for fusion consistent with these data is zzso
