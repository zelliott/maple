The lack of reference sequences from zzso zzso zzso often poses a challenge to the zzso of zzso affiliation of sequences from environmental samples, and many environmental sequences are thus left zzso Such unidentified sequences belonging to the widely distributed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were retrieved from zzso and divided into species that were identified in a zzso context using a reference zzso from an ongoing study of the zzso The sequence zzso of the unidentified zzso sequences stored in zzso as well as data from the corresponding original papers, were compiled and used to explore the ecology and distribution of the zzso In addition, the relative occurrence of zzso was contrasted to that of other zzso zzso 

Most species of zzso were found to have less than zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the nuclear zzso zzso This zzso value was used jointly with zzso analysis to zzso and identify unidentified zzso sequences to species zzso A total of 177 unidentified zzso ITS sequences corresponding to 98 species were recovered, zzso of which were successfully identified to species level in this zzso These sequences account for an unexpectedly large proportion of the publicly available unidentified zzso ITS sequences when compared with other zzso zzso Eight zzso species were reported from multiple hosts and some even from hosts forming zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sequences have been reported from four zzso and in climate zones ranging from cold temperate to equatorial zzso Out of the 19 species found in more than one study, six were found in both Europe and North America and one was found in both Europe and Japan, indicating that at least many north temperate species have a wide zzso 

Although zzso species identification and zzso are associated with practical and conceptual difficulties, they also offer new possibilities and avenues for zzso zzso assembly holds great potential to zzso valuable information from community studies for use in a species and zzso zzso
