zzso zzso has been shown to be an effective approach to zzso zzso zzso due to the enhanced zzso zzso and presentation by zzso To overcome disadvantages associated with conventional methods used to zzso zzso we have developed a novel zzso zzso delivery system that zzso a zzso zzso zzso It is demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent immune zzso With a strong binding zzso to DC, zzso zzso induced zzso T cell response in zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso was due not only to enhanced zzso zzso but also to induction of DC zzso Mice zzso with zzso generated strong zzso zzso T cell and zzso zzso zzso also targeted zzso zzso DC to zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso T cell zzso Moreover, upon challenge with zzso tumor cells, tumors in mice zzso with zzso either did not grow or displayed a much more delayed zzso and had slower zzso of growth than those of zzso zzso This zzso zzso delivery system was applied here for the first time to the zzso zzso With several advantages and exceptional zzso we propose zzso zzso as a potential vaccine zzso
