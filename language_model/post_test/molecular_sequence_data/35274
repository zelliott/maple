zzso zzso zzso are small proteins linked to the cellular iron and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model zzso for human African zzso expresses three zzso zzso is a highly abundant zzso protein capable to bind an zzso cluster zzso in zzso using zzso zzso as zzso We here report on the functional and structural analysis of zzso in relation to its zzso zzso 

An zzso extension unique to zzso from zzso affects the zzso structure and the zzso capacity of the zzso The zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso can replace zzso as the zzso of the zzso Interestingly, zzso forms stable zzso zzso species that in zzso are incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso disease progression in a mouse zzso The structure of the zzso of zzso was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Despite the fact that several zzso in other zzso are involved in the zzso binding of zzso zzso different zzso approaches did not reveal any specific interaction between zzso and free zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are able to coordinate an zzso formed with zzso suggesting a new mechanism of zzso binding and a novel function for the zzso zzso The first zzso structure and in zzso relevance of a zzso from a zzso zzso are zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is indispensable for zzso zzso and zzso a new mechanism for zzso zzso
