Human smooth muscle cells were used to investigate the zzso activities of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of coarse zzso zzso prepared by zzso increased with the mean zzso whereas the zzso activities of a zzso fraction had zzso zzso Furthermore, the dependence of zzso activity on zzso content is zzso zzso of zzso abolished both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this compound yielded zzso with restored zzso potency but devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A, yielded a compound having the highest zzso activity, so far observed for a zzso compound, and having only weak zzso zzso
