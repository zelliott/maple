The zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso from influenza A virus is zzso restricted but zzso for the zzso zzso presented by the zzso zzso complex zzso class II zzso zzso We report here the structure of the zzso complex, determined by X-ray zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso The overall structure of this complex is very similar to the previously reported structure of the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence differences between zzso and zzso which are located deep in the zzso binding groove and out of reach for direct contact by the zzso are able to indirectly influence the zzso of the zzso surface by changing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at position zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso is zzso for zzso presented by zzso and zzso and zzso these zzso differences, other zzso zzso are sensitive to these zzso We also find a dependence of the zzso of the zzso class II zzso groove on the sequence of the bound zzso by comparing the zzso complex with the structure of zzso presenting a collagen zzso This structural study of zzso zzso emphasizes how zzso sequence differences can affect zzso binding indirectly by moving zzso zzso
