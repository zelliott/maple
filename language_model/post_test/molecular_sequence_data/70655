We have determined the ability of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso DNA zzso breaks in human zzso These zzso proteins cleave highly zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso sites in their respective hosts to generate homogeneous zzso 3' ends that initiate target zzso zzso or zzso We show that both zzso can be expressed in human cells and can generate zzso DNA zzso breaks in zzso zzso and zzso site zzso These zzso breaks can be repaired in zzso although break repair is zzso with the frequent generation of short deletions or zzso zzso and zzso should be useful for analyzing DNA zzso break repair in human cells and zzso
