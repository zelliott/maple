The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is zzso regulated both by oxygen and zzso A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso region of the zzso gene was found to zzso zzso negative regulation to an zzso zzso hybrid zzso Studies with deletions of zzso length in this zzso demonstrated the presence of separate elements that comprise an upstream promoter that is active in the absence or presence of zzso and an upstream zzso site zzso which zzso strong repression upon the promoter element when oxygen is zzso The promoter element is located zzso to the zzso in the zzso zzso Mixed zzso zzso was used to obtain zzso zzso in the zzso which partially or completely zzso this sequence without affecting the promoter zzso The zzso region has three short direct repeats which seem to be important for function, as zzso zzso within the repeats and not outside them, zzso zzso zzso A model to explain the negative regulation of the zzso gene by oxygen and zzso is zzso
