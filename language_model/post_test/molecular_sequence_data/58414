A DNA zzso of zzso zzso covering the 170 degrees region of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated and zzso For DNA isolation, suitable restriction sites at the end of previously known genes were chosen to amplify adjacent unknown DNA regions by inverse zzso On the basis of the DNA zzso 26 zzso were identified of which zzso and zzso as well as part of zzso and zzso have been described zzso Here we report the complete sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Of the other proteins zzso on the zzso zzso fragment, eight revealed similarities to previously described zzso These included a pair of newly identified DNA zzso zzso A zzso and B zzso a zzso zzso carrier zzso a member of the zzso family zzso an zzso zzso and a response regulator zzso zzso of the physical and the genetic maps revealed several zzso According to its zzso sequences the zzso zzso gene which was previously mapped at 162 degrees was found to be adjacent to zzso localized at 170 zzso Genes zzso and zzso were located the opposite way round and closer together than expected from the genetic map zzso at 173 degrees and zzso at 170 zzso The zzso zzso which was mapped at 169 degrees, was not present on the respective zzso zzso comparison actually showed that zzso is located close to 70 degrees on the zzso zzso zzso
