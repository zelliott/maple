Many zzso zzso channel zzso zzso members contain zzso segments in which the first four form a zzso domain zzso and the last two form the pore domain zzso Studies of zzso channels from the zzso zzso together with identification of zzso only proteins have suggested that the zzso and the zzso can fold zzso Whether such zzso zzso is common to other zzso zzso members has remained zzso Here we show, using protein zzso that the zzso zzso zzso sodium channel zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso selective pore zzso that is zzso zzso and that forms functional, zzso channels when zzso into zzso zzso zzso of the zzso selectivity filter from zzso to zzso a change similar to that previously shown to alter zzso selectivity of the bacterial sodium channel zzso zzso creates a zzso zzso channel, zzso We further show that production of zzso can be generalized by making zzso proteins from two other zzso zzso one from the hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso and one from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, our data establish a family of active zzso zzso channels that should be excellent model systems for study of the factors that govern both sodium and calcium selectivity and zzso Further, our findings suggest that similar dissection approaches may be zzso to a wide range of zzso and, thus, serve as a means to simplify and accelerate zzso zzso and drug development zzso
