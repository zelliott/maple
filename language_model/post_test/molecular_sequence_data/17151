In contrast to zzso many plants zzso zzso inner membrane carrier proteins with an zzso extension that is removed upon zzso zzso zzso using zzso and plant zzso models and zzso general zzso processing zzso zzso indicate that the extension was removed in a zzso zzso The first processing was carried out by zzso while the second processing most probably occurs in the zzso space by an as yet undefined zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso from potato processed two carrier proteins to an intermediate size, this processing was sensitive to an zzso inhibitor zzso and further, processing could be inhibited by changing zzso zzso to zzso zzso at a zzso zzso consensus processing site for zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso only processed plant zzso carrier proteins to the same intermediate size as zzso plant zzso and this zzso processing did not occur in a temperature sensitive zzso zzso for zzso at the restrictive zzso zzso of carrier proteins with intact or zzso plant zzso under conditions designed to slow down the rate of import revealed that the zzso processed intermediate could be observed and chased to the mature zzso The second processing step is inhibited by zzso suggesting it is carried out by a zzso zzso A model for the processing of the zzso extension of plant zzso carrier proteins is zzso
