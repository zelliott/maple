The functional significance of the zzso zzso acids within zzso regions II and zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso followed by transient expression of the zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso The substitution of a zzso zzso at position zzso zzso region zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso resulted in a zzso that did not bind the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, replacement of zzso with zzso did not affect zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso at positions 391 and zzso zzso domain zzso were changed to zzso zzso the less zzso zzso to zzso had no effect on zzso zzso However, replacement of the zzso zzso with zzso reduced zzso binding by zzso Replacement of a zzso zzso at position 82 zzso region zzso with zzso also produced a zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected zzso protein of approximately 51 zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso cells, indicating that these zzso probably did not affect expression or processing of the zzso zzso the sequence of the human zzso zzso described in this paper differs from the published sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso region zzso The present sequence encodes a protein of 422 zzso zzso instead of the zzso acid protein that has been described previously zzso zzso zzso zzso and has a change in the sequence in zzso region IV from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso which zzso to the published sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso Moreover, conversion of the zzso region IV sequence of the present clone to that of the published sequence by zzso zzso abolished zzso binding to the zzso
