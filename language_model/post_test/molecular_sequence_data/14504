The zzso zzso is a zzso class B G zzso zzso that is activated by binding of its natural zzso zzso The signaling effects of this zzso are zzso by zzso with zzso which activates zzso production, and zzso which activates zzso calcium zzso We have explored the molecular basis for the zzso of each of these G proteins to this zzso using systematic zzso zzso of key zzso within each of the zzso loop regions, and studying zzso binding and zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in the first zzso loop zzso and zzso markedly reduced cell surface zzso resulting in marked reduction in zzso and elimination of measurable calcium zzso zzso of an zzso zzso in the first zzso loop reduced zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of a zzso motif in the second zzso loop zzso had no significant effects on any measured zzso zzso in the third zzso loop involving adjacent zzso and zzso zzso zzso or two zzso zzso separated by a zzso and an zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso responses, while the latter also reduced calcium zzso zzso effects were zzso by combining the effective zzso while combining all the effective zzso resulted in a construct that continued to bind zzso zzso but that zzso no significant zzso or calcium zzso These data suggest that, while some zzso zzso are clearly shared, there are also distinct zzso for zzso with each of these G zzso
