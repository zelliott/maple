We previously reported that the dog zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso as observed in humans, and four zzso were identified based on the number and/or order of the 12 and 39 zzso sequences located in the zzso region of human zzso To assess the diversity of the zzso gene in dogs we examined the zzso variations in four breeds zzso golden zzso zzso zzso and zzso employing the zzso chain reaction zzso As a result, we found three novel zzso and determined the DNA sequences of these zzso The beagle shared four zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the 435 zzso and zzso zzso zzso being zzso The golden zzso had the 435 and zzso zzso and the 435 zzso was frequent zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed, of which the zzso zzso was most frequent zzso The zzso had five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso was most common zzso These findings suggest that the zzso frequency varied among the four dog breeds, and analysis of the zzso zzso may therefore be useful for zzso the relationships among dog zzso
