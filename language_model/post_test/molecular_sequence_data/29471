zzso zzso are zzso zzso exchange factors zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and invariably possess tandem zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso While it is known that the zzso domain is the principal zzso zzso recent zzso data indicate that for some zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso may cooperate with their associated zzso zzso in promoting zzso zzso exchange of zzso zzso In order to gain an understanding of the involvement of these zzso zzso in zzso zzso exchange, we have determined the crystal structure of a zzso zzso from zzso in complex with zzso The complex features the zzso domain in a unique zzso distinct from the zzso zzso in the related structures of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso with the zzso domain in binding zzso primarily through a set of interactions involving switch 2 of the zzso Comparative sequence analysis suggests that a subset of zzso proteins will zzso their zzso zzso similarly to zzso
