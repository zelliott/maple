The crystal structure of satellite zzso mosaic virus zzso has been solved by multiple zzso replacement and molecular replacement and refined at zzso A zzso zzso a T zzso 1 zzso virus, is the smallest virus structure zzso The coat protein is an zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso strand that extends into the interior of the virus, presumably interacting with the zzso zzso of electron density on the interior of the protein zzso may be zzso although it is not possible to construct any detailed model of the zzso zzso Basic zzso acid zzso in contact with the zzso acid show a considerable degree of zzso The zzso strand of the virus coat protein interacts with adjacent zzso forming an additional zzso
