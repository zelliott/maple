Two major ecological transitions marked the history of the Black Sea after the last Ice zzso The first was the zzso transition from a zzso to a marine zzso dominated by zzso and dolphins once this basin was zzso back to the Mediterranean Sea zzso 8,000 y zzso The second occurred during the past decades, when overfishing and hunting activities brought these predators close to zzso having a deep impact on the structure and dynamics of the zzso zzso the extent of this decimation is essential for characterizing this zzso dynamics and for zzso restoration zzso However, this extent is poorly documented in historical zzso We addressed this issue for one of the main Black Sea zzso the harbor zzso using a population zzso zzso zzso its genetic diversity using an approximate zzso zzso approach, we show that only a demographic expansion (at most 5,000 y zzso followed by a zzso population collapse can explain the observed genetic zzso We demonstrate that both the zzso settlement of harbor zzso in the Black Sea and the recent anthropogenic activities have left a clear footprint on their genetic zzso Specifically, we zzso a strong population reduction zzso that occurred within the past 5 decades, which can therefore clearly be related to the recent massive killing of small zzso and to the continuing incidental catches in commercial zzso Our study thus provides a quantitative assessment of these demographically catastrophic events, also showing that two separate historical events can be zzso from contemporary genetic zzso
