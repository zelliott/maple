The molecular zzso of zzso crustaceans has been based on sequence data from a limited number of zzso These have included rapidly evolving zzso zzso which are most appropriate for studies of closely related species, and slowly evolving nuclear zzso zzso zzso which have been most useful for resolution of deep branches within the zzso Here we examine the utility of the nuclear gene that encodes zzso zzso for zzso reconstruction at intermediate levels zzso among zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso zzso (the true zzso zzso based on zzso zzso sequences were compared and combined with those for the zzso zzso zzso I zzso All of the zzso in our zzso sample were resolved with high support with zzso zzso data zzso However, some of these zzso were grouped into zzso that are in conflict with recognized zzso zzso A zzso based on zzso zzso I was consistent with the zzso zzso zzso but with weaker zzso A recently proposed measure of zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso was generally more zzso than zzso zzso I for relationships above the level of zzso Combined analysis of data from both genes provided strong support for zzso that are in conflict with current assignments of zzso to the families zzso zzso zzso and zzso
