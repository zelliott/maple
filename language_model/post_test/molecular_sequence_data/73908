In an effort to better understand functional recognition of structurally dissimilar zzso by a single zzso a model system for studying zzso of disparate zzso I complexes was developed using the zzso zzso zzso clone zzso which is zzso to a human zzso zzso bound to an zzso zzso We identified a second complex comprised of a synthetic zzso designated zzso bound to zzso that is recognized by clone zzso In zzso zzso zzso profiles for peptides zzso and zzso zzso onto the appropriate target cells were comparable, suggesting that zzso and zzso form functionally equivalent zzso To probe the interaction between each complex and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso were tested for their activity in zzso zzso zzso were observed between the two zzso with respect to permissible zzso zzso at each zzso position from zzso to zzso marked differences were evident at zzso and at zzso The results obtained suggest that this zzso forms critical contacts with atoms at zzso positions zzso and zzso of zzso and at zzso and zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso of these zzso is a function of both shared and zzso contacts made with each zzso These findings further highlight the versatile zzso that may be shown by a single zzso and suggest a basis for the recognition of zzso zzso sharing only a limited set of structural zzso
