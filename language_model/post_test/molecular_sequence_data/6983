zzso zzso plays an important role in the inflammatory response and when excessive or persistent may augment tissue zzso The effects of zzso indicated the involvement of one or more zzso zzso in human zzso migration and shape change in response to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of alpha zzso and alpha zzso were used to probe the specificity of the zzso involved in zzso zzso specific for zzso G inhibited zzso Moreover, rapid zzso of zzso G and zzso suppressed zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso serum in multiple blind well zzso and to zzso in migration zzso under zzso The zzso of zzso zzso that reduced zzso by 50% would zzso free zzso G with a zzso of zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso required to produce a similar zzso of zzso would zzso zzso G with a zzso of 345 zzso These data suggest different modes of action for these two classes of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso G zzso and to a lesser extent of zzso zzso zzso their effect by preventing a shape change in the zzso zzso exposed to zzso zzso did not affect shape change in response to zzso even at zzso that were able to reduce zzso zzso by zzso These results support the involvement of cell surface zzso in the control of cell migration and show that zzso and zzso have differing modes of zzso This opens the possibility for the rational design of zzso agents targeted at zzso membrane zzso
