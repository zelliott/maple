An antibiotic, zzso zzso zzso the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are necessary for the zzso of the bacterial cell zzso In this study, we cloned both genes zzso zzso and zzso designated zzso and zzso respectively, from zzso zzso zzso zzso Each gene product was zzso to zzso and zzso zzso coli, transformed with a zzso zzso carrying zzso or zzso displays higher resistance to zzso than the same host carrying the zzso coli zzso or zzso gene inserted into the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso was competitively inhibited by zzso the zzso value (920 zzso was obviously higher (40 approximately zzso than those for zzso coli zzso (9 zzso or zzso (27 zzso The high zzso value of the zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso may be a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso studies for the zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso rate of the zzso by zzso is absolutely slower than that of the zzso coli zzso We conclude that zzso from zzso zzso zzso is also one of the zzso zzso
