zzso zzso derived from the envelope zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso that elicit broad zzso zzso remain an elusive zzso The highly zzso 30 zzso membrane zzso external region zzso of zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso for two rare zzso broad zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both these zzso possess relatively zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate enhanced binding to their zzso in the context of the native zzso precursor envelope zzso by the intimate juxtaposition of a zzso zzso The zzso B surface zzso zzso zzso protein forms zzso that can be zzso both as an zzso array of the zzso and to provide the zzso environment needed for enhanced zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso particles with zzso zzso appended at the zzso of the zzso protein are recognized by zzso and zzso with high affinity compared to positioning the zzso at the zzso or the zzso loop zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso region further enhances recognition of the zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso particles decreases zzso and zzso binding and subsequent zzso with synthetic lipids restores optimal zzso zzso of the particles into small animals raised zzso zzso that recognize both the zzso and zzso zzso envelope zzso expressed on the cell surface; however, no zzso activity could be zzso zzso zzso of the zzso particles in sequence with zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso did not raise zzso zzso that could be mapped to the zzso zzso However, the zzso did raise zzso zzso that had the ability to neutralize selected zzso zzso The first generation zzso particles represent a unique means to present zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso to the immune zzso
