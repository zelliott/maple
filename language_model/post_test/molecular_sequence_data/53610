zzso protein of 25 zzso zzso is a zzso membrane protein essential for synaptic zzso zzso To investigate the mechanisms by which zzso mediates zzso we performed a search for proteins that interact with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a zzso protein that is the rat zzso of mouse zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically interacts with zzso but not zzso The association of zzso and zzso is zzso via zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso we have shown that zzso is highly enriched in brain, where it zzso with zzso in most brain zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that in brain, zzso exists in both zzso and zzso zzso Studies using indirect zzso and zzso zzso reveal that, in addition to early zzso zzso is also localized to large zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in nerve growth zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in regulation of zzso through interaction with zzso
