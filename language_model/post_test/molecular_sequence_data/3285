We are interested in the zzso that specify the structure of zzso coiled zzso zzso coiled coils often contain zzso as an important zzso packing zzso structures containing zzso at certain zzso positions in the zzso unit are referred to as zzso Two types have been identified, containing zzso at either the g position of the zzso repeating unit zzso as the d position in the Richardson zzso referred to as a zzso zzso or the e position (a position in the Richardson zzso referred to as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain forms an zzso zzso coiled zzso which falls into the second class of zzso based on recent crystal zzso The role of zzso in such structures has not yet been explored zzso We test the importance of zzso at the e positions on the zzso state and stability of the isolated zzso domain of zzso zzso by testing the effect of zzso at this zzso We find that zzso to zzso is tolerated and its moderately stabilizing effect is most likely a consequence of plasticity of this zzso The effects on stability of the zzso to either zzso or zzso can be largely accounted for by zzso propensity differences between these zzso and zzso The ability of the zzso to adjust to such zzso while maintaining the basic fold of this coiled zzso was further tested by making the same changes at the more highly exposed g zzso zzso at the g positions also causes an increase in stability, presumably by subtle zzso of the zzso to allow partial zzso of this zzso
