A zzso negative, strictly zzso zzso by zzso zzso pale yellow pigmented and zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from soil of a zzso field on zzso Island in the Republic of Korea and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso Growth of strain zzso was found to occur at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was shown to belong to the family zzso and was related to zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was determined to be zzso zzso These results are consistent with characteristics of members of the zzso zzso The only zzso zzso detected in strain zzso was zzso zzso and the major zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso The major polar zzso detected was zzso and the major cellular fatty acids were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso has zzso activity to convert zzso zzso and Rd into zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was 52 zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from zzso zzso zzso and the other species of the zzso zzso by its zzso and genetic distinctiveness and by several zzso zzso zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
