The red leaf zzso of Empire Red Leaf Cotton zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted from zzso zzso in light, is a well known dominant agricultural zzso However, the zzso molecular mechanism remains zzso To explore this, we compared the molecular biological basis of zzso zzso in both zzso and the green leaf cotton variety zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso Introduction of zzso zzso factor zzso the master regulator zzso zzso in zzso zzso into zzso 24 induced zzso zzso indicating structural genes for zzso zzso are not defected and the leaf zzso might be caused by variation of regulatory genes zzso zzso analysis found that a zzso factor zzso (Red Leaf Cotton 1) which encodes the zzso of zzso was highly expressed in leaves of zzso but barely expressed in zzso 24 in zzso zzso expression of zzso from zzso and zzso 24 in zzso roots of zzso zzso and zzso 24 significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter sequences between zzso and zzso 24 revealed two zzso tandem repeats presented in zzso with only one repeat in zzso zzso zzso zzso in cotton leave tissue evidenced that the tandem repeats in zzso is responsible for zzso zzso expression and therefore zzso zzso Taken together, our results in this article strongly support an important step toward understanding the role of zzso zzso factors in the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso in red leaf cotton under zzso
