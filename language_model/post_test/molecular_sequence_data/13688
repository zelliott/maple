We present the complete zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso together with a structural comparison to its zzso zzso In the majority of cases, but not all, the analyses indicate high degrees of primary structural identity within regions of predicted or demonstrated functional zzso We have also taken advantage of the avian model to define the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Northern analyses indicate chicken zzso zzso levels to be zzso in the liver early during development and increase to reach adult levels just prior to zzso Although no zzso differences in zzso zzso levels were zzso the administration of zzso to male zzso was observed to cause a zzso decrease in zzso zzso levels, suggesting that the hormone may alter circulating zzso levels via a zzso zzso
