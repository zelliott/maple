zzso zzso 1 zzso was recently identified as the first zzso zzso that specifically zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso It is a component of the zzso and other zzso complexes and plays an important role in zzso zzso genes in zzso cells, but the molecular mechanisms of its action remain zzso The zzso crystal structure of the human zzso reveals that zzso defines a new zzso of zzso zzso The active center of zzso is characterized by a remarkable zzso zzso cavity with a highly negative zzso zzso Although the protein core of zzso resembles other zzso its zzso activity and functions require two additional structural zzso an zzso zzso domain important for protein stability and a large zzso in the zzso domain indispensable both for the zzso activity and the interaction with zzso These results provide a framework for further probing the zzso mechanism and the functional roles of zzso
