The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified as a 78 zzso iron regulated outer membrane zzso zzso devoid of the zzso zzso as well as cells zzso in the zzso gene were unable to take up zzso as an iron zzso The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was cloned in zzso coli zzso and was shown to zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (78 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (27 zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso a zzso carrying genes for zzso and zzso allowed growth on zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of genes for zzso zzso and zzso was necessary to allow zzso zzso zzso cells to use zzso as an iron zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene and its promoter region was determined and the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a signal zzso of 28 zzso acids and a typical zzso box at its zzso zzso of the first gene in the zzso zzso a well zzso zzso box was found which is in accordance with the zzso expression of zzso
