The zzso zzso of sponges zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso This protein and its gene have been identified so far in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso the second class of zzso zzso the mechanism of synthesis of the largest zzso structures on Earth remains zzso Here, we describe the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso are composed of zzso zzso zzso arranged around a central zzso canal and contain zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso filaments zzso the zzso zzso The major protein in the zzso is a zzso protein that strongly zzso with zzso zzso in Western zzso Its zzso has been successfully zzso the deduced zzso zzso zzso in addition to the characteristic zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso react specifically with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The characterization of zzso at the genetic level should contribute to an understanding of the zzso mechanism of zzso in zzso These data also indicate that zzso is an zzso zzso common to both classes of zzso zzso
