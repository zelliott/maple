Both zzso and zzso human zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso display zzso zzso activity against primary zzso and T zzso virus zzso The most broadly zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes 14 zzso zzso including the zzso core zzso at the tip of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neutralized zzso of 38 primary zzso carrying the zzso zzso motif regardless of whether the viruses belonged to zzso A, B, zzso or zzso in contrast, none of 19 viruses with the zzso and other zzso sequences at the tip of the zzso loop was sensitive to zzso zzso These data are consistent with the zzso resolution of a complex of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso that shows that the binding specificity of the zzso is due to recognition of the zzso motif at the tip of the zzso The critical role of the zzso zzso in this motif was determined using viruses zzso with the envelope of primary isolate zzso containing the zzso motif or with a zzso envelope with a zzso zzso replacing the zzso zzso at the tip of the zzso While the zzso zzso was neutralized by zzso zzso the zzso carrying the point zzso was resistant to zzso These data illuminate the structural basis for both the breadth and specificity of a broadly zzso human zzso and contribute to our understanding of the zzso recognized by zzso that protect against infection with zzso
