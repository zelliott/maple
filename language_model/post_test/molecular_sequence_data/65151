The zzso acid sequence of zzso which functions in the zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso and zzso to achieve folding of newly zzso zzso is highly similar to that of protein zzso zzso zzso but they have their own distinct roles in protein zzso We have characterized the domain structure of zzso by limited zzso and zzso sequencing and have found it to be similar but not identical to that of zzso zzso had three major zzso regions, the first of which was located between zzso 120 and zzso the second between 201 and zzso and the third between 313 and zzso the data thus being consistent with a zzso structure zzso zzso expression in zzso coli was used to verify the domain zzso Each single domain and a zzso double domain could be produced in the form of zzso folded zzso as verified by circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso When the ability of zzso and its a and zzso zzso to fold zzso zzso A was studied by zzso mass zzso zzso markedly enhanced the folding rate at early time points, although less effectively than zzso but was an ineffective catalyst of the overall zzso The a and zzso zzso produced only minor, if any, increases in the folding rate at the early stages and no increase at the late zzso zzso of the soluble zzso zzso with the P domain of zzso was studied by chemical zzso in zzso None of the single zzso zzso nor the zzso double domain could be zzso to the P domain, whereas zzso was obtained with a hybrid zzso zzso but not with zzso indicating that multiple zzso are involved in this zzso interaction and that the zzso domain of zzso cannot be replaced by that of zzso
