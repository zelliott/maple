In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are converted into zzso which are incorporated into biologically active zzso zzso whose lower zzso bases do not form zzso zzso bonds with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Here we report the identity of two zzso zzso genes that zzso an zzso that transfers the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso yielding zzso zzso The zzso genes were named zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso DNA library of zzso zzso A positive selection strategy using an zzso coli strain devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was used to isolate a zzso of zzso DNA that contained zzso and zzso whose zzso sequences overlapped by 8 zzso zzso was isolated to zzso shown to be functional as a zzso and to have highest activity at pH zzso zzso also activated zzso to its zzso zzso Previously characterized zzso zzso activate zzso but do not activate zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm the incorporation of zzso into the zzso and mass zzso was used to identify zzso reaction zzso
