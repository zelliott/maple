Many cell zzso processes are regulated by zzso zzso In order to investigate the role of zzso zzso of the zzso complex we treated suspended or adherent cultures of zzso cells with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso from cell zzso Western zzso of zzso and zzso revealed zzso and zzso mobility shifts which were zzso by zzso zzso Using zzso binding protein fusion zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso we were able to demonstrate specific interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso with zzso zzso In extracts from cells treated with zzso where zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was no longer zzso with zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso of zzso regulated the binding of zzso The zzso zzso was identified as zzso in the zzso WW domain binding motif zzso thus demonstrating the zzso regulation of the zzso interaction by zzso zzso zzso
