To assess the disease progression rate among 12 zzso West European residents zzso of West African zzso compared with the disease progression rate among zzso individuals of the same population, and the characteristics of the zzso strains zzso 

zzso individuals were identified by commercially available zzso zzso their clinical status and zzso cell counts were zzso and zzso was isolated from their peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso capacities of the isolated viruses were determined and their zzso relationships were zzso by comparing zzso chain zzso zzso sequences of reverse zzso zzso gene zzso 

Eight of the 12 zzso individuals presented with progressive disease and one of them progressed from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A1 to A3 within 36 months after zzso The ratios of zzso versus symptomatic individuals among residents of the Rotterdam region of West African descent were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso was isolated from six of the nine individuals with progressive zzso The time required for virus isolation correlated zzso with the zzso zzso cell zzso Five of the zzso zzso zzso in immortalized zzso lines, and two zzso from patients with AIDS were zzso Five zzso zzso from patients born in the Cape zzso zzso grouped together within zzso zzso The zzso isolate from a patient of zzso origin belonged to zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso genes from zzso zzso of two zzso patients, one of which has also been shown to be involved in zzso resistance in zzso 

Disease progression in zzso infection may be as rapid as in zzso zzso isolation and viral zzso were related to disease status, and zzso identical to those observed in zzso zzso resistance were observed in patients treated with zzso
