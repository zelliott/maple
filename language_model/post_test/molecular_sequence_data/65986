zzso zzso channel zzso contributes in part to zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism is still zzso We zzso that zzso increases zzso currents via zzso zzso interaction and that steroid hormones have differential effects on different types of zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso channels zzso and human zzso zzso channels zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and zzso currents zzso by zzso clamp were zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso increased the zzso current in a zzso manner and this effect was abolished by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso increase in the zzso current was unaffected by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tamoxifen zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso synthesis zzso or zzso zzso synthesis zzso In contrast, zzso reduced the zzso current in the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso also inhibited zzso increase in the zzso zzso Finally, zzso but not zzso reduced the zzso zzso 

The present results show that zzso stimulates zzso channels without affecting zzso zzso This effect is zzso zzso and is likely zzso via a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso of zzso channels may contribute in part to its reported antagonism against zzso vascular relaxation via zzso zzso
