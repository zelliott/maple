The recent report that zzso zzso can be induced by zzso stimuli in experimental animals in the absence of zzso has focused attention on the structural similarities between zzso and zzso Here we report that some zzso individuals develop zzso which similarly react with the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso and with the zzso beta chains zzso zzso As these two peptides share a high level of zzso we have investigated the role of this zzso region on zzso class II zzso T cell zzso The synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso has been tested on T cell line zzso zzso Both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso proliferation increased in the presence of this zzso zzso experiments indicate that this enhancing effect carried out by zzso zzso is exerted at the level of zzso zzso Moreover, the specificity of this interaction is supported by the fact that a zzso specific for this zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso zzso similarly to the zzso carried out by zzso II zzso These data support the hypothesis that the functional zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso beta chain described may be involved in the zzso of zzso
