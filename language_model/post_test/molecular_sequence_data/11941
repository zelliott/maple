A panel of five zzso zzso zzso was generated from mice zzso with an attenuated strain of zzso zzso Four of the zzso were used to select zzso of zzso virus which were able to escape zzso by the selecting zzso but it was not possible to select zzso which could escape zzso by the fifth zzso The zzso coding region of the zzso zzso of each zzso was directly zzso to identify the zzso responsible for the zzso escape zzso These results are compared to those of a previous study in which zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso generated against zzso zzso zzso were located on the external surface of the zzso zzso We have confirmed the existence of the previously identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso 2) as well as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Two previously zzso zzso located in surface zzso of zzso zzso 3 and zzso were also zzso None of the zzso zzso the zzso escape zzso was found near the surface depressions on the zzso which are believed to be the zzso binding zzso
