We report the first zzso gene zzso zzso expression and zzso characterization of an zzso converting zzso zzso related zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso counterpart of this zzso zzso zzso A (a zzso zzso also known as zzso leads to the zzso of zzso I to produce a potent zzso The zzso zzso activity of its zzso coli zzso counter part can be inhibited by the zzso drug zzso suggesting that this class of zzso constitutes a novel target for drugs and zzso By utilizing a DNA zzso expression profiling approach, we identified a gene zzso a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was zzso expressed in zzso and zzso stages of the zzso life zzso Both zzso and protein levels of zzso are higher in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso expression of the zzso zzso structure analysis of zzso revealed the presence of an active zzso binding zzso When expressed in zzso coli, the zzso zzso showed zzso activity with synthetic zzso Replacement of two zzso and one zzso acid at positions zzso 470 and zzso respectively, with zzso zzso in its active site resulted in loss of zzso zzso zzso an zzso specific inhibitor was able both to reduce significantly zzso zzso activity and to inhibit zzso zzso Both its zzso location and close zzso to zzso from bacterial species suggests a role in zzso zzso Further, identification of zzso now provides an opportunity to investigate zzso zzso for their potential as drug and vaccine zzso
