Three zzso zzso the lid complex of the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso complex, all consist of multiple proteins harboring zzso and zzso zzso Up to now, no specific function for any of these proteins has been zzso nor has the importance of these motifs been zzso In particular zzso a lid zzso serves as the paradigm for zzso proteins as it is highly zzso and important for zzso zzso 

We have identified a sequence zzso termed the zzso zzso which is highly zzso in a subset of zzso domain proteins such as zzso and zzso but is not present outside of this zzso The zzso motif consists of five polar zzso that resemble the active site zzso of zzso zzso classes, particularly that of zzso By using zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso are important for the function of zzso while a highly zzso zzso zzso outside of the zzso motif is not zzso Single zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso all show similar zzso including slow growth, sensitivity to temperature and zzso acid zzso and general zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso motif is abundant in certain zzso zzso including newly identified proteins of zzso bacteria and zzso thought to act outside of the traditional large zzso zzso The putative zzso nature of the zzso motif makes it a good candidate for a pivotal zzso function, possibly a zzso zzso activity and a zzso zzso zzso
