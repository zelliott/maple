A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso sample collected from the deepest of the known World Ocean zzso fields, zzso field (1 degrees zzso zzso N 4 degrees zzso zzso zzso on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, at a depth of 4100 zzso The strain was enriched using zzso as the electron donor and zzso oxide as the electron zzso zzso of strain zzso were irregular zzso zzso zzso in zzso The temperature range for growth was zzso degrees C, with an optimum at 81 degrees zzso The pH range for growth was zzso with an optimum at pH zzso Growth of zzso was observed at zzso zzso ranging from 1 to 6 % zzso with an optimum at zzso % zzso The isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extract as electron donors for zzso zzso It was also capable of growth with zzso as the sole electron zzso zzso as a carbon source and zzso as an electron zzso without the need for organic zzso zzso zzso the form of poorly zzso zzso oxide or zzso zzso was the only electron zzso that supported zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the closest relative of the isolated zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso properties and zzso zzso the isolate is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
