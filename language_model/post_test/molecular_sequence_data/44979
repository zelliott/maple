zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso here as zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso that is found in multiple zzso compartments in zzso zzso From an analysis of the corresponding zzso we found that the distribution of the zzso to appropriate zzso locations is achieved by the use of alternative sites for the initiation of zzso The pig zzso zzso zzso gene spans over 100 zzso and is organized into 16 zzso The core protein sequence is zzso by zzso zzso which match perfectly with zzso zzso of the gene for zzso zzso another member of the zzso zzso zzso These two sets of 11 zzso share the same zzso sites, suggesting a common zzso Multiple species of zzso for zzso zzso zzso were detected by the zzso amplification of zzso ends and they were shown to have been generated from a single gene by alternative choices of sites for the initiation of zzso and zzso Two types of transcript were prepared, corresponding to zzso from zzso and zzso zzso Their expression in zzso in zzso cells indicated that they zzso two zzso zzso and zzso which differed only at their zzso zzso the long form contained a zzso zzso targeting sequence and was directed to zzso the short form, lacking such a signal zzso remained in the zzso The complex structure of the zzso zzso zzso gene thus zzso by alternative promoter zzso a fine zzso regulation of coordinate zzso in the different zzso zzso of the two zzso arising from a single zzso
