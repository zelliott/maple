Factor IX zzso is a vitamin zzso plasma zzso a zzso of which results in zzso zzso A canine model of zzso B zzso attempts to use this model for gene transfer experiments or characterization of the zzso zzso require zzso of normal canine zzso zzso We report the isolation and characterization of the coding region for canine zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso identity at the zzso level with human zzso The leader zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso and the zzso portion of the heavy chains show extensive sequence conservation between the canine and zzso All zzso zzso undergoing zzso in humans are zzso in zzso The complete coding sequence for canine zzso has been determined, and the derived translation product has been zzso A similar approach should allow identification of the zzso zzso in canine zzso zzso Furthermore, this clone may prove a valuable resource in gene transfer experiments for this zzso
