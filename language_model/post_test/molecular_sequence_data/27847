Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of zzso were searched for signs of zzso zzso characteristic nuclear zzso enhancement patterns displayed in the two-dimensional zzso typical chemical shifts, zzso zzso and slow zzso zzso The results provided identification of the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso involved in the zzso The full sequential assignment of this region was gained by identification of some zzso acid spin systems and their alignment with the primary zzso The assignment of the zzso was virtually completed subsequently and a list produced of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso constraints derived from the zzso The zzso consists of a zzso with four zzso zzso one attached parallel chain, three tight turns and a zzso The zzso of the zzso was determined by distance geometry calculation using the zzso constraints zzso zzso 107 sequential and 226 long-range zzso 32 zzso angles, zzso and 28 hydrogen zzso as zzso Observation of some interactions between the sheet and previously identified zzso regions made it possible to give an outline of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso
