zzso human zzso research is important in identifying disease zzso genes zzso Although zzso reconstruction by statistical methods is widely used, direct zzso determination by molecular techniques has also been developed as a complementary method for statistical zzso In this study, we demonstrate a molecular zzso method making use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified 10 common zzso and a zzso zzso zzso within zzso region upstream of the zzso initiation site of zzso and determined zzso structure, dividing the region into two DNA zzso Real zzso were determined zzso by our zzso analysis with fragments longer than 1 zzso zzso reconstructed from zzso zzso in the same region by the statistical methods including zzso zzso were also zzso zzso comparison between statistical zzso and direct determination of zzso revealed that major zzso containing multiple marker sites showing strong zzso are estimated in great accuracy but that a variety of zzso reflecting weak zzso are not reconstructed precisely zzso Our data can be helpful in implementing molecular zzso or statistical zzso since usage of these methods may be determined depending on the zzso zzso
