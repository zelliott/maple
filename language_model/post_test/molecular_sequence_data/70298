Using Northern analysis three zzso areas are detected in the gene prune region from which three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in length zzso zzso zzso are zzso Only zzso zzso zzso is shown to be changed in size and quantity in the case of the zzso and zzso zzso This zzso seems to be a gene prune zzso From the analysis of the portion of zzso zzso zzso sequence corresponded zzso zzso zzso follows that its putative zzso acid product contains a zzso site which is characterized for zzso zzso zzso On the basis of presented results and published data by zzso et al zzso it may be concluded that at least five different zzso transcribe in the gene prune region in area spanning about 10 zzso
