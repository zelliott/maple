The effects of zzso of the genes zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit zzso changes in growth rate or zzso although a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew more slowly than its parent zzso Attempts to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso but not the other zzso were more sensitive to zzso a zzso zzso These observations suggest that individually the zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso but that either zzso or zzso is required for growth in zzso These results also suggest that zzso is a functional zzso in zzso zzso
