zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso to focal zzso in adherent zzso Through zzso of proteins assembled at the zzso tails of zzso zzso promotes signaling events that zzso cellular growth, survival, and zzso The zzso region of zzso contains a region of sequence zzso with band zzso and zzso zzso proteins termed a zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in a variety of signaling and zzso proteins and are thought to mediate zzso interactions with partner proteins and zzso at the plasma membrane and zzso regulatory zzso Here we report two crystal structures of an zzso zzso of avian zzso containing the zzso domain and a portion of the regulatory zzso that connects the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso folds of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso are similar to those of known zzso structures despite low sequence zzso zzso in the sequence and relative orientation of the F3 zzso alters the nature of the zzso zzso and the zzso binding site found in zzso family zzso zzso is not present in zzso A putative protein interaction site on the F3 lobe is masked by the zzso region of the zzso Additionally, in one structure the adjacent zzso zzso and zzso binding sites in the zzso associate with the surfaces of the F3 and F1 zzso zzso These structural features suggest the possibility that protein interactions of the zzso zzso domain can be regulated by binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
