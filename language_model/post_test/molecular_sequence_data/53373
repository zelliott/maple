zzso of zzso repair zzso the genesis of zzso unstable zzso colon zzso zzso is one of several genes zzso components of the zzso repair complex, and zzso zzso zzso have been found in a few zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in whom zzso zzso colon zzso zzso However, mice bearing zzso zzso genes do not develop colon zzso and zzso zzso in sporadic human colon zzso have not been zzso Here we report that in zzso colon cancer the zzso gene is zzso by zzso zzso of both zzso zzso The cell line derived from this tumor is functionally deficient in DNA mismatch zzso This zzso can be zzso zzso by addition of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso deficient zzso cancer cell line demonstrates zzso instability, an elevated zzso gene zzso rate, and resistance to the zzso of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of zzso can play a role in development of sporadic zzso colon cancer expressing the full range of cancer zzso associated with zzso of the mismatch repair zzso
