Human tissue zzso 4 zzso belongs to a zzso family of closely related zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso activates zzso and is zzso in prostate and zzso zzso We have identified active zzso of zzso zzso besides inactive zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso nickel, and zzso zzso in three crystal forms containing zzso zzso and zzso These structures display a novel metal site between zzso and zzso that links the zzso loop with the zzso zzso zzso zinc as present in zzso fluid zzso the zzso activity of zzso against zzso zzso In our zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zinc zzso constant zzso of 16 zzso including a permanent residual activity, in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since the zzso N zzso of zzso zzso becomes more accessible for zzso agents in the presence of zzso we propose that zinc affects the zzso active site via the zzso formed between the N zzso and zzso required for a functional active zzso zzso possesses an unusual zzso that creates a zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings explain the observed specificity of zzso for the zzso to zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso shows a zzso charged surface patch, which may represent an zzso for zzso zzso zzso
