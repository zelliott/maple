DNA integration is a defining step in the zzso life cycle and the basis of stable gene transfer in zzso gene zzso Previous studies of integration by zzso zzso have shown that integration is not random, but favored in active zzso zzso Studies to date have focused on zzso integration in dividing cells, leaving open the question of whether integration target site selection might differ in zzso zzso According to one idea, division of the host cell might be required for favored integration in zzso units, possibly as a result of zzso zzso during DNA zzso Here we have investigated this issue by comparing integration in dividing zzso primary lung zzso to integration in zzso zzso cells arrested in zzso by serum zzso and contact zzso We identified several differences in integration site selection in arrested versus dividing cells, including the frequency of integration in zzso units and in zzso zzso However, integration in zzso cells was in fact more favored in zzso units, contrary to the idea that cell division was important for this zzso These data provide the first view of zzso integration in zzso cells and help zzso models for the mechanism of favored integration in zzso
