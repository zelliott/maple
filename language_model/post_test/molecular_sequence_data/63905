zzso modified zzso Ankara zzso zzso expressing zzso influenza virus genes were constructed and evaluated for use in zzso zzso Two strains of zzso zzso expressing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso genes were zzso Each influenza virus gene was cloned from zzso zzso into an zzso construction zzso and was introduced to the deletion III locus of the wild type zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso viruses were plaque zzso and zzso expression was confirmed by zzso Two zzso were primed by vaccination with 50 zzso zzso and two zzso were vaccinated with 50 zzso zzso using the zzso zzso research zzso Six and 10 weeks later, zzso were zzso with 2 zzso zzso infectious units of zzso zzso zzso the zzso influenza zzso equally divided between intramuscular and zzso sites in the zzso A marked rise in influenza zzso zzso and zzso serum zzso zzso was detected following administration of zzso boosters with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses and zzso zzso production were also strongly zzso by both zzso This study demonstrates the facility with which zzso zzso viruses expressing defined pathogen genes can be constructed, and provides preliminary evidence of the zzso and safety of these zzso in the zzso
