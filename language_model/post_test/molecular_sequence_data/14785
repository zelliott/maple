Recent studies have shown that the polar bear zzso zzso zzso evolved from a brown bear lineage since the late zzso potentially indicating rapid zzso and zzso to arctic zzso Here, we present a high-resolution data set from multiple independent zzso across the nuclear zzso of a broad sample of zzso brown, and black zzso zzso zzso analyses place polar bears outside the brown bear zzso and date the divergence much earlier, in the middle zzso about 600 zzso to zzso thousand years zzso This provides more time for polar bear evolution and confirms previous suggestions that polar bears carry zzso brown bear zzso DNA due to past zzso Our results highlight that zzso zzso analyses are crucial for an accurate understanding of evolutionary zzso
