zzso zzso zzso were zzso based upon known translation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with these zzso utilizing zzso zzso strain zzso zzso DNA as template produced a DNA zzso containing a portion of zzso This DNA zzso was used as a zzso probe to clone a zzso version of zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso sequences revealed the presence of six zzso in zzso The zzso sequence of zzso from these two strains of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso bias for most zzso acids zzso by zzso was similar to that observed in zzso zzso for highly expressed zzso This zzso bias was also observed in the zzso zzso ACT zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso consisting of zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso from strain zzso zzso a protein with one additional zzso Both zzso zzso proteins possessed a high degree of identity throughout their length to zzso human, and plant zzso zzso
