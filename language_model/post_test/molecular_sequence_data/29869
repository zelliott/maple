All of the 181 possible overlapping zzso as well as 179 zzso covering the zzso acid sequence of human zzso zzso zzso were zzso on zzso zzso The synthetic procedure of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mason, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso was modified to obtain up to 100 zzso of zzso on each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso were identified by examining the binding of zzso raised against both native and zzso zzso to these peptides by zzso zzso zzso The peptides bound in a similar pattern to zzso zzso against both native and zzso zzso zzso zzso Six major zzso were located corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using both zzso and zzso An additional zzso zzso zzso zzso was found by the use of zzso Most of the zzso are zzso and reside largely in zzso regions at the boundaries of secondary structural elements of zzso This observation is consistent with our previous results which suggested that zzso binding at the active site of the zzso can cause a dramatic reduction in zzso binding to zzso due to zzso constraints in flexible loop regions in various parts of the zzso The similarity of the zzso profiles of native versus zzso zzso indicates that the two forms of the zzso share the same zzso acid zzso zzso Competitive zzso zzso zzso showed that the binding of zzso zzso to both native and zzso zzso was inhibited by approximately zzso by the seven zzso zzso indicating that a significant proportion of the zzso zzso by this zzso is specific for short zzso Besides revealing the zzso structure of zzso our results provide a rational basis for the design of zzso zzso to study the importance of loop zzso in the zzso dynamics of the zzso
