This investigation presents data which indicate that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso activity zzso from zzso cells is composed of three separate zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was demonstrated that the zzso zzso protein had an apparent molecular mass of 50 zzso zzso and was zzso to apparent zzso by zzso from an zzso zzso zzso These zzso were also zzso with a second zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells demonstrated positive zzso with the zzso specific for human zzso The zzso zzso protein was adherent to an zzso zzso column and was demonstrated to be zzso to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein was demonstrated to have an apparent molecular mass of 60 zzso and was also zzso with a second zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso Further, the zzso specific for zzso was demonstrated to zzso to a zzso message from zzso isolated from zzso zzso A third zzso was detected that was zzso to zzso zzso and both of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso was adherent to zzso and zzso zzso and was not zzso with any zzso for either zzso or zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso demonstrated positive zzso with an zzso specific for zzso This investigation demonstrates with zzso zzso and molecular data that the zzso zzso zzso produces three zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
