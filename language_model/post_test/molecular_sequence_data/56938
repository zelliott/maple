zzso zzso zzso is a fundamental mechanism in the regulation of cell proliferation and zzso zzso this zzso process is modulated by the opposing activities of protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso While the role of protein zzso zzso has been examined extensively in human breast zzso the role of zzso in this process is virtually zzso To address this issue, an activated zzso zzso was introduced into an immortalized zzso human breast zzso cell line zzso This resulted in a substantial increase in zzso zzso which led to the formation of progressively growing zzso after such cells were zzso into zzso nude zzso zzso a striking increase in the expression of specific zzso zzso and zzso was observed in 3 independently zzso transformed cell lines and their derived zzso This zzso was verified at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso expression was only slightly increased in these zzso transformed cells, and no expression of zzso zzso was zzso The level of zzso zzso as well as the differential expression between zzso and zzso directly correlated with zzso Furthermore, rat zzso zzso with elevated zzso expression zzso also had sharply elevated zzso expression when compared to rat zzso zzso with little or no zzso expression zzso zzso the level of expression of zzso zzso was directly correlated with the level of zzso zzso Thus, our results provide the first evidence that, in human breast zzso cells and in rat zzso zzso that have an induced increase in zzso zzso a consistent and substantial increase in the expression of specific zzso zzso The relationship between zzso zzso zzso expression and specific zzso expression may play a critical role in human breast zzso
