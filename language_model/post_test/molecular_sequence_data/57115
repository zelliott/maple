Both the zzso of zzso fatty acid zzso and the liver fatty zzso protein zzso are induced in the liver by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso as well as high fat zzso One proposed mechanism for this induction is that it represents an zzso response to altered zzso fatty acid zzso zzso by zzso fatty acids formed via the zzso zzso zzso zzso The studies presented in this paper were designed to investigate the role of the products of zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso In primary zzso cultures exposed to zzso the increase in zzso activity preceded the induction of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso could be significantly inhibited zzso by concurrent exposure of cultured zzso to zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid, a zzso zzso fatty acid, that is poorly zzso in zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso via a zzso mechanism that was not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso acids were without such inducing zzso In further studies, zzso zzso acid zzso were found to display greater potency as zzso of zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso The inducing effects of the zzso acid zzso were also independent of the zzso zzso zzso The results of these studies suggest that the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso to a significant extent, by poorly zzso zzso zzso acids formed via the zzso zzso
