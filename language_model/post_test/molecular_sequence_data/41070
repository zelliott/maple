Purple acid zzso are zzso found in animals, plants and zzso They possess a zzso metal zzso to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso In humans, elevated purple acid zzso levels in zzso are correlated with the progression of osteoporosis and zzso bone zzso making this zzso a target for the development of new zzso to treat zzso zzso To date, little progress has been achieved towards the design of specific and potent zzso of this zzso that have zzso zzso Here, we have undertaken a zzso screening approach using a zzso library identifying three zzso of purple acid zzso with zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiency values are zzso zzso per heavy zzso X-ray crystal structures of these compounds in complex with a plant purple acid zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined and show that all bind in the active site within contact of the zzso zzso For one of these compounds, the zzso ring is positioned within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso simulations indicate that the three compounds fit into the active site of human purple acid zzso These studies open the way to the design of more potent and selective zzso of purple acid zzso that can be tested as zzso drug zzso
