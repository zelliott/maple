zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is essential for the major zzso of zzso genetic zzso in zzso zzso It has a potent zzso activity that uses zzso zzso to unwind very long stretches of zzso The functional form of zzso zzso has been zzso since zzso of zzso have been previously zzso We have isolated two zzso forms of the zzso one zzso containing a single copy of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the other zzso containing two copies of each zzso We show here that the zzso form of the zzso zzso approximately zzso can form a stable initiation complex on the end of zzso zzso Depending on the nature of the zzso end, zzso estimates ranged from approximately zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso which enhanced but was not required for zzso We further showed that the complex of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso DNA end was competent to unwind zzso A general model for the action of zzso has been proposed that uses repeated zzso changes between two states of a complex between DNA and a zzso form of the zzso Our results make such a model unlikely for zzso zzso
