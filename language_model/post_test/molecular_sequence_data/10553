Two human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are derived from the same gene by alternative zzso involving zzso 9 of the zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso zzso was proposed to act as a zzso negative inhibitor of zzso thus modulating zzso responsiveness of target zzso To study zzso in mice we characterized the zzso region around zzso 9 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the presumed zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of 59 zzso zzso In contrast, human zzso zzso zzso only 15 zzso zzso Using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction the absence of zzso zzso was demonstrated in all adult mouse zzso zzso To exclude the possibility that the zzso chain reaction conditions employed were not suitable for the amplification of zzso zzso we zzso an artificial template corresponding to the presumed zzso zzso spanning zzso 7, 8, and zzso Various amounts of this template were added to brain zzso preparations and as little as 25 molecules were zzso under the zzso chain reaction conditions zzso Since zzso is not zzso across species its zzso significance in humans appears zzso
