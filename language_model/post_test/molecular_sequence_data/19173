zzso virus is the most divergent zzso zzso that had been detected up to now, and does not fit into any of the four approved zzso zzso viral zzso virus type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso Classical zzso fever virus zzso and Border disease virus zzso However, the presence of zzso and zzso coding regions, which are unique to zzso provides clear evidence of a zzso Nevertheless, the zzso acid identity of zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is only zzso By using a zzso zzso a novel zzso construct was generated, in which the zzso region zzso the zzso protein zzso was replaced by that of zzso virus zzso In zzso studies of zzso revealed autonomous replication with the same efficacy as the zzso backbone zzso and infectious zzso virus could be zzso In order to compare the ability of zzso zzso suppression, two reporter gene zzso specific for zzso zzso were carried zzso In zzso cells, no significant difference in blocking of zzso expression between the parental virus zzso zzso virus and the zzso construct zzso could be zzso In contrast, an zzso deletion zzso showed an impaired replication in bovine cells and a marked zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our findings reveal the zzso of zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso virus with a zzso type 1 backbone and its characteristic feature as an inhibitor of zzso zzso induction with an zzso comparable to other zzso
