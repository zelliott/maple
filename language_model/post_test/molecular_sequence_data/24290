zzso oxide zzso is zzso from zzso in the zzso zzso active site of zzso zzso zzso The internal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may zzso to the side chain of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso we generated the zzso zzso zzso and zzso NO formation activities with the zzso using both zzso and zzso as zzso were less than zzso zzso zzso in contrast to rates of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso reduction rate of the zzso was very slow, less than zzso zzso in contrast with that (more than 10 zzso of the wild zzso The backbone zzso group of zzso interacts with the zzso zzso through van der zzso zzso whereas the zzso oxygen of zzso and the zzso zzso atom of zzso form a tight hydrogen zzso The results suggest that zzso is critical in preserving the zzso zzso structure and thus, is indirectly involved in both zzso and electron transfer from the zzso domain to the zzso
