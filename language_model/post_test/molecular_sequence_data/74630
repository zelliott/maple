zzso II zzso are essential zzso that zzso DNA zzso and play a role in zzso zzso While these zzso appear to recognize and cleave the DNA in a zzso fashion, factors that zzso zzso specificity remain an zzso To gain new insights on these topics, we zzso using zzso and molecular dynamics methods, studies of the structural and dynamic features of a 21 zzso DNA segment zzso zzso by zzso zzso The large size of the zzso did not hamper the determination of structures of sufficient quality, and numerous interesting correlations between zzso parameters already depicted in zzso and molecular dynamics simulations are recovered zzso The main feature of the sequence is the occurrence of a large opening of the base pairs in a zzso zzso region located immediately at the zzso end of one of the zzso zzso This opening seems to be largely dependent on sequence context, since a similar opening is not found in the other AT base pairs of the zzso Furthermore, two zzso zzso of the same portion of the zzso present slow internal motions at the zzso zzso revealing particular base zzso In conclusion, this zzso region presents the most salient character in the sequence and could be involved in the preferential zzso by zzso zzso The examination of preferred sites in the literature pointed out the frequent occurrence of zzso zzso namely zzso attachment region and scaffold attachment region zzso at the sites zzso by zzso zzso We could zzso that the particular flexibility of these sequences plays an important role in enabling the formation of a competent zzso zzso The sequences could then be selected based on their facility to undertake zzso change during the complex formation, rather than purely based on binding zzso
