A representative set of zzso acids with zzso zzso has been characterized here, following up our previous compilation of zzso parameters for single zzso on aromatic side zzso Their zzso chemical shifts, chemical shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times were determined by solid state zzso on twelve zzso zzso acid samples, and the corresponding zzso zzso chemical shifts and zzso zzso were obtained in zzso Of particular interest are zzso acids carrying a zzso because not only the zzso chemical shift but also the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used for structural studies of zzso peptides and zzso The zzso are further compared with zzso zzso and zzso using both zzso and zzso zzso to describe their zzso behavior and to examine the respective zzso effects of the zzso and zzso zzso We have also characterized two zzso zzso acids in which a zzso is zzso connected to the backbone by a zzso or zzso zzso and which are particularly well suited for structure analysis of zzso zzso The zzso zzso parameters of the zzso zzso acids are compared with data from the zzso labeled side chains in synthetic zzso
