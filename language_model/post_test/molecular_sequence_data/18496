Two zzso bacterial zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from a soil sample collected at zzso South zzso These strains were observed to be zzso zzso zzso and to form pink zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that these strains belong to the zzso zzso in the family zzso zzso zzso and C2 have the highest sequence similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Like other members of the zzso zzso the novel zzso showed resistance to zzso with a zzso value in excess of zzso The zzso were found to have zzso zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso and an unidentified zzso as major polar zzso In addition, the most abundant fatty acids of strain zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis results showed that the DNA zzso contents of strain zzso and C2 are zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, the zzso zzso data support the proposal that the zzso zzso and C2 represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is a strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
