The structural gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso A zzso sequence of the cloned zzso was zzso This sequence specifies an open reading frame of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows a zzso similarity with that of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso from a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to human, revealed the presence of seven highly zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso which have four to six zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso carries only two zzso zzso This zzso is also unique in that some of the zzso acids that are fully zzso in zzso from other sources are replaced by functionally different zzso zzso Construction of an zzso strain provided a sufficient supply of this zzso and it was zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical with the native zzso zzso zzso and it is not zzso even after treatment at 65 degrees C for 70 zzso
