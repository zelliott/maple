The deleted in liver cancer 2 zzso is a tumor zzso zzso frequently found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein containing a sterile zzso zzso domain, a zzso protein zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The SAM domain of zzso zzso exhibits a low level of sequence zzso zzso with other SAM zzso and appears to be the zzso of a new zzso of SAM zzso found in zzso zzso In the present study, we have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of zzso using zzso methods together with molecular dynamics simulated zzso In addition, we performed a backbone dynamics zzso The zzso packed as a unique four zzso bundle stabilized by zzso zzso zzso The arrangement of the four zzso is distinct from all other known SAM zzso In contrast to some members of the SAM domain family which form either zzso or zzso both zzso analyses and zzso correlation time zzso measured by backbone zzso relaxation experiments indicated that zzso exists as a zzso in zzso The interaction of zzso domain with sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was examined by CD and zzso zzso zzso The zzso exhibits membrane binding properties accompanied by minor loss of the secondary structure of the zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso of zzso in zzso does not require SAM domain, instead, a protein domain consisting of zzso zzso mediates the zzso of zzso
