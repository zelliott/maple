zzso stress tolerance of the microbial producers is of great importance for the process economy and efficiency of zzso zzso Key genes influencing ethanol tolerance of brewing zzso can be revealed by studies on the molecular mechanisms which can lead to the further zzso engineering zzso for the improvement of ethanol tolerance and ethanol zzso zzso shows protective effect on the cell viability of zzso against multiple environmental stress factors, however, further research is needed for the exploration of the underlying molecular zzso In this study, the promoter region of the zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a reporter zzso based on the expression zzso zzso on which the green zzso protein zzso was directed by the zzso promoter was constructed and transformed to industrial zzso strain zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso expression of the zzso zzso in presence of zzso and zzso ethanol revealed that the zzso activity was strongly induced by zzso ethanol, showing specific response to ethanol zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a protective response against ethanol zzso
