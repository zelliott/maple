The evolutionary transition of the fins of fish into zzso limbs involved genetic changes to zzso systems that resulted in novel skeletal patterns and zzso zzso to understanding this issue have entailed the search for zzso of limb structure in zzso zzso and zzso Comparative genetic analyses have produced ambiguous zzso although studies of zzso zzso genes from zzso group 13 zzso and zzso reveal similarities in gene expression between the zzso segments of fins and zzso this functional zzso has not been supported by zzso comparisons of the activity of their zzso zzso namely the zzso Global Control zzso Here, we show that zzso elements driving zzso gene expression in zzso limbs are present in zzso Using an zzso zzso approach, we find functional conservation between zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso sequences from zzso zzso and skate can drive reporter gene expression in mouse limbs and zzso zzso Our results support the notion that some of the zzso associated with zzso limbs arose by modification of deeply zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms of zzso regulation in zzso
