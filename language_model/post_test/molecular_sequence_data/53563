A novel zzso zzso zzso which processes the precursors of the envelope fusion zzso of zzso zzso and human influenza A zzso was zzso to zzso from pig zzso On zzso the zzso zzso gave a protein band corresponding to about 32 zzso and has an apparent molecular mass of 120 zzso as determined by gel zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso against this zzso revealed that the zzso is located in pig lung mast zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso exhibits about zzso identity with those of mast cell zzso from other zzso Of the zzso tested, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a few zzso zzso such as zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso inhibited this zzso zzso zzso stabilized the zzso but zzso conditions did not, unlike for human mast cell zzso The zzso zzso efficiently processed the fusion zzso precursor of zzso virus and slowly processed zzso of human influenza A virus, and triggered the zzso of zzso virus in a zzso manner, although human mast cell zzso beta and rat mast cell zzso zzso zzso from lungs did not process these fusion zzso at zzso These results suggest that mast cell zzso in pig lungs is the possible trigger of the zzso virus zzso
