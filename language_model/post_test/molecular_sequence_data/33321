Recent studies have documented that the soybean zzso zzso zzso has undergone two rounds of large-scale zzso and/or zzso zzso To shed light on the timing and nature of these zzso events, we characterized and analyzed two zzso of zzso zzso satellite repeats, zzso and zzso using a combination of zzso and molecular zzso zzso These two zzso of satellite repeats mark distinct zzso of soybean zzso and, in at least one case, a pair of zzso suggesting their origins from an zzso zzso The satellite zzso of each zzso are arranged in large tandem zzso and zzso zzso of the two zzso were not detected by zzso in zzso zzso on extended DNA fibers nor at the sequence zzso This indicates that there has been little zzso and homogenization of satellite DNA between these two sets of zzso These satellite repeats are also present in zzso zzso the proposed wild zzso of zzso but could not be detected in any other relatives of soybean examined in this study, suggesting the rapid divergence of the zzso satellite DNA within the zzso zzso Together, these observations provide direct evidence, at molecular and zzso levels, in support of the hypothesis that the soybean zzso has experienced a recent zzso zzso
