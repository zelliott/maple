zzso I is a zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso I binds protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso with zzso in an overlay zzso in zzso zzso interaction analysis, and in zzso and zzso zzso zzso I also zzso with both the alpha and gamma zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso I fusion protein zzso zzso containing the putative zzso binding domain zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This fusion protein was also rapidly zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso to a zzso of 1 zzso The zzso zzso was identified as zzso 461 by zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso I zzso zzso by zzso significantly reduced its binding to zzso by overlay and by zzso zzso zzso A zzso decrease in zzso potency was also observed using a zzso zzso which mimics zzso of zzso These findings identify a signaling mechanism involving the regulation of zzso activity and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
