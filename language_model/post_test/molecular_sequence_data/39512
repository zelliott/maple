Human zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein family that binds a broad range of zzso and activates the zzso zzso of innate zzso Common zzso of zzso disrupt the zzso protein or zzso the amount of protein produced, resulting in zzso zzso The clinical manifestations of zzso zzso have been extensively studied but the actual role of this zzso in immunity to infection remains a matter of strong zzso zzso is commonly thought to play a key role in protective zzso because zzso zzso has been associated with an increase in zzso to infectious zzso However, the high worldwide prevalence of multiple zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggests the converse that zzso zzso zzso zzso To explore the underlying forces accounting for the high worldwide prevalence of zzso zzso zzso we characterized genetic diversity in and around the zzso zzso region in zzso zzso from 24 worldwide zzso Our results clearly demonstrate that the patterns of zzso variation are compatible with neutral evolution, as opposed to negative, positive or balanced natural zzso The high worldwide zzso of zzso zzso associated with the production of little or no protein therefore result exclusively from human migration and genetic zzso The evolutionary neutrality of zzso strongly supports the notion that zzso variation does not have strong effects on population zzso zzso therefore, that this zzso is largely redundant in host human zzso
