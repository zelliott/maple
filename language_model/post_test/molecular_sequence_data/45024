The zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso complexes are central to zzso zzso zzso zzso and budding of zzso The zzso zzso complex contains the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and its assembly is directed by the zzso zzso box of zzso the zzso half of zzso and the zzso half of zzso The crystal structures of a zzso core zzso and the zzso core were solved at zzso and zzso A zzso Each zzso contains a structurally similar pair of zzso that form the zzso The zzso domain of zzso has a zzso binding site on its surface that is zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso binds the zzso zzso The structure shows how zzso is assembled by a compact core from which the zzso zzso domain, the zzso C domain, and other zzso project to bind their zzso
