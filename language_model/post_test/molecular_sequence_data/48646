Three bacterial strains utilizing zzso zzso as a sole source of zzso nitrogen and energy were isolated from an industrial wastewater treatment zzso zzso tests and zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the isolated strains belonged to zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out with zzso zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso was accompanied by the release of zzso in the culture broth with increase in zzso Total organic carbon analysis confirmed the extensive zzso of zzso The strain could degrade zzso zzso and zzso easily suggesting that the degradation zzso could involve these as possible zzso zzso zzso amplification of the zzso large zzso and the presence of high activity for zzso zzso in the crude cell zzso further confirmed that the degradation of zzso occurred through zzso zzso in strain zzso The strain zzso was found to degrade other zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso as zzso
