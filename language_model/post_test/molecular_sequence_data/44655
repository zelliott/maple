We isolated a complementary DNA zzso that zzso a zzso protein zzso from a zzso library of tobacco zzso zzso zzso cells zzso A comparison among deduced zzso acid sequences of plant zzso revealed the presence of a long zzso region within the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso Southern analysis revealed that tobacco zzso zzso is zzso by only a small number of copies of a gene in the tobacco zzso zzso of zzso zzso to an extract of tobacco zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso activity in zzso This result indicates that the level of zzso is a zzso factor for zzso zzso activity in zzso We subsequently succeeded in the functional zzso of zzso initiation of zzso that was associated with a plant promoter in a zzso plant zzso zzso of zzso expressed zzso zzso to a zzso zzso restored zzso activity, as did the addition of human zzso Moreover, heating of the zzso zzso eliminated its ability to restore zzso zzso It appears that the heat zzso of zzso was caused by the heat zzso of zzso in zzso
