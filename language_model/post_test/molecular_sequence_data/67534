zzso zzso and zzso constitute a family of zzso proteins widely distributed among zzso Both of them are able, under appropriate conditions, to convert zzso to zzso and induce zzso through the production of zzso oxygen species, a fundamental event in many immune zzso In zzso PO activity has been described and studied in both solitary and colonial species and the zzso is involved in inflammatory and zzso reactions against foreign cells or zzso and in the formation of the zzso zzso which zzso the zzso reaction of zzso zzso genes for two putative zzso zzso and zzso have been recently identified in zzso zzso In the present study, we determined the zzso sequences of two zzso proteins from two colonial zzso zzso zzso from the Mediterranean Sea and zzso zzso from zzso Multiple sequence alignments evidenced the similarity between the above sequences and zzso zzso whereas the analysis of the three-dimensional structure reveals high similarity with zzso zzso which share common precursors with zzso zzso zzso zzso grouped in the same cluster with zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso clustered with zzso zzso all of them share the full conservation of the six zzso at the two zzso sites as well as of other zzso also found in zzso zzso zzso involved in the regulation of zzso zzso In zzso zzso indicated that the genes are transcribed inside zzso cells, a characteristic zzso type in zzso where PO activity is located, at the beginning of their zzso These results represent a first attempt to identify candidate molecules responsible of the PO activity in compound zzso
