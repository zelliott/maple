zzso is a cell surface zzso of zzso that is implicated in the regulation of tumor growth and zzso zzso Transformation of colon zzso to zzso is associated with zzso of several zzso alternative zzso zzso The functional roles of zzso zzso in colon zzso tumor progression remain zzso zzso expression is zzso in colon zzso compared to paired normal zzso In the present study we demonstrate that zzso of zzso back into colon zzso cells by stable zzso reduces their in zzso growth rate and zzso zzso of several colon zzso cell lines and use of zzso zzso reveal that this in zzso and in zzso growth reduction requires the ability of zzso to bind zzso These observations indicate that the zzso zzso associated with transformation of zzso to colon zzso may provide the zzso cells with a growth zzso Furthermore, the reduction in tumor growth rate zzso by zzso of zzso into colon zzso cells is dependent on its ability to bind zzso
