Sex is determined in zzso by the zzso zzso which is located on the zzso region of the Y zzso Although the presence of zzso in zzso associated with male to female sex reversal clearly indicates that this gene is essential for zzso formation, little is known concerning other genes in this process or how the expression of zzso itself is zzso This is mainly due to the absence of an appropriate in zzso cellular zzso Previous studies have indicated that zzso coding sequences are undergoing rapid evolution in zzso In this study, we cloned and compared a Y zzso region immediately zzso to the zzso open reading frame in several zzso zzso The divergence of the region zzso to zzso between primates was found to be comparable with that described for zzso zzso An alignment of sequences within the zzso zzso together with sequences from the cow and zzso revealed the presence of several highly zzso zzso These zzso may have a function in the control of zzso expression during fetal zzso
