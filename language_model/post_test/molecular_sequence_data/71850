The ecologically diverse and zzso zzso zzso are a useful group for the study of marine zzso The zzso of the zzso is generally accepted, as is the zzso of most of the numerous species found along the West Coast of North zzso However, the zzso groupings that would help in the proposal and interpretation of various zzso schemes are poorly supported based on widely overlapping zzso zzso The use of genetic characters provides an alternative zzso In this study, we present the first quantitative analysis supporting the zzso of all 14 species of the zzso zzso among 54 zzso The structural features and evolution of the 750 zzso of the zzso b gene used to test the zzso were similar to those of other zzso Low levels of zzso sequence divergence zzso and zzso levels of zzso at zzso positions were found in the zzso The zzso of zzso was supported in extensive zzso analyses using distance, zzso and likelihood zzso Further corroboration was obtained from zzso and zzso statistical zzso
