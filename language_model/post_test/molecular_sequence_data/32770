zzso microbial communities are believed to be comprised of thousands of different bacterial zzso One prevailing idea is that zzso is everywhere, and the environment zzso zzso that all types of bacteria are present in all environments where their growth requirements are zzso We tested this hypothesis using zzso communities and type II zzso zzso zzso genes found in zzso collected from New Jersey and Uzbekistan zzso zzso zzso Terminal restriction zzso length zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and type II zzso genes was employed to determine community zzso The terminal zzso zzso in soil samples had a zzso distribution, indicating that the majority of zzso zzso and zzso pathways are present infrequently in the zzso Less than zzso of zzso were detected in more than 50% of samples, and as many as zzso of the fragments were unique and detected in only one zzso zzso zzso zzso fingerprints clustered by country of origin, indicating that unique populations are present in North America and Central zzso zzso analysis of type II zzso gene fragments cloned from zzso soil revealed 35 novel sequence zzso whose levels of identity to genes in the zzso database ranged from 68 to zzso The data indicate that zzso are zzso distributed but that distinct populations are present in North American and Central zzso These results have implications for microbial zzso and indicate that the cosmopolitan zzso species and zzso pathways may account for only a small proportion of the total diversity in zzso
