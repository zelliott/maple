Fusion genes have been reported as a means of enabling the development of novel or enhanced zzso In this report, we analyzed fusion genes in the zzso of two zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso and identified 32 fusion genes that are present as zzso in one strain zzso and are fused in the second zzso and zzso The mechanism for each case of gene fusion is zzso 28 out of 32 genes identified as fusion products in this analysis were reported as essential genes in the previously documented zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso This observation suggests the potential of the products of fusion genes as putative microbial drug zzso These results underscore the utility of bacterial zzso sequence comparisons for understanding gene evolution and for in zzso drug target identification in the zzso zzso
