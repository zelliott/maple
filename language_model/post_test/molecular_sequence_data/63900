Vitamin C zzso is present in the respiratory lining fluid of human zzso and local deficits occur during zzso zzso Here we report a unique function of vitamin C on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso a zzso zzso channel that regulates zzso surface fluid zzso Vitamin C zzso zzso induced the openings of zzso zzso channels by increasing its average open probability from 0 to zzso zzso zzso without a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso Exposure of the zzso airway surface to vitamin C zzso the zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso The average zzso zzso constant was zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso zzso When vitamin C was instilled into the zzso zzso of human subjects, it effectively activated zzso transport in zzso In zzso zzso previous treatment of the underlying trafficking zzso with zzso oxide or expression of zzso zzso restored the zzso of zzso transport by vitamin zzso zzso dependency and zzso sensitivity, as well as the expression of transcripts for zzso vitamin C zzso zzso and zzso support a model in which an zzso vitamin C zzso is central for relaying the effect of vitamin C to zzso We conclude that cellular vitamin C is a biological regulator of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The pool of vitamin C in the respiratory tract represents a potential zzso and pharmaceutical target for the complementary treatment of sticky airway zzso by enhancing zzso fluid zzso
