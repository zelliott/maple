zzso zzso is a newly identified zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso into highly ordered zzso within dynamic cell extensions such as zzso growth cone zzso We have isolated zzso and zzso clones of human retinal zzso and characterized the structure of the human retinal zzso gene zzso The zzso predicts a protein of zzso zzso acids and molecular mass zzso that shows zzso identity to bovine retinal zzso and zzso identity to human zzso zzso analysis reveals a consensus zzso acid response element and several potential binding sites for zzso factors zzso and zzso which zzso with the zzso expression of zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis and zzso clone sequencing indicate that the zzso gene lies within 200 zzso of the zzso gene zzso at zzso Database searches revealed that the human zzso gene zzso and zzso gene zzso at zzso also coexist within a zzso zzso zzso The close physical linkage of these zzso gene pairs suggests that they derive from a common gene zzso event and allows comparison of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, a possible link to the zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso at zzso zzso was excluded by demonstration of multiple independent segregation events in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified and will serve as useful markers in future linkage zzso The likely function of retinal zzso in light of known zzso roles in other cell types, is to assemble zzso zzso in support of zzso disk zzso
