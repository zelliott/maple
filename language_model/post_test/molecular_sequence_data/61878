The paradigm of zzso zzso zzso degradation zzso holds that zzso zzso and membrane proteins are zzso back to the zzso and zzso by the zzso in a coupled zzso zzso the degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso we found a divergence from this general zzso zzso zzso of the export in zzso loaded zzso brain zzso showed that the export was zzso by the zzso complex and required a zzso factor but was independent of zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso known so far, the exported zzso was zzso by both, a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso interference experiments in zzso cells identified the zzso of the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso The zzso clearance mechanism for zzso zzso represents an as yet unknown type of zzso which is not entirely dependent on the zzso
