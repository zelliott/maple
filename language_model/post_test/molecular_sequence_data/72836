Rapid flow of information in the nervous system involves zzso zzso recycling by zzso zzso an event triggered by the zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso expressed in the zzso cells, zzso discs, and the zzso Here we show its role in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso defines a zzso membrane structure to which the zzso zzso is zzso zzso is necessary for the formation of zzso pits and zzso in the zzso release of coated zzso from the membrane zzso Our results suggest an zzso control of the zzso cycle that maintains the balance between the amount of zzso and zzso zzso
