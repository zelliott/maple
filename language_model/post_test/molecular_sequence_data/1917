The distinct roles of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso the zzso responses to zzso are not completely zzso Although knockout animal experiments have been aiding to gain insight into zzso zzso additional information on the function of zzso and zzso will be provided by the application of zzso zzso zzso Based on the crystal structure of the zzso zzso binding domain and a zzso model of the zzso binding domain, we have designed zzso zzso that exploit the differences in size and flexibility of the two zzso binding zzso zzso predicted to bind zzso to either zzso or zzso were zzso and tested in zzso using zzso competition and zzso zzso This approach directly led to highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and potent zzso To unravel zzso roles of the two zzso in zzso experiments with rats were conducted using the zzso and zzso zzso in comparison to zzso The zzso zzso induced zzso growth, caused zzso effects, reduced zzso and zzso plasma levels, and increased zzso I, whereas the zzso zzso did not at all or only at high doses lead to such effects, despite high plasma zzso It can thus be concluded that zzso effects on the zzso zzso bone, and liver are primarily zzso via zzso zzso administration of the zzso and zzso zzso did not lead to an zzso of zzso effects on the zzso zzso and liver zzso
