Despite the severe ecological and economic damage caused by introduced species, factors that allow invaders to become successful often remain zzso Of invasive zzso zzso are among the most widespread and zzso zzso invasive zzso are often zzso forming zzso in which workers and queens mix freely among physically separate zzso By reducing costs associated with zzso zzso species can attain high worker zzso allowing them to achieve zzso zzso Here we examine the behavior and population zzso of the invasive Argentine zzso zzso zzso in its native and introduced zzso and we provide a mechanism to explain its success as an zzso Using zzso zzso we show that a population bottleneck has reduced the genetic diversity of introduced zzso This loss is associated with reduced zzso aggression among zzso separate zzso and leads to the formation of zzso dominant zzso In contrast, native populations are more genetically variable and exhibit pronounced zzso zzso Although reductions in genetic diversity are generally considered zzso these findings provide an example of how a genetic bottleneck can lead to widespread ecological zzso In addition, these results provide insights into the origin and evolution of zzso which is often considered a challenge to kin selection zzso
