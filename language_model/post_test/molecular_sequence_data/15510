Mixed zzso infections (a simultaneous presence of two or more zzso in the same zzso have long been suspected to represent an obstacle for recovering cultures that would faithfully represent original species zzso However, without the means to directly compare the zzso in the host and in culture, this would remain just a zzso Here we have used zzso zzso of spliced leader zzso gene repeats to zzso several novel species of insect zzso isolated from zzso hosts and to compare them with the zzso that had been detected in the gut zzso of the same zzso We have found that, whereas the original infections were dominated by some zzso zzso most of the respective zzso cultures contained novel species of zzso and zzso zzso we concluded that, in each case, this replacement was caused by differences in zzso properties between the original zzso zzso and the less fastidious zzso that was later recovered in zzso The properties of the new organisms, including their zzso and zzso as well as their zzso affinities within the family, were investigated and used to describe five novel zzso
