The yellow zzso pattern in zzso floral lip associated with red zzso and zzso zzso is an ideal model to study coordinate regulation of zzso zzso In this study, zzso analysis revealed that the red zzso in floral zzso was composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrary, these zzso were not detected in yellow lip zzso Four key genes involved in zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated and their expression patterns were zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that although they are active during floral development, zzso and zzso genes are specifically zzso in yellow lip zzso zzso with zzso and zzso genes into lip tissue driven by a zzso promoter, zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that transient expression of these two genes resulted in zzso production in yellow zzso Further analysis of a zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso revealed that although it is actively expressed during floral development, it is not expressed in yellow lip zzso zzso expression of zzso in lip zzso by zzso can also induce formation of red zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that differential expression of zzso is critical to determine the color pattern of floral organ in zzso zzso zzso
