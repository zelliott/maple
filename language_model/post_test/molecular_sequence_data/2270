zzso is a plasma protein inhibitor that can be grouped within a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso is a functional zzso of zzso found in a family with a high zzso of zzso zzso functional analysis has suggested that the zzso resides in the zzso site rather than in the zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso we have isolated the zzso from plasma using zzso zzso followed by zzso upon zzso to remove the normal zzso that is present (the zzso is zzso for the zzso The zzso protein was reduced, zzso and fragmented with zzso A pool zzso pool zzso containing the zzso site region was isolated by zzso high performance liquid zzso and zzso treated with zzso and zzso zzso Fast atom zzso zzso analysis of this zzso identified a novel zzso of mass zzso Four steps of zzso degradation together with further analysis by fast atom zzso zzso identified the zzso sequence of this zzso as zzso The mass of the novel zzso and its changing mass in response to zzso degradation are only compatible with its identity as zzso with the zzso site zzso replaced by zzso Using specific zzso zzso we demonstrated that the molecular zzso of zzso zzso is caused by a zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings may be of broad interest, as other members of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso contain zzso at their zzso sites and may be expected to undergo a similar zzso
