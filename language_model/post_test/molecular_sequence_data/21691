zzso zzso markers were developed in zzso zzso a desert shrub occurring widely in western China, to investigate its genetic diversity and population genetic zzso 

Using the combined zzso capture technique, 10 novel zzso zzso zzso primer sets were isolated and characterized in 90 individuals from six populations of zzso zzso Five to 14 zzso per locus were identified for these zzso zzso and expected zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso 

These zzso markers provide a useful tool to assess the genetic variation and population structure of zzso zzso
