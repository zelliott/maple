In a study of surface zzso but zzso zzso B virus zzso zzso patients, we were able to amplify and clone whole zzso zzso from the serum of a zzso zzso zzso showed that the patient zzso two different zzso zzso one of zzso A and the other of zzso D, with the zzso D zzso apparently zzso The surface zzso of the zzso A virus is heavily zzso especially in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso region, with several zzso that have not been previously zzso The zzso D virus is a zzso zzso Both zzso possess the common zzso double zzso of the zzso core promoter zzso and the zzso D virus is also zzso in the zzso zzso box zzso of the large surface zzso zzso Biological characterization showed that the zzso A zzso was fully zzso whereas the zzso D zzso zzso zzso The small surface zzso of the zzso A virus was only very zzso recognized by commercial zzso The small surface zzso of the zzso D virus could be recognized by the tests, but it was mainly retained within zzso cells, probably because of an excess of large surface zzso In conclusion, the cryptic nature of this double zzso infection is characterized by the predominance of the zzso zzso D virus over the zzso zzso A zzso
