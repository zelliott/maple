We identified a new zzso stand still zzso required in the female zzso for proper survival, sex determination and zzso Three strong zzso zzso were zzso The strongest zzso exhibited by zzso dissected from adult females is the complete absence of germ zzso In other zzso the few surviving germ cells frequently show a zzso typical of primary zzso zzso is not required either for fly viability or for male zzso zzso The gene was cloned and found to zzso a novel zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the female germ zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso and a closely localized gene are involved in the modification of the zzso zzso of the dominant zzso of zzso caused by zzso of region 49 zzso The similarity of the zzso zzso of zzso to that of zzso and zzso suggests that the three genes function in a common or in parallel pathways necessary in the female zzso for its survival, sex determination and zzso
