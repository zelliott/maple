zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso factors, activates zzso and zzso gene expression but also has a role in zzso cell differentiation and zzso zzso of zzso may therefore be of central importance in the function and zzso of human zzso zzso We have found evidence that, in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity are readily zzso in a series of human zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso protein extracts with two zzso sites from the human zzso gene promoter demonstrated the formation of several DNA zzso zzso zzso some of these could be accounted for by zzso zzso zzso activity was anticipated in zzso and zzso zzso but was also detected in a proportion of zzso zzso zzso that did not express zzso target zzso The data demonstrate the presence of zzso in a range of zzso zzso Different zzso generated slightly differing patterns of zzso activity, though zzso zzso and protein size appeared normal in all zzso so far zzso
