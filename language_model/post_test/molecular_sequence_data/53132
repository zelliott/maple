The zzso and zzso ( Bar ) zzso genes are zzso zzso which are required for the fate determination of external sensory zzso in the zzso By means of a zzso approach, we have identified in mouse and human two zzso genes highly related to the Bar zzso zzso zzso and zzso While zzso represents a novel zzso zzso turned out to zzso to the zzso zzso recently described in zzso We isolated and zzso the full-length mouse zzso and mapped both the human zzso and zzso genes to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso expression pattern by in zzso zzso revealed that this transcript is exclusively expressed in restricted zzso of the developing zzso which suggests that this zzso similar to its zzso counterparts zzso and zzso may play a crucial role in cell fate determination of neural zzso In particular, zzso showed specific zzso of expression in the zzso and in the zzso where it was found to be expressed in zzso cells giving rise to the zzso external zzso layer and to specific populations of zzso sensory zzso of the spinal zzso Thus, zzso function may be required for the generation of these specific zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the mapping assignment and the expression pattern make zzso an attractive zzso candidate gene for a form of zzso syndrome, a rare zzso anomaly of the zzso in zzso
