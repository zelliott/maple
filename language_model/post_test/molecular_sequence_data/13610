Genes for two forms of human zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a zzso library and zzso One zzso zzso is identical in length to human kidney zzso but differs from it by two bases in the coding region and differs slightly in the zzso and zzso zzso The second zzso zzso is nearly identical to these genes in the coding region, except that it has an extra zzso coding segment near the 3' end of this zzso This segment zzso to the zzso sequence of the 3' end of zzso 3 of human kidney zzso also differs significantly from zzso and human kidney zzso in a zzso sequence in the zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso and human kidney zzso are zzso forms of the same zzso Whether zzso is a zzso of these two is not certain, because of the significant differences in the coding and zzso zzso zzso may represent a different zzso
