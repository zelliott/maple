A full-length zzso of the accessory zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso has been zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso The zzso clone encodes a zzso with a deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and a predicted molecular mass of 41 zzso The gene zzso the beta zzso lies within 4 zzso pairs of that for the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso on the left arm of zzso zzso The two genes have similar structural features and share several common DNA sequence elements in their upstream regions, suggesting the possibility of coordinate zzso A human zzso zzso of the accessory zzso was identified, and its zzso sequence was zzso The human sequence encodes a zzso with a predicted molecular mass of 43 zzso that shows a high degree of zzso acid sequence similarity to the zzso beta zzso zzso rabbit zzso directed against the zzso zzso and accessory zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso coli, recognize specifically and zzso the native zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the physical association of the two zzso in the zzso zzso and identification of a human accessory zzso zzso provide evidence for a common zzso structure for animal zzso DNA zzso
