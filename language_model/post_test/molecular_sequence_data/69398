The zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso and its binding site on 23 S zzso zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso radical zzso to map the contacts between zzso and the backbone zzso in 23 S zzso and to investigate how this interaction is influenced by other zzso zzso zzso were characterized in both naked 23 S zzso and zzso from an zzso coli zzso strain, before and after zzso with zzso The protein protects 17 zzso between positions zzso and zzso in the naked 23 S zzso Within the zzso zzso also interacts with this zzso region, although the protection effects are subtly different and extend to zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex zzso binds to an adjacent site on the zzso protecting zzso at positions zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and increasing the accessibility of position zzso The overlap in the positions affected by zzso zzso and zzso and the increase in protection between positions zzso and zzso when they are bound at the same time, reflect the mutually cooperative nature of their interaction with the zzso The data support a model for the zzso zzso of the zzso region, in which two zzso structures fold so that the zzso lie in close zzso with the main zzso interactions of zzso within the minor groove of one of the zzso The zzso of the zzso interaction is modulated by zzso and other proteins within the zzso The antibiotics zzso and zzso inhibit the zzso functions of this region by zzso in between the accessible zzso and interacting with zzso zzso
