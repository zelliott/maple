zzso zzso T zzso zzso can be effective at controlling zzso in humans and zzso in zzso but their utility is partly offset by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso escape and zzso of escape zzso viruses upon transmission to zzso hosts can help us understand zzso viral control and the fitness cost extracted by immune escape zzso Traditional methods for following zzso escape and zzso are, however, insensitive to minor viral zzso We developed sensitive quantitative real-time zzso zzso to track the viral load of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and escape zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Rapid outgrowth of zzso virus occurs during the first few weeks of zzso However, the rate of escape zzso soon after, revealing a prolonged persistence of zzso zzso not zzso by standard cloning and sequencing zzso The rate of escape of zzso correlated with levels of zzso zzso zzso T cells present at that zzso Similarly, when zzso zzso zzso the restricting zzso zzso zzso were infected with zzso stock containing a mixture of zzso and zzso virus, rapid zzso to zzso was observed over the first 2 weeks following zzso However, the rate of zzso to zzso slowed dramatically over the first month of zzso The serial zzso of escape zzso viruses evolving during zzso infection shows that rapid dynamics of immune escape and zzso can be observed in early infection, particularly when zzso T cells are primed by zzso However, these early rapid rates of escape and zzso are transient and followed by a significant slowing in these rates later during infection, highlighting that the rate of escape is significantly influenced by the timing of its zzso
