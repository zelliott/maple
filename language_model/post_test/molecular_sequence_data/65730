zzso degradation is the only sustainable component of natural zzso in contaminated groundwater zzso yet its controls, especially in zzso zzso are still poorly zzso zzso putative spatial correlations between specific populations of key microbial players and the occurrence of respective degradation processes remain to be zzso We therefore characterized microbial community distribution across a high-resolution depth profile of a zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation depends mainly on zzso zzso We conducted zzso terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso and quantitative zzso of bacterial zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso to zzso the distribution of total zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso We show that a highly specialized zzso community of microbes related to known zzso iron and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso resides within the zzso zzso zone underneath the highly contaminated plume zzso This zone, where zzso compounds and zzso important electron zzso also harbors a surprisingly high abundance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the previously detected zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Lueders, zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that this zzso zzso zone is a hot spot of zzso zzso zzso These findings show that the distribution of specific zzso zzso and degradation processes in contaminated aquifers are tightly zzso which may be of value for the assessment and prediction of natural zzso based on intrinsic zzso zzso
