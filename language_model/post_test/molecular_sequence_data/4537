The zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso derived from the E founder zzso We identified a single zzso region (the zzso region, or zzso that is required for the production of the entire zzso zzso zzso In zzso lacking the zzso the E cell gives rise to zzso and zzso instead of zzso and appears to adopt the fate of its cousin, the C founder zzso zzso a gene from the zzso restores zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts are first zzso specifically in the E cell, consistent with a direct role for zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein is an apparent zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso As zzso factors have been implicated in zzso development in other animals, our findings suggest that zzso may be specified by zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso We propose that zzso the first zzso gene known to be involved in the zzso of germ layer and founder cell identity in zzso zzso may link maternal genes that regulate the establishment of the zzso to downstream genes responsible for zzso zzso
