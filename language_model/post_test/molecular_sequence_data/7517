The zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned using the zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 844 zzso acid zzso which is zzso to other known zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso functionally zzso the growth and zzso defects of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso In contrast, the growth zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso could not be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the interactions of zzso with precursor proteins and/or other components of bacterial zzso zzso are zzso within each zzso
