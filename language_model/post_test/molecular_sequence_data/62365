zzso novel strains of zzso were cultivated from coastal and zzso regions of the Pacific Ocean using zzso zzso methods that rely on dilution to extinction in very low zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso fell into five zzso zzso all of which contained zzso gene sequences reported previously from seawater environmental gene clone libraries zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of zzso reliability did not support collapsing these five zzso into a single zzso and they were therefore named the zzso marine zzso zzso zzso Twelve cultures chosen to represent the five zzso were successively zzso in liquid culture, and their growth characteristics were determined at different temperatures and dissolved organic carbon zzso The zzso in the zzso group were zzso diverse zzso and their zzso properties generally followed their zzso zzso None of the zzso in the zzso group formed colonies on low- or zzso zzso upon their first isolation from seawater, while 7 of 12 zzso that were zzso for laboratory testing eventually produced colonies on zzso zzso zzso The zzso grew relatively slowly in natural seawater media zzso to zzso zzso and none of them grew in zzso media zzso zzso of C zzso The zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso zzso many of them were of zzso size zzso zzso zzso This zzso study revealed that sporadically detected zzso gene clones from seawater are part of a zzso diverse constellation of organisms mainly composed of zzso and zzso lineages that are zzso under specific zzso zzso
