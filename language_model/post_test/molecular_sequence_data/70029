According to restriction site analyses of zzso DNA, zzso zzso shows a zzso that consists of two frequent zzso that are evenly distributed all over the Old World and several rare zzso never present in more than one zzso To ascertain the causes responsible for such distribution, three different zzso fragments from zzso I and II sampled in a population from zzso have been partially zzso Only three silent zzso changes have been detected in the zzso zzso One of them implies the loss of the zzso restriction site, which zzso zzso I from zzso zzso On the basis of these results as well as on others involving the geographic distribution of zzso I and II, they can be considered zzso zzso The sequencing study has been zzso with the analysis of zzso zzso between zzso zzso and different nuclear zzso in four zzso zzso zzso As expected, no significant zzso zzso have been found between zzso I and zzso Moreover, when zzso I and II were pooled and compared with the rare, endemic zzso similar results were zzso
