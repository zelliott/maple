The structural basis of zzso channel zzso by G proteins has received considerable attention recently, and multiple regions on zzso channels that interact with G protein zzso have been zzso We have demonstrated previously that a region extending from the N zzso to the zzso loop of the zzso channel is involved in determining the differences between zzso and zzso zzso channels with respect to zzso by G zzso Here we explore this region of the channel in greater detail in an effort to further define the regions involved in determining zzso zzso zzso channels constructed from zzso and zzso zzso channels revealed that the N zzso the zzso loop, and domain I all play an important role in determining zzso We identified a zzso acid zzso from domain I that mediates the effects of domain I, and a zzso acid zzso from the zzso loop that mediates the effects of the zzso zzso When these regions from zzso were exchanged into zzso zzso identical with that of zzso was zzso The differences between zzso and zzso in the identified region of domain I involve zzso that are predicted to be almost exclusively zzso zzso to some of the zzso G protein binding regions of zzso zzso interaction domain, zzso and a zzso zzso binding zzso caused relatively little change in zzso which suggests that these sites are not necessary individually for G zzso zzso and may help to explain the small effects of exchanging these regions in zzso
