The zzso zzso zzso B was zzso to zzso in its zzso form from zzso zzso The zzso protocol included zzso exchange, zzso interaction and zzso zzso The zzso was found to have a molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso There was a differential effect of temperature on the zzso and zzso activities of the zzso zzso The zzso activity had an optimum of 45 degrees C, and zzso 60 degrees zzso Both activities had an optimum pH of zzso although the zzso had a secondary peak at zzso Both activities were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso but inhibited by zzso zzso The zzso was found to have a broad zzso zzso Using zzso as zzso and a temperature of 45 degrees C, the zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso U zzso zzso The zzso when zzso against zzso zzso and a temperature of 60 degrees C had zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso U zzso zzso The zzso was very stable at 45 degrees C, but rapidly zzso at 60 degrees zzso
