We have zzso cloned and zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso zzso and two zzso with defective zzso activity isolated for resistance to zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso has suffered a zzso deletion which reduces the size of zzso to 180 zzso The other zzso zzso has an zzso to zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso This zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence of a domain involved in binding zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso thus appears to be essential for the activity of the zzso of zzso
