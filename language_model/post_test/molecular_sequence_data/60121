The DNA binding domain of zzso protein was studied with various zzso deletion zzso proteins and identified by gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was shown from gel zzso zzso that DNA binding affinity of the zzso proteins relative to that of native zzso falls in the range from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso whereas it was much weaker for zzso Thus, the DNA binding domain was defined to be the region from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso and those of medium ranges revealed that the region of zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso forms a long stretch of zzso flexible chain, and also showed that the structure of the zzso region zzso zzso in zzso zzso was nearly identical to that of zzso zzso and zzso chemical shift zzso induced by complex formation of zzso with an zzso duplex zzso demonstrated that two loop regions, zzso zzso zzso and zzso play an essential role in DNA zzso
