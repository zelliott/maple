The zzso family of zzso is highly zzso throughout evolution and functions in zzso control of life span, zzso and many other cellular zzso Since the discovery of the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso there has been a flurry of activity aiming to uncover the mode of zzso binding and zzso zzso and zzso studies have led to several proposed reaction mechanisms, yet the exact zzso steps remain zzso Here we present in zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso that shed light on the mechanism of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso reaction proceeds via an initial zzso mechanism with the direct formation of an zzso zzso zzso studies further suggest that zzso zzso the zzso reaction in a biologically relevant zzso Through zzso and kinetic analyses of point zzso we also clarify the role of several zzso core domain zzso in zzso zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso and zzso These findings bring us a few steps closer to understanding zzso activity and may provide a useful platform for the design of zzso zzso for analysis of zzso function and possibly therapeutic zzso
