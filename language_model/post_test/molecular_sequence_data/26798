zzso DNA sequences have the ability to fold into zzso structures called zzso and are considered as promising zzso zzso Although the zzso structure is composed of quartets and zzso zzso in the zzso it is also flanked on each side by numerous zzso The effect of loop length and composition on zzso zzso and stability has been well investigated in the past, but the effect of zzso bases on zzso stability and zzso duplex competition has not been zzso We have studied in detail the effect of zzso bases on zzso stability and on duplex formation by the zzso in the presence of complementary strands using the zzso sequence located in the promoter region of the zzso zzso The results obtained from CD, zzso difference spectrum and zzso melting demonstrated the effect of zzso bases on zzso structure and zzso With the increase in flank zzso the increase in the more favorable zzso is accompanied by a striking increase in the zzso zzso which resulted in a decrease in the overall zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, CD, zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the propensity to attain zzso structure decreases with increasing flank zzso
