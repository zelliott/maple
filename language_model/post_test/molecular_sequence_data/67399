zzso are soluble carbohydrates with health benefits and possible roles in plant zzso zzso zzso genes were isolated using comparative zzso and physical mapping followed by zzso sequencing in zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were clustered together with multiple copies of zzso zzso genes and a zzso element on two barley zzso zzso structures of the genes were zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso in the zzso showed that the zzso zzso genes may have evolved from zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso was performed using leaf zzso extracted from three wheat zzso grown under different zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes had correlated expression patterns in our wheat experiment and in existing barley zzso zzso Single zzso zzso zzso markers were developed and successfully mapped to a major zzso region affecting wheat grain zzso zzso in two independent wheat zzso The zzso controlling zzso and low- zzso in parental lines were also found to be associated in zzso production in a diverse set of 128 wheat zzso To the zzso knowledge, this is the first report on the mapping and sequencing of a zzso zzso gene cluster and in particular, the isolation of a novel zzso gene from zzso
