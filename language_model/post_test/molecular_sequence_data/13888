To evaluate the potential for regulation of the insulin zzso zzso zzso we have cloned the mouse zzso zzso identified its promoter, and analyzed promoter activity in the zzso state and in response to zzso The zzso of the mouse zzso gene lacks typical zzso and zzso boxes but contains nine potential zzso binding sites consistent with a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene also has significant regions of zzso with the promoters of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth factor I zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso start sites were identified zzso zzso zzso upstream from the start zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso promoter activity was present in the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso Within this region, there were zzso pair and zzso pair negative regulatory elements at zzso zzso and zzso zzso surrounded by positive zzso By gel shift zzso a nuclear factor was identified in zzso cells which binds to zzso and zzso sequence in the negative regulatory element and appears to be distinct from zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was due to a decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso with no change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso protein by approximately zzso within 9 h but did so without altering zzso zzso levels or zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, both insulin and zzso zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso with insulin this is probably due to an effect on protein zzso whereas with zzso the effect is due to a change in the zzso of zzso zzso
