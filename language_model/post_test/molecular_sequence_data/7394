zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a protein zzso zzso with structural and functional similarities to zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso family zzso Here we describe the structure of the zzso gene and characterize the pattern of zzso zzso zzso and a closely related zzso nervous tissue and zzso zzso zzso are assembled by selective use of two of the zzso zzso of zzso was found to be restricted primarily to the brain, zzso and zzso exhibit a different expression profile in the developing mouse zzso The expression of the zzso zzso and mature zzso increase zzso while the expression of zzso decreases with zzso Our results thus show that despite their structural and functional similarities, zzso and zzso differ markedly in their patterns of zzso
