The zzso activity of zzso zzso was evaluated as potential zzso zzso using relevant in zzso zzso 

zzso were tested in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and against replication competent zzso in zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso T zzso zzso activity was evaluated in an zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed 50% effective concentration zzso values of zzso zzso against a zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso Higher activity was found for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between 15 and 30 zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between 107 and 377 zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso that targeted the zzso cavity on zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highly active, with zzso values as low as 2 zzso for zzso All zzso showed high activity against zzso or zzso zzso zzso B and zzso zzso Many early zzso compounds were much less active against zzso C zzso whereas zzso compounds that targeted the zzso cavity were very active against all zzso including zzso zzso In zzso T cell zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso values ranged between 13 and zzso zzso depending on the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso again being the most zzso zzso the latter compounds completely prevented viral replication by treating the cultures from 2 h before until 24 h after infection, at zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

These novel zzso zzso might constitute a promising class of zzso zzso
