zzso zzso disease is the most common form of inherited motor and sensory zzso Based on zzso and zzso criteria CMT has been zzso into two main zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, it is genetically zzso with zzso dominant, zzso zzso zzso and zzso modes of zzso Thus far, seven genes have been identified in association with the zzso zzso zzso We hereby report our clinical and molecular genetic findings in a zzso family with zzso 

Two young sisters with zzso and other zzso family members were clinically and zzso evaluated and then molecular genetic investigation was carried out in order to identify the zzso zzso 

Following an initial indication for linkage of the family to the zzso locus on zzso 8, we zzso the zzso zzso protein 1 zzso gene and identified a single zzso deletion in zzso 3 that is associated with zzso in the zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso that is associated with zzso in a zzso family of Iranian descent with two affected young girls and a history in other members of the zzso
