In many respects zzso are much more like zzso than zzso with respect to the conservation of many of the components involved in transcription, translation and DNA zzso So far, only a few DNA zzso with structures similar to those of zzso DNA zzso a have been found in zzso The identification and characterization of all the DNA zzso of one zzso would add considerably to our knowledge of the basic mechanisms of DNA replication in these zzso 

We have identified a novel DNA zzso composed of two zzso zzso and zzso with molecular weights of zzso Da and zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and have cloned the corresponding genes which are zzso arranged on the zzso zzso No significant sequence zzso was found between these two proteins and other known DNA zzso The pol genes were transcribed as part of a single zzso that additionally contained genes zzso to the zzso and zzso family of zzso We zzso the zzso DNA zzso from zzso coli strains expressing the cloned genes and characterized its zzso It possesses strong 3' zzso zzso zzso activity and has a zzso preference which is characteristic of a zzso DNA zzso 

In zzso zzso we identified a second DNA zzso zzso by two zzso neither of which display significant zzso to any other known DNA zzso Both the zzso properties of the zzso and the gene organization raise the possibility that this zzso might be the zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso
