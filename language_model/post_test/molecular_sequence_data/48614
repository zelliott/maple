Under natural zzso plants and algae have evolved various zzso zzso mechanisms in response to the constantly changing light zzso The state transition and long-term response processes in zzso zzso involve zzso and composition zzso of zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso named zzso has been found to have pivotal roles in both state transition and long-term zzso Here we report the crystal structures of the zzso domain of a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso form and in complex with various zzso zzso zzso adopts a zzso protein zzso fold and contains all the essential zzso at the active zzso A novel hairpin zzso found to be a zzso feature of the zzso family and indispensable for the zzso stability, interacts with the zzso loop and fixes it in an active zzso We have also demonstrated that zzso is a zzso city zzso that zzso both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, preliminary in zzso data suggest that it might be capable of zzso a consensus zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The potential zzso zzso binding site is predicted based on the location of a zzso contributed by the adjacent zzso within the zzso zzso The structural and zzso data presented here provide a framework for an improved understanding on the role of zzso in zzso zzso
