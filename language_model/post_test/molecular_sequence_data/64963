zzso zzso synthesis during growth on methanol by zzso zzso has been considered to play a role in zzso zzso An zzso that zzso zzso zzso synthesis was zzso from zzso zzso and was suggested to belong to a family of alcohol zzso zzso In this study we report the gene cloning and gene disruption analysis of three zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in order to clarify the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso From the primary structures of these three zzso zzso was shown to be zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Gene products of zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli showed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso analyses suggested that zzso zzso synthesis was mainly zzso by a zzso zzso zzso and this zzso contributed to zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso during growth on methanol by zzso zzso
