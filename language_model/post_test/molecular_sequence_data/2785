Two zzso zzso regions were identified downstream of the zzso gene constant zzso One of these regions is located at the site of a putative zzso element and was observed only in T cell lines and not in cell lines derived from other zzso The other zzso region was also detected only in T cell lines but only in those expressing zzso zzso Thus, the first region is probably tissue specific, while the second region is probably tissue and stage zzso The DNA sequence of the second zzso zzso region revealed several stretches of zzso that are characteristic of consensus sequences for regulatory zzso These results, together with the observations in transgenic mice that indicate a requirement for two distinct regions for optimal zzso gene zzso suggest the presence of at least two regulatory regions downstream of the zzso zzso one is an zzso region and the other is a zzso related regulatory zzso The zzso specificity of these zzso zzso regions supports the notion that changes in zzso structure control zzso gene zzso
