The zzso sequence of the 3' terminal zzso zzso zzso of tobacco zzso virus zzso zzso 2 has been zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein localized the zzso protein gene between zzso zzso and zzso (from the 3' zzso of this zzso The zzso zzso site that is processed to liberate the zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso was identified as zzso The predicted translation product from the gene is a 477 zzso acid long zzso with a calculated zzso of 53 zzso The gene was modified at the zzso end to facilitate zzso and to provide it with a zzso initiation zzso The modified gene was zzso transcribed in zzso and expressed in a rabbit zzso zzso translation system, where it directed the synthesis of a 53 zzso zzso zzso analyses of the secondary structure of the zzso protein predicted the presence of three beta sheet zzso which suggests that this zzso zzso may be structurally analogous to those of the zzso and zzso These and other results from computer analyses of the zzso acid and zzso acid zzso and comparisons with the zzso proteins of zzso and other related viruses are zzso
