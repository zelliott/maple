We have identified a zzso protein zzso with highly unusual properties zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in a zzso protein of 28 zzso but the 18 zzso native protein was not zzso The zzso zzso does not facilitate degradation of zzso zzso by zzso A, although it does inhibit zzso D zzso Lack of the former activity might be explained by the absence of a domain implicated in binding to zzso In addition, and contrary to data on the human zzso the zzso zzso does not inhibit zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso in zzso but actually enhances zzso zzso
