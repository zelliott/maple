Chicken zzso H is a zzso zzso possessing zzso as well as zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso exhibits molecular masses of 400 zzso on gel zzso and 52 zzso on zzso indicating that it consists of eight zzso with the same molecular zzso In the current study, we cloned the zzso for the zzso zzso of chicken zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso H gene consists of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso protein consistent with the molecular mass determined on zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence contains all the partial sequences determined for the zzso zzso The sequence is similar to that of the zzso zzso of rabbit zzso which has been partially zzso The zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso cells exhibited both zzso and zzso activities, which were inhibited by zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso H in zzso cells was also recognized on zzso This gene is the first one for zzso H in an animal tissue whose sequence has been completely zzso
