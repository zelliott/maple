zzso is an abundant zzso zzso zzso capable of binding to both zzso sequences and to the upstream regions of a number of nuclear genes coding for zzso proteins zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso binding sites conform to the consensus zzso an element also present in the binding sites of factors designated zzso and zzso These factors act as zzso of the zzso zzso of the genes for zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso We now present evidence that zzso zzso and zzso are probably the same zzso We speculate that one of the functions of zzso is the adjustment of the expression of a number of gene families to cell growth zzso
