In a manual sequence alignment experiment we accidentally observed that the locust zzso hormone zzso zzso peptides zzso which are peptides contained in the zzso display sequence similarity with human growth zzso factor zzso So far, a counterpart for zzso either structurally or zzso has not yet been reported in any zzso This could give new insights into the origin of the zzso zzso as it would mean that in some zzso zzso the structural zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are located on the same zzso No function could as yet be attributed to zzso although these zzso occur abundantly in the zzso zzso a zzso organ from which many zzso are zzso zzso similar to zzso a role as releasing factor may be zzso for zzso
