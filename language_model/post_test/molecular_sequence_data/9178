To identify zzso zzso of major zzso cell marker genes and zzso them to determine whether zzso cells are present among the dense zzso of zzso that surround the zzso cup structures of the horse zzso during early zzso 

zzso zzso were developed to detect the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was detected in zzso isolated from zzso using standard zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and products were cloned and zzso Absolute real-time zzso was used to zzso gene expression in total, zzso and zzso peripheral zzso and invasive zzso zzso surrounding the zzso cups zzso of five zzso in early pregnancy were isolated and zzso marker gene expression levels were zzso by quantitative zzso 

Absolute zzso transcript numbers were determined by performing quantitative zzso and comparing values to zzso standards of known zzso 

zzso gene expression in peripheral zzso zzso was higher than in zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in the zzso population, and no significant differences were detected for zzso and zzso between the two zzso zzso of all four zzso cell markers was significantly higher in zzso isolated from the zzso cups of pregnant zzso compared to zzso isolated from the same animal on the same day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data provide the first evidence for the expression of major zzso cell markers by horse cells and an enrichment of zzso cells in the zzso zzso during zzso
