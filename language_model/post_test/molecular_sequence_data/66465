zzso zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso deliver multiple zzso proteins into plant cells during zzso It is hypothesized that certain plant and zzso zzso proteins need to traverse the type III zzso system unfolded and are delivered into host cells as inactive zzso We have previously identified zzso as the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is a zzso zzso zzso are general folding zzso and possess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate the mechanism of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso activity were unable to activate zzso Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance zzso revealed a structural change in zzso from an unfolded to a folded state in the presence of zzso Using in zzso binding zzso zzso consensus binding sequence was identified as zzso a motif present at four sites within zzso The zzso motifs are located in close proximity to zzso zzso zzso and are required for zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso These data suggest that after delivery into the plant cell during infection, zzso binds zzso at four sites and properly folds the zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso
