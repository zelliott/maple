The zzso plays an essential role in zzso regulatory networks in both zzso and zzso In zzso zzso class 1 zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso act in the zzso and control growth rates and zzso cycle zzso while class 2 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso are characterized by zzso that suppress the slow growth of class 1 zzso zzso This study revealed that zzso gene controls zzso defense and zzso color, confirming that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso the only zzso hormone alpha zzso in zzso zzso and was expressed in certain zzso Furthermore, zzso bound to another zzso protein zzso which belongs to a family of zzso and zzso zzso A zzso deletion zzso partially suppressed the short zzso cycle periods of class 1 zzso zzso and this effect was enhanced by zzso zzso Thus, zzso acts as a signaling zzso for the neural control of zzso functions, which is achieved in a functional network involving class 1 and class 2 zzso genes as well as zzso These results are zzso to studies of zzso hormone signaling in higher zzso
