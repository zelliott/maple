zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso are members of the transforming growth zzso family of growth and differentiation factors that induce signaling in target cells by assembling type II and type I receptors at the cell zzso zzso zzso involved in type II binding are located predominantly in the zzso region that forms an extended zzso whereas zzso involved in type I binding are located in the zzso and preceding loop central portion of the zzso To test whether the central zzso are sufficient to determine specificity toward type I zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed in which the central zzso zzso of zzso A were replaced with corresponding zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso were assessed for zzso type II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity as well as zzso properties toward zzso A and zzso zzso zzso retained Act zzso binding affinity comparable with wild type zzso A, whereas zzso zzso showed a slightly reduced affinity toward Act zzso Both the zzso were devoid of significant zzso zzso in zzso cells in the A3 zzso reporter zzso up to zzso zzso higher than the minimal effective zzso A concentration zzso 4 zzso In contrast, these zzso showed zzso activity in a zzso zzso in zzso cells as well as induced zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing alkaline zzso Furthermore, both the zzso activated zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso Also, both the zzso antagonized zzso that signal via zzso type II zzso such as zzso A and zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso in the central region determine its specificity toward type I zzso zzso zzso can be useful in the study of zzso zzso and zzso of transforming growth zzso members, zzso and zzso
