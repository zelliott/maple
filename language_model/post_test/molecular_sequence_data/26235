zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from goose zzso through molecular zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The protein has a molecular mass zzso by zzso gel zzso of 17 zzso in contrast to 10 zzso found for the zzso zzso Complete zzso acid sequence (131 zzso has been determined mainly through zzso or zzso zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso isolated by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sequences have been established by zzso degradation or action of zzso Y, respectively, applied on the native zzso Goose zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso previously identified in the zzso It appears that in zzso zzso namely birds and zzso the zzso processing of the zzso involves only one zzso releasing the hormone zzso and a zzso zzso with two zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the avian protein with its zzso and zzso counterparts reveals that the first half of the zzso chain is zzso much less variable than the second and that the goose protein resembles the zzso protein much more than the zzso zzso
