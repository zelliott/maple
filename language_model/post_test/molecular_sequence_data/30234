We have devised a method to follow the stability of individual zzso zzso complexes containing zzso coli zzso zzso halted at many different sites along a DNA template during the zzso zzso Studies of complexes formed with zzso zzso DNA templates reveal at least three general classes of zzso complexes that differ dramatically in their zzso zzso of one sort zzso zzso are highly stable to zzso and zzso under a variety of solution zzso They remain intact and active for up to 24 hours even in salt zzso up to 1 zzso This suggests that they are stabilized to a significant extent by zzso interactions between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso We consider these to be the normal complexes formed during zzso chain zzso zzso of a second sort zzso zzso zzso zzso releasing free zzso transcripts and active zzso zzso The rate of zzso is substantially enhanced by elevated zzso of zzso hence the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso acids in these complexes is stabilized predominantly by zzso zzso However, release complexes are stabilized by zzso zzso of zzso which as been implicated in stabilization of the binding of zzso to free zzso zzso These complexes are formed at DNA sequences that we refer to as release zzso Analysis of DNA sequences at release sites reveals that all share a common feature, the potential to form an zzso hairpin in the region just upstream from the actual 3' end of the released zzso zzso incorporating zzso in the transcript and blocking potential hairpin formation with DNA zzso support a direct role for an zzso hairpin in triggering the release zzso Changes in the zzso DNA sequences generally have little effect on the presence or rate of the release reaction, although there are significant zzso The results suggest that the presence of certain zzso zzso in the region six to ten zzso upstream from the transcript growing point can trigger a substantial structural transition in the zzso zzso complex, forming a zzso zzso complex from which transcript zzso is zzso This release, mode complex may be a central intermediate in zzso chain zzso A final class of complexes zzso zzso appear to be zzso complexes that have entered a state or zzso that is stable, but is blocked in zzso the normal zzso zzso Such complexes bear active zzso zzso and can be zzso after limited zzso The structural elements that determine the formation of dead-end complexes are not yet zzso
