The three zzso element zzso binding protein zzso family members have been ascribed different functions in gene zzso They were therefore examined with various zzso molecular zzso and cell biological tests to evaluate whether their sequence differences reflect functional zzso or neutral changes at zzso zzso Each zzso displayed a characteristic profile of intrinsic zzso zzso and repression, binding with protein partners, and zzso zzso Although some differences, such as weakened zzso nuclear zzso were predictable from primary sequence differences, the unexpected failure of zzso to bind the zzso zzso zzso was traced to seemingly conservative zzso within a small patch of an zzso zzso The zzso strength and the zzso strength of the zzso were in the opposite zzso Despite their distinguishing features and differential activities, the zzso traffic to shared zzso sites and regulate many common target zzso including zzso Though a variety of functions have been attributed to the zzso based upon their panel of shared and unique features, we propose that they constitute a molecular regulatory kit that tunes the expression of shared targets through a common zzso
