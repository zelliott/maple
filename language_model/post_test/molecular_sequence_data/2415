The zzso type 1 vaccine strain of zzso is probably the safest and most successful zzso vaccine virus used in zzso Its widespread use since the early 1960s has contributed significantly to the virtual zzso of zzso in developed zzso We have reported previously the construction of an zzso zzso zzso of zzso based on the zzso 1 strain, and proposed that this virus could be modified to express on its surface zzso zzso from other zzso We describe here the construction and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso containing an zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso In zzso zzso experiments, the virus zzso inhibited zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso and significantly reduced the group specific zzso activity of zzso human zzso zzso zzso raised by subcutaneous injection of the zzso zzso in zzso was shown to be specific for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and by western zzso Moreover, the zzso neutralized a wide range of American and African zzso zzso and also inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso zzso against the zzso derived regions of the zzso also neutralized zzso These results establish the potential of using zzso for the presentation of foreign zzso and suggest that zzso 1 zzso zzso could offer an approach to the development of an zzso zzso
