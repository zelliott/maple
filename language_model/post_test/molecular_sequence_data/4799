zzso zzso is a member of the transforming growth factor beta zzso of zzso growth and differentiation factors that is essential for proper regulation of skeletal muscle mass in zzso Here we report the myostatin sequences of nine other zzso species and the identification of zzso in the coding sequence of bovine myostatin in two breeds of zzso zzso Belgian Blue and zzso which are known to have an increase in muscle mass relative to conventional zzso The Belgian Blue myostatin sequence contains an zzso deletion in the third zzso which causes a zzso that eliminates virtually all of the mature, active region of the zzso The zzso myostatin sequence contains a zzso zzso in zzso 3, resulting in a substitution of zzso for an zzso zzso in the mature region of the zzso The similarity in zzso of zzso cattle and myostatin zzso mice suggests that myostatin performs the same biological function in these two species and is a potentially useful target for genetic manipulation in other farm zzso
