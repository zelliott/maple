zzso the characteristic zzso acid of zzso and zzso proteins in animals, is also found in certain zzso proteins in plants but has been believed to be absent from viral and bacterial zzso We report here on the cloning and characterization from a zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso Chlorella zzso of a zzso zzso which shows distinct sequence similarity to the zzso half of the zzso alpha zzso of animal zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, was found to be a soluble zzso and to zzso both zzso and zzso the standard zzso of animal and plant zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides such as zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso repeats coded by the viral zzso also served as zzso zzso was a particularly good zzso with a zzso of 20 zzso The zzso in both positions in this repeat were zzso those preceding the zzso being zzso more zzso The data strongly suggest that zzso zzso Chlorella zzso expresses proteins in which many zzso become zzso to zzso by a novel viral zzso zzso
