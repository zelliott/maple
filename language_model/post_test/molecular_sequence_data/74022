We determined the zzso sequence of the first zzso base pairs in the zzso control region from 74 zzso zzso zzso collected in the zzso zzso We detected four zzso sites that defined five zzso two of which were found in single zzso The same DNA sequence was characterized in an additional 353 specimens by zzso with two restriction zzso In this manner each zzso could be assigned to one of the three most common zzso The zzso diversity for the total sample (as well as the zzso zzso was estimated as zzso and zzso genetic distances between zzso ranged from zzso The low zzso diversity and the low average zzso genetic distance between zzso suggest a recent expansion in abundance from a small founding zzso Despite the low degree of variation, zzso of the common zzso differed markedly between zzso The results indicate isolation, even between geographically close areas, as well as zzso to specific summer and autumn feeding zzso zzso within a presumed single breeding ground suggests mixing of pods with different zzso zzso
