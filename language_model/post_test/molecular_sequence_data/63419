Human zzso 7, a major zzso of human skin, has been zzso directly in its native zzso in zzso coli by forcing the zzso of the newly zzso zzso into the bacterial zzso The procedure yields a stable zzso 7 with highly specific activity that is inhibited efficiently by its specific inhibitor zzso domain zzso The protein was zzso and its three-dimensional structure was solved in the absence of zzso zzso The structure obtained agrees with that reported recently for human tissue zzso 7 zzso in the presence of zzso zzso from a preparation obtained in a zzso protein expression zzso A model of the interaction between the zzso and its inhibitor is proposed on the basis of both the three-dimensional structure of human tissue zzso 7 reported here and that of the zzso domain 6 solved previously by zzso
