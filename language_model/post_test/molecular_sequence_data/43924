A clone that can complement both zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso was found among plasmids containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso acid zzso The regions upstream and downstream of the zzso gene were zzso Two zzso frames zzso and zzso which were similar to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso were found upstream of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso Since zzso had no zzso to zzso the gene was designated zzso The zzso genes appeared to be within the same zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso three zzso frames were zzso One of these, transcribed in the same direction as the zzso zzso was identical to be the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso The other two zzso zzso located between the zzso and zzso zzso were transcribed zzso and their deduced zzso acid sequences showed similarities to a zzso transport protein and a zzso regulatory protein zzso The two genes may thus be involved in hem transport and the regulation of hem gene expression respectively, and were tentatively named zzso and zzso Although zzso and zzso are unlikely to be part of the same zzso zzso are clustered on the zzso zzso zzso
