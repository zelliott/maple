zzso hormone receptors zzso expressed in the zzso of zzso species of zzso are unique in lacking the zzso zzso tail characteristic of zzso of zzso zzso and other G zzso zzso To further investigate evolutionary relationships among zzso zzso a zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso the Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso We have determined the pharmacological characteristics and zzso zzso of this zzso from an early evolved, zzso species of zzso and compared it with the corresponding receptors in zzso species of zzso and zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein from the zzso zzso has high zzso with the other zzso zzso zzso zzso and, in common with other zzso lacks an zzso zzso zzso The zzso selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells, assessed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso was similar to that of the other zzso zzso and distinct from those of the zzso zzso The pharmacological characteristics of the zzso zzso were similar to those of other zzso zzso for a selection of zzso (including naturally occurring zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was slightly more rapid than that of the human zzso while the zzso zzso of the chicken zzso in which a zzso zzso tail is present, was considerably more zzso In terms of the evolution of the zzso in zzso the zzso (a zzso zzso zzso has a striking zzso in both structure and pharmacological zzso to zzso in zzso zzso which are quite distinct from the zzso zzso zzso and are unique among G zzso receptors in lacking an zzso zzso zzso The distinct structure of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is likely to have important functional consequences in the zzso physiology of zzso
