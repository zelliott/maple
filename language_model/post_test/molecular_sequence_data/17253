zzso are important zzso receptors in all zzso that transmit zzso change zzso across the zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso form a head and two long legs in the zzso and span the zzso Here, we define with crystal structures the atomic basis for zzso regulation of the zzso and affinity for zzso of the zzso zzso and how zzso zzso bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso I domain alters three metal binding sites, associated zzso and zzso and zzso zzso displacement of the zzso causes a 62 degrees zzso between the zzso I and hybrid zzso zzso through the zzso connected zzso zzso domain in the upper zzso leg causes a 70 A separation between the knees of the alpha and beta zzso zzso in the head thus zzso interaction between the legs in a previously described zzso bent zzso zzso and leg extension positions the zzso head far above the cell zzso
