zzso is a lung cancer zzso and zzso zzso show marked therapeutic efficacy for tumors harboring this fusion zzso It remains unsettled, however, how the fusion gene should be detected in specimens other than zzso zzso zzso We here tested whether reverse zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso is a sensitive and reliable zzso 

We developed a multiplex zzso system to capture zzso fusion transcripts and applied this technique to our zzso nationwide cohort of zzso cell lung cancer zzso in zzso 

During February to December 2009, we collected 916 specimens from zzso patients, quality filtering of which yielded zzso specimens of primary zzso from zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso with our zzso system identified zzso transcripts in 36 samples zzso from 32 individuals zzso The zzso products were detected in specimens including zzso washing fluid zzso zzso zzso tumor biopsy zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso were zzso with those of sensitive zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was confirmed to be a reliable technique for detection of zzso fusion zzso We propose that diagnostic tools for zzso should be selected in a manner dependent on the available zzso zzso FISH and sensitive zzso should be applied to zzso zzso zzso but multiplex zzso is appropriate for other zzso zzso
