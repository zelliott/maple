A zzso study of the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso H domain was performed to provide information about its structure and mechanism of zzso These efforts resulted in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso H lacking the putative zzso C zzso The zzso resolution structure resembles the known structures of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso The structure revealed the coordination of a zzso zzso within the zzso core comprised of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surface charge mapping of the zzso structure revealed a high density of basic charges on one side of the zzso Using a model of the zzso structure superimposed upon a structure of zzso reverse zzso bound to an zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso H secondary structures and individual zzso acids were examined for their potential roles in binding zzso zzso regions included zzso zzso H zzso zzso and zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso and its following zzso Most of the identified zzso zzso corresponded with zzso directly binding zzso in an zzso H from zzso zzso as observed in a zzso structure with zzso Finally, zzso of zzso H of zzso zzso coli, and zzso revealed that a loop of the zzso connection domain resides within the same region of the zzso and zzso coli zzso The zzso connection domain may serve to recognize and bind the zzso zzso major zzso
