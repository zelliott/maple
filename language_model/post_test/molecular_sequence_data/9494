The viral zzso E6 is an essential factor for cervical zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso Among other zzso activities, E6 recruits the zzso zzso zzso to promote the zzso and subsequent zzso degradation of zzso E6 is prone to zzso which long precluded its structural zzso Here we found that E6 specifically zzso through its zzso domain and that disruption of the zzso interface strongly increases E6 zzso This allowed us to raise structural data covering the entire zzso E6 zzso including the high-resolution zzso structures of the two zzso zzso of E6 and a robust zzso model structure of the zzso domain zzso Interestingly, zzso interface zzso that disrupt E6 zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that E6 needs to zzso via its zzso domain to promote the zzso of zzso by zzso
