We have used an zzso combining zzso gene transfer and zzso in Swiss zzso mice to look for activated zzso genes in solid human sporadic zzso This zzso can detect zzso zzso zzso at zzso 12, 13, or zzso We examined a panel of 13 independent surgical specimens of primary tumors and zzso No zzso or zzso zzso were zzso an zzso zzso zzso at zzso 61, was identified in one of the 13 zzso No zzso genes zzso at zzso 13 were zzso Thus, the zzso zzso detects a low frequency of zzso gene zzso in zzso
