Human zzso zzso and their zzso incorporating zzso zzso or zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso The synthetic zzso were examined for their zzso activity against zzso zzso two zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso The human zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso were found to be potent zzso zzso zzso which differs by one zzso acid at the zzso of its zzso was totally zzso The zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso were insensitive to human zzso However, the zzso of two basic zzso such as zzso at both the zzso and the zzso of zzso significantly enhanced zzso and zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso such as zzso acid, at the zzso and zzso rendered the zzso totally zzso The presence of two zzso zzso zzso such as zzso at the zzso of zzso and of two basic zzso zzso at its zzso resulted in molecules that were zzso active against these oral zzso The results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso peptides are the crucial functional elements that determine their zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of all zzso constitutes the same zzso zzso structure, with the polar face formed by the zzso and zzso zzso playing an important role in defining zzso potency and the zzso zzso The enhanced zzso activity observed for zzso peptides with two basic zzso at both the zzso and zzso could be due to zzso of the zzso of the structure, which could facilitate specific interactions with the microbial zzso
