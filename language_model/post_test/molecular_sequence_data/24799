The zzso zzso zzso is a defining activity of the highly zzso zzso pathway, and is present in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are now known that zzso either zzso zzso or zzso as the primary zzso donor and share the ability to catalyze the transfer of zzso to the zzso of zzso Because of the crucial position in the zzso zzso of zzso their zzso characteristics and zzso may play a significant role in zzso the origins of zzso and, indeed, of metabolism zzso Despite the shared ability to zzso zzso zzso that have been characterized to date now fall into three sequence families: the zzso family, consisting of the well-known higher zzso zzso zzso together with their zzso and zzso bacterial cousins (including the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and plant zzso zzso the zzso family, exemplified by the minor zzso zzso activity of zzso coli zzso zzso but which also includes at least one zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the tentatively named zzso family, which contains the unique zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which are indicated by sequence analysis to be present also in the zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso
