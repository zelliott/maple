zzso zzso are important for horizontal gene transfer in zzso and zzso bacteria, but have not been reported yet for enteric zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to transfer by zzso genes for a zzso zzso zzso which were located on a DNA element called zzso We report here that the corresponding zzso genes for a zzso zzso system and a zzso zzso zzso are located on a large zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso renamed zzso The zzso element zzso at two specific attachment sites in a zzso way into the zzso of zzso coli K-12 zzso One site was identified within zzso the structural gene for a zzso zzso of both ends of zzso revealed the presence of the 3' part of zzso on one end such that after integration of the element, a complete zzso gene is zzso zzso represents, to our knowledge, the first zzso zzso found in enteric zzso
