zzso is a type II integral membrane protein that has previously been suggested to be a resident protein of a membrane network zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso In the present study, we have produced a zzso zzso against the zzso human zzso protein to reassess the zzso distribution of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Double zzso of zzso cells showed significant zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso marker zzso except for differences in the zzso of the outer nuclear zzso zzso zzso of native zzso cells and of zzso cells zzso with zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso are predominantly localized in the rough zzso While zzso was zzso with protein zzso zzso an zzso marker zzso very little overlap of zzso was found with zzso an established marker for the zzso intermediate zzso When rough and smooth zzso were prepared from rat liver, zzso was found to zzso with zzso II, a rough zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso II were predominantly recovered in rough zzso and were largely separated from the intermediate compartment marker protein zzso From these results it is concluded that zzso is localized in the rough zzso
