In zzso release behavior and zzso activity, and in zzso plasma disposition of newly zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso were investigated and compared with zzso The derivatives included oxidized zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso release of platinum complex from zzso zzso zzso was determined by an equilibrium dialysis zzso These zzso zzso showed sustained release of the platinum zzso In zzso release zzso for zzso was significantly longer zzso zzso than that for zzso In zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso against colon 26, mouse colon cancer cell line, was measured using the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a similar zzso activity to zzso However, both zzso activities were markedly decreased when zzso with the medium containing zzso On the other hand, zzso retained residual zzso activity at a significantly higher level than zzso after zzso with the medium containing serum, although it showed the lowest zzso zzso This indicated longer maintenance of the in zzso zzso activity of zzso in serum compared with zzso Plasma disposition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was determined by intravenous administration to zzso Although the total platinum plasma zzso profile for zzso was similar to that for zzso its markedly higher profile was achieved when zzso was zzso The values of the total platinum zzso and zzso where zzso is the area under the platinum zzso curve and zzso is the mean residence time, for zzso were zzso times and zzso times significantly higher than with zzso in zzso zzso zzso also showed a significantly lower total clearance compared with zzso These results from the in zzso experiments revealed that retention of zzso in blood circulation was much greater than that for zzso zzso thus has potential as a zzso zzso of zzso for passive tumor zzso
