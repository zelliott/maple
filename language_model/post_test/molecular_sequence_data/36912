Since our first report showing that the zzso of zzso or type zzso zzso zzso zzso is a consequence of a zzso in the zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a number of zzso were found in the zzso gene of zzso zzso However, to establish the molecular basis of zzso in each patient, we must carry out several important experiments as summarized zzso First, we should confirm that the cloned or amplified zzso DNA segments are not derived from the zzso or related zzso It should be noted that the putative zzso zzso contains the sequence almost identical to zzso 4 and 5, including their zzso boundaries of the authentic zzso zzso Thus, the zzso detected in zzso 4 or 5 amplified from zzso DNA, must be carefully analyzed to exclude a possibility that the zzso is located in the zzso Second, it is of significance to confirm the promoter activity of the patients' zzso zzso zzso we established the zzso zzso system derived from melanoma cells where the cloned zzso gene is faithfully zzso Finally, transient expression zzso of zzso zzso is invaluable to conclude that zzso zzso are associated with the zzso zzso zzso I also discuss the implications of a cluster of zzso sites in zzso 1 coding for the zzso of zzso
