Evidence is presented that suggests a role for zzso domain interactions in the assembly of class II major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the class II zzso alpha or beta chains resulted in proteins that did not generate complexes recognized by zzso zzso and that were largely retained in the zzso zzso zzso of the alpha and beta zzso zzso into other proteins allowed the zzso proteins to zzso suggesting a direct interaction of the alpha and beta zzso zzso The interactions were zzso by a structural motif involving several zzso zzso on the same face of a putative alpha zzso
