This report describes the zzso of a gene zzso from tomato plants that encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso in transgenic plants reveals that the gene is under strict zzso control, becoming zzso active in cells which are apparently undergoing mechanical stimulation generated during the different zzso of zzso We show that the zzso gene contains a large zzso leader zzso which is required to zzso zzso gene expression in leaves, but not in other zzso of the zzso Based on these zzso we propose that the observed zzso regulation of this gene may constitute a basic mechanism for deployment of zzso zzso in plants, which act to limit the deleterious effects of zzso generated during normal plant zzso
