For the rapid and sensitive detection of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso biopsy zzso we combined cell sorting with the zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 5-8 of the zzso gene were investigated by zzso analysis using zzso sorted zzso obtained from each zzso biopsy zzso of 16 patients with zzso zzso zzso extracted from their respective surgical specimens were investigated by a conventional method of zzso zzso zzso in the biopsy specimens were detected in 6 of the 12 zzso tumors but in none of the 4 zzso zzso After tumor cell enrichment by cell zzso one zzso in zzso 8 became apparent, which could not be detected from the surgical zzso by a conventional method of zzso zzso This method should improve the sensitivity of detecting zzso gene zzso and provides additional information concerning the DNA zzso pattern in the zzso
