Human zzso zzso zzso zzso C, plays a functionally important role in maintaining zzso shape and regulating membrane material properties, possibly through its interaction with protein zzso Moreover, it has previously been shown that zzso deficient in protein zzso exhibit decreased content of zzso zzso To further define the relationship between protein zzso and zzso C, a series of studies were performed using both protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by flow zzso showed that the zzso C content of cells totally deficient in protein zzso was zzso of normal and that of cells partially deficient in protein zzso was zzso of zzso Interestingly, while zzso zzso zzso cells had no zzso levels of this zzso cells from zzso zzso had normal zzso zzso zzso content of zzso of these zzso zzso cells was also zzso These data suggest that zzso C may be zzso in excess by zzso cells and its membrane content regulated by protein zzso To investigate if this regulation is due to association between protein zzso and zzso C, we examined the retention of zzso C in membrane skeletons zzso zzso prepared from normal zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso C is retained by zzso shells prepared from normal zzso whereas zzso shells prepared from protein zzso zzso are totally devoid of this zzso However, zzso of protein zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso resulted in retention of zzso C with the zzso zzso This finding suggests that protein zzso is necessary for association of zzso C with the membrane zzso Furthermore, these data suggest that through its interaction with zzso C, protein zzso may play a role in regulating the membrane content of this zzso in mature human zzso
