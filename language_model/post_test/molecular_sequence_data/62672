The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso block encodes two members of the zzso group of cell surface zzso zzso and zzso These two zzso mainly expressed in brain, were known to be composed of at least six zzso sharing zzso DNA zzso The zzso structure of zzso Y has been zzso in detail, uncovering the existence of at least 11 more zzso spanning more than 700 zzso Many of these zzso located at the zzso and 3' ends of zzso Y undergo differential and alternative zzso Seven of the zzso have been found to use alternative zzso zzso Most of these zzso are expressed within the brain, although some zzso exhibit a more ubiquitous distribution zzso zzso Y zzso appears to be driven from two alternative promoters located zzso of zzso 1 and zzso zzso Assuming that the zzso events at the zzso and 3' ends of these genes are independent of one another, potentially up to 360 different zzso could be zzso The main impact on protein function is predicted to be in the efficiency of translation, zzso processing within the cell, and structure of the zzso domain that may influence any role the genes have in zzso
