The mechanisms of zzso actions of zzso 2, zzso II and zzso zzso against various zzso coli strains were zzso Poly zzso inhibited zzso zzso 434 and zzso growth without zzso the zzso zzso 2 had a zzso activity on zzso 21 and zzso 434 membrane but could not inhibit the zzso growth in a zzso zzso zzso II, which killed zzso and zzso 434 without cell membrane damage, zzso zzso to zzso Once they were introduced into the cell by zzso all three peptides were able to inhibit cell growth at zzso of 10 times lower than their zzso These results indicate that the nature of the zzso and also the characteristics of the cell membrane determine the zzso actions of a zzso
