zzso and zzso zzso zzso are known to be involved, respectively, in zzso zzso in zzso and high zzso zzso zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso was isolated and shown to degrade zzso via zzso A zzso zzso containing a zzso region of zzso zzso genes was cloned and zzso and four genes zzso were shown to zzso the zzso involved in the zzso to central zzso of zzso via zzso The Bag proteins share moderate identities with the reported zzso in the zzso zzso except zzso that had no obvious zzso with any functionally characterized zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso as a zzso protein and likely a zzso by gel zzso zzso was demonstrated to be a novel zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso of zzso to zzso with zzso zzso or zzso as its zzso The zzso values of these three zzso for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso A were reported to be abundant in zzso zzso zzso zzso should zzso zzso as its zzso zzso in zzso The addition of zzso increased zzso activity, and zzso zzso experiments indicated that three zzso zzso in zzso were associated with binding to zzso zzso and were necessary for its zzso zzso zzso is the first characterized zzso zzso zzso in microbial metabolism and is likely a new and distinct member of zzso family, with a zzso zzso as deduced by sequence analysis and zzso zzso
