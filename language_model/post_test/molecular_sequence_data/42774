To develop a zzso chain reaction zzso for the specific detection of the C protein gene in strains of group B zzso 

A single primer pair derived from the zzso sequence of the zzso binding beta zzso of the C protein complex permitted the specific amplification of a zzso base pair DNA zzso from the C protein zzso After 35 cycles of amplification this product could be detected by zzso gel zzso Southern zzso zzso confirmed that this product was the C protein zzso 

zzso detected the C protein gene in 75 zzso of 119 strains of group B zzso zzso The product was not detected in other Gram positive organisms, showing that this zzso zzso was highly zzso The sensitivity of the zzso was satisfactory to a dilution of 1 in 10,000 of extracted zzso 

The C protein of group B zzso is associated with zzso zzso The specific detection of the C protein gene by zzso may help identify which strains are likely to be associated with infection by the zzso
