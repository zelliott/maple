zzso scavenger zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of a residual cap structure following 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso Some previous studies suggested that both zzso and zzso were zzso for zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso by the zzso complex in the zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso are not zzso by zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are, demonstrating the importance of a zzso chain for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso at a slower rate than their corresponding zzso zzso and zzso respectively), indicating an involvement of the second zzso for efficient zzso zzso Although zzso zzso cannot zzso zzso they have a high binding affinity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso may function as an efficient zzso zzso Our data have important implications for the regulatory role of zzso in zzso zzso pathways due to its possible interactions with different zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso
