The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in the majority of human gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso a zzso of gastrointestinal zzso zzso A previous study identified zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso in five of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To better define the frequency and spectrum of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso tract that had been characterized for zzso protein zzso we examined zzso tissue samples for zzso in the zzso domain by zzso amplification and DNA zzso zzso zzso domain zzso were found in nine of 56 zzso tumors zzso zzso eight zzso two zzso and occurred exclusively in zzso zzso Seven of the nine zzso consisted of zzso deletions of one to 19 zzso There was one zzso zzso that added 12 zzso and one zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso disrupted the downstream reading frame of the zzso The single zzso zzso zzso is very similar to the only other zzso zzso reported in zzso zzso Of the 46 zzso 43 were strongly positive for zzso protein expression and negative for diffuse expression of zzso Neither zzso expression nor gene zzso were found in gastrointestinal zzso or zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso zzso domain does not occur in gastrointestinal zzso zzso with well zzso muscle zzso and is restricted to zzso However, since these zzso are only found in a minority of zzso further investigation into the mechanisms of zzso gene zzso in this group of zzso is zzso
