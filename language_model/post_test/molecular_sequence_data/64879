zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cause zzso infection in several zzso and are transmitted by zzso zzso Of the 10 described species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the most zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the first internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences of these 5 zzso The length of the zzso sequences ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences ranged from 35 to zzso zzso sites were detected in each zzso zzso variation varied from zzso to zzso The characteristics of the zzso of zzso zzso show similarities to those of other zzso The findings of this present study show that the zzso represent a powerful genetic marker for the molecular identification of zzso and a useful tool for developing molecular zzso techniques to study zzso zzso transmission patterns and prevalence in definitive and intermediate zzso
