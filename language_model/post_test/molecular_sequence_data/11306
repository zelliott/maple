zzso is a zzso protein involved in the initiation phase of zzso zzso A single zzso gene had been reported to account for zzso zzso in liver and muscle, the two major zzso of zzso We describe the characterization of novel forms of zzso designated zzso zzso zzso by a second gene that is expressed zzso in certain zzso including liver, heart, and zzso Cloning of zzso zzso zzso indicated the existence of multiple species, including three liver forms zzso zzso and zzso generated in part by alternative zzso Overall, zzso has zzso identity to muscle zzso but is zzso identical over a zzso segment thought to contain the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli or zzso cells is active in zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso by skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso produced in zzso coli recognized proteins of Mr approximately zzso present in extracts of rat liver and in cultured zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, most of the zzso was present as a free protein but some was zzso associated with zzso zzso and was only released by treatment with zzso zzso cells also expressed the muscle form of zzso zzso which was attached to a zzso zzso zzso zzso
