We established transgenic mouse lines expressing a zzso zzso wheat germ zzso zzso under the control of mouse zzso gene zzso In the taste zzso zzso zzso was faithfully expressed in zzso zzso taste zzso zzso zzso protein was transferred not zzso to the zzso zzso type III cells in the taste buds but directly to a subset of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and further conveyed to a zzso region of the nucleus of solitary zzso In addition, zzso was expressed in solitary zzso cells in the zzso zzso and transferred along the zzso sensory zzso to the zzso zzso The solitary zzso cells zzso expressed zzso together with bitter taste receptors zzso This result shows an exceptional signature of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso transgenic mice revealed the zzso zzso pathways from taste zzso cells and the zzso neural zzso from solitary zzso zzso
