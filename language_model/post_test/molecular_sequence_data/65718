The Black Sea is the largest extant zzso water body on zzso Its zzso boundary is located at a depth of 100 m and is populated by a single zzso of marine green sulfur zzso This zzso zzso zzso strain zzso is extraordinarily low light adapted and can therefore serve as an indicator of deep zzso zone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, two zzso zzso were retrieved from the bottom of the Black Sea at depths of zzso and zzso m and were analyzed for the presence of zzso DNA sequences of zzso using zzso zzso Using zzso zzso media, viable cells of the zzso zzso were detected only at the zzso surface and not in deeper zzso In contrast, green sulfur bacterial zzso zzso gene fragments were amplified from all the zzso layers investigated, including zzso After separation by zzso zzso gel zzso and sequencing, 14 different sequence types were zzso The sequence of zzso represented only a minor fraction of the amplification products and was found in 6 of 22 and 4 of 26 samples from the zzso and zzso stations, zzso Besides the sequences of zzso three additional zzso of the marine zzso of green sulfur bacteria were zzso However, the majority of sequences clustered with groups from freshwater zzso Our results suggest that a considerable fraction of green sulfur bacterial zzso did not originate in a zzso marine zzso environment and therefore were likely to have an zzso zzso Thus, analysis of zzso DNA sequences permits a more differentiated interpretation and reconstruction of past environmental conditions if specific zzso of zzso species, like zzso zzso strain zzso are zzso
