The primary structures of growth hormone zzso of three zzso species, zzso zzso silver zzso and grass zzso were determined by a chemical method and/or by molecular zzso The zzso carp zzso was extracted from zzso tissue by use of an alkaline zzso then successively zzso by gel zzso zzso interaction column zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso The primary structure of zzso carp zzso determined chemically is identical to that deduced from the zzso zzso zzso By molecular zzso the primary structures of silver carp and grass carp zzso were also zzso The zzso of these three zzso species all contain 188 zzso acid zzso and their sequences are zzso When four of the five zzso of zzso zzso were arranged to match the same positions of zzso of other zzso zzso a zzso matched alignment was zzso Among fishes, zzso are relatively zzso within the same order (82 to zzso zzso but they are more diversified between orders zzso to zzso zzso In further comparison, fish zzso are even more different from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Although the primary structures of zzso zzso are relatively zzso four zzso zzso notably one located at the zzso are zzso
