The zzso locus control region zzso is a complex regulatory element that is essential for the appropriate red zzso expression of all zzso zzso zzso Of the five hypersensitive sites that define the zzso only zzso has been shown to augment gene expression in zzso in both transient and stable zzso as well as in transgenic zzso Thus, zzso has been assumed to be an important element for the function of the zzso in zzso We have zzso zzso zzso in zzso embryonic stem zzso cells and zzso analysis in derived mice to investigate the function of zzso in its normal zzso position in the zzso zzso zzso Replacement of zzso with a zzso marker gene zzso zzso + zzso causes a zzso reduction in expression of all of the genes in the zzso and a more pronounced effect zzso on the most zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso when expression of this gene is first zzso during zzso The zzso produces no zzso in the zzso timing of expression of the zzso zzso When zzso the zzso zzso is lethal in zzso with the zzso dying during the stage of zzso zzso and early fetal liver zzso To distinguish zzso effects resulting from the deletion of zzso from those attributable to zzso of the zzso marker, the zzso marker was removed by expressing the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells harboring the zzso zzso zzso Mice derived from these zzso cells zzso zzso delta zzso demonstrated nearly full expression of all the zzso zzso genes on the zzso zzso These results indicate that although zzso demonstrates significant regulatory activities in a variety of zzso deletion of this element from the zzso zzso locus has no significant effect on the timing or extent of expression of the zzso In addition, this result emphasizes that when using zzso zzso to analyze complex regulatory elements in zzso the inserted zzso marker must be removed to avoid influencing the zzso of the zzso
