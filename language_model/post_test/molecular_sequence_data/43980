zzso growth zzso zzso is zzso as zzso high molecular mass complexes from producer zzso The zzso precursor zzso also called zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso linked complex with zzso and zzso the zzso to zzso In human zzso and certain other cell types, zzso zzso binding zzso zzso is zzso to zzso and forms complexes of more than 230 zzso In addition, zzso and zzso which are structurally similar to zzso can be part of zzso zzso zzso In Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso a major part of the zzso zzso zzso into the medium is a zzso small zzso complex containing zzso and zzso In addition, we found two other forms of zzso zzso complexes, zzso a zzso complex containing zzso and a zzso complex containing a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso acid sequencing and zzso cloning from a zzso cell zzso library, revealed that it is a zzso counterpart of a previously identified, zzso protein known as chicken zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso mouse zzso and rat zzso (a zzso membrane zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso precursor zzso revealed that the expressed protein forms a complex with zzso and that a major part of the complex is zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso for zzso was expressed in large amounts in zzso zzso and zzso but less abundantly in other zzso These results suggest that zzso produced in certain cell types, may form a complex with zzso which may have different properties compared with other zzso zzso zzso It remains to be investigated whether the complex formation between zzso and zzso also occurs in other cells, whether the association between them occurs in the zzso complex, and whether it affects the interaction of zzso with zzso or zzso
