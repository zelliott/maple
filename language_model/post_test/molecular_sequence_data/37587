zzso inflammatory zzso diseases are characterized by a cellular zzso and are similar in many respects to other chronic inflammatory zzso While zzso bacteria have been recognized as the principal zzso agent and the immune response to these bacteria is thought to be responsible for the tissue destruction, the full zzso spectrum is still incompletely zzso In addition to many cell types such as zzso zzso and zzso T cells have been implicated in zzso and are considered to have regulatory roles in progression of the zzso Based on our recent studies demonstrating biased expression of several zzso families in zzso zzso the aim of this study was to characterize further the T cells relevant to the disease process by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso sequence analysis of zzso region 3 zzso of the zzso zzso In spite of the likely involvement of numerous bacteria, the present study has clearly shown the zzso of zzso T cells in zzso zzso in contrast to low zzso of peripheral blood T cells as evidenced by the appearance of distinct bands in zzso tissue samples and zzso pattern of peripheral blood on zzso zzso These were confirmed by the DNA sequencing of the zzso of zzso of selected zzso The analysis of deduced zzso acid sequences demonstrated zzso acid motifs in the zzso region of the zzso zzso sequences from each zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso T cells recognizing a limited number of zzso or zzso are involved in the disease zzso
