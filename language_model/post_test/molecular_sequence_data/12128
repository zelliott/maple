The zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha are known to activate certain zzso and zzso cell zzso We have produced and fully zzso the zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso They induce zzso of the zzso cell line, zzso and T zzso zzso cells express three of the known zzso zzso zzso In order to study the zzso of a single zzso we have expressed the shared zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso alpha zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso We have examined the effects of zzso and zzso alpha on the zzso zzso zzso by equilibrium binding studies and in a zzso zzso zzso competes for zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso alpha competes for its zzso counterpart with an zzso of 10 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso These affinities are the same as those measured on the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso cells respond to both these zzso in the zzso zzso with the same zzso values as those measured for zzso zzso This indicates that this cellular response can be zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
