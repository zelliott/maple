A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed from the cloned gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently released zzso from soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso with a specific activity of 76 U zzso In contrast, release of zzso was very inefficient from the zzso zzso zzso grass and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso also expressed from a cloned zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the release of zzso from zzso However, the combination of zzso zzso and zzso released more zzso from zzso grass and zzso zzso grass than did zzso zzso zzso more reducing sugar was also released from all three zzso by the combination of zzso zzso and zzso than by zzso zzso Thus the extent of zzso of zzso zzso by zzso appears to be limited by the zzso In this system zzso does not appear to increase the rate of zzso of zzso zzso by zzso but probably allows the release of shorter zzso zzso from already zzso zzso zzso zzso
