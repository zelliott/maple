zzso zzso is a zzso anchor modification of zzso and viral proteins targeting them to membrane locations, thus changing the cellular function of modified zzso zzso zzso is critical in many zzso zzso in signal zzso zzso or alternative zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso recognizes the sequence motif of appropriate zzso proteins at the N zzso and zzso the zzso zzso to the absolutely required zzso zzso zzso Reliable recognition of capacity for zzso zzso from the zzso protein sequence alone is desirable for zzso function zzso projects but the existing zzso motif is not practical, since it produces huge numbers of false positive and even some false negative zzso As a first step towards a new prediction method, it is necessary to refine the sequence motif coding for zzso zzso Relying on the in-depth study of the zzso acid sequence zzso of zzso zzso on binding site analyses in X-ray structures or zzso zzso models for zzso from various zzso and on consideration of zzso data extracted from the scientific literature, we found indications that, at least within a complete zzso zzso the zzso 17 protein zzso experience different types of zzso zzso We identified three motif zzso region 1 zzso zzso fitting the binding zzso region 2 zzso zzso interacting with the zzso surface at the mouth of the zzso zzso and region 3 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Each region was characterized by physical requirements to single sequence positions or groups of positions regarding volume, zzso backbone flexibility and other typical properties of zzso acids zzso These specificity differences are confined partly to zzso ranges and are proposed for the design of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso systems including zzso zzso zzso major, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An exhaustive search for zzso led to the discovery of two putative zzso zzso
