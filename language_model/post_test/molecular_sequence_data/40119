The zzso zzso zzso is expressed by a wide variety of human zzso including zzso zzso and gastric zzso The restricted expression of zzso on tumor zzso as well as its implication in tumor progression and bad prognosis makes zzso a promising new candidate for zzso An zzso vaccine zzso zzso zzso has been successfully evaluated in zzso studies in a zzso tumor zzso Here, we report the generation of human zzso T cells specific for the zzso zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso derived DC infected with a replication defective zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of several donors confirms a repertoire of such zzso zzso In a parallel approach, incorporating the results of zzso zzso of zzso derived zzso peptides and the potential high affinity zzso predicted by a computer-based algorithm, we identified 8 putative zzso zzso zzso class I zzso of zzso zzso Two of these generated specific zzso T cells after zzso with zzso loaded zzso DC and zzso by zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso these particular zzso generated T cells recognized naturally zzso positive tumor cells only if they expressed zzso as judged by zzso gamma zzso or zzso Also, zzso zzso T cells recognized these peptides in a zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, there is a repertoire of zzso T cell recognition of zzso in normal human donors and some candidate zzso zzso have been zzso
