To screen zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary zzso glaucoma zzso zzso Nine zzso families were recruited for the zzso All patients underwent detailed clinical examinations to confirm the diagnosis of zzso The families of index patients were also zzso Genealogical information was obtained by pedigree zzso The primary candidate zzso zzso was amplified from zzso DNA, zzso and analyzed in patients to identify the zzso zzso 

Eight of the nine zzso families were zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed three distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso in seven of nine unrelated zzso index patients zzso Six patients had zzso zzso and one had a compound zzso zzso zzso zzso were not identified in two zzso In family 4, the index patient was found to be zzso for the zzso zzso In family 6, although affected individuals were found to be zzso in the zzso region, no zzso could be zzso 

This study indicates that zzso could be the zzso cause of zzso in the zzso population zzso zzso zzso patients show zzso zzso Further studies are needed to delineate the spectrum of zzso in zzso zzso families and to identify new or modifier genes contributing to the manifestations of zzso in this zzso
