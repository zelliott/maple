zzso is thought to be a zzso state of zzso of zzso in which zzso forces are pulling zzso and zzso the cohesive forces between the zzso Unlike conventional zzso members of the zzso I family are zzso zzso which are expected to be molecules that could generate zzso zzso 

We have characterized zzso roles of two zzso I zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These two proteins form a zzso but not a zzso zzso not essential, both proteins are required for accurate zzso segregation and normal zzso of zzso zzso zzso live analysis using zzso indicates that these zzso spend a much longer time zzso in zzso before the initiation of zzso zzso Further observation using zzso and zzso markers shows that, in these zzso sister zzso move back and forth between the two zzso indicating that entry into zzso A is zzso This is supported by live image analysis showing that zzso zzso is retained during the prolonged zzso Furthermore, the zzso extension is dependent upon the zzso zzso zzso 

We discuss two models of zzso I function in zzso zzso One proposes that zzso and zzso are required for efficient capturing of zzso by the zzso while the other proposes that they are required to generate tension upon zzso zzso zzso I, therefore, plays a fundamental role in the establishment of zzso probably by generating zzso forces at the zzso
