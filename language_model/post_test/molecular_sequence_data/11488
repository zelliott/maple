The zzso zzso zzso from the polar fish zzso zzso has been expressed in and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso as a biologically active zzso The gene for the 37 zzso acid long zzso has been chemically zzso using zzso preferred zzso zzso the gene has been cloned into an zzso expression zzso as well as in a zzso integration zzso which is zzso more zzso The expression is under the control of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been investigated as a carrier protein to facilitate expression and zzso of zzso In order to reach increased expression levels, tandem repeats of the zzso gene (up to eight zzso have been zzso In most cases the genes are efficiently expressed and the products zzso The expression level amounts to approximately 100 zzso in the culture zzso In a number of genetic zzso the genes are directly linked and expressed as zzso zzso In other zzso zzso regions have been inserted between the zzso gene copies, that allow the zzso to be processed by specific zzso either from the zzso zzso zzso system or from a zzso zzso The latter requires a separate processing step after zzso zzso to obtain mature zzso In all these cases zzso processing is incomplete, generating a zzso mixture of mature zzso carrier and zzso zzso and/or a mixture of zzso The zzso activity has been demonstrated for such zzso as well as for zzso zzso
