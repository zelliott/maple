zzso zzso zzso is an emerging pathogen in zzso Here, we identified a zzso zzso protein toxin zzso which contains a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso of zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prevents interaction with downstream zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and toxicity toward insects and zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain in complex with zzso determined at zzso resolution represents a zzso zzso fold and is the smallest zzso toxin zzso zzso analysis identifies zzso as a retaining zzso The zzso domain of zzso blocks zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso Thus, zzso hijacks host zzso signaling in a zzso manner by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
