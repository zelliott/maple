zzso is an aromatic zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Two zzso regions located upstream and downstream of the locus for the zzso type II zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of eight genes zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso The three zzso genes were each zzso by gene zzso zzso of one of them zzso generated a zzso zzso while zzso of the other two zzso and zzso did not affect the zzso of zzso The zzso gene may code for an zzso responsible for the introduction of oxygen atoms at early steps in the zzso of zzso leading to zzso One of the zzso may be responsible for reductive zzso of an intermediate from an zzso and another for the reduction of a zzso group in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A hypothetical zzso zzso showing in particular the involvement of zzso zzso and of various other gene products in zzso zzso is zzso
