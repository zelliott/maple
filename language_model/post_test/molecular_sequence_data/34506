zzso species in section zzso display local, zzso and zzso patterns of distribution across the Northern Hemisphere where these zzso zzso occur with host trees throughout their geographical range within a continent, or have zzso intercontinental zzso the origins of which are not zzso We zzso evolutionary histories of four species, 1) zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso and 4) zzso zzso from populations distributed throughout the Old World, and portions of the New World zzso and North zzso based on genetic variation of 154 zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequences from 83 population zzso By describing the population structure of these species across their geographical distribution, we attempt to identify their historical migration and patterns of zzso 

Models of population structure from zzso zzso demographic and zzso analyses revealed genetically differentiated and geographically structured zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso zzso showed considerably less population structure and zzso zzso lacked sufficient genetic differentiation to resolve any population zzso zzso populations within zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show little or no zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso there is a high level of zzso and zzso plasticity for veil and zzso zzso The ITS sequences of the type specimens of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were identical to one another and are treated as one species with a wider range of geographic distribution under zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that each of the zzso species has undergone a relatively independent evolutionary history, zzso as zzso 1) a widely distributed ancestral population of zzso zzso zzso into distinctive zzso populations in the New zzso 2) two divergent lineages in zzso zzso gave rise to the New World and Old World zzso zzso and 3) the low levels of genetic divergence within zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be the result of more recent demographic population zzso The scenario of migration via the zzso Land Bridge provides the most probable explanation for zzso zzso geographic zzso of these species, but it does not offer an explanation for the low degree of genetic divergence between populations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings are mostly consistent with the designation of New World zzso populations as separate species from the European counterpart species zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The results also reinforce previous observations that linked zzso zzso and zzso zzso displaying zzso in parts of North America and zzso zzso of the population structure of these zzso suggest that host tree history has heavily influenced their modern zzso however, the complex issues related to zzso of these zzso with their tree hosts remain unclear at this zzso
