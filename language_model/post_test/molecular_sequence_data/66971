We have investigated the sequences and the expression patterns of different members of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso during zzso Low stringency zzso of a zzso zzso library with an zzso zzso led to the isolation of several zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These zzso do not only differ by zzso of different leader zzso but also by alternative usage of coding zzso thereby leading to functional zzso For zzso we show that zzso of an additional zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso and spatial expression patterns of zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso and by whole mount in zzso zzso zzso transcripts are detected from zzso to late zzso stages and are found to be zzso to zzso zzso arches and distinct structures of the zzso zzso and zzso including the zzso marginal zone of the zzso zzso zzso is already present in early zzso stage zzso and accumulates from zzso until the end of zzso zzso expression is found within the anterior neural fold, in the zzso and zzso in the zzso arches as well as in the zzso
