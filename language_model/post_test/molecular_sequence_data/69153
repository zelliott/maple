zzso the activity of zzso DNA zzso zzso on open circular zzso we observed virtually complete termination within potential zzso zzso zzso destroying the triplex potential of the sequences prevented zzso while zzso zzso restoring triplex potential restored zzso We zzso that strand displacement during DNA zzso of zzso templates brings three DNA strands zzso DNA downstream of the zzso plus a displaced zzso into close zzso provoking triplex formation, which in turn prevents further DNA zzso Supporting this idea, we found that zzso is unable to zzso through short zzso stretches within zzso DNA zzso Thus, DNA zzso by inducing triplex formation at specific sequences in front of the replication fork, causes zzso zzso biological implications of such zzso zzso are zzso Our data also provide a novel way to target DNA zzso at specific sequences using zzso zzso
