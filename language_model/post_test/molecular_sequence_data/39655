In stark contrast to the rapid zzso radiation of zzso during the zzso explosion, the simple body plan of sponges zzso zzso emerged from the zzso relatively zzso Although the genetic and zzso zzso of these disparate evolutionary outcomes are unknown, comparisons between modern sponges and zzso promise to reveal the extent to which critical genetic factors were present in their common zzso Two particularly interesting classes of genes in this respect are those involved in cell signaling and zzso These genes help guide development and zzso in modern zzso but the timing and sequence of their origins is zzso Here, we demonstrate that the sponge zzso zzso one of the earliest branching animals, expresses core components of the zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, we identify sponge zzso of nearly every major zzso zzso gene family, including those that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso From these data, we zzso that key signaling and zzso genes were in place early in animal evolution, before the divergence of sponge and zzso zzso
