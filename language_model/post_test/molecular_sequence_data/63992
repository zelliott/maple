We have previously cloned the mouse zzso basic protein zzso a zzso of human zzso from mouse zzso zzso zzso Using zzso alignment and zzso the rat zzso of human and mouse zzso was cloned from lung and named as zzso The complete open reading frame and part of the zzso and zzso regions were obtained through rapid amplification of zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a protein of 111 zzso acids containing a signal zzso of 37 zzso acids at the zzso with the mature protein of 74 zzso zzso The zzso is a new member of zzso zzso The mature protein of zzso shares zzso and zzso zzso with mouse and human zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso to be predominantly localized in the pulmonary vascular zzso zzso The zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed and zzso zzso into zzso zzso In the in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso The implication of zzso found in rat lung is that this zzso may have the function to recruit zzso to fight against pulmonary zzso
