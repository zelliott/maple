We report here the identification and characterization of a novel nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated in a screen for zzso zzso proteins using the zzso alpha zzso binding domain as a zzso The zzso protein shares no sequence and has little structural zzso with other nuclear zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso is cell and tissue type specific and is most abundant in the brain, where its expression is restricted to zzso In addition to interacting with zzso zzso zzso also binds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso alpha via a zzso interaction zzso The zzso zzso association can be zzso by zzso zzso boxes, indicating zzso binds zzso alpha on a surface similar to that of other zzso zzso can enhance the zzso activities of nuclear receptors with which it zzso In zzso zzso is recruited by zzso zzso alpha to the promoter region of zzso zzso alpha target zzso Furthermore, the zzso recruitment of zzso to the promoter follows a zzso pattern similar to that of other zzso Our results suggest that zzso represents a distinct class of nuclear zzso zzso that mediates zzso signaling in specific target zzso
