The zzso relationships among the species of the zzso zzso were studied by comparing their zzso zzso zzso The zzso species form a coherent zzso cluster within the zzso of the zzso budding bacteria in the zzso The sequences of two strains of zzso zzso were obtained from zzso extracted from zzso zzso cells, which are the only source of material available, and were found to be almost identical zzso of zzso zzso Overall, the zzso species are closely zzso with sequence similarities ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso is zzso the most zzso related species and exhibits the lowest similarity zzso with zzso zzso Australian isolate zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are all very highly zzso with similarities greater than zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso species are more closely related to the zzso species zzso zzso than to the other zzso species, zzso zzso zzso uncertainties resulting from the loss of the type culture of zzso zzso are zzso
