zzso translation initiation factor 2 zzso is a zzso that functions as a central switch in the initiation of protein zzso In its zzso state it delivers the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the small zzso zzso and releases it upon zzso zzso following the recognition of the initiation zzso We have developed a complete zzso framework for the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex and have determined the effect of the conversion of zzso to zzso on zzso affinity for zzso in zzso In its zzso state the factor forms a positive interaction with the zzso zzso on zzso that is disrupted when zzso is replaced with zzso while contacts between the factor and the body of the zzso remain zzso This positive interaction with the zzso zzso on the zzso may serve to ensure that only charged zzso zzso enters the initiation zzso The zzso on and off of the zzso interaction with the zzso zzso is likely to play an important role in the mechanism of zzso zzso release upon initiation zzso zzso In addition, we show that the zzso zzso zzso which is known to be a critical identity element distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso zzso is required for recognition of the zzso zzso by zzso Our data suggest that a role of this zzso is to orient the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso in its recognition pocket on zzso
