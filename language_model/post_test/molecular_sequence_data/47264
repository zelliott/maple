As the zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso and zzso there is considerable interest in defining its zzso zzso We previously showed that the rat zzso zzso zzso into Chinese zzso zzso cells was coupled to both zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis via protein zzso C zzso In this study, we show that deletion of 51 zzso acid zzso from the zzso zzso resulted in reduced affinity for zzso and a corresponding rightward shift in the zzso curve for zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis did not occur in cells expressing the truncated zzso zzso also failed to increase zzso A activity or activate protein zzso C, indicating that the zzso zzso is zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso is coupled to zzso as zzso zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked the zzso zzso A zzso zzso had all the activities of the wild type zzso zzso These results show that the portion between 39 and 51 zzso from the zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso is required for interaction with zzso but not zzso Furthermore, an increase in zzso calcium was generated via a zzso zzso zzso from zzso stores that are distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso
