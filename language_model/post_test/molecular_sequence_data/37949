The zzso family of zzso factors is characterized by a unique DNA binding zzso Five genes have been isolated in zzso one gene in zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas the roles of the zzso genes are beginning to be understood in zzso no clear function has been reported in zzso organisms, except for zzso the most divergent member of the zzso To study the zzso role of zzso zzso factors using an alternative zzso model, we report the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso gene zzso The fruit fly protein shares highly zzso zzso with the zzso factors zzso to 3 and is more closely related to this zzso It binds DNA with the same target specificity as zzso factors zzso to zzso zzso is located on zzso III and we characterized the entire zzso zzso expression was analyzed during zzso zzso zzso are detected only in the peripheral nervous system and in the brain of the zzso
