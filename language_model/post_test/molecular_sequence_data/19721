A zzso zzso presented with zzso zzso and zzso At zzso multiple coalescing zzso zzso were detected in the margins of the zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso muscle and zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that they would be the same species of unpublished zzso species strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarity based on a comparison of 675 zzso zzso examination of the zzso tissue sections revealed extensive necrosis and zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso necrosis was also detected in the zzso zzso the zzso were zzso with zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the reaction was strong for the zzso Similar reactions were found in the zzso zzso of the zzso and occasionally in the zzso and zzso zzso The present results indicate that the unpublished zzso species induced multiple organ failure accompanied by acute zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso
