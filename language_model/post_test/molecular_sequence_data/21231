zzso zzso are zzso zzso that play important roles in zzso zzso Identification of zzso is crucial to understanding their biological zzso Recently, zzso approaches have been employed to predict zzso precursors zzso However, features used are divergent and consequently induce different zzso Thus, feature selection is critical for zzso zzso We generated an zzso feature subset including 13 features using a hybrid of genetic zzso and support zzso machine zzso Based on zzso the zzso performance of the zzso feature subset is much higher than that of the two feature sets used in zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Finally, we constructed the zzso zzso to predict the most recently identified human zzso in zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso and zzso zzso achieved much higher zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso is effective for identifying zzso
