zzso limitation in zzso or zzso acid deprivation of cells in culture causes a signal zzso cascade consisting of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor 2, and increased synthesis of zzso zzso factor zzso 4 by a zzso control zzso In a zzso zzso program, zzso zzso activates a wide range of downstream target genes involved in zzso cellular zzso and other cell zzso zzso zzso of other signal zzso pathways by zzso acid deprivation led to the question of whether or not the increased abundance of zzso alone was sufficient to trigger the zzso control zzso Using zzso cells that zzso express zzso in a zzso manner showed that zzso target genes were activated in the absence of zzso acid zzso zzso expression of zzso alone resulted in effective recruitment of the general zzso machinery, but some reduction in zzso modification was zzso These data document that zzso alone is sufficient to trigger the zzso zzso zzso control zzso However, the absolute amount of zzso zzso required to achieve the same degree of zzso zzso observed after zzso acid limitation was greater, suggesting that other factors may serve to enhance zzso zzso
