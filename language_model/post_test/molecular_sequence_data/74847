zzso analysis of the zzso zzso site within the zzso zzso precursor protein zzso is fundamental for studies of the molecular biology of influenza A zzso in particular, for molecular zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A current problem for routine zzso is the emergence of new strains of the zzso or zzso zzso or even other zzso which escape detection by commonly used reverse zzso zzso zzso Here, the first zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso site of influenza A viruses of all 16 zzso zzso is zzso The zzso was assessed in comparison to zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso site and a real-time zzso detecting the M zzso A panel of 92 influenza A viruses was used for zzso zzso data for influenza A viruses from 32 zzso fluid samples and 11 diagnostic zzso samples of all 16 zzso zzso were generated by direct sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the new zzso zzso zzso by cycle zzso complement existing methods and strengthen the reliability of influenza A virus zzso allowing both molecular zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso or zzso within a single zzso
