zzso zzso is an important industrial fungus known for its ability to efficiently zzso large quantities of protein as well as its wide variety of biomass degrading zzso Past research on this fungus has primarily focused on extending its protein production capabilities, leaving the structure of its 33 zzso zzso essentially a zzso To begin to address these deficiencies and further our knowledge of zzso zzso zzso and zzso potential, we have created a zzso framework for this zzso We constructed a zzso library containing zzso clones with an average insert size of 125 zzso which provides a coverage of 28 zzso zzso zzso ends were zzso and zzso using publicly available software which identified a number of genes not seen in previously zzso zzso zzso Little evidence was found for repetitive sequence in zzso zzso with the exception of several copies of an element with similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 34 genes involved in biomass degradation revealed five groups of zzso genes in the zzso zzso clones were zzso and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso software resulting in 334 zzso covering 28 zzso of the zzso The assembly of these zzso zzso was verified by zzso with zzso zzso
