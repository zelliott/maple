zzso in particular zzso are believed to be responsible for zzso cartilage degradation in zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso system in this disease, we studied in normal and zzso human zzso zzso the nature, the number, and the level of expression of the zzso zzso zzso and through which zzso the zzso stimulation of these cells by zzso is zzso 

We determined the zzso level by zzso zzso the type of zzso with the use of specific zzso and by the reverse zzso zzso and the zzso level of the type I zzso by slot zzso zzso zzso activity was measured on the zzso zzso via zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso data revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity zzso in both normal zzso 21 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso The number of receptors was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in normal cells zzso zzso 96 zzso This increase was zzso zzso zzso zzso in second and third passages had a normal level of zzso Analysis of the zzso species by zzso revealed that both type I and type II zzso are zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso the type I zzso was the most zzso in all zzso No difference in the relative amount of type I zzso zzso level was found between normal and zzso zzso A blocking zzso against the type I zzso completely zzso in both normal and zzso cells, the zzso binding and zzso beta zzso zzso production, whereas the treatment with zzso II zzso was zzso 

These results indicate that the type I zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso and is responsible for zzso the zzso zzso of these cells by zzso This phenomenon is probably secondary to an zzso in the zzso regulation of the type I zzso Although type II zzso is also zzso its translation seems to be zzso or this zzso is already zzso
