The zzso zzso of zzso contains the genes zzso zzso (formerly called zzso and zzso which are zzso transcribed in that order from a single promoter, zzso C4 is an zzso zzso which is processed from the precursor zzso C4 zzso acts as a zzso zzso of zzso thereby also zzso zzso zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso and the overlapping zzso and zzso zzso We show, by means of zzso deletion analysis, that zzso is zzso coupled to zzso An internal zzso deletion of zzso making up zzso of the zzso still allows zzso synthesis at a reduced rate, indicating that a functionally active zzso gene product is zzso for zzso zzso We identify the product of the zzso gene as a zzso protein which interferes with cell zzso The results suggest that zzso expression of zzso in the absence of a functionally active zzso prevents zzso zzso formation because of its zzso effect on the host zzso
