zzso zzso is a dramatic disease of the upper respiratory tract in poultry caused by a zzso In this study we investigated the characteristics of western European field zzso of infectious zzso virus zzso to gain more information on their zzso The examined 104 zzso collected from acute outbreaks during the last 35 years, originated from eight different countries: Switzerland zzso Germany zzso Sweden zzso the United Kingdom zzso Italy zzso Belgium zzso Austria zzso and Norway zzso Two vaccines, a chicken zzso origin product and a tissue culture origin product, were included in the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to amplify a zzso DNA zzso of zzso using zzso generated for the zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso of the resulting zzso products by restriction zzso zzso restriction zzso length zzso analysis was carried zzso zzso zzso of three field zzso and both vaccine strains were selected for zzso Here 98 field zzso showed the same zzso pattern and were identical to both vaccine strains zzso zzso They differed from five Swiss zzso with identical zzso pattern zzso 2) and one Swedish isolate zzso zzso The present study demonstrated that at least three clones of zzso have been circulating in western Europe during the last 35 zzso The 104 zzso analyzed showed a high genetic similarity regarding the zzso zzso and a large majority of the field zzso zzso were genetically related to the vaccine zzso
