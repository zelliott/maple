The single gene zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The gene was found to contain three zzso one lying immediately after the translation initiation zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence indicated that zzso zzso contains 19 zzso acid differences from zzso zzso including extensions at both zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that similar levels of zzso zzso are present throughout growth and development of zzso zzso A complete copy of the zzso zzso was prepared, and an zzso pair zzso complementary to the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso transformation zzso zzso such that expression of the zzso transcript was driven by the zzso I gamma zzso zzso cells were selected and maintained at low cell density, a condition resulting in minimal activity of the zzso I zzso High level expression was induced by allowing the zzso to reach high cell density or by growing them in the presence of medium zzso by high density zzso Under these conditions, in which zzso zzso and protein levels were reduced about zzso the zzso zzso zzso lost the ability to complete zzso A zzso ring formed and zzso but the zzso linking daughter cells failed to zzso The resulting cell population contained zzso cells and networks of cells connected by zzso zzso zzso cell division was restored when the cells were diluted to low zzso These observations have identified a new point at which zzso may regulate cell zzso
