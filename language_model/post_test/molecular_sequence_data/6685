zzso zzso growth factor receptors zzso associate with coated pit zzso proteins zzso in zzso zzso a mechanism for zzso retention in coated pits during zzso Using an in zzso binding zzso we localized the zzso binding zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and confirmed specificity by competition with a synthetic zzso corresponding to this zzso A zzso zzso lacking this zzso binding zzso did not associate with zzso in zzso but demonstrated zzso and zzso zzso indistinguishable from its zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso are distinct from zzso binding zzso and that processes other than association with zzso regulate zzso of zzso
