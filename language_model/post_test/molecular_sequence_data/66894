zzso zzso males lack zzso and have evolved a mechanism of zzso zzso segregation that is independent of both the zzso and zzso segregation systems of zzso The zzso zzso gene is specifically required in males for proper segregation of zzso and provides a genetic tool for understanding zzso mechanisms of pairing and segregation as well as differences in sex zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report on the cloning of the zzso gene and the molecular characterization of zzso zzso zzso experiments using a zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso to predicted Berkeley zzso Genome Project zzso gene zzso and that zzso expression is required in the male germ line prior to zzso stage zzso zzso with this early zzso requirement, expression of zzso was found to be independent of regulators of zzso M phase initiation or zzso The predicted zzso protein contains three zzso zzso zzso one at the zzso zzso and two in tandem at the zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso a zzso to zzso repeat is zzso in three related zzso zzso On the basis of these findings, we propose a role for zzso as a bridging zzso that holds zzso zzso together via zzso zzso
