The zzso zzso locus zzso has an zzso expression and is positively zzso by its gene product, a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso sequencing method was used here to describe, in leaf and zzso the zzso pattern of a zzso pair region of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the C zzso are zzso whereas in zzso the zzso content is zzso zzso of these zzso patterns indicates that the zzso zzso expression does not result from the zzso of any specific C zzso and that, in zzso zzso interacts with a zzso target zzso zzso zzso experiments using a zzso partially zzso and zzso zzso promoter fragments showed that, in zzso the zzso protein binds to the major groove of a zzso target zzso although its binding activity decreases at increasing levels of zzso and is more effectively reduced by zzso of the lower strand than of the upper strand of the zzso Using partially zzso zzso cell zzso we also show that, besides the zzso zzso other proteins specifically bind to a partially zzso zzso promoter fragment, therefore indicating that in plants a subset of different proteins may mediate the expression of a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso
