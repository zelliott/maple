zzso and leaner, two zzso of the mouse zzso zzso have been studied extensively as models for human zzso Here we describe the isolation, zzso and expression analysis of zzso a gene zzso the alpha zzso of a proposed zzso calcium channel, and also report the physical mapping and expression patterns of the zzso human zzso DNA sequencing and gene expression data demonstrate that zzso zzso are the primary cause of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso mice, and suggest that zzso locus zzso and human diseases, episodic zzso 2 and familial zzso zzso represent zzso in mouse and human versions of the same zzso zzso
