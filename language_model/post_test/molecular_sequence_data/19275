In the human zzso locus a number of zzso are transcribed from the zzso regions in the opposite direction to zzso zzso We observed that the zzso organization of genes for the zzso and zzso proteins is highly zzso between human and zzso We examined the expression profiles of these zzso and zzso zzso in various human zzso The expression patterns of zzso in human zzso coincide with those of the adjacent zzso zzso that are zzso expressed along the zzso zzso This coordinated expression was observed even in transformed tumors and cancer cell lines, suggesting that the expression of zzso is prerequisite for the regulated expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso transcribed from the most upstream position of the zzso cluster possesses an zzso short stretch which potentially forms an zzso zzso secondary zzso Our data suggest a critical role for zzso in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
