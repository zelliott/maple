zzso a type II zzso protein of the zzso brush border, is sorted directly to the zzso membrane of zzso canine kidney II zzso zzso targeting appears to be zzso by an zzso segment that contains a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso domain consisting of two short zzso repeats, A and zzso zzso signals within these repeats were characterized by using green fluorescent protein zzso as a zzso zzso with a zzso signal zzso and both repeats A and B were zzso zzso Similar zzso lacking zzso repeats were zzso zzso Either repeat A or B was sufficient to direct zzso targeting of zzso zzso zzso alone were not sufficient for targeting because fusion to a different zzso motif did not alter the random zzso of zzso and several zzso with zzso in either repeat A or B were zzso and zzso zzso In addition, repeat B appears to contain an zzso targeting signal that functions in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that, unlike several other zzso targeted membrane and soluble zzso zzso sorting of zzso zzso proteins does not appear to zzso zzso zzso
