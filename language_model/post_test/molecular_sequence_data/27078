zzso proteins in plants offer a source of carbon and nitrogen to zzso zzso in the form of root zzso and zzso organic zzso This report describes an zzso transport system dedicated to the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have designated genes involved in zzso metabolism as zzso genes and show that an zzso zzso strain lacking putative transport genes zzso is unable to grow with or transport zzso when this compound is available as a sole source of zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso as modulated by a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Although alfalfa root zzso contain zzso zzso we demonstrate that the transport system is not highly expressed in zzso suggesting that zzso are not exposed to high levels of free zzso in zzso In addition to zzso we report that zzso zzso encodes a second independent mechanism that enables transport of zzso This secondary transport mechanism is induced in zzso cells and likely zzso a system involved in zzso zzso This study represents the first genetic description of a zzso zzso transport system, and the ability to metabolize zzso may contribute significantly toward the ecological success of zzso bacteria such as the zzso
