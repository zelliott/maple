Isolation of infectious molecular clones has been valuable to our understanding of zzso zzso Two infectious molecular clones of zzso were isolated zzso from a zzso subject at different stages of the disease, using a standard zzso zzso zzso and a novel progressive amplification zzso We found the progressive amplification procedure was simpler and more specific than the conventional plaque zzso zzso The two infectious zzso clones had distinct cell zzso and zzso zzso The zzso clone obtained at the zzso stage of the disease was zzso zzso and had a zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso clone obtained at the stage of AIDS development was dual zzso for T cells and zzso and induced zzso A detailed analysis of the restriction sites of the two clones showed 9 of 21 sites to be zzso These unique restriction sites were predominantly localized in the envelope zzso Furthermore, the zzso sequence analysis of the entire zzso region supported the results from the restriction analysis and showed that these two clones are closely zzso and the differences are restricted to the variable zzso The difference in zzso acid sequences in the zzso region may explain the observed differences in T cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso of two distinct infectious molecular clones from the same patient at different stages of the disease may be useful in studies on the mechanism of zzso zzso
