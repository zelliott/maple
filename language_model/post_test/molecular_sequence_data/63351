The zzso structure and organization of a new and distinct zzso that is widespread in zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso DNA zzso was zzso zzso zzso in size and shared many of the features of the members of the zzso zzso such as the presence of genes potentially coding for the movement zzso the inclusion body zzso and the reverse zzso zzso and an zzso region consisting of a potential zzso zzso However, the virus differed from the previously described zzso mosaic zzso and other known zzso in that the zzso transmission factor zzso was absent and the putative coat protein contained a zzso deletion and was fused zzso with the zzso zzso identity at the zzso acid level with known zzso including a previously reported zzso from zzso was low and ranged from 32 to zzso The absence of an zzso and the highly divergent nature of the zzso sequence are characteristics of this new zzso that is widely associated with zzso
