zzso zzso in female zzso zzso are mosaic due to random X zzso In contrast to mice, X zzso zzso does not occur during the zzso of human female zzso cells to induced zzso stem cells zzso although this view is zzso Using balanced populations of female zzso patient and control zzso we confirm that all cells in zzso colonies contain an inactive X, and additionally find that all colonies made from the same donor zzso contain the same inactive X zzso zzso this extreme zzso toward a particular dominant, active X is also a general feature of primary female zzso during zzso and the skewing seen in zzso and zzso culture can be alleviated by zzso of zzso These results have important implications for zzso modeling of zzso diseases and the interpretation of long-term culture studies in cancer and zzso using primary female zzso cell zzso
