We here report genes zzso a newly discovered class of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which degrades starch and zzso to zzso Two zzso were zzso and partially zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The obtained zzso zzso acid sequences were used to generate zzso zzso which were further used to probe the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso genes zzso and zzso from the two zzso were fully zzso and found to contain a coding region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A total of 13 small zzso were found in each of the two genes with identical zzso The two zzso genes share zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso They zzso mature zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced molecular masses of zzso and zzso Da agree with the values found for the two zzso zzso A structure analysis of the promoter regions of the zzso genes revealed a number of putative regulatory DNA zzso such as the zzso and zzso sites, which are related to nitrogen and carbon zzso respectively, and the zzso boxes, which are related to zzso expression of zzso A third zzso gene zzso from the fungus zzso zzso was partially zzso to zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from this zzso zzso shares zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene was achieved zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
