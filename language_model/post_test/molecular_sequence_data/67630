White zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous weed of the temperate world that through use of improved zzso has also become the most important zzso of grazed pastures zzso It has long been suspected to be zzso but the zzso ancestral species have remained zzso zzso zzso ancestors were indicated by DNA sequence zzso to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we use further DNA evidence as well as a combination of molecular zzso zzso and zzso and experimental zzso to test the hypothesis that white zzso originated as a hybrid between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso plants were identified with zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences identical to those of white zzso Similarly, zzso zzso plants with nuclear ITS sequences identical to white zzso were also zzso zzso zzso experiments, alternately using labeled zzso DNA zzso from each of the putative ancestral species on the same white zzso cells, showed that half of the zzso zzso with each zzso F1 hybrids were generated by zzso rescue and these showed strong zzso zzso pairing and produced a significant frequency of zzso zzso indicating the likely mode of zzso The F1 hybrids are zzso with white zzso and function as synthetic white zzso a valuable new resource for the zzso of ancestral zzso into modern white zzso for future plant zzso 

Evidence from DNA sequence zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso and breeding experiments supports the hypothesis that a zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso with a zzso coastal species zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso The coming together of these two narrowly adapted species (one zzso and the other zzso along with zzso has led to a zzso hybrid with a broad zzso zzso
