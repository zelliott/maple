The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso of steroid zzso To date, this laboratory has isolated and characterized five distinct zzso complementary zzso zzso in the mouse zzso I through zzso These different forms are expressed in a zzso and zzso manner and fall into two functionally distinct zzso zzso I and III, and most likely II, function as zzso whereas zzso IV and V function as zzso zzso This study describes the isolation, zzso and zzso expression of a sixth member of this gene family, zzso zzso This new zzso functions as an zzso zzso exhibiting very low zzso constant zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso VI is the earliest zzso to be expressed during zzso in cells of embryonic origin at 7 and zzso days zzso zzso and is the major zzso expressed in zzso tissue at the time of zzso zzso days zzso and continues to be expressed in zzso tissue at zzso zzso and zzso days zzso zzso VI is expressed in giant zzso at zzso days zzso and is expressed in the zzso through day zzso zzso In the adult zzso zzso VI appears to be the only zzso expressed in the skin and also is expressed in the zzso but to a lesser extent than zzso zzso Mouse zzso VI zzso is zzso to human zzso I zzso Human type I zzso has been shown to be the only zzso expressed in the zzso and zzso The demonstration that mouse zzso VI functions as a zzso and is the zzso zzso expressed during the first half of pregnancy in zzso tissue and in embryonic cells suggests that this zzso may be involved in local production of zzso which is needed for successful zzso of the zzso and/or maintenance of early zzso
