We have identified five zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso by a positive selection zzso Three of these contained zzso recognizable zzso and two appeared to lack the zzso zzso The packaging of zzso proteins in these zzso has been analyzed with a new gentle cell zzso zzso It employs zzso zzso for the selective zzso of zzso plasma and zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso or by quantitative zzso zzso With this gentle zzso method, it was demonstrated that two zzso are selectively defective in assembling proteins into zzso zzso packages zzso and zzso zzso within zzso but not zzso zzso packages zzso and zzso zzso within zzso but not zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso machinery contains components that are specific for each of three classes of zzso zzso represented by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the two zzso lacking zzso recognizable zzso zzso and zzso all three zzso were zzso to the zzso
