We have characterized a zzso zzso that is expressed predominantly in the styles of tomato zzso according to a tightly regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in mature zzso from flowers at zzso with transcripts zzso in zzso from flowers collected zzso days prior to zzso In zzso zzso of zzso in tissue sections showed that expression of the gene is confined in the zzso to the outer five cell layers of the strands of zzso tissue within the upper two-thirds of the zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso detected in zzso and zzso zzso were more than zzso and zzso lower than the level in zzso zzso A zzso to the zzso gene was detected in tobacco and was also found to be expressed predominantly in the zzso The ability of the zzso zzso region of the tomato gene to appropriately regulate expression of a zzso coding sequence was examined in transformed tomato and tobacco zzso In contrast to results with previously described regulated zzso the zzso promoter functions correctly in the zzso of tomato plants, but fails to direct correct expression in tobacco zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso includes an open reading frame zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a highly zzso zzso region that may represent a signal zzso
