We have characterized the zzso zzso zzso which is expressed by zzso zzso of embryonic bone zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and consists of the zzso zzso zzso There are three zzso zzso zzso One has a short zzso zzso another has a long zzso while the third seems to lack zzso and zzso zzso Except for the zzso zzso zzso is identical to zzso a molecular involved in zzso outgrowth and zzso kidney tumor progression in the chicken and it is significantly zzso with zzso a zzso involved in melanoma progression and zzso in human zzso In the bone zzso the zzso cell population contains zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso give rise to T cells at a frequency of zzso when injected zzso in zzso zzso As zzso zzso cells differentiate into zzso and zzso zzso the zzso cell population seems to contain precursors for multiple zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to cell spreading of zzso zzso adhering to the vascular zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is likely to be involved in cellular zzso and zzso zzso
