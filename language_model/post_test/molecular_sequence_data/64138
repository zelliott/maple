zzso an zzso zzso cell zzso factor, plays a pivotal role in the development of zzso and zzso nervous zzso Despite lacking a zzso segment, zzso is associated with the cell membrane during the zzso cell division of zzso neural precursor cells and is selectively zzso to one of the two progeny cells from a zzso cell zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso domain that is essential for both the zzso zzso and the fate zzso function of zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso NIP zzso zzso NIP is a zzso zzso protein that contains two zzso zzso zzso motifs required for the interaction with zzso In dividing zzso zzso NIP is zzso to the cell membrane with zzso in a zzso cortical zzso zzso of NIP in zzso cells recruited zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso This recruitment of zzso to membrane by NIP was dependent on the presence of at least one zzso zzso In zzso Schneider 2 cells, NIP and zzso were zzso at the plasma zzso zzso of NIP expression by zzso interference released zzso to the zzso These results suggest that a direct zzso interaction between NIP and zzso is necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of zzso to the plasma zzso zzso of zzso to a zzso cortical zzso in a dividing zzso is essential for zzso to function as an intrinsic cell fate zzso
