The zzso nature of zzso and zzso poses serious challenges to in zzso zzso characterization in intact zzso zzso in zzso systems provide an alternative promising medium for the expression and characterization of protein zzso and function in a zzso context that bears several similarities to the cellular zzso In addition, zzso zzso has recently emerged as a convenient method for protein selective isotope zzso providing significant advantages for detailed zzso zzso We report the zzso expression of the model protein zzso zzso in an zzso coli zzso system and the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the expression zzso In contrast with in zzso protein production under control of the strong zzso promoter, zzso is expressed in zzso in zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by mass zzso were performed to confirm the protein zzso In order to probe the zzso of the newly expressed protein and investigate the feasibility of in zzso structural analysis, high resolution protein characterization was carried out by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression in a zzso environment is a convenient method for the production of soluble zzso protein under conditions amenable to selective zzso zzso Yields can be easily zzso by zzso zzso zzso
