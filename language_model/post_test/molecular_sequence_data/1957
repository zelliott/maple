DNA zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso of human zzso zzso has been shown to participate in DNA damage repair by removing zzso blocking zzso zzso shows similarity to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso By comparison to zzso zzso a well-studied member of this family, we designed conservative and zzso zzso of likely active site zzso of zzso and tested them in a variety of zzso From the loss or impairment of activity, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as being involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the most critical since maximum zzso was seen with even conservative zzso zzso bound DNA through its active site in a zzso manner and exhibited a preference for zzso Although zzso bound more strongly to DNA with a free 3' zzso it also bound well to zzso closed DNA, suggesting a possible zzso scanning zzso DNA binding studies further indicated that zzso coordinates zzso through zzso and zzso and contacts the DNA 3' end through zzso The removal of zzso involved a zzso zzso and our results support zzso as being the point of zzso zzso On the basis of these similarities in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso we propose a reaction mechanism for zzso which explains its strict zzso zzso
