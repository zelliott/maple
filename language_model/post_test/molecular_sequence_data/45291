In our previous zzso zzso analysis, we identified 53 mature zzso zzso whose function was unknown, in zzso We zzso these genes from the viewpoint of the specific zzso acid zzso Out of 53 zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso motif zzso indicating that they were novel small zzso zzso From the search of specific elements in promoter regions, several zzso elements were zzso In order to determine whether three promoters were functional in zzso or not, the gene zzso with promoter regions fused to the zzso gene were transformed into zzso zzso analysis showed that these promoters were active in the mature zzso grains and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso formed a zzso family zzso in the rice zzso From the results, zzso might have important roles in mature zzso development and zzso tube zzso
