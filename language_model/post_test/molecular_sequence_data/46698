To study the sequence diversity of the zzso region zzso in the putative envelope protein zzso of zzso in Beijing and its zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso derived from plasma of 46 patients infected with zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and directly zzso by using zzso zzso chain zzso and zzso chain termination zzso 

The zzso was found in zzso positions of zzso zzso which had some differences with other zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso sequence zzso rates of these zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the zzso acid sequence zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were 6 zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two highly zzso zzso acids were only found in this zzso 

The further study of the diversity of zzso and its biological significance will be beneficial to the development of zzso zzso
