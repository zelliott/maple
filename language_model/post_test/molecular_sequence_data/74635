zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso mainly through zzso of zzso and executioner zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso of the former zzso is implemented through the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, while the zzso of the latter is accomplished by the interaction of the zzso region located between the zzso and the zzso zzso with their active zzso Both modes of zzso are antagonized by zzso which is released from zzso during the initiation of the intrinsic zzso zzso Although the mechanism of zzso interference in zzso zzso of zzso is clearly established, the mechanism by which zzso interferes with the zzso of the executioner zzso by zzso remains largely zzso To address this issue, we performed a limited zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso Under these conditions, the zzso of the zzso region was diminished zzso Furthermore, the rate of association of zzso and zzso with zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso was reduced drastically, suggesting that zzso zzso restricts the exposure of the zzso zzso A limited zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso (the zzso domain of human zzso as negative controls was also zzso zzso laser zzso zzso analysis of the fragments revealed the identity of protected sites, suggesting that the zzso domain makes numerous contacts with the large zzso of zzso zzso combined with the results from zzso experiments, strongly suggest that the groove for the zzso motif on the zzso favors binding to the zzso of the large zzso rather than to the small zzso of zzso Our results further show that the zzso pocket of zzso is first occupied by the zzso region, followed by the interaction of the zzso of the zzso with the zzso site of the zzso zzso
