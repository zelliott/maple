zzso zzso were obtained for the type 2 zzso site in particulate methane zzso zzso from zzso album zzso grown on zzso and zzso The concentration of the type 2 zzso signal was approximately 200 zzso per 25 zzso protein in packed cells and membrane zzso a concentration that is consistent with its attribution to zzso and the zzso parameters were consistent with electron zzso resonance zzso parameters previously assigned to zzso The zzso structure due to nitrogen is better resolved because I zzso 1/2 for zzso whereas I zzso 1 for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso structure is resolved in the g region of the zzso zzso At low zzso frequency zzso the resolution of the nitrogen zzso structure zzso zzso are attributed to type 2 zzso in which zzso zzso is bound to four (less likely three) nitrogen donor zzso
