For the model zzso zzso zzso a zzso gene zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was generated as a sensitive molecular tool to study gene expression from the nuclear zzso In the past, monitoring promoter activity in zzso employing the commonly used zzso zzso by zzso zzso was hampered due to the detection limit of the reporter zzso especially if analyzing weak zzso In this work, the expression of zzso from such promoters resulted in an average zzso activity at least 500 times higher than that detected for the zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso of zzso zzso efficiently zzso the export of the zzso into the culture medium of zzso strain zzso ( - ), and the characterization of the zzso protein showed an unexpected temperature instability, probably arising from zzso modifications made by the zzso To further test the utility of zzso promoter sequences originating from different viral zzso were analyzed for their ability to drive zzso expression in zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso mosaic virus zzso displayed a significant zzso activity and this happened only when the zzso region of the zzso region of the zzso was omitted from the zzso expression zzso zzso proved to be a superior quantifiable reporter gene for the analysis of zzso promoter sequences in zzso zzso
