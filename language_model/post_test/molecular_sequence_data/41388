Juvenile hormone zzso zzso a great diversity of processes in insect development and zzso It plays a critical role in controlling the zzso cycles of female mosquitoes by preparing zzso for blood zzso and egg zzso Here, we show that in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes zzso III control of gene expression is zzso by a zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We identified Aedes zzso as a zzso protein using zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso required the presence of zzso zzso In newly zzso female zzso the expression of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso was dependent on both the ratio of light to dark periods and zzso zzso Their expression was compromised by in zzso zzso interference zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the steroid zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso III was not effective in induction of zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso in fat bodies of female mosquitoes with zzso zzso zzso or zzso A sequence containing an zzso motif from the Aedes zzso gene promoter specifically zzso with a protein complex, which included zzso and zzso from the female zzso fat body nuclear zzso These results indicate that a zzso zzso mediates zzso III zzso of zzso and zzso genes in the context of zzso zzso regulation in female mosquitoes during zzso zzso This study provides an important insight into the understanding of the molecular basis of zzso zzso
