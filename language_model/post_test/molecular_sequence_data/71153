The expression of type 1 zzso in zzso coli is phase zzso with cells switching between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The phase variation is dependent on the orientation of a 314 zzso DNA element (the zzso that zzso DNA zzso DNA inversion requires either zzso or zzso zzso zzso that differ in both specificity and zzso Whereas zzso promotes zzso with little zzso bias, zzso promotes zzso in the zzso direction zzso In zzso cells, zzso activity zzso and, zzso most bacteria are zzso Here, it is shown that zzso specificity is caused by two different, but zzso zzso First, zzso shows a strong preference for the switch in the ON orientation as a zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso sequence of the zzso binding sites is a key factor in determining zzso zzso although one or more additional zzso sites that flank the zzso switch also appear to be zzso zzso the orientation of the switch controls zzso in zzso most probably to control zzso zzso
