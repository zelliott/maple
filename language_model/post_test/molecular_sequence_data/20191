In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso by positively regulating the zzso zzso Network zzso Although a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, neither a zzso partner nor a zzso target has been zzso In this report we identify a zzso zzso that physically interacts and zzso with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso display highly similar zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso that zzso the zzso domain zzso of the largest zzso of zzso zzso II zzso Interestingly, we find that zzso and zzso are required for zzso of zzso zzso found in the zzso repeats of the zzso To determine if zzso could be a zzso target, we replaced the native zzso gene with a synthetic gene zzso a zzso protein in which zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso carrying this zzso were similar to zzso zzso They were viable, displayed genetic interactions with the zzso and were unable to complete zzso upon zzso of the cell division zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso plays a novel zzso role in the regulation of zzso
