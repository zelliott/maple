When the zzso zzso zzso was transformed with DNA that shares no zzso to the zzso three classes of zzso were zzso In the most common class, the DNA was inserted as the result of a reaction that appears to require base pairing between the target sequence and the terminal few base pairs of the transforming DNA zzso In the second class, no such zzso was zzso and the transforming DNA was integrated next to a zzso or zzso in the zzso it is likely that these integration events were zzso by zzso zzso The final class involved the in zzso zzso of transforming DNA with zzso linear fragments of zzso zzso
