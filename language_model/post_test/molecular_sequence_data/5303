zzso sequences of zzso promoters recognized by zzso coli zzso zzso were subjected to a zzso cluster analysis based on the zzso method of zzso Five regions permitting promoter zzso were zzso They are located at zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were independently zzso on the basis of their sequence zzso in each of these regions and typical sequence elements were zzso The putative functional significance of the revealed elements is discussed on the basis of available zzso zzso Those promoters that have a high degree of zzso with the revealed sequence elements were selected as representatives of corresponding promoter groups and the presence of other sequence motifs in their structure was zzso Both positive and negative correlations in the presence of particular sequence motifs were zzso however, the degree of these zzso was not high in all cases, probably indicating that different combinations of the signal elements may create a zzso The list of promoter sequences with the presence of different sequence elements is available on request by zzso zzso zzso
