zzso zzso zzso is used to probe the structure of zzso and repression complexes at the zzso regulatory region in zzso Both the zzso operator, 01, and the zzso zzso are found to be protected from zzso zzso by the zzso zzso on zzso DNA, and hypersensitive sites appear on both strands around zzso zzso zzso between 01 and zzso This zzso site is zzso with the site of the DNA zzso shown previously to form within a loop caused by simultaneous zzso binding to 01 and zzso zzso zzso are also observed both upstream from zzso zzso protein zzso and downstream from bound zzso zzso in open promoter zzso In both open and closed complexes the binding of zzso partially protects the backbone from zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is shown to be required for both closed and open complex zzso Taken together with previous zzso data, the results suggest that zzso zzso complexes involve DNA bent towards a protein core consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
