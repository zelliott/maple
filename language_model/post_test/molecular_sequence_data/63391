zzso zzso is zzso through the Kennedy pathway, but more than 50% of PC is remodeled through the zzso cycle, zzso the zzso and zzso of PC to attain the final and proper fatty acids within zzso The zzso step is zzso by zzso zzso zzso and we report here the identification of a novel zzso which we named zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso family and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56 zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso zzso showed significantly increased zzso activity as assessed by thin layer zzso analysis with zzso preference toward zzso fatty zzso zzso is localized within the zzso zzso and is primarily expressed in zzso zzso including liver, zzso and zzso In a human zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in virtually complete loss of membrane zzso activity, suggesting that zzso is primarily responsible for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso regulated zzso in liver in a zzso zzso zzso zzso fashion, implicating a role of zzso in zzso zzso Our studies identify a zzso zzso that plays a critical role in PC zzso in zzso zzso and provide an invaluable tool for future investigations on how PC zzso may potentially impact zzso and zzso zzso
