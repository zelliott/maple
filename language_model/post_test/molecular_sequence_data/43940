Recent work has suggested that important zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso lie external to the major repeat regions of the zzso We have studied two naturally exposed human populations zzso and zzso New zzso and determined the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso overlapping synthetic peptides spanning zzso acids 76 348 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and overlapping peptides representing the zzso repeats of the zzso strain of zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso response is directed towards areas within the repeat region as well as areas external to this; but the dominant zzso recognized by the two populations zzso were zzso One zzso lying external to the repeats and recognized by both zzso partially zzso an area of the protein referred to as region zzso zzso from zzso zzso New zzso and zzso contained zzso to this zzso zzso single letter zzso acid sequence zzso which were capable of recognizing zzso as determined by quantitative zzso zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso had zzso to this zzso compared with zzso who had zzso to the central repeats of the zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso did not induce zzso to zzso However, zzso with overlapping zzso zzso representing this region zzso or zzso induced specific zzso but only two zzso recognized both zzso and zzso and, by zzso the overlapping zzso sequence zzso zzso in these two zzso could bind zzso zzso in zzso however, in contrast, nine zzso which recognized either zzso or zzso alone did not bind zzso Only one of two zzso containing zzso recognizing zzso stained zzso zzso zzso This serum also recognized an zzso dependent upon two zzso acids zzso to zzso These data suggest that the fine specificity of zzso is a critical zzso for binding to both zzso and zzso
