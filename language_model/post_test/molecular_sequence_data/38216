Recent attention has focused on the geographic variation of dengue zzso since major zzso may follow introduction of a new virus strain into susceptible zzso We cloned and zzso a very interesting Mexican isolate zzso which is zzso unique by signature analysis with respect to all other zzso zzso zzso This strain is also unique in biological behavior zzso and is of zzso significance in zzso The zzso Mexican isolate sequence information was compared with that of other zzso analyzing the branching structure of the zzso tree reconstructed from the E gene zzso acid zzso The E zzso is target for zzso zzso and zzso responses, and defines the zzso and zzso of zzso In the zzso our strain was located in the position of greatest zzso within zzso Also, frequency analysis of zzso acids revealed a very different signature pattern from that found in viral zzso
