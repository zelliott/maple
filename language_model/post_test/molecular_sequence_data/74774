The understanding of genetic risk factors for chronic zzso increased in the last decade with the discovery of zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso The first zzso was detected at the zzso zzso site of the protein zzso and subsequently two other zzso in this region, zzso and zzso were described that resulted in a similar zzso of zzso zzso This study reports a novel zzso zzso within this region and zzso the resulting molecular properties at the zzso zzso 

Blood samples of a zzso zzso carrier family were zzso for zzso zzso using melting point curve analysis, restriction zzso and DNA zzso zzso dependent properties of the zzso sequence were zzso by molecular zzso The zzso kinetic of the zzso zzso sequence was measured by a novel zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso using designed 11 zzso acid peptides from zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso site at zzso 122 coupled to a zzso zzso zzso The kinetic of zzso zzso zzso was measured in a zzso zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso 

DNA sequencing revealed a novel G to A transition at position zzso of the published zzso sequence zzso zzso The zzso results in an zzso acid substitution of zzso by zzso at position 121 zzso of the zzso zzso Four additional zzso carriers could be identified among the relatives while only the first patient developed chronic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed a change in the bond pattern between the zzso region and the calcium binding loop, whereas zzso zzso showed an increased zzso zzso rate with a reaction kinetic elevated by more than zzso 

The novel zzso zzso zzso highlights the surface exposed region zzso zzso as a hotspot for zzso zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso provide evidence for an zzso zzso dependent increase in zzso to zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site suggesting an enhanced zzso and a zzso at the zzso zzso
