zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso in retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent therapeutic targets for the zzso zzso we sought to identify zzso of zzso zzso and determine their effects in Royal College of zzso zzso rats, an animal model of zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso peptides of the zzso zzso domain of zzso Two zzso peptides zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity zzso zzso and zzso respectively), but not other zzso Western zzso showed that zzso of both zzso peptides caused specific degradation of zzso zzso zzso structure of zzso suggested that the peptides zzso and zzso corresponded to the regions forming salt bridges between the zzso core domain 2 and the zzso zzso We determined the zzso regions of zzso peptides zzso and zzso using zzso and one zzso zzso inhibited the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso We next zzso the zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Using isolated rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso The zzso injection of zzso zzso also prevented retinal zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso and preserved retinal function assessed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso application of zzso zzso also prevented zzso of retinal zzso in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso offers a new zzso for treating zzso
