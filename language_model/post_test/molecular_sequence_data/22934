zzso is an zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso involved in collagen zzso This study examined the zzso pattern of zzso gene expression in zzso cultured cells and zzso zzso analysis revealed that protein zzso by the zzso zzso exhibited zzso identity with fish, avian and zzso zzso In A6 kidney zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso were present zzso and zzso by heat shock but not zzso zzso including zzso and zzso both of which enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso and retarded zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso gene expression but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso was present zzso throughout zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso was enriched in zzso associated with collagen production including zzso zzso and head zzso Heat zzso zzso of zzso zzso was enhanced primarily in embryonic zzso already exhibiting zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that the pattern of zzso zzso gene expression is similar to zzso in response to heat shock but also displays unique features including a response to a zzso zzso and preferential expression in zzso zzso
