The zzso translation initiation factor 2 zzso binds the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso This complex associates with the 40 S zzso zzso which then, with the aid of other factors, binds to the zzso end of the zzso and zzso to the first zzso zzso where zzso promotes zzso zzso followed by the formation of the 80 S zzso Here we provide a comparative sequence analysis of the beta zzso of zzso and its zzso counterpart zzso zzso differs from zzso in not possessing an zzso extension implicated in binding zzso zzso and zzso The remaining sequences are highly zzso and are shared with zzso Previously isolated zzso in the zzso zzso which allow initiation of translation at zzso zzso due to the uncovering of an intrinsic zzso activity in zzso involve zzso that are zzso in zzso but not in zzso We show that the sequence of zzso zzso to zzso is sufficient for binding zzso the only zzso with which it zzso and zzso at the most, 78 zzso zzso does not interact with zzso despite its similarity with zzso probably because of a gap in zzso in this zzso These observations have implications for the evolution of the mechanism of translation zzso
