Though it possesses four zzso bonds the zzso fold is amenable to chemical zzso using a zzso zzso Thus, we zzso a zzso zzso toxin from snake with high yield and showed that the synthetic and native toxins have the same structural and biological zzso Both were characterized by the same zzso zzso zzso identical high binding affinity zzso zzso 22 zzso 5 zzso for the muscular zzso zzso zzso and identical low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso Then, we engineered an additional loop zzso by a fifth zzso bond at the tip of the central zzso This loop is normally present in longer snake toxins that bind with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Not only did the zzso toxin still bind with the same high affinity to the muscular zzso but also it displayed a zzso higher affinity zzso zzso 100 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso as compared with the parental zzso zzso This result demonstrates that the engineered loop zzso at least in part, to the high affinity of zzso toxins for zzso zzso zzso That zzso proteins with four or five zzso bonds are amenable to chemical synthesis opens new perspectives for engineering new activities on this zzso
