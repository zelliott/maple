The zzso protein is a true late gene product of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso whose exact function is unknown but which exhibits zzso properties and which is zzso on zzso zzso In order to determine whether the zzso protein is zzso by cellular zzso or by zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene has been cloned and zzso expressed in zzso zzso In addition, zzso cell lines have been selected for their ability to express zzso protein zzso zzso and analysis by two-dimensional zzso of zzso and zzso expressed zzso protein demonstrated that, indeed, multiple zzso of the protein occurs in absence of zzso zzso zzso indicating that the protein behaves as a natural zzso for cellular zzso In addition, a sequence zzso of the zzso zzso due to a difference in the number of zzso repeats, has been characterized between different strains of zzso
