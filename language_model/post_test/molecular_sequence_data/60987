The zzso gene is centrally located within the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso With one exception, the 14 genes within the cluster are zzso zzso zzso transcript is first detected late in zzso coincidental with the appearance of mature zzso and accumulates approximately zzso in zzso We show that zzso expression is restricted to zzso with zzso abundance decreasing immediately after induction of zzso zzso zzso and translation are not temporally separated and, similar to zzso zzso zzso a zzso fusion protein is first detected with the appearance of mature zzso and decreases after induction of zzso zzso zzso expression requires both a zzso mechanism of regulation, responsible for repression in zzso and a zzso mechanism of regulation, responsible for zzso zzso We show by functional analysis of upstream DNA sequences that a zzso sequence and two adjacent zzso direct repeats are necessary for zzso zzso expression of both the intact zzso gene and the reporter zzso At least one repeat zzso is required for normal levels of zzso We find that the zzso gene is not a direct target of the zzso and zzso zzso regulators, but of a yet unidentified zzso zzso zzso
