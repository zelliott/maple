The zzso of zzso G proteins is accomplished primarily by the zzso zzso exchange activity of zzso G zzso zzso The existence of zzso zzso zzso exchange factors for G proteins has also been zzso zzso zzso screens with zzso and zzso as zzso were performed to identify binding partners of these zzso Two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso were identified in these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso characterization of zzso zzso revealed that it is a potent zzso zzso exchange factor for a subset of zzso proteins including zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso zzso exchange was zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso stimulates release of zzso and forms a stable zzso transition state complex with the zzso zzso this complex zzso upon binding of zzso to zzso
