The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso G protein complex from wheat zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were revealed to interact both in zzso and in zzso and zzso was shown to enhance the zzso activity of zzso zzso is a member of the zzso gene family in wheat with a single zzso domain and is induced during cold zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso was used to zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso to the plasma membrane zzso Even though zzso zzso signaling and zzso signaling have both been shown to play a role in the response to environmental stresses in plants, little is known about the interaction between zzso proteins and zzso The GAP activity of zzso towards zzso suggests it may play a role in the zzso of zzso as part of the stress response in zzso zzso was also shown to interact with the zzso zzso C, zzso not only in the PM but also in the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso was also shown to interact with zzso in the PM and zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso interaction showed that the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso is enhanced by high zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso with zzso zzso and zzso showed the interaction with zzso to be competitive, which suggests that zzso may play a role in the zzso feedback regulation of both zzso and zzso This hypothesis was further supported by the demonstration that zzso has GAP activity with zzso
