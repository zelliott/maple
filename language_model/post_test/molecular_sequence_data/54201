zzso zzso has distinct advantages for providing insight into protein structures, but faces significant resolution challenges as protein size zzso To alleviate such resonance overlap issues, the ability to produce zzso labeled proteins is zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso A can be used to catalyze the zzso of two separately expressed zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso zzso The yield of zzso zzso labeled zzso protein zzso is approximately zzso The zzso zzso spectrum obtained from this zzso zzso demonstrates successful application of zzso A for zzso labeling of zzso proteins for solution zzso zzso
