A variety of nuclear zzso are believed to associate directly with nascent zzso zzso II transcripts and remain associated during subsequent nuclear zzso processing zzso including zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso To investigate the functions of these proteins by using a combined zzso and genetic approach, we have isolated nuclear zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso Living zzso cells were zzso with zzso light to zzso zzso proteins intimately associated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso were then selectively zzso and the zzso zzso complexes were used to elicit zzso in zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso which detect a variety of zzso proteins were zzso Here we characterize one of these zzso zzso zzso is one of the major proteins associated with nuclear zzso zzso in zzso as detected by zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso using both zzso and zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso protein is localized within the zzso The deduced primary structure of zzso indicates that it is composed of at least two distinct types of zzso zzso zzso an zzso box recently described in a variety of zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso motif repeats related to the zzso motifs of the largest zzso of zzso zzso I, II, and zzso In zzso zzso zzso DNA binding studies indicate that although both the zzso box and zzso motifs bind zzso zzso and zzso DNA, the zzso motifs also bind to zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso within a cluster of zzso zzso and its expression is essential for cell zzso
