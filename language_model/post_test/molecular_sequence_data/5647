The general zzso factor zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso of zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso to assess the role of zzso zzso acids in several important regions of zzso zzso These include zzso in the highly zzso zzso region and basic zzso in the D1 and E1 core domain zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in growth zzso in zzso reduced zzso zzso activity in zzso and an inability to form stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso retained the ability to respond to zzso zzso in zzso and to the zzso zzso in zzso supporting the view that these basic zzso play a role in zzso zzso In addition, 14 zzso zzso were introduced in the zzso zzso zzso Three of these zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed altered growth properties in zzso and were compromised for supporting zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was impaired for zzso zzso II interaction, while the zzso zzso exhibited altered zzso start site selection both in zzso and in zzso and, surprisingly, was more active than the wild type in the formation of stable DB zzso These results support the view that the zzso domain is involved in the direct interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso II and suggest that this domain may interact with DNA and/or zzso the formation of a DB zzso
