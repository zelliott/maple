zzso junctions zzso are the simplest and most commonly occurring zzso zzso zzso They consist of three double zzso arms (A to zzso connected at the junction point, with or without a number of zzso bases in one or more of the three different zzso zzso junctions with two zzso bases in one strand zzso have a high tendency to adopt either of two alternative stacked zzso in which two of the three arms A, B and C are zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso stacking rules, which successfully predict for DNA zzso zzso preference from zzso have been extended to zzso zzso Three novel DNA zzso sequences were designed to test the zzso of these extended stacking rules and their zzso behavior was studied by solution zzso All three show the predicted zzso preference even in the absence of zzso zzso The stacking preference for both classes of DNA zzso can thus be predicted from zzso The high-resolution zzso solution structure for one of the stacked zzso is also zzso It shows a zzso local and global structure defined by an extensive set of classical zzso restraints and residual zzso zzso Analysis of its global zzso and that of other representatives of the zzso family, shows that the relative zzso of the stacked and zzso arms, are restricted to narrow regions of zzso space, which can be understood from geometric zzso Together, these findings open up the possibility of full prediction of zzso zzso zzso and global zzso directly from zzso
