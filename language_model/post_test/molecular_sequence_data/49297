zzso zzso have been known as zzso zzso consisting of a zzso domain connected to a zzso domain zzso by an zzso zzso zzso A molecular zzso approach has been chosen to find structural differences between two related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have found that zzso and zzso show a high primary zzso and zzso structure zzso zzso although possessing a good ability for raw starch degradation, did not show consensus zzso acid zzso to any zzso found in zzso or other zzso zzso Raw starch binding and zzso by zzso must thus depend on the existence of a zzso lying within the intact protein which lacks a separate zzso The zzso represents a structurally new type of zzso zzso
