zzso flux of zzso across human zzso may be facilitated by zzso and/or by zzso zzso zzso Previously we have reported the presence of zzso and zzso in the zzso of human term zzso zzso In the present study, we detected a significant zzso of water, zzso and zzso sensitive to mercury and zzso in zzso from normal term zzso which indicates a functional zzso In addition, we observed an increase of zzso expression in zzso zzso with a lack of functionality of zzso for water and zzso Our data showed a molecular and functional expression of zzso in zzso from normal and zzso zzso In the last case, zzso zzso sensitive to zzso and mercury increased and the zzso protein seems to be zzso These results suggest that the increase of zzso zzso in zzso zzso could be attributed to an increase of expression of zzso more than zzso zzso In conclusion, our results provide new zzso that suggest the involvement of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso mechanism across zzso from mother to fetus in zzso zzso Much further work is needed to define whether the zzso of zzso plays a direct role either in the zzso or in the zzso response of zzso
