Little is known about viral zzso of zzso associated with western zzso encephalitis virus zzso Here, we have zzso six North American zzso zzso in an zzso zzso mouse zzso Full zzso sequence analyses showed zzso or zzso % divergence among the six zzso zzso However, the percentage mortality and mean time to death zzso varied significantly when mice received subcutaneous injections of zzso zzso of each zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and Imperial 181 zzso were the most divergent of the six in zzso zzso zzso caused 100 % mortality by 5 days zzso whereas zzso caused no zzso zzso had significantly higher zzso in the brain than zzso Similar differences in zzso were observed when zzso and zzso were administered by zzso zzso or intravenous zzso zzso was 100 % lethal with an zzso of zzso days when zzso zzso of each virus was administered by zzso zzso in contrast, zzso caused no zzso The presence of zzso in the brains after infection by different routes and the lack of observed mortality confirmed that zzso is zzso but not zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso severity of brain zzso virus distribution patterns, routes of infection and differences in infection of cultured cells, zzso and zzso were identified as zzso and zzso zzso zzso
