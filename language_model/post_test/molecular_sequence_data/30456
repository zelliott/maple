Using Northern zzso analysis we have detected an approximately 840 zzso zzso which is complementary to the zzso leader sequence and the first ten zzso of the coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have determined two zzso start sites for this zzso zzso zzso zzso both within the zzso zzso at about 80 and 90 zzso downstream from the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso clone showed that this zzso species zzso the entire trailer sequence and approximately 20 zzso of the coding sequence of the nearby zzso zzso zzso
