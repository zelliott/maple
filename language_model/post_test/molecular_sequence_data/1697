zzso the gene that maps to common zzso fragile site zzso is frequently affected by aberrations in multiple types of zzso zzso encodes a 46 zzso protein that contains two WW zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso tumor growth of zzso breast cancer zzso Little is known of the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso domain is predicted to be involved in zzso metabolism and the WW zzso are likely involved in zzso zzso In this report, we identify the specific zzso zzso for zzso as zzso and show that the zzso WW domain is responsible for this zzso Using the zzso WW zzso as a probe, we screened zzso protein zzso and identified five zzso zzso The binding to one of these candidates, small membrane protein of the zzso zzso zzso was further zzso and we observed that a specific zzso motif in the zzso zzso sequence was required to interact with the zzso WW domain of zzso In addition, zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso compartments of zzso human breast cancer zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso contains a Group I WW domain that binds known cellular proteins containing the specific zzso zzso Identification and characterization of zzso interacting proteins will lead to an understanding of the biological functions of zzso in normal and tumor zzso
