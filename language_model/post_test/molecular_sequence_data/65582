zzso detachment from zzso zzso is studied as a function of the laser zzso The first step for the detachment is a resonant electronic zzso of the zzso Electronic zzso zzso are reported for three zzso including zzso A comparative study of the detachment yield for 13 peptides was performed at 260 zzso and at 220 zzso At 260 zzso the detachment yield is mainly driven by the sum of the zzso zzso of the aromatic zzso acids that are contained in the zzso At 220 zzso no direct relation is observed between the electron zzso yields and the sum of zzso zzso At this zzso the sequence and the structure of the zzso may have an influence on the zzso zzso
