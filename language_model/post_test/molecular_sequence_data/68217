During previous research on oxidized and reduced zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso qualitative different electron zzso rates were zzso We have now investigated this phenomenon in detail for zzso I and II from zzso zzso which differ significantly in total charge and in which the sequence zzso is the largest among all known zzso We have also characterized the electronic structure of zzso I through zzso zzso and zzso zzso to parallel the existing characterization of zzso II and other zzso This investigation has allowed us to propose a model, according to which the productive zzso for electron transfer occur through a zzso patch near the zzso The effects of total charge and zzso potential are zzso The possible formation of zzso through the zzso patch at liquid zzso temperature is discussed in light of the zzso zzso
