zzso of cells to the B lineage in chickens occurs only during a brief period of zzso B cell zzso then progress through discrete zzso stages resulting in the production of mature B cells that are competent to form a functioning zzso immune system in the adult zzso During zzso chicken B cell precursors undergo tissue and zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso B cell zzso that migrate to the zzso of zzso express the zzso zzso zzso zzso Such cells undergo initial zzso expansion within the zzso without undergoing gene zzso Beginning between days 15 and 17 of zzso B cells in the zzso undergo a tissue specific change in surface zzso that results in the loss of zzso zzso expression and the acquisition of the related zzso structure zzso zzso of zzso identifies B zzso that have begun to undergo gene zzso Before zzso from the zzso zzso zzso undergo another zzso switch in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso switches in zzso allow us to distinguish three populations of B cells in the zzso of zzso at defined stages of development and suggest that regulation of zzso zzso plays a role in B cell development in the zzso
