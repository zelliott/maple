Despite the fact that zzso zzso has many interesting biological features and is a frequent site of zzso formation, relatively little is known about its zzso zzso We have shown recently that a 47 zzso zzso zzso III zzso in conjunction with zzso I (27 zzso and II (15 zzso forms the zzso unit membrane zzso highly specialized zzso characteristic of the zzso surface of zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing revealed that zzso contains up to 20 zzso of zzso zzso attached to a core protein of zzso zzso The presence of an zzso signal zzso sequence and a single zzso domain located near the C zzso plus the zzso location of all the potential zzso sites, points to a type I zzso zzso Thus the mass of the zzso domain (20 zzso plus up to 20 zzso of zzso of zzso greatly exceeds that of its zzso domain (5 zzso Such an zzso mass distribution, a feature shared by the other two major zzso provides a molecular explanation as to why the zzso leaflet of zzso is almost twice as thick as the zzso zzso The fact that of the three major proteins of zzso only zzso has a significant zzso domain suggests that this zzso may play an important role in zzso interaction in terminally differentiated zzso zzso
