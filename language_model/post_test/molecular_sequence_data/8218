Acute organ transplant rejection is characterized by a heavy zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso in the graft zzso lead to increased zzso traffic into the zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso adhere to the zzso of rejecting cardiac transplants, but not to the zzso of zzso zzso or normal hearts analyzed with the in zzso zzso binding zzso zzso with the enhanced zzso zzso the cardiac zzso begins to de zzso express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have been shown to be sequences of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso but not that of zzso zzso or normal controls, also reacted with the zzso G fusion zzso giving further proof of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso could be significantly decreased either by treating the zzso with zzso zzso zzso or by treating the tissue sections with zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso Finally, we zzso zzso several members of the zzso family zzso and analyzed their ability to block zzso zzso to cardiac zzso The zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso (a zzso and zzso zzso (a zzso could all significantly reduce zzso zzso but the zzso by the zzso zzso was clearly superior to other members of the zzso zzso The crucial control zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso but being otherwise similar to the members of zzso family, had no effect on zzso zzso
