Two new zzso peptides related to the zzso family have been isolated by acid extraction from the broad bean zzso zzso The extract was separated by zzso exchange zzso and a fraction showing zzso activity was further zzso by zzso zzso zzso from a single zzso peak was zzso and revealed the presence of two peptides differing by one zzso zzso The peptides were named zzso They are 47 zzso acids long, have an overall positive charge and contain 8 zzso that probably form 4 zzso bridges characteristic of the zzso zzso were active against both zzso and zzso bacteria, but were inactive against the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
