zzso is a zzso zzso toxin that is registered as toxic substance by Chemical Weapons zzso Current detection methods can result in false zzso and/or zzso and their criteria are not based on the identification of the protein zzso acid zzso In this study, zzso monolithic zzso extraction followed by zzso zzso and liquid zzso zzso zzso was developed as a method for rapid and accurate determination of zzso zzso which was immobilized on monolithic zzso was used as a capture zzso for zzso extraction from the sample solution, and the zzso was supported in a zzso spin zzso Recovery of zzso was more than zzso After zzso the extract was zzso with zzso and analyzed by zzso The accurate masses of molecular zzso and zzso zzso of the separated zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso and linear zzso zzso Six zzso which were derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were chosen as marker peptides for the identification of zzso Among these marker zzso two peptides were zzso This method was applied to the determination of zzso from crude zzso The monolithic zzso extraction removed most contaminant zzso from the total zzso zzso of the sample, and the six marker peptides were clearly detected by zzso It takes about 5 h for detection and identification of more than 8 zzso of zzso through the whole zzso and this procedure will be able to deal with the terrorism using chemical zzso
