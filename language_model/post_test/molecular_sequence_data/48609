zzso response factors zzso play important roles in fruit development, zzso defense responses and stress signaling zzso After harvest, zzso fruit such as zzso are subject to a range of problems associated with zzso handling and storage zzso There have been few attempts to evaluate the role of zzso in zzso responses to environmental zzso To investigate the zzso mechanisms underlying fruit zzso zzso and zzso we cloned four zzso from zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contained the zzso zzso zzso domain, which shared high similarity with other reported zzso zzso The zzso gene structures, and zzso zzso motifs in zzso zzso proteins were zzso and compared with those of zzso zzso patterns of zzso were examined during fruit development, under zzso treatment, zzso treatment, zzso stress zzso zzso and pathogen zzso zzso displayed differential expression patterns and expression levels under different experimental zzso zzso and zzso showed a close association with fruit zzso and zzso had a high expression level in the earlier stages during the fruit development zzso The expression of zzso strongly associated with stress zzso These results support the role for zzso zzso in zzso regulation of zzso or zzso genes and thus, in the regulation of zzso zzso processes and stress zzso
