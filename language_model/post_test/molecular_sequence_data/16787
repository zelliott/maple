zzso zzso zzso are predicted to zzso zzso proteins zzso for zzso family G zzso While approximately 50 zzso proteins are predicted to exist in humans, little is known about their zzso zzso Here we show that zzso (also called zzso and zzso a founding member of the zzso family, targets the zzso family zzso zzso which regulates plasma zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso does not function as a GAP for zzso but rather promotes its zzso in zzso zzso associates directly with zzso in its zzso but not zzso zzso zzso experiments pinpoint the site of interaction to the zzso domain of zzso zzso expression of zzso promotes the zzso of zzso to the plasma zzso leading to zzso zzso presumably due to facilitated access to zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso zzso to induce zzso loading of zzso in zzso Finally, short interfering zzso loss of zzso leads to attenuated zzso zzso These studies identify zzso as a novel regulator of the zzso plasma membrane recycling system and reveal an unexpected function for zzso zzso
