By means of the zzso zzso system using the zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso I, zzso as the zzso we isolated a mouse zzso which zzso a protein with significant zzso in zzso acid sequence to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein that was derived from the zzso reacted with a zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso zzso II and did not react with any zzso of zzso zzso I or zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso the largest zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso These results provide zzso evidence that the zzso isolated, named zzso encodes a specific zzso of zzso zzso II, and indicate that the zzso organization of the zzso is zzso between zzso and zzso A possible role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso in the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso is also zzso
