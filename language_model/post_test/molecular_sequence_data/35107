The objective of the present study was to gain new insights into the evolution, zzso zzso and selection pressures imposed on the zzso zzso zzso by examining the changes in the zzso zzso zzso The most recent common zzso of zzso was estimated to have emerged 62 years ago based upon HE gene sequence data obtained from zzso zzso originating from Spain, South Korea, Netherlands, Hungary, and Italy and using the HE gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso The HE gene sequence data zzso all the zzso zzso into two zzso zzso zzso however, various zzso from Spain, Italy, and South Korea did not segregate geographically suggesting very recent zzso of the viruses to these zzso Evidence of zzso was observed between two South Korean zzso that zzso into two distinct zzso Data further suggest that most of the zzso in the HE gene are under negative zzso however, changes within zzso 237 showed an evidence of positive zzso
