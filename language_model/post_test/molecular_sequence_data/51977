zzso genetic studies of the human malaria zzso zzso zzso have been hampered in part due to difficulties in zzso cloning and zzso zzso zzso DNA in zzso This is thought to be a result of the unusual zzso bias zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gel zzso separation of zzso zzso zzso has shown that large zzso zzso resulting from the deletion of DNA from zzso ends, frequently zzso zzso the biological implications of this zzso zzso will require the analysis of large regions of zzso and in particular zzso zzso To overcome the limitations of cloning zzso DNA in bacteria, we have cloned zzso DNA from the zzso zzso strain zzso in zzso as artificial zzso A zzso library with an average insert size of approximately 100 zzso was established and found to have a three to fourfold zzso for zzso zzso Unlike bacterial zzso zzso zzso maintain and zzso large tracts of zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso mapping of zzso clones demonstrates that the cloned DNA is zzso and identical to the native zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso ends of zzso are underrepresented in zzso libraries, we have enriched for these sequences by cloning zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments (from 40 to 130 zzso as zzso by zzso in zzso
