A zzso repetitive element was found in the zzso of the white button zzso zzso zzso and designated zzso It is present in approximately 15 copies per zzso zzso in the commercial strain zzso zzso Analysis of seven copies showed 89 to zzso sequence zzso The repeat has features typical of class II zzso zzso terminal zzso repeats, zzso repeats, and a target site zzso of 7 zzso The latter shows a consensus zzso When used as probe on Southern zzso zzso identifies relatively little variation within traditional and zzso commercial zzso indicating that most strains are identical or have a common zzso In contrast to these zzso high variation is found among zzso zzso Furthermore, a remarkable difference in copy numbers of zzso was found between zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso life cycle and those with a zzso life zzso zzso is a type II zzso not previously reported in zzso and appears to be useful for the identification of strains within the species zzso zzso
