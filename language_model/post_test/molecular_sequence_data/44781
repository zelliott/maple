zzso an important zzso governing smooth muscle cell zzso binds to cultured bovine zzso smooth muscle cells zzso via both the zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although TM zzso expression and functional activity is regulated by zzso in human zzso cells and mouse zzso cells, it remains unclear in those models whether the increased TM zzso expression observed upon zzso stimulation is zzso through the zzso of zzso or via TM zzso We observed in cultured zzso that TM zzso is increased zzso to zzso by either zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso or zzso growth factor zzso The increase in TM zzso with zzso is time dependent zzso at 3 hours), a consequence of increased zzso stability, and accompanied by increases in cell surface TM functional zzso zzso TM zzso was reproduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso of TM zzso by zzso is zzso via the zzso We speculate that increases in zzso TM zzso and activity after zzso may contribute to the impaired zzso formation observed after zzso vascular zzso
