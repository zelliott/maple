In the embryonic zzso pioneer zzso establish a simple topography of zzso and zzso zzso The cues used by these zzso during the initial formation of the zzso scaffold remain largely zzso We have investigated the zzso guidance role of zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso as well as to the zzso zzso repulsive guidance zzso zzso Here, we show strong expression of zzso and both of its putative zzso in the developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that this zzso was essential for zzso guidance in an early forming zzso brain zzso Similar zzso zzso were also observed following loss of either zzso or zzso zzso partial knock downs of these molecules revealed zzso interactions and confirmed that these receptors and zzso were acting in the same zzso The results provide the first evidence that zzso acts as an zzso guidance zzso in zzso and support a model zzso zzso zzso respond to a combination of attractive and repulsive cues as they navigate their zzso zzso
