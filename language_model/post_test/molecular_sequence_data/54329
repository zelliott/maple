zzso zzso is the major mechanism responsible for zzso resistance in Chinese populations of zzso zzso Previous work has shown that enhanced zzso contributes to resistance in the zzso Chinese strain, zzso The current study provides evidence that enhanced zzso by zzso zzso also contributes to the resistance in this zzso The average zzso activity of third zzso zzso larvae was zzso compared with that of a susceptible zzso zzso Much of this difference was attributed to zzso at two zones which zzso the model zzso zzso zzso zzso and also a zzso analogue of zzso A preparation enriched for zzso zzso to one of these zones from zzso was shown to zzso zzso with a specific activity of about zzso zzso This material was also matched by mass zzso with four putative zzso zzso all of which clustered within a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on these four genes showed zzso greater expression in zzso of zzso compared to zzso but no differences was found in the number of copies of the genes between the zzso
