A gene for zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso by screening a zzso DNA library using the coding region of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso had an open reading frame for a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein with a tag showed a single band of 120 zzso on zzso The zzso forms zzso as judged by gel zzso zzso retained full activity even after incubation at 50 degrees C for 60 zzso or exposure to zzso M zzso at 30 degrees C for 20 zzso being more stable than zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso activity showed a sharp optimum temperature of 42 degrees C at pH zzso and an optimum pH of zzso at 30 degrees zzso The zzso unlike most plant zzso was predominantly activated by zzso zzso zzso and slightly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso known as a strong zzso of most bacterial zzso but not of plant zzso showed no effect on the zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive to the zzso by zzso at higher pH zzso than lower pH zzso contrary to zzso zzso zzso and plant zzso zzso for zzso was increased about zzso by zzso while markedly decreased by zzso zzso and zzso about 3- to zzso The regulation mechanism of zzso is not readily zzso by conventional zzso zzso
