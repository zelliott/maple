zzso is a ubiquitous zzso factor family which consists of three distinct zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso Among them, zzso and zzso zzso have been reported to be involved in plant response to zzso zzso Here, a zzso zzso was identified from zzso zzso zzso and transformed to zzso to investigate its functions in plant stress zzso We found that transformed zzso with zzso zzso exhibited higher seed zzso under zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso stress treatment compared to zzso zzso The zzso of transformed zzso also showed improved tolerance to zzso and decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso rescued partly tolerance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we examined zzso levels of several stress-related genes in transformed zzso Among them, zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were substantially higher in transformed zzso than those in zzso zzso zzso zzso our data revealed that zzso plays positive roles in response to zzso zzso and zzso stress at different zzso stages in plants, respectively, via possibly regulating stress-related zzso
