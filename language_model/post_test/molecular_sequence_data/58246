Recently it has been shown that zzso with zzso DNA zzso genes for viral or bacterial zzso can elicit both zzso and cellular immune responses in zzso and nonhuman zzso In this study, mice and nonhuman primates were vaccinated by intramuscular injection with plasmids that express either a zzso form of zzso zzso or rev zzso Mice receiving the zzso DNA developed zzso zzso responses against zzso zzso protein and the V2 zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso mice also exhibited zzso T cell responses, such as in zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso Class zzso zzso T zzso zzso activities, following zzso zzso In addition, zzso from these zzso cultures showed high levels of zzso production compared with zzso suggesting that primarily type zzso helper T zzso zzso responses were induced by both zzso zzso responses were also obtained for mice vaccinated with rev zzso zzso responses induced by zzso or rev vaccines were zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso 6 zzso zzso primates vaccinated with zzso DNA also showed zzso T zzso zzso and zzso responses, including moderate levels of zzso zzso against zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso DNA may provide a powerful means for zzso zzso and cellular immune responses against zzso
