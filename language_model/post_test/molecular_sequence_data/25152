A mouse zzso probe zzso to the human zzso transforming sequence has been identified and partially zzso and is used here to zzso the gene on the mouse X zzso The human gene has been physically mapped to within 60 zzso of the gene for zzso factor IX, within a large zzso linkage group between the mouse and human zzso which extends from zzso to zzso on the X zzso of both zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the mouse zzso probe onto mouse zzso zzso indicates that this gene lies in the same region of the X zzso as zzso the mouse gene for zzso factor zzso Moreover, segregation of zzso zzso DNA zzso for zzso and zzso in a total of zzso individuals derived from two large zzso mouse zzso populations (which are also segregating for 17 other zzso molecular zzso demonstrates that the mouse genes are separated by only zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite this short distance we were able to order zzso and zzso relative to one another and other genes in this zzso The mouse gene order zzso predicts a similar ordering of genes on the human X zzso a gene order which has only recently been demonstrated by physical zzso Thus, the map location and linkage relationships of the zzso gene are similar in man and zzso and this unique zzso locus is part of a zzso linkage group on the zzso X zzso
