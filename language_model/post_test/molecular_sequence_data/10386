A zzso element, inserted at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in a zzso zzso giving rise to a zzso female zzso zzso was cloned and zzso to characterize this novel zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso element present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso long terminal repeat zzso at both zzso There is a zzso zzso binding site downstream of the zzso zzso sequence and a zzso tract upstream of the 3' zzso zzso The zzso leads to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso showed evidence of the mobile nature of the zzso The DNA sequencing of the cloned zzso zzso element revealed that zzso possesses an open reading frame zzso that shows similarity with the envelope protein zzso by the gypsy and 297 zzso In addition, the cloned element appears to be a zzso zzso of a not yet identified complete element, because only the zzso domain of the reverse zzso gene is zzso
