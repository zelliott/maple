Short zzso peptides harboring zzso motifs are frequently involved in zzso zzso such as associations with zzso zzso 3 zzso and WW zzso Although patches of aromatic zzso present in either domain interact with zzso their overall structures are zzso suggesting that additional protein families exist that use stacked aromatic zzso acids zzso zzso to bind zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso A zzso motif zzso in the zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso protein of the zzso bacterial pathogen zzso zzso serves as a zzso for the zzso protein family zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These share a similar overall structure characterized by the two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, using three independent zzso we have delineated the minimal zzso zzso zzso of aromatic and basic zzso within two zzso zzso regions of the zzso domain abolished binding to zzso zzso of an zzso zzso with reversed charges could partially be rescued by introducing complementary zzso within the zzso Like zzso zzso aromatic zzso within the zzso domain zzso with zzso whereas the zzso specificity of either domain was determined by zzso charged zzso The zzso domain is therefore a new addition to the AA domain zzso which includes zzso and WW zzso
