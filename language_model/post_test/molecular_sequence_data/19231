The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is remarkable due to its ability to initiate the zzso of a wide range of zzso aromatic zzso zzso including zzso containing zzso and zzso rings, known pollutants for their toxic zzso Although the terminal zzso from zzso exhibits limited sequence similarity with well characterized zzso from the zzso zzso family, the crystal structure determined to zzso A by molecular replacement revealed the zzso to share the same global zzso structural zzso The zzso domain zzso itself from other bacterial zzso zzso iron zzso by a substantially larger zzso zzso binding pocket, the largest ever reported for this type of zzso While zzso in the zzso region close to the zzso iron atom are zzso the central region of the zzso pocket is shaped mainly by the side chains of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which contribute to the rather uniform zzso shape of the zzso Two flexible zzso zzso and zzso exposed to the zzso seem to control the zzso access to the zzso pocket and control the pocket zzso Compared with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on loop zzso are moved towards the zzso thus zzso the zzso pocket by at least 2 zzso An 11 A long water channel extends from the interface between the alpha and beta zzso to the zzso zzso The comparison of these structures with other known zzso suggests that the broad zzso specificity presented by the zzso zzso is primarily due to the large size and particular zzso of its zzso pocket and provided the basis for the study of its reaction zzso
