zzso receptors bind peptides of the zzso family, the most potent zzso known, and have been implicated in zzso To begin to define DNA sequences necessary for the zzso regulation of the rat zzso type A zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso region zzso and part of the zzso region, a total of zzso zzso zzso of the rat and human sequences revealed a 57% similarity in the zzso zzso and a zzso similarity in the zzso Several zzso sequences were identified, including zzso and zzso which may be important for the regulation of ETA gene zzso zzso extension analysis identified two zzso initiation sites within the rat zzso
