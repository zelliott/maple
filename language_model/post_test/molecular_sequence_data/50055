zzso zzso has the capability to zzso differentiated zzso zzso as shown by nuclear transplantation in animal zzso The zzso of donor zzso are rapidly zzso on injection into zzso eggs and are correctly zzso when donor zzso zzso in the early zzso of frogs and zzso zzso the zzso zzso dynamics of early zzso This is one of the most remarkable structural reorganizations of zzso zzso in nuclear zzso Despite the long history of nuclear zzso almost nothing is known about the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso in egg zzso Here we show that the zzso germ cell proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in egg zzso independently of continuing zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso which zzso to the zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results show that a single protein zzso can trigger zzso zzso of the complex zzso zzso
