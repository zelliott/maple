A zzso protein of 33 zzso is shown to be present in the zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso eggs, and early zzso The zzso is zzso 2 as demonstrated by zzso and mass zzso studies, and is termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is zzso present in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso and early zzso From after the swimming zzso stages zzso zzso however, it becomes partly soluble to zzso zzso buffer and all disappear thereafter zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso with the use of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso demonstrate the zzso nature of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso but not those zzso of zzso or those zzso with zzso inhibit zzso or zzso zzso zzso A zzso protein seems to present in two zzso subspecies, one other zzso species, and two fish species, but not in other zzso species, such as zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso in its zzso form, serves in a cellular function in a zzso manner, but the mechanism is still zzso
