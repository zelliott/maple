zzso cause plant cell wall loosening and are present primarily in the plant zzso Gene sequence analysis suggests that zzso are present in several zzso or zzso bacteria and zzso However, experimental evidence of microbial zzso activity is largely zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso from three plant zzso bacteria and one fungus cause extension of cell walls in zzso and weaken filter paper networks, without zzso zzso Since zzso were able to weaken cellulose networks, we tested whether they zzso enhanced the activity of several zzso in zzso of zzso The microbial zzso did not show such zzso beyond the zzso effect of bovine serum zzso Our results show that the zzso present in several zzso microbes have weak zzso activity and we zzso a role for these zzso in plant zzso Additionally, the convenient expression of several zzso in zzso coli makes a future comparative zzso analysis among zzso possible in order to understand their activity at the molecular zzso
