The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso A resolution using zzso anomalous zzso zzso belongs to a very large zzso family of proteins found mainly in bacteria but also in zzso and zzso The protein is a zzso of zzso zzso regulator and is predicted to be a sugar zzso zzso or zzso Here we describe the structure of zzso and discuss the possible function as an zzso possibly involved in zzso zzso
