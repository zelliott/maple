The members of the zzso zzso are widely used in the food and feed industry and show a remarkable ecological zzso Several zzso strains have been marketed as zzso as they possess zzso properties for the zzso In the present study, we used two complementary next-generation sequencing technologies to deduce the zzso sequences of two zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso which were isolated from the products zzso and zzso zzso as zzso The zzso and zzso draft zzso have, respectively, an estimated size of zzso and zzso and a zzso content of zzso Both strains are close to identical to each other and differ by no more than minor zzso zzso zzso insertions and zzso as evident from the verified presence of one zzso zzso and only 29 zzso zzso zzso In terms of coding capacity, zzso and zzso are predicted to zzso a comparable zzso indicating that zzso and zzso are likely to establish similar interactions with human zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that shared high similarities with plasmids found in other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Further analysis revealed that the zzso plasmids constitute a good evolution marker within the zzso zzso The plasmids of the zzso and zzso strains are almost zzso as testified by the presence of only three verified zzso and share a zzso region zzso a remnant of a zzso zzso system that is absent from the plasmids of zzso and zzso but zzso in another smaller zzso zzso zzso Our observations imply that the results obtained in animal and human experiments performed with the zzso and zzso strains can be compared with each other as these strains share a very recent common zzso
