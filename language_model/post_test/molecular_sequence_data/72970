zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both undergo zzso arrests which result in heading zzso We characterized these arrested zzso at the zzso and molecular levels, and defined the zzso changes that ensure after arrest has been zzso We found that the order of floral organ initiation and the positions of resulting floral organ zzso in this species in some respects from that of zzso which is a member of the same family, zzso We also cloned zzso of the zzso floral zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso and characterized their expression zzso We found that the zzso zzso was expressed in some of the zzso of zzso cauliflower, providing evidence that this tissue is zzso zzso In broccoli, both the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso However, the spatial pattern of expression of the broccoli zzso zzso differed from that of zzso In addition we identified a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence indicated that the zzso gene product does not contain the zzso thought to be responsible for the early arrest exhibited in cauliflower zzso et zzso zzso but contains other changes that might play a role in the broccoli heading zzso
