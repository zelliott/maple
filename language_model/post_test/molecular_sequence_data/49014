A new general zzso technique is zzso which allows an accurate determination of zzso zzso zzso The most important feature of this new approach includes acquisition of the two data sets with and without the additional zzso at the end of zzso evolution zzso This enables preservation and separation of the two zzso terms of zzso evolution, which are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are evaluated by the zzso zzso fitting of the ratios of integrated signal volumes for both kinds of zzso The effectiveness of the new sequence is demonstrated by determination of the zzso zzso in DNA zzso duplex zzso zzso Additionally, the ability of the new method for the measurement at the natural abundance level of zzso zzso is presented for the zzso
