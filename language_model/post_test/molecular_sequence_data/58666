The zzso B virus X protein is a zzso zzso zzso zzso by the X protein is most likely zzso through binding to different cellular zzso Using the zzso zzso method, we have isolated a clone that encodes a novel zzso cellular zzso zzso X and zzso interactions also occur in zzso zzso raised against zzso recognizes a zzso protein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 zzso The interaction between X and zzso requires a small region on X containing zzso acids zzso From Northern zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in both zzso and zzso cell lines as well as in normal zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is expressed in very low level in the normal human zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the X zzso Based on these results, we suggest that zzso is an important cellular negative regulator of the X zzso and that zzso interaction may play a role in zzso zzso
