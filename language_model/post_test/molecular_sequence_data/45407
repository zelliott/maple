The objectives of the present study were to identify zzso species isolated from the canals of zzso teeth with zzso zzso using zzso and molecular techniques, and to investigate the genetic diversity of the zzso Twenty-two zzso zzso isolated from the canals of zzso teeth with zzso zzso zzso were identified to species level using rapid ID 32 zzso galleries and partial zzso zzso zzso To zzso the zzso zzso DNA from the zzso was analyzed by zzso field gel zzso zzso after zzso with zzso zzso regions of two zzso ace and zzso were zzso for further differentiation of the zzso All strains were identified as zzso zzso by both commercial kit and partial zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of 22 zzso demonstrated 18 zzso profiles, whereas 13 distinct zzso were identified after analysis of the ace and zzso composite zzso Most of the zzso from distinct patients had different zzso zzso Moreover, in two cases, different zzso zzso strains were found in different zzso teeth from the same zzso zzso zzso was the only zzso species isolated from the canals of zzso teeth with zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed among the zzso zzso zzso following zzso and zzso typing zzso Furthermore, the genetic diversity within root canal strains was similar to previous reports regarding zzso zzso zzso from different clinical and geographic zzso
