To generate an in zzso system for investigating the zzso phase of zzso zzso mouse lines transgenic for a full-length infectious zzso clone of a zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso from two independent zzso transgenic mouse lines produced zzso that infected human zzso Plasma zzso was detected in these mice at levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparable to those reported for zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso in these mice increased zzso after either treatment with the zzso zzso zzso B or infection with zzso zzso Thus, a zzso zzso a zzso zzso strain under the control of its zzso expressed as a zzso in mice can proceed through the zzso replication phase and produce infectious zzso In addition, the presence of plasma zzso that can be monitored by measuring plasma zzso zzso levels permits these mice to be used to study the impact of different interventions on modulating in zzso zzso zzso zzso these mice provide a novel zzso system to investigate the in zzso regulation of zzso production by factors that activate the immune zzso Furthermore, this zzso system should be useful in zzso the role of zzso factors in modulating zzso replication and investigating the in zzso therapeutic efficacy of agents that target the zzso stages of zzso zzso
