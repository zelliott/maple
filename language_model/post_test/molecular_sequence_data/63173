We study here the evolution of genes located in the same physical locus using the recently zzso zzso locus in seven wheat zzso in zzso zzso and zzso species and compared them with barley and rice zzso zzso We investigated both the conservation of zzso and the molecular evolution of zzso including coding and zzso zzso zzso is restricted to two groups of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Unknown zzso surrounded by several copies of zzso almost zzso in rice and zzso but in a different relative zzso zzso zzso genes between wheat and rice run along with genes harboring different copy numbers and highly variable sequences between close wheat zzso The coding sequence evolution appeared to be submitted to zzso selective pressure and zzso sequences analysis revealed that the molecular clock hypothesis is violated in most zzso
