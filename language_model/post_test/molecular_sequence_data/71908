In plants, zzso is zzso by two different zzso a zzso zzso via zzso and a zzso zzso via the zzso zzso from zzso In contrast to the better characterization of the zzso zzso at a molecular level, the molecular regulation and significance of the zzso zzso are not yet well zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that is responsible for the conversion of zzso to zzso in the final step of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned by functional zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso pair full-length zzso zzso 295 zzso acids in its open reading frame, contains a putative zzso targeting zzso zzso targeting has been demonstrated by particle gun zzso using an zzso zzso acid green zzso protein fusion zzso Southern zzso suggested the existence of a zzso gene that mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso in the zzso protein in zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed preferential gene expression in leaf and root zzso of zzso plants with an approximately zzso abundance in the root compared with the leaf zzso This indicates the possible role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso in contrast to the function of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This work completes the molecular cloning and characterization of the three genes involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in higher zzso
