The three-dimensional fold of a new protein sequence can often be zzso directly from sequence zzso to a protein of known zzso The function of a new protein sequence is more difficult to zzso however, since zzso can have different molecular and cellular zzso To develop and automate zzso methods for determining molecular function, we have analyzed zzso specificity in two related families of binding zzso One of these families includes zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the other includes zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso These proteins have similar folds but varying zzso binding many different small zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso iron, and zzso Starting from template structural zzso alignments of over 90 sequences per family were generated by zzso database searches with hidden zzso zzso zzso trees were made of full-length sequences and of zzso of zzso lining the binding zzso to determine whether zzso of the trees correlate with zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso in the binding pocket were also used to predict zzso function for many zzso database sequences and to identify specific side zzso contacts in proteins without solved zzso Our results demonstrate the utility of zzso functional zzso within a protein family zzso
