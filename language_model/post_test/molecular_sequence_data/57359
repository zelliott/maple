The zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso gene zzso was isolated and zzso zzso is a single copy gene whose sequence predicts a 19,000 Dalton protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso from zzso zzso II as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso also appears to interact with zzso zzso II in a manner dependent upon zzso since zzso zzso II zzso from cells lacking zzso also lacks zzso Previous results have demonstrated that deletion of the zzso results in slow growth and zzso and zzso In contrast, deletion of the zzso gene revealed that it is essential for cell growth and zzso Loss of both the zzso and the zzso genes causes zzso These results suggest that zzso contributes to the function of zzso zzso II in the absence of zzso either in a manner independent of its association with the zzso or by directly binding to the zzso in a manner independent of its association with zzso
