The interaction between zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso is essential for signal zzso However, the importance of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso and zzso of zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso have also been zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso independently of zzso and that participation of zzso is necessary for efficient zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso carrying zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain failed to bind zzso whereas they bound zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso carrying zzso in the switch zzso domain exhibited severely reduced ability to bind zzso whereas their ability to bind zzso was zzso zzso that bound to either zzso or zzso alone failed to activate zzso zzso without zzso zzso which lacks the ability to activate zzso selectively lost the ability to bind zzso These results suggest that the zzso domain of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso through interaction with zzso and that zzso modifications of zzso are required for this zzso
