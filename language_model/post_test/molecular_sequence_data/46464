zzso affinity maturation proceeds in zzso via a combination of point zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of light chains or portions of the heavy chain, thereby reducing the probability of zzso in local affinity zzso in sequence zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso can be exploited to mimic the broad spectrum of zzso types deployed by B cells, incorporating both zzso revision and zzso editing together with zzso point zzso This method was used to effect a zzso affinity improvement in an zzso zzso zzso in three rounds of zzso and zzso and a zzso affinity improvement in an zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso When zzso zzso zzso or chain zzso was directly compared to zzso zzso the zzso approach yielded greater affinity improvement with substantially reduced divergence from zzso zzso demonstrating an advantage of simultaneously testing a broad range of zzso zzso
