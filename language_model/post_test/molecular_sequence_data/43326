zzso of zzso zzso by zzso wrapping zzso reverses zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso a protein extract isolated from CW zzso causes zzso of normal zzso zzso and reverses zzso diabetes, reducing mortality by zzso We investigated the hypothesis that a novel gene zzso a constituent of zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso associated protein zzso is a product of a novel gene expressed in zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a strong single transcript of zzso zzso at 1 and 2 d after CW that disappeared by the 6th day and was absent from zzso control zzso zzso gene is expressed in zzso cells, but not in zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of zzso in zzso but not in extracts from control zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to a region unique to zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso incorporation into zzso duct zzso in primary culture and a rat pancreatic duct cell line but had no effect on a zzso zzso tumor cell zzso A portion of human zzso gene was cloned and appears to be highly zzso to the zzso zzso This data suggests that the zzso gene is a novel pancreatic gene expressed during zzso zzso whose protein product is a constituent of zzso and is capable of initiating duct cell zzso a prerequisite for zzso zzso
