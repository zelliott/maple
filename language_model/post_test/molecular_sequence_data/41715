Based on pattern searches and systematic database zzso almost 650 different zzso zzso repeats from nearly all zzso have been zzso more than 150 of them are reported here for the first zzso Their presence in functionally diverse proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso factors strongly suggests domain zzso but their occurrence in zzso and zzso excludes zzso zzso The spreading mechanism remains unknown, but in at least three cases horizontal gene transfer appears to be zzso zzso repeats occur in at least four consecutive zzso The terminal repeats are more variable in zzso One feature of the internal repeats is a predicted central zzso zzso which is likely to interact with other zzso The functions of the zzso repeats are compatible with a role in zzso zzso
