zzso virus zzso a new member of the zzso codes for a fusion zzso protein with five potential zzso zzso Because zzso are known to be important structural components affecting the zzso and function of viral zzso we analyzed the effect of the deletion of zzso zzso on cell surface zzso zzso zzso and the biological activity of the zzso F zzso Each of the five potential zzso sites was removed either individually or in zzso revealing that four sites are actually zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso While the removal of zzso and/or zzso had no or little effect on zzso surface zzso and fusion activity, the elimination of zzso or zzso reduced the surface expression by more than zzso Similar to a zzso lacking all zzso zzso deletion zzso in which the potential zzso site was destroyed by introducing a zzso zzso were neither zzso nor transported to the cell surface and consequently were not able to mediate zzso zzso This finding indicates that in the absence of zzso the zzso acid sequence around position zzso is important for folding and zzso
