Transport of zzso acids from low zzso in seawater by marine zzso has been extensively zzso but few of the genes involved in this zzso process have been zzso We have characterized three zzso acid zzso genes cloned from zzso of the sea zzso zzso zzso These genes show zzso proximity to classical zzso acid transport systems, including zzso and zzso and the inebriated gene zzso zzso expression of these genes in zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso transport above zzso levels, demonstrating that these genes mediate zzso zzso zzso specific to one of these genes zzso inhibited zzso zzso confirming the zzso activity of this gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso of larvae revealed expression of zzso in the zzso zzso associated with zzso acid zzso as independently demonstrated by zzso zzso of radioactive zzso zzso rates of zzso transport increased zzso during early development, from embryonic to zzso zzso Analysis of gene expression during this zzso period revealed that zzso transcript abundance remained nearly constant, while that of another zzso gene zzso increased zzso The functional characterization of these genes establishes a molecular biological basis for zzso acid transport by zzso stages of marine zzso
