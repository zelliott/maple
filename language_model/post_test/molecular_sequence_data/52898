zzso of cellular zzso During zzso the asymmetry of plasma membrane zzso is lost, which exposes zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells can be inhibited zzso by zzso and its structural zzso but not by other zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is specifically zzso Using zzso display, we have cloned a gene that appears to recognize zzso on zzso zzso Here we show that this zzso when zzso into B and T zzso enables them to recognize and engulf zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using a zzso zzso suggested that the protein is expressed on the surface of zzso zzso and zzso zzso this zzso like zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso cells and, in zzso induced an zzso zzso This candidate zzso zzso is highly zzso to genes of unknown function in zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso recognition on zzso cells during their removal by zzso is highly zzso throughout zzso
