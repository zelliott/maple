We isolated a human zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso after high stringency screening of a human zzso zzso library using a rat zzso zzso as a zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso and an zzso that encodes 53 zzso acids was found between two zzso The zzso exhibited zzso and zzso identity at the zzso and zzso acid levels, respectively, with the corresponding region of rat zzso The human zzso was classified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso based on its zzso to rat zzso Using zzso cell hybrid analysis, human zzso was localized to zzso zzso Fine mapping analysis using FISH localized the gene to zzso Since zzso receptors of the zzso zzso have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, establishing the precise map position of human zzso zzso is an important step towards evaluating this locus as a candidate for zzso in neurodegenerative zzso
