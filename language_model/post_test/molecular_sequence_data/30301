The zzso zzso steroid 5 zzso is responsible for the conversion of testosterone into the more potent zzso zzso In man, this steroid acts on a variety of zzso target zzso to mediate such diverse zzso processes as male sexual differentiation in the fetus and zzso growth in zzso Here we describe the isolation, structure, and expression of a zzso zzso the human steroid 5 zzso A rat zzso was used as a zzso probe to screen a human prostate zzso zzso A zzso zzso was identified and DNA sequence analysis indicated that the human steroid 5 zzso was a zzso protein of 259 zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso A comparison of the human and rat protein sequences revealed a zzso zzso zzso of expression zzso containing the human and rat zzso into zzso zzso cells resulted in the synthesis of high levels of steroid 5 zzso zzso zzso Both zzso expressed in zzso cells showed similar zzso zzso for naturally occurring steroid zzso However, synthetic zzso demonstrated marked differences in their abilities to inhibit the human and rat steroid 5 zzso
