We have recently reported a case of zzso zzso caused by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from this individual showed an abnormal pattern of expression of several genes coding for elastic zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso In this study we intended to zzso the mechanism responsible for zzso zzso in these zzso zzso We identified a zzso region zzso of the human zzso promoter in which two binding sites for the zzso factor specific protein 1 zzso are required for gene activity in normal zzso zzso of zzso to these sequences was dramatically reduced within zzso zzso cells, although zzso expression was zzso Further analysis of the promoter sequence found increased zzso levels in zzso zzso cells compared with cells from unaffected zzso When DNA zzso activity was zzso inhibited in zzso zzso cells using the zzso we found a significant increase in zzso zzso In conclusion, besides changes caused by the zzso zzso zzso gene regulation is affected by an zzso mechanism that can be reversed by an inhibitor of DNA zzso zzso It is not yet known whether zzso gene expression is affected in all cases of zzso zzso arising from zzso zzso
