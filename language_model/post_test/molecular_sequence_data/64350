zzso proteins form a family of zzso protein zzso required for diverse biological zzso including zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso control of zzso activity, regulation of zzso zzso and zzso Although structures of zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso or zzso have been determined, the role of the zzso in the mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso is still zzso Here, we present additional structures of zzso in several differently zzso zzso in a productive complex with zzso in a zzso zzso complex with bound zzso and in the zzso zzso We observe a new mode of zzso binding that seems to depend on zzso zzso in which the zzso ring of zzso is buried in the highly zzso zzso pocket of the zzso We propose a detailed zzso mechanism for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso consistent with zzso and zzso zzso
