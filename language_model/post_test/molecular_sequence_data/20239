zzso and zzso particles zzso have been demonstrated to be robust scaffolds for the construction of zzso In order to develop new zzso for zzso zzso zzso as well as to investigate the two-dimensional zzso of viruses and zzso the zzso zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso was investigated as a potential building block in our zzso zzso is an zzso plant virus with an average diameter of 28 zzso that can be isolated zzso in gram quantities from zzso or Chinese zzso There are 180 coat protein zzso per zzso zzso The conventional zzso zzso reaction was employed for the chemical modification of the viral zzso zzso zzso with sequential zzso zzso analysis identified that the zzso groups of zzso of the flexible zzso made the major contribution for the zzso of zzso toward zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was also monitored with zzso zzso and fluorescence, which revealed that approximately 60 zzso per particle could be zzso We hypothesized that the flexible A chain contains the zzso zzso because the crystal structure of zzso has shown that chain A is much more flexible compared to B and C, especially at the zzso region where the zzso zzso In addition, about 90 to 120 zzso groups, located in the most exposed zzso could be modified with zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was stable to a wide range of reaction conditions and maintained its integrity after the chemical zzso zzso it can potentially be employed as a zzso scaffold for the display of a variety of materials for applications in many areas of zzso
