The solution structure of the zzso zzso V of the zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso III was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The fold is unique to zzso zzso zzso acid sequence conservation is pronounced for zzso zzso that form the structural core of the zzso indicating that the fold is representative for zzso zzso from a wide range of different zzso The interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and alpha was studied by zzso experiments where alpha was incubated with full-length zzso domain zzso and zzso shortened at the zzso by 11 and 18 zzso zzso The only interacting zzso were found in the zzso zzso segment of zzso most of which is structurally zzso in free zzso Since the zzso and zzso of the structured core of zzso are located close to each other, this limits the possible distance between alpha and the zzso zzso zzso complex and, zzso between the two alpha zzso involved in zzso and zzso DNA zzso Analysis of an zzso extended construct zzso showed that zzso presents the only part of zzso zzso and V of zzso which comprises a zzso fold in the absence of other interaction zzso
