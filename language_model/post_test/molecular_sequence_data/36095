In an attempt to determine whether zzso of collagen by zzso involves binding of the zzso to the plasma zzso the effect of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso was studied in an in zzso model zzso zzso bone rudiments from zzso mouse fetuses were incubated with varying zzso of the zzso zzso electron microscopic analysis indicated that Con A caused a zzso increase in the amount of zzso collagen zzso in zzso zzso suggesting either an enhanced zzso or a decreased zzso breakdown of zzso Since a Con zzso increase was not seen in the combined presence of both the zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso which is known to inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso it is unlikely that Con A zzso zzso Based on the finding that Con A zzso with the zzso of a synthetic zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso B it is suggested that the zzso of zzso zzso collagen under the influence of the zzso was due to a decreased zzso zzso Since Con A did not inhibit the zzso of collagen zzso by the zzso it is concluded that Con zzso binding sites for collagen molecules are unlikely to be involved in zzso of collagen zzso by zzso
