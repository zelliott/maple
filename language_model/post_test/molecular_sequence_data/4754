Total pancreatic zzso from the zzso species zzso zzso zzso was used to make zzso as a template for the zzso chain zzso Three redundant zzso based on the known zzso acid sequence of zzso insulin were used to amplify a zzso of zzso zzso truncated zzso complete zzso and complete zzso Whereas the zzso junction contained the expected zzso zzso site zzso the zzso junction was found to contain only a single zzso the first such site to be unequivocally associated with the zzso processing of a zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso sequences around this site shows that a typical zzso zzso conversion zzso should still be able to zzso as the general requirements for precursor processing at a zzso site are satisfied, notably a basic zzso zzso at the zzso zzso An zzso zzso (in this case zzso at the zzso position, which is seen in all known zzso is zzso The corresponding zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso was also amplified by zzso revealing a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso position within the zzso zzso
