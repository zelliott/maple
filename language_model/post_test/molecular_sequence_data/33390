zzso modifications zzso of proteins in the adult brain are known to mark zzso processes for complex brain functions such as learning and zzso Multiple zzso occur in nerve cells, and are able to zzso proteins in different zzso zzso In synaptic zzso protein zzso is the primary zzso that contributes to the control of the activity and zzso of synaptic zzso In the nucleus, it can zzso zzso and proteins involved with the zzso machinery and, in combination with other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso acts to regulate zzso zzso and gene zzso The combination of zzso zzso is highly complex and is known to be unique to each zzso The ensemble of zzso in the adult brain, however, remains zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso approach that allows the isolation and identification of zzso on synaptic and nuclear zzso in particular on zzso Using zzso zzso we identified zzso unique zzso from zzso zzso and 196 unique zzso sites on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A comparison of zzso sites in synaptic and nuclear zzso and on zzso suggests that different zzso and zzso motifs are zzso Overall, our data demonstrates the complexity of zzso in the brain and the prevalence of zzso zzso and reveals potentially important regulatory sites on proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and brain zzso
