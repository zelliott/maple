The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso a family 1 zzso zzso has been studied at a molecular zzso Following zzso and X-ray zzso of this zzso a zzso A resolution structural model has been obtained by molecular zzso zzso shows a zzso zzso with zzso having a typical zzso zzso Its active site has been compared to the one of the previously determined zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall design of the zzso binding pocket is very well zzso with the exception of three zzso that have been identified as a zzso binding site in zzso To verify the structural model and alter its zzso zzso these three zzso have been introduced at the corresponding positions in zzso zzso zzso zzso in different zzso single, zzso and triple zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso resulted in an increased affinity for zzso whereas zzso gave rise to a shifted pH optimum (from zzso to zzso Analysis of zzso revealed a zzso and a zzso increase of the efficiency of zzso zzso in the single and triple zzso zzso In contrast, their activity on zzso zzso was largely reduced zzso The zzso at position zzso in zzso seems to be the determining factor for the difference in zzso specificity between the two types of family 1 zzso
