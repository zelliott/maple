zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are potentially important tools in the characterization of zzso such as proteins and zzso In this work, zzso zzso of three zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso were zzso and compared to their respective normal zzso zzso While the zzso of the zzso zzso are significantly broadened (up to zzso no significant spectral shifts zzso zzso zzso of the major zzso modes were observed between the two zzso We show that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso can be comprised quite reliably from the zzso of its constituent aromatic zzso acids except in the backbone regions where the spectral zzso are critically dependent on the length and zzso of the zzso zzso From this study we conclude that, together with protein backbone groups, aromatic zzso acid zzso provide the overwhelmingly dominant features in the zzso and zzso zzso of peptides and proteins when zzso It follows that the zzso modes of these three small constructed peptides may likely apply to the assignment of zzso and zzso features in the zzso of other peptides and zzso
