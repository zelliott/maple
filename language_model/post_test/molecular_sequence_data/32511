The zzso communities adherent to zzso particles were studied in heavy metal contaminated coastal zzso Six sampling sites on the Belgian zzso plate and presenting various metal zzso zzso and organic matter content, were zzso The results indicated that the total microbial biomass zzso + zzso zzso was zzso correlated to zzso metal levels zzso and that the percentage of cells adherent to zzso particles was close to zzso in every site even in highly contaminated zzso zzso it seems that heavy metal contamination does affect total bacterial biomass in marine sediments but that the ratio between attached and free living zzso is not zzso The composition of the zzso communities adherent to the fine fraction of the sediments zzso zzso was determined using fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso The FISH results indicated that the proportion of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso bacteria, was not related to the zzso zzso metal zzso Most of the 79 complete zzso zzso sequences obtained from the attached microbial communities were classified in the zzso and zzso and in the zzso zzso A large proportion of the attached zzso sequences found in this study zzso was included in the zzso zzso zzso that are indigenous to marine zzso
