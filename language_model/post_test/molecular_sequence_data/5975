zzso cells in the neurological zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a number of abnormal zzso zzso zzso have shown that these properties are direct effects of the zzso zzso What has remained unexplored are the numerous zzso abnormalities that the two zzso zzso cells zzso In zzso zzso cells have zzso zzso zzso that lack zzso zzso zzso In zzso before the zzso cells die, their zzso remain short and zzso To determine whether or not a system of healthy zzso (or other environmental zzso would alter either of these zzso we examined young zzso and adult zzso mouse zzso using zzso zzso In zzso day 20 zzso zzso zzso we found two distinct zzso classes of zzso zzso One, zzso to be wild type, had a zzso structure similar to normal zzso cells in zzso zzso The other consisted of cells with small zzso reduced zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso making them indistinguishable from zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso We also examined mature zzso zzso We found no evidence that the stunted zzso of zzso zzso cells is rescued in mosaic animals but observed numerous examples of medium to large zzso resembling zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso abnormalities described in both zzso reflect cell zzso zzso genetic blocks in the zzso maturation of the zzso zzso zzso The implication is that the action of the zzso zzso at these two zzso are required to execute a normal program of zzso zzso
