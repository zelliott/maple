We recently generated zzso zzso mice and found that a major zzso of zzso type II was the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade by the zzso zzso However, the zzso roles of zzso zzso on the regulation of Na zzso and blood pressure, and whether zzso zzso functions positively or zzso in this zzso remained to be zzso In the present study, we generated zzso zzso mice by deleting zzso 7 of the zzso zzso These mice did not show zzso and zzso zzso but they did exhibit low blood pressure and increased Na and K zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso mice as compared with their zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and Maxi K were not changed, but zzso Na channel appeared to be activated as a zzso mechanism for the reduced zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is a positive regulator for the zzso zzso and zzso is a potential target of zzso zzso
