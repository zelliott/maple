The zzso of cellular proteins is essential for the study of many different biological zzso This study describes an zzso for the detection of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, with a method that may be generally zzso to other cellular zzso A small zzso protein tag that is recognized by a pair of readily available, zzso zzso zzso was zzso This tag was then added to an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein by genetic zzso We show that it is possible to use zzso zzso to detect low zzso levels of zzso by a simple zzso and detection zzso This zzso was then adapted into a zzso zzso format suitable for screening in zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso also permits the zzso to be zzso with a standard zzso of cell zzso thus allowing the identification of conditions causing reduction of protein levels simply due to zzso The screening results demonstrated that the zzso is able to identify compounds that zzso the levels of zzso both positively and zzso and that represent valuable starting points for drug discovery zzso
