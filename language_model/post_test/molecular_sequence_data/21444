zzso proteins containing zzso repeats have been identified in several zzso bacteria potentially involved in zzso Recently, a zzso surface zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso Here we zzso 37 novel putative zzso zzso zzso protein genes zzso zzso amplification and sequencing across 10 zzso zzso strains showed they were zzso distinguishing zzso matching known differences in zzso zzso interaction zzso Thirty zzso could be divided into four groups based on sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions and zzso repeat zzso Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 zzso formed triplets within the zzso with one member from each group represented in each zzso zzso trees suggested that these groups arose through multiple instances of zzso zzso For Group 1, 2, 3 and 4 zzso X was typically zzso and Y typically zzso consistent with other bacterial zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso closely resembled zzso with X typically being zzso acid or zzso acid and Y typically being zzso or zzso zzso also showed sequence similarity to zzso and contained a predicted signal zzso zzso site and zzso domain, suggesting that it is a surface zzso
