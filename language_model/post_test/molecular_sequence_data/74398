The abundant human zzso zzso type 16 zzso protein exists as two distinct structural forms in zzso zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso contains a limited zzso fold constrained by the N and C zzso zzso deletions facilitate the assembly of zzso into zzso zzso which bind to zzso zzso The zzso region is highly zzso and its deletion zzso zzso zzso and prevents zzso zzso zzso zzso can detect zzso in biopsy material, as well as zzso and zzso in zzso cells, indicating structural zzso Our results suggest a role for zzso formation in zzso the zzso of zzso during zzso zzso
