zzso zzso is transferred to the zzso mouse and rat through a major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso on the brush border of the zzso small zzso We have previously described a site on the zzso surface of the human fetal zzso with zzso binding characteristics similar to zzso We report here the identification by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the human zzso of rat and mouse zzso in tissue obtained from human fetal and adult zzso zzso protein was detected in adult human zzso by western zzso zzso studies of sections of human zzso show that the zzso is localized mostly to the zzso cells, where it is in the zzso zzso These data suggest that the binding of zzso previously seen in the fetal zzso is due to the presence of zzso Potential roles for this zzso class zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso include the transfer of passive zzso induction of oral zzso and zzso
