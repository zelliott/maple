The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the evolution and zzso of zzso C virus zzso by assessing the zzso distribution of 273 zzso 2 strains isolated from French blood donors from 1990 to 2010 and by determining complete coding sequences in zzso 2 zzso These classified into 7 of the established zzso and into 15 additional lineages not yet assigned to a known zzso zzso tree construction showed two zzso zzso zzso 1 included most zzso 2 strains while cluster 2 included zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso Full zzso sequencing was performed on 15 zzso 2 strains belonging to both zzso that is, one zzso zzso two zzso zzso three zzso zzso two zzso zzso one zzso zzso two zzso zzso and four zzso zzso zzso included a zzso to zzso acid open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso distances between zzso belonging to the first cluster was zzso while the mean distance between the two clusters was zzso Analysis indicated that the zzso between zzso zzso and other zzso 2 strains occurred early in the evolutionary zzso zzso zzso retained a zzso feature characteristic of zzso 2, that is, absence of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This finding suggests that appearance and fixation of this zzso occurred late in the evolutionary history of zzso type 2 and that its absence is an ancestral feature of zzso
