Genes expressed in zzso cells contain binding sites for a zzso factor believed to be an important regulator for this zzso zzso Using high-level transient expression in zzso cells, we have identified complementary DNA zzso the zzso zzso The factor, a new member of the zzso family of zzso zzso is restricted to zzso cells at the level of zzso expression and is closely zzso between mouse and zzso
