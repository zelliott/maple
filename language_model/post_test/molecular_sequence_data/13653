In previous studies we identified high affinity zzso zzso linked receptors for zzso gene related zzso zzso on rat T and B cells, on zzso cell lines including the mouse zzso cell line zzso and on cells in mouse bone zzso The effect of zzso on early B cell differentiation has been examined using the zzso and on cells in mouse bone zzso The effect of zzso on early B cell differentiation has been examined using the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso induction of surface zzso zzso protein expression in zzso cells, an effect that is associated with a decrease in the zzso levels of zzso heavy zzso and light zzso chain zzso In this report, experiments are described that provide further information on the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression was examined in zzso zzso An optimal window for the zzso effect of zzso on zzso induction occurs at least 24 h after the cells are treated with zzso To determine whether the zzso effects of zzso on zzso expression are zzso by an zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, zzso mobility shift zzso were performed using nuclear proteins from zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso zzso binding activity in cells that had been treated with zzso or zzso + zzso suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso is not zzso by an zzso of zzso zzso zzso These studies provide further evidence that zzso plays an zzso role in early B cell zzso Finally, a model is proposed that describes an integrated role for zzso in the zzso regulation of early B cell zzso
