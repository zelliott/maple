A simple zzso method that combines zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso was developed to probe the solution structure of zzso zzso The method is based on zzso structural information from zzso of protection against zzso zzso as governed by zzso accessibility and protein zzso This approach was applied to the study of the zzso factor zzso member of the zzso family of zzso zzso In the absence of DNA and at low zzso strengths, Max is rapidly zzso by each of six zzso selected for the study, results consistent with an open and flexible structure of the zzso At zzso salt levels, the rates of zzso are moderately zzso this and the patterns of zzso are consistent with zzso of the protein through a predominantly zzso zzso In the presence of zzso DNA, the protein becomes dramatically protected against zzso exhibiting up to a zzso reduction in zzso zzso Over a zzso period, both complete and partial zzso of the zzso complex is zzso The partial zzso fragmentation patterns reflect a very high degree of protection in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso with those expected of a stable zzso bound to DNA at its basic zzso Less protection is seen at the zzso where a slow, sequential zzso zzso occurs, zzso to the presence of a zzso zzso The results also indicate a high affinity of Max for its target DNA that remains high even when the zzso zzso is zzso zzso In addition to the study of the zzso protein Max, the present method appears well suited for a range of other structural biological zzso
