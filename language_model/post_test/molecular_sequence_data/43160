The zzso family of zzso factors includes five zzso and three zzso zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of cell zzso but little is known about zzso function during zzso zzso We have explored the regulation of zzso expression during mouse zzso by in zzso zzso We find selective zzso of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso and zzso zzso at important zzso zzso zzso transcript levels are high in early, zzso zzso zzso and later in zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains several layers of zzso zzso zzso is zzso following the onset of zzso expression and is first apparent in zzso zzso at zzso days of zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts are detected later in zzso once the zzso shows evidence of zzso zzso of the zzso into zzso zzso cells and zzso terminally zzso cells at zzso days of gestation zzso with expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and of zzso in zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso at zzso days of gestation precedes appearance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in the proliferating, zzso zzso In zzso zzso no zzso transcripts were detected at the tip of the developing zzso which contain terminally zzso zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts were limited to the upper half of the zzso and were absent in the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso may participate in maintaining zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso may be important to maintain the differentiated zzso Thus, selective regulation of zzso forms occurs during zzso zzso development, irrespective of the zzso or zzso origin of such zzso
