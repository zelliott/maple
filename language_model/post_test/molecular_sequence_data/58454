We report a partial zzso sequence that encodes a zzso dubbed zzso with zzso identify and zzso similarity to zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso the gene product of the zzso dominant zzso kidney disease locus located on zzso 16 at band zzso zzso Northern analysis demonstrates that the zzso gene is expressed in all zzso zzso including both adult and fetal zzso Finally, in zzso zzso studies zzso this novel gene to zzso where zzso the second most common locus for zzso is known to zzso zzso zzso is an excellent candidate gene for zzso
