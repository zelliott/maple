The zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso the zzso reduction of zzso to zzso as one of the key steps in the biological nitrogen cycle, where it zzso in the zzso energy metabolism of zzso nitrate zzso Here we report on the crystal structure of this zzso from the zzso zzso zzso which we solved by zzso anomalous zzso zzso We propose a reaction scheme for the transformation of zzso based on structural and zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso is a functional zzso with 10 zzso zzso groups of type c and an unusual zzso zzso zzso at the active zzso By comparing the zzso arrangement of this zzso zzso with that of other zzso zzso we have been able to identify a family of proteins in which the orientation of zzso groups is zzso whereas structure and function are zzso
