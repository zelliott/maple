In plants, a zzso element, zzso is involved in zzso gene expression in response to zzso and zzso zzso To understand signal zzso pathways from perception of the zzso stress signal to gene zzso we characterized a gene family for zzso proteins zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that both genes are induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso northern analysis with zzso zzso showed that these genes are strongly induced in roots by zzso stress and in stems and roots by zzso zzso The zzso gene is located on zzso 5, and zzso on zzso zzso We screened an zzso zzso DNA library with zzso fragments of zzso and zzso as zzso and isolated DNA fragments that contained zzso regions of these zzso zzso analysis showed that both genes are interrupted by a single zzso at identical positions in their leader zzso Several zzso sequences were found in the promoter regions of both zzso The zzso zzso reporter gene driven by the zzso promoters was induced by zzso and zzso stress in transgenic zzso zzso
