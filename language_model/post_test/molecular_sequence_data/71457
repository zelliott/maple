zzso zzso zzso is an important precursor of zzso and zzso proteins such as small G zzso In this study, we have identified mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that mouse and human zzso zzso share a high level of zzso acid identity zzso with each other, and share a high level of similarity zzso with zzso zzso of lower zzso but only weak similarity zzso to plant and zzso zzso zzso Both of the newly identified zzso zzso genes from mouse and human were expressed in zzso coli, and their gene products displayed zzso zzso activity when zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as zzso The zzso zzso activity of these genes was also confirmed by demonstrating zzso synthesis after zzso of zzso coli with a zzso expressing the zzso genes derived from zzso zzso and a zzso expressing either the mouse or human zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests that the human zzso gene is a single copy zzso
