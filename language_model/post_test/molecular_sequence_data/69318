A region of the zzso zzso has been shown to stabilize zzso zzso in a broad zzso zzso This region encodes two zzso transcribed zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso specifies a zzso resolution system, while the zzso zzso alone is capable of stabilizing an zzso zzso under defined growth conditions in several different zzso zzso The observed zzso of the zzso zzso is most likely the result of zzso protein binding within the zzso zzso The characteristics of zzso binding to this region and the role of such binding in zzso stabilization were examined with zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the binding of a single zzso of zzso protein to the promoter region most likely blocks interaction of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso I protection experiments indicate that zzso binds to a discrete sequence of 48 base pairs in zzso While the binding of zzso to zzso is essential for proper regulation of expression of the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso the analyses of binding properties of zzso zzso proteins suggest that binding to this region does not play a direct role in zzso zzso
