zzso mapping is one of the key steps in zzso zzso The traditional mapping strategies typically require to zzso a set of markers that are nearly evenly or randomly distributed across the zzso or a region of zzso Such zzso strategies work with low zzso We propose an improved mapping strategy by zzso the principle of one-dimensional zzso and information on physical map into the standard mapping procedure used in experimental zzso Computer simulations based on a set of empirical data suggest that our new procedure can reduce the number of markers required for zzso to less than zzso of that of the standard zzso An illustrative application also demonstrates a pronounced reduction of the burden in zzso The proposed strategy offers a quick and cost-effective access to the target gene for zzso cloning without any extra expense except for making use of zzso sequence zzso A Microsoft Excel zzso for performing easy calculations described in this article, is available on request from the zzso
