zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso responds to two different environmental zzso The expression of these genes is induced in the presence of zzso or its zzso zzso and zzso when a good nitrogen source zzso zzso zzso or zzso is zzso Three types of zzso sites and zzso factors are required for zzso zzso gene zzso as zzso zzso zzso element associated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso element associated with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso element associated with the zzso and zzso proteins required for zzso zzso Most of the work leading to the above conclusions has employed zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso The purpose of this work is to extend our understanding of these elements and their roles to zzso zzso zzso genes using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso We show that eight distinct zzso sites participate in the process as zzso a newly identified zzso element, two zzso two zzso and three zzso zzso The two zzso zzso elements are zzso with two of the three zzso sequences that make up the zzso zzso The remaining zzso zzso zzso however, is not a zzso element but appears to function only in zzso The data provide insights into how these zzso and zzso factors function together to accomplish the regulated expression of the zzso gene that is observed in zzso
