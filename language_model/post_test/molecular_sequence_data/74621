The zzso query zzso zzso the free query of biological information, even across zzso a central challenge facing zzso Solutions to this problem can alter the nature of the field, moving it beyond the jungle of data integration and expanding the number and scope of questions that can be zzso An alignment table is a zzso relationship on locations zzso zzso An important special case of alignment tables are hit tables ? tables of pairs of highly similar segments produced by alignment tools like zzso However, alignment tables also include general zzso zzso and can represent any useful connection between sequence zzso They can be zzso and provide a high-quality zzso backbone of connections between biological zzso zzso tables thus can be a natural foundation for zzso as they permit a central part of the zzso problem to be reduced to purely technical problems involving tables of zzso challenges in implementing alignment tables include efficient representation and indexing of sequence zzso We define a location zzso that can be incorporated naturally into common zzso database zzso We also describe an zzso of alignment tables in zzso an extension of the zzso zzso database system that provides indexing and operators on locations required for zzso alignment zzso This paper also reviews several successful large-scale applications of alignment tables for zzso zzso zzso with millions of alignments have been used in queries about alternative zzso an area of zzso analysis concerning the way in which a single gene can yield multiple zzso Comparative zzso is a large potential application area for zzso and alignment zzso
