zzso is an essential component of skeletal muscle zzso Its zzso domain binds to zzso and its C zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso complex in the zzso zzso is therefore thought to serve as a link from the zzso zzso of the muscle cell through the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso result in zzso or Becker muscular zzso 

The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The structure is an zzso zzso of two zzso each zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are linked by a central alpha zzso The zzso zzso are both zzso zzso zzso Comparisons with the structures of zzso and zzso zzso reveal that the zzso of the individual zzso zzso are very similar to those of zzso but that the arrangement of the two zzso zzso within the zzso is zzso The zzso zzso reveals a change of 72 degrees in the orientation of one pair of zzso and zzso zzso (from different zzso relative to the other pair when compared with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is more zzso than the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso structure reveals a previously zzso arrangement of the zzso zzso within the zzso This observation has implications for the mechanism of zzso binding by zzso and related zzso zzso the position of three zzso zzso zzso within the structure suggests that they exert their effects through zzso of the zzso rather than through disruption of the binding to zzso
