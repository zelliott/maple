Nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface zzso or zzso that contain zzso acid zzso and several zzso zzso mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue zzso Some pathogens are also known to zzso their zzso although the role of this modification in zzso remains zzso We report that zzso a gene located within the Group B zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso that is itself required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling and zzso zzso identified zzso as a critical zzso for zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a single zzso zzso in zzso can determine whether zzso displays a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso coli zzso zzso also functions as a zzso zzso in zzso In fact, zzso zzso are commonly found within zzso zzso gene zzso A zzso approach identified 18 bacterial species with a zzso zzso gene cluster that included zzso Included in this list are the zzso human pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso of zzso pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso These studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of zzso zzso zzso without concurrent loss of zzso a key to further studies addressing the zzso of this modification in bacterial zzso
