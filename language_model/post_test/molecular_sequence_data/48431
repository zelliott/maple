zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso used for biological control of insects attacking ornamental zzso zzso identification of this species using internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso of zzso DNA was conducted for the first zzso The complete sequence of zzso and fragments of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes are reported zzso The estimated length of zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso This zzso was nearly identical to its counterpart of zzso zzso strain in spite of the difference in their zzso The zzso relationships were determined using the zzso method supported with strong zzso probabilities zzso of both zzso zzso Further molecular markers could be useful to identify the zzso strain and support its sister relationship to the Egyptian zzso zzso
