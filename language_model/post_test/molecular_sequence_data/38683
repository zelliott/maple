In zzso base pairing between the 3' end of zzso zzso and the zzso site of zzso is required for efficient initiation of zzso An interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso was also proposed for translation initiation in zzso Here, we used an zzso zzso approach in zzso to identify the regions of zzso zzso that might interact with the zzso zzso untranslated region zzso zzso Various fragments covering the entire mouse zzso zzso gene were cloned zzso of a cat reporter gene in a zzso zzso and translation products were analyzed after transient expression in human zzso For the largest part of zzso zzso we show that the zzso of complementary fragments in the zzso zzso zzso do not impair translation of the downstream open reading frame zzso When translation zzso is observed, reduction of the size of the complementary sequence to less than 200 zzso zzso the zzso zzso A single zzso complementary to the zzso zzso 3' domain retains its zzso potential when reduced to 100 zzso zzso analyses show that two distinct sequences of approximately 25 zzso separated by a zzso sequence of 50 zzso are required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reveals that zzso containing the zzso sequences accumulate in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that translation is blocked due to zzso of initiation zzso Our results support an zzso base pairing to explain the translation zzso observed and suggest that this region of zzso zzso is properly located for interacting with zzso
