The qualitative and quantitative contributions of four separate zzso DNA elements controlling the root zzso soybean zzso zzso gene were analyzed in transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso from internal deletions in the zzso region between positions zzso and zzso was monitored from a zzso reporter zzso The strong positive element zzso zzso zzso responsible for high-level expression was demonstrated to be an zzso element by deleting zzso zzso control zzso zzso of the downstream qualitative zzso element zzso zzso zzso containing the putative zzso consensus sequences zzso and zzso resulted in a low expression zzso zzso zzso enhancement is therefore dependent on the zzso element, which by itself does not enhance zzso This quantitative effect of the immediate upstream region carrying the consensus sequences was also found in hybrid promoter studies using the soybean zzso zzso gene promoter, suggesting the involvement of these motifs in a regulatory mechanism for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso negative element zzso zzso zzso linking the zzso and zzso onto the zzso box did not lead to zzso zzso These results indicate that interaction between positive, negative and neutral qualitative elements controls zzso zzso zzso of the nuclear protein zzso at the zzso weak positive element zzso zzso zzso is probably not directly required for this zzso
