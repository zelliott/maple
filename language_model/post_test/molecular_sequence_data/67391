zzso in the zzso zzso zzso member 4 zzso zzso of very long chain fatty zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes have been identified in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate which of these genes is responsible for zzso in Chinese zzso A total of zzso with zzso or suspected zzso were enrolled in the zzso The coding regions and adjacent zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso genes and 3 coding zzso of the zzso gene were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso were determined by zzso zzso Three novel zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso were not present in 176 normal individuals and were predicted to be zzso Two benign variations were zzso a reported variation, zzso in zzso and a novel variation, zzso in zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso and zzso The zzso variation has not been previously zzso We conclude that no zzso variations in zzso and zzso were detected in the Chinese zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso is more likely to be significant in Chinese zzso zzso
