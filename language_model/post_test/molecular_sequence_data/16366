zzso and zzso are abundant zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso Their respective primary sequences are highly zzso Our previous studies showed that these proteins are novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso from patients with zzso colitis zzso rheumatic disease and zzso zzso zzso In the present paper, we showed that zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of patients with UC do not recognize zzso in zzso while they recognize the protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizing zzso in zzso showed a similar profile to the zzso in the patients' zzso In order to zzso the difference in zzso to zzso between zzso and zzso we mapped the zzso for zzso by means of several zzso The results showed that zzso recognizes the intact zzso composed of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso This suggested that zzso in zzso is zzso changed in the zzso or the peripheral structure of the zzso from the protein in zzso The apparent zzso change of zzso between zzso and zzso will be important for understanding the functional difference of zzso in these zzso
