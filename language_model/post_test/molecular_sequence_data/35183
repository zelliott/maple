zzso harbors several zzso zzso genes that zzso members of three zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso exchange zzso One of them is the zzso family represented by three members in zzso zzso zzso zzso and a further protein distinguished by several zzso zzso zzso are characterized by a zzso tandem domain and have roles in cell zzso and zzso 

We study here zzso In zzso its zzso domain bound zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When following the distribution of zzso in zzso we observed the protein in the zzso and at the plasma zzso zzso when cells formed zzso zzso or zzso zzso was conspicuously absent from areas of the plasma membrane which were involved in these zzso zzso cells lacking zzso exhibited an impaired zzso and showed significantly reduced speed and less persistence during zzso Cellular properties associated with zzso zzso like zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso zzso with roles in membrane trafficking and signal zzso have been identified as putative interaction partners consistent with the data obtained from zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso component and is associated with the plasma membrane in a pattern distinctly different from the zzso of zzso zzso analysis reveals that loss of the protein affects cellular processes that involve membrane flow and the zzso zzso
