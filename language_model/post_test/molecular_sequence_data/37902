We have identified a new zzso major basic protein gene family member in the mouse and have given it the designation zzso major basic zzso zzso The gene was initially characterized as a unique expressed sequence tag zzso clone having significant identity to the previously recognized member of this gene family, zzso The zzso was used to screen and isolate zzso from a bone zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso clone of zzso was isolated and this gene was shown to be physically linked to within 100 zzso of zzso on the central region of mouse zzso zzso Progressive similarity alignment of the deduced zzso open reading frame demonstrates the apparent conservation of the zzso protein structure found in the other known zzso zzso zzso zzso maintains the zzso nature associated with these proteins with a predicted zzso of zzso However, unlike the human zzso which display a three orders of magnitude charge difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is only slightly less zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso of the zzso gene parallels zzso and is confined to zzso compartments engaged in zzso Moreover, using zzso knockout mice and zzso with an zzso that recognizes both zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso protein expression is restricted to zzso zzso zzso
