zzso zzso have been reported to zzso insect resistance in transgenic plants, except for a rice zzso inhibitor that zzso drought tolerance in transgenic rice zzso We have cloned a zzso inhibitor of tobacco that is expressed under treatment with zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso codes for a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with a deduced sequence of zzso zzso zzso We have generated transgenic tobacco plants expressing the zzso inhibitor zzso under the zzso zzso When analyzed in the zzso generation, these transgenic plants exhibited tolerance to sodium zzso variable pH and zzso together with the expected resistance to the insect zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The transgenic plants showed enhanced seed zzso root length and zzso ratio, significantly enhanced total zzso content and reduced zzso zzso substances under zzso Under sodium zzso treatment, the transgenic plants have enhanced zzso inhibitor zzso The transgenic plants exhibited a higher zzso content and an optimum zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of transgenic plants with zzso zzso inhibitor expression showing tolerance to a wide range variable pH in the culture medium along with other zzso
