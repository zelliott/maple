zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso zzso proteins that are important in both human immunity and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso are found in diverse bacterial species, including most human zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of a bacterial zzso protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso domain and two novel zzso zzso that resemble zzso H and zzso 8, zzso The entire protein adopts a flat zzso shape, characteristic of other zzso zzso that may be important for zzso This zzso structure provides new features and insights not observed in two previous zzso zzso zzso context analysis zzso that zzso may be involved in a novel zzso or zzso system, suggesting an important role for these zzso zzso which were likely to have been inherited from zzso via horizontal gene transfer, in the adaptation of zzso bacteria to the host zzso
