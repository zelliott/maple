We present a simple zzso zzso based on zzso chain reaction zzso in combination with zzso zzso gel zzso zzso which allows comprehensive zzso scanning of the entire coding sequence and zzso junctions of the zzso gene in one zzso zzso The key features of the present method are zzso all fragments can be amplified using one common zzso zzso zzso all fragments can be scanned for zzso on a single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all fragments were tailored by the attachment of appropriate zzso zzso and otherwise manipulated to consist of only two melting zzso in order to maximize resolution of zzso by zzso The entire procedure starting with a sample of zzso DNA can be completed within 6 zzso and has the potential to detect any sequence variation, irrespective of its location in the zzso zzso The zzso detection sensitivity was demonstrated by the analysis of 26 constructed control zzso distributed over the whole of the zzso zzso We have applied the method to genetic diagnosis in 43 cases of zzso zzso Overall, a point zzso zzso or zzso was found in 26 zzso of the zzso In addition to zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso 11 was found in one sample, illustrating the importance of comprehensive gene scanning for reliable zzso
