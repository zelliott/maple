The entry of enveloped viruses into cells is normally zzso by fusion between viral and cellular zzso in which the fusion zzso plays a crucial zzso The fusion peptides of group II zzso zzso F proteins are quite zzso with a zzso region located at the N terminal of the zzso zzso For this report, we used zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to study the structure and function of the fusion zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F protein zzso Five zzso in the fusion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were generated zzso and the zzso f genes were transformed into the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to completely abolish the ability of the zzso zzso to produce infectious zzso virus, while the zzso zzso and zzso did zzso The zzso envelope fusion zzso demonstrated that the zzso substitution increased the zzso of zzso while the zzso substitution reduced its zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the structure of a synthetic fusion zzso of zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso The fusion zzso appeared to be an zzso structure composed of a flexible zzso in the N zzso from zzso to zzso a zzso from zzso to zzso a turn at zzso and a regular zzso from zzso to zzso The data provide the first zzso structure of a zzso fusion zzso and allow us to further understand the relationship of structure and function of the fusion zzso
