We show that sequence comparisons at different levels of resolution can efficiently guide functional analyses of regulatory regions in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alignments of several zzso genes guided discovery of minimal regulatory regions that are active in zzso reporter zzso Using the zzso I zzso locus as a case study, we show that more refined local sequence analyses can then be used to reveal functional zzso within a regulatory zzso A high-resolution zzso zzso in conjunction with comparative sequence analyses defined essential sequence elements within the zzso regulatory zzso Finally, we found a zzso quantitative relationship between function and sequence divergence of zzso functional zzso This work demonstrates the power of comparative sequence analysis between the two zzso species for guiding gene regulatory zzso
