The neutral theory often is presented as a theory of zzso or silent changes at an isolated zzso zzso relevant to marking the steady pace of zzso but not to the origin of biological structure, function, or zzso Nevertheless, precisely these issues can be addressed in neutral models, such as those elaborated here with regard to scrambled zzso zzso zzso zzso editing, the transition from zzso to zzso zzso and the retention of duplicate zzso All of these are instances of a more general scheme of zzso neutral zzso that zzso biased variation, zzso zzso and excess capacities to account for a complex series of steps giving rise to novel structures or zzso The directional and constructive outcomes of these models are due not to neutral zzso zzso per se, but to these other zzso zzso models of this type may help to clarify the poorly understood role of zzso factors in evolutionary innovation and zzso
