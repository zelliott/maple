zzso acid is zzso in zzso coli by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A, the genes of which are named zzso and zzso In our previous work we cloned and characterized the two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report on the expression of the zzso gene under control of the zzso left promoter of the zzso zzso The yield of the active gene product zzso zzso was enhanced up to zzso of the soluble cell zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso in a three-step procedure and the reading frame of the zzso zzso gene was confirmed by zzso degradation of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows no classical zzso zzso but is subject to a zzso zzso The apparent zzso values were different for zzso zzso below and above zzso and were determined to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The active form of the zzso is a zzso of zzso Da and contains one zzso of zzso and nine zzso zzso four of which built up two zzso zzso The zzso point of the protein was determined to be at pH zzso Chemical modifications of the zzso showed that at least one zzso and one zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso The zzso domain is located in the zzso part of the zzso chain as revealed by a sequence comparison to other zzso binding zzso Furthermore, there is evidence for a relationship to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
