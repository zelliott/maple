zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential protein critical for zzso assembly and zzso Its zzso shadow domain zzso zzso a requirement for binding protein partners that contain a zzso zzso How does zzso select among its many different zzso zzso zzso binds tightly to zzso zzso 2 zzso but zzso to zzso We investigated differences in zzso and the impact of the zzso extension zzso by contrasting zzso to its zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ in the zzso zzso with zzso having an zzso at position 188 rather than zzso We find that while this substitution reduces the zzso constant, it does not impact the binding surface as demonstrated by unchanged partner binding zzso However, the zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso as compared with 87 zzso in zzso is zzso the charged zzso in zzso are necessary for tight zzso zzso zzso a panel of zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso we find that zzso in zzso interacts with zzso but not zzso supporting the conclusion that different sites in the binding surface provide discrimination for partner zzso Partner sequence is also critical for zzso as the remaining difference in binding between zzso and zzso zzso is eliminated by swapping the zzso motifs between the zzso Taken together, these studies indicate that the binding surface of the zzso zzso plus its short zzso provide the needed discrimination among zzso partners, and that the zzso is important for zzso the interactions of the zzso zzso zzso
