Plants survive adverse conditions by modulating their growth in response to a changing zzso zzso zzso play a key role in these zzso responses by stimulating the degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to its zzso zzso enables association of zzso with zzso This leads to the zzso zzso degradation of zzso and consequently growth zzso We report that zzso growth control can be regulated independently of zzso We demonstrate that when a proportion of zzso is zzso to the Small zzso zzso zzso zzso the extent of zzso increases during zzso We identify a zzso in zzso and demonstrate that zzso zzso binds to this motif in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso leads to an zzso of zzso zzso resulting in beneficial growth restraint during zzso We conclude that plants have developed a zzso mechanism to control zzso
