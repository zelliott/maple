We have zzso the zzso regions in one acute zzso leukemia zzso with zzso resulting in the formation of a zzso hybrid gene and in four zzso zzso zzso three of which had the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso fusion gene and one with zzso and an zzso hybrid zzso The zzso were localized to zzso 7 of zzso zzso 1 of zzso an zzso sequence of zzso and zzso 7 of zzso In two zzso cases with zzso and in the zzso the breaks in zzso 7 of zzso had occurred close to each other, a few zzso downstream from a zzso zzso repeat zzso The break in the two zzso had occurred in the same zzso zzso and in the zzso 40 zzso upstream from the zzso The third case of zzso zzso had a break upstream and near a zzso repeat region and a sequence similar to the zzso bacterial zzso element was found to flank the zzso In the zzso with the zzso zzso hybrid zzso the break in zzso 7 of zzso had occurred close to an zzso zzso Similarly, in all 4 zzso the breaks in zzso 1 of zzso were near an zzso zzso No zzso or other repetitive sequences were found 250 zzso upstream or downstream from the break in the zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso with zzso and in one zzso with zzso there were one, two and six, respectively, zzso identity between the contributing zzso sequences in the zzso In the other two zzso cases, two and three extra zzso of unknown origin were inserted between the zzso and zzso zzso At the junction and/or in its close vicinity, identical zzso frequently containing a zzso zzso were found in both partner zzso Our data thus show that all four zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristic motifs in the zzso regions which may serve as specific recognition sites for zzso proteins and have functional importance in the zzso events taking place between the zzso Different sequence motifs may, however, play a role in each individual zzso
