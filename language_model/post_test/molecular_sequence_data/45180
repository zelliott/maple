The zzso product of zzso zzso the expression of which is regulated by the zzso zzso is zzso through a type III zzso system into host zzso We investigated the function of zzso of zzso zzso by using cultured zzso zzso zzso invaded by an zzso deletion zzso altered their zzso into the zzso shape, which was not due to cell death, whereas cells invaded by the zzso strain kept their cell shape zzso The zzso zzso did not affect initial cell entry and zzso in cells, but the zzso formed zzso plaques on cell zzso indicating a zzso in zzso spread by the zzso An zzso deletion zzso also showed changes in cell zzso and zzso in bacterial spread to adjacent zzso In cells invaded by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress fibers was prominent at 3 h after zzso Analysis of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso protein accumulated on focal zzso structures in the infected host zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso protein in the focal contacts of infected cells may function to maintain an intact cell zzso The zzso change induced by invasion of the zzso zzso may affect secondary bacterial zzso
