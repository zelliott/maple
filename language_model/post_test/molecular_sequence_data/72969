The seed coat is a maternal organ which surrounds the zzso and is involved in the control of its zzso This study with pea zzso zzso zzso was conducted to understand more fully the zzso zzso occurring in the seed zzso The zzso of soluble zzso the starch content, and the activities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alkaline and soluble acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared at four zzso stages during seed zzso Among the four zzso only zzso activity was very high and strongly correlated with the starch concentration in the seed zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso from pea seed coats in a three-step zzso consisting of zzso zzso gel zzso and affinity zzso The zzso was characterized at the zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso properties which allow it to function in the direction of both zzso zzso and zzso The zzso ratio of its four zzso was close to the theoretical equilibrium constant at the four zzso stages we zzso A zzso experiment on seed coats has shown that zzso activity is zzso in zzso and can produce 37% of zzso zzso in the seed coat cells zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso could play a central role in the control of zzso concentration in the seed coat cells in response to the demand for zzso in the zzso during the development of the zzso
