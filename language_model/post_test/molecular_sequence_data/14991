zzso of zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso agent with 20 zzso acid segment from zzso in zzso coli was zzso The DNA zzso zzso zzso was zzso in light of the zzso coli preferred zzso by zzso overlapping zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was fused with zzso zzso gene to construct a zzso zzso zzso The resulting expression level of the fusion protein zzso zzso 20 zzso accounted for zzso of cellular zzso and about zzso of the target proteins were in a soluble zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the total soluble zzso The soluble fusion protein was easily zzso to near zzso by affinity zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso was effectively obtained by zzso zzso of the fusion protein with factor zzso An unknown site in the zzso fusion zzso which can be zzso by factor zzso to produce approximately 10 zzso zzso was zzso Compared with the unknown site, the specific site of zzso zzso was easier to be recognized and zzso by factor zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso assisted laser zzso zzso is equal to its theoretical molecular zzso zzso activity zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso of the key strategies for the expression of zzso peptides zzso such as zzso usage bias, fusion partner and zzso zzso would provide an efficient and facile platform for the production or study of zzso
