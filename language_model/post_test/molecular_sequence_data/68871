The replication region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 29 was zzso zzso derivatives of zzso were introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 and examined for their ability to replicate zzso The zzso sequence had one open reading frame zzso for a 315 zzso acid protein zzso Comparisons with proteins zzso by other zzso bacterial plasmids strongly suggest that the deduced protein zzso zzso by zzso has a zzso zzso zzso also contains a DNA sequence similar to the origin zzso sequences of zzso or zzso which initiate zzso replication at the plus zzso In a zzso system, zzso coli zzso carrying zzso produced a protein that was considered to zzso to the product of the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is zzso following a zzso mechanism via zzso DNA zzso
