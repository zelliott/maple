zzso are essential components of basement zzso playing important roles in cell zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso are composed of an zzso zzso and gamma chains held together by zzso zzso The first zzso identified, from the mouse zzso zzso zzso is now referred to as zzso zzso is expressed in the mouse developing lung by zzso and zzso cells and plays a role in branching zzso Since zzso are zzso zzso different zzso sites are engaged in promoting lung zzso by serving different functions at different stages of zzso This study shows that the cross region of the zzso selectively promotes zzso cell zzso The outer zzso region of alpha 1 and beta 1 chains mediates zzso zzso and thereby basement membrane formation and zzso cell zzso The inner zzso region of zzso beta 1 chain binds to zzso zzso zzso and both stimulate zzso zzso While the combined effect of these zzso active sites results in normal lung tissue structure and branching zzso different zzso abnormalities of the lung may result from zzso in each of zzso
