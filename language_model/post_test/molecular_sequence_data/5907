Two zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso specificity zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso They zzso putative type I restriction and modification zzso systems with maximum sequence zzso to the type zzso family, which includes zzso and zzso Each locus encodes an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and two DNA specificity zzso zzso The gene organization at each locus is such that zzso and zzso are flanked by two zzso zzso Within each zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso in tandem by the same DNA zzso while the second zzso gene is zzso by the complementary strand but without overlap with the other three zzso zzso The zzso and zzso sequences of one locus are almost identical to their counterparts in the zzso The four zzso genes zzso per zzso are highly zzso at their zzso ends and also share sequence similarities in the 3' ends of their corresponding coding zzso zzso to the disposition of and sequence similarities among the zzso zzso they form zzso repeats at each zzso Analysis by zzso chain reaction zzso has shown that both zzso behave as zzso DNA zzso elements with multiple inversion sites, termed zzso occurring within the zzso zzso The zzso lead to a zzso of zzso zzso generating an array of zzso genes that probably zzso S zzso possessing alternative zzso zzso zzso information obtained from the analysis of zzso transcripts by zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso indicates that inversion zzso the zzso of alternative zzso genes by the relocation of coding sequences downstream of a promoter and zzso site zzso situated at one end of each zzso
