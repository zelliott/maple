zzso resistance protein 1 zzso is an zzso cassette zzso that zzso resistance to drugs and mediates the transport of organic zzso zzso has a core structure of two membrane spanning zzso zzso each followed by a zzso binding zzso This core structure is preceded by a third zzso with five zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso each contain six TM zzso We investigated the consequences of Ala substitution of 18 Pro zzso in both the zzso and TM regions of zzso and zzso on zzso expression and organic zzso transport zzso All zzso zzso except zzso were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells at levels comparable with zzso zzso In addition, five zzso containing zzso of Pro zzso in or zzso to the TM zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso exhibited significantly reduced transport of five organic zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in the zzso loop zzso linking zzso to zzso caused a substantial increase in zzso and zzso zzso whereas transport of other organic zzso was reduced or zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso dependence of transport and binding by the zzso zzso were also zzso Our findings demonstrate the importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso transport function and suggest that zzso may play a differential role in zzso the activity of the zzso binding zzso to the zzso of different zzso across the zzso
