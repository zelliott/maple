A novel method, zzso zzso zzso method, was developed for simultaneous concentration of viruses and zzso from a single water zzso zzso and zzso in a water sample were mixed with a zzso solution and zzso on an zzso zzso zzso virus and zzso samples were obtained as zzso and zzso zzso respectively, by vigorous vortex mixing of the membrane and zzso of the zzso zzso The highest recovery efficiencies of model microbes from river water and tap water by this zzso method were obtained using a mixed cellulose zzso membrane with a pore size of zzso zzso zzso as the zzso membrane and zzso as the zzso zzso The recovery was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The zzso method detected successfully indigenous viruses and zzso in wastewater and river water samples from the zzso zzso Japan, showing an overall positive rate of zzso zzso for human zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso By direct DNA sequencing, a total of four zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso of zzso zzso were identified in the water samples, indicating that the river water was contaminated with feces from various zzso including zzso
