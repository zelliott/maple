To identify rules for the design of efficient zzso peptides that deliver therapeutic agents into zzso zzso we compared the properties of two closely related primary zzso peptides that mainly differ by their zzso zzso On the basis of a zzso zzso that is zzso in water and that promotes efficient cellular zzso of zzso acids through zzso association, we have designed a zzso zzso that is predicted to adopt a zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso a zzso zzso transition into a sheet structure, while zzso remains zzso zzso experiments show that both peptides can spontaneously insert into zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso indicates that both peptides interact with zzso in the liquid expanded and liquid condensed zzso zzso observations reveal that the peptides strongly disrupt the zzso organization of the zzso and that the zzso state can influence the zzso by model zzso
