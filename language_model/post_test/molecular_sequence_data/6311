Using zzso zzso zzso based on zzso regions of the zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso of DNA was amplified by the zzso chain reaction from zzso zzso zzso zzso This fragment, which showed significant zzso with zzso coli zzso was used as a probe to isolate a zzso zzso clone containing zzso from an Ana DNA zzso zzso analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso with zzso identity with zzso coli zzso zzso of Ana zzso is a small, unidentified ORF, transcribed in the same zzso An zzso lying downstream of the zzso coding region and transcribed in the opposite orientation, shows zzso with bacterial zzso zzso zzso Single copies of zzso have been identified in Ana and two other zzso Multiple transcripts zzso to zzso were detected by Northern zzso
