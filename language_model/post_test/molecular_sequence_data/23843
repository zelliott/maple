zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso function as important zzso sensors as well as key regulators of energy zzso zzso plays a dynamic role in energy combustion by zzso zzso fatty acid zzso systems primarily in liver, whereas zzso functions as a regulator of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso expression approach, in zzso deficient mouse liver results in zzso zzso with concurrent expression of zzso specific zzso In this study, to gain a global molecular understanding of zzso gene expression in liver, we have analyzed gene expression profiles using the zzso zzso mouse expression array set zzso that enables a comprehensive gene expression profiling with zzso zzso zzso data analysis provided us with over zzso genes zzso fourfold or higher, and 121 genes zzso fourfold or higher in liver with zzso zzso zzso We have found 101 zzso genes out of zzso zzso and 29 zzso among the zzso gene categories, zzso Of 177 functionally characterized candidate genes in the zzso category many appear to be involved in zzso zzso metabolism and signal zzso To focus attention on the zzso genes in the zzso category, we cloned the full-length zzso of two novel candidates, which we designated as zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is not normally expressed in liver but induced robustly in liver with zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso which encodes a 38 zzso zzso zzso zzso is a low abundant transcript in normal liver, but induced dramatically following zzso zzso The expression of these two genes was not increased in fatty zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso The identification of these and other novel zzso genes should provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying energy storage and zzso zzso
