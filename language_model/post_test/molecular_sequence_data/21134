A zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was identified by sequence comparison in the zzso database, zzso functionally expressed in zzso coli, zzso and zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso structure was determined by X-ray zzso and has been refined at zzso zzso resolution to an zzso of zzso The zzso is composed of an zzso fold and a cap domain and the overall fold is similar to other known zzso zzso Active site zzso were identified as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso like zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso As a consequence, these zzso have in common the relative position of their zzso zzso within the structure and also show some similarities in the zzso zzso The zzso shows high preference for zzso and does not accept zzso zzso halo zzso or halo zzso It is a zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and exhibits maximum activity between 33 and zzso with a pH optimum between pH 8 and zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, from the zzso of zzso it was found that the zzso possesses a large and open active site zzso zzso experiments were performed to explain the zzso determined zzso zzso
