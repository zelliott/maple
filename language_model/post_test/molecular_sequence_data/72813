We describe here the sequence and zzso analysis of a gene from the zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso to the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is found to share the highest degree of zzso with the only other described zzso zzso alpha zzso characterized from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the translation of the zzso gene reveals the presence of the following previously described zzso an zzso alpha domain rich in zzso and basic zzso an X domain and four zzso binding motifs zzso A putative zzso zzso zzso zzso binding element is also zzso The zzso zzso alpha protein would now represent the shortest zzso of this expanding family with zzso zzso and a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso A Northern analysis indicates that the zzso zzso alpha protein gene transcript is present at low levels suggesting that zzso alpha is likely to be only a minor cell zzso The presence of an zzso alpha zzso in another kingdom within the zzso domain possessing the full suite of zzso motifs is significant in several zzso It not only supports the zzso character of the domain zzso but suggests that these zzso have similar functions in these organisms and zzso the ancient origins of the protein export zzso
