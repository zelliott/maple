We have developed a new technique for the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso This method measures the conversion of a larger amplified DNA zzso to a shorter DNA product zzso with zzso The procedure uses pairs of zzso zzso one of which is zzso to cleave zzso DNA at closely spaced zzso The extent of zzso by the zzso restriction zzso is zzso by amplification of these zzso products with zzso zzso and radioactive labeling of the zzso The ratio of the two amplified fragments zzso with the degree of zzso at the restriction zzso The analysis is zzso zzso internally controlled and requires small quantities of zzso zzso
