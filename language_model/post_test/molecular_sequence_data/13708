The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics of zzso as a zzso of zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso using the standard procedures of zzso zzso The conversion of zzso to zzso was studied using zzso zzso I and zzso With rats as the animal model, the stability of zzso in zzso zzso was determined, then the transport characteristics of zzso were studied using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso relatively stable in zzso zzso and zzso fluid, had a zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso Its zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by 20 zzso zzso by a mixture of zzso 80 zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso and by 2 zzso zzso Further, in zzso chambers, its zzso to zzso zzso decreased dramatically with zzso zzso studies showed that zzso was zzso by zzso zzso I, an zzso releasing the zzso zzso acid, with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein and 21 zzso respectively, and that zzso was zzso by zzso with zzso and zzso of 44 zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso a potential zzso of zzso is absorbed by the zzso zzso zzso is relatively stable in the gut wall, and is converted to zzso by zzso with the zzso by zzso zzso I to zzso as the rate limiting zzso
