A zzso zzso DNA of zzso zzso strain R zzso has been shown to have a 5 zzso deletion which removes the zzso sequence and its surrounding zzso sequences between the pro zzso and 15 S zzso zzso The deleted DNA has been zzso and is found to be flanked by two 11 zzso direct zzso The deletion zzso displays a normal zzso in zzso zzso This implies that the zzso sequence is not required for expression of the respiratory zzso
