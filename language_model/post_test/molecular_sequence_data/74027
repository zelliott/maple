A new surface zzso named zzso which is distinct from the previously described zzso zzso outer membrane proteins was zzso An zzso zzso named zzso reacted with zzso of the zzso strains tested indicating that the zzso recognized by this particular zzso is widely distributed and highly zzso Western zzso experiments indicated that zzso zzso is directed against a protein band with an approximate molecular mass of zzso but also recognized a minor protein band with an approximate molecular mass of zzso This zzso exhibited zzso activity against four zzso zzso two zzso of zzso B, and one isolate from each zzso A and C, and passively protected mice against an experimental zzso To further characterize the zzso protein and to evaluate the protective potential of zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was identified and cloned into a low copy expression zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso insert revealed an zzso of 525 zzso coding for a zzso of 174 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso and a zzso point of zzso Three injections of either 10 or 20 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein efficiently protected zzso of the mice against a zzso deadly challenge comparatively to the zzso observed in the control zzso The fact that the zzso protein can elicit the production of zzso and protective zzso emphasize its potential as a vaccine zzso
