zzso is an zzso coli zzso factor that activates expression of the zzso zzso in response to the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso stimulates zzso initiation at the zzso promoter by binding to four sites centered at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso upstream of the transcript start zzso In a previous study, we described a spontaneous zzso that exhibited increased zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso carries five consecutive base changes at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso upstream of the zzso transcript zzso Here we show that these changes improve zzso binding to the target site centered at position zzso at the zzso promoter and that this improvement is responsible for increased promoter zzso Thus, the activity of the zzso promoter is fixed by the occupation by zzso of a DNA site that zzso the zzso zzso zzso appears to be a typical class zzso zzso zzso
