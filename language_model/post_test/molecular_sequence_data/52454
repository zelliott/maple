The zzso transmitted zzso is a cell surface product of three gene zzso 1) zzso (formerly zzso a class I zzso heavy zzso 2) beta zzso and 3) zzso transmitted factor zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the reduced form of zzso zzso zzso This class I zzso has been shown to be an zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso is necessary for binding to zzso it is not zzso We proposed that the R group of the zzso acid in position 1 plays a pivotal role in zzso binding to zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso differing in size and zzso of the R group were zzso zzso with other zzso zzso acids such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no significant effect on the ability of these zzso alpha zzso to sensitize target cells zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta bound zzso to zzso in a zzso competition zzso Moreover, the zzso analogue bound in an zzso zzso To determine the limitations of the putative zzso pocket, zzso zzso were constructed incorporating zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso or zzso replaced the native zzso these zzso derivatives did not show significant binding to zzso zzso the presence of a zzso R group zzso than zzso is necessary for an zzso zzso to bind zzso in an zzso zzso Additionally, the ability of zzso to discriminate between the optical forms of zzso and zzso demonstrates that this zzso pocket is zzso in its ability to bind zzso Thus, we have defined three requirements for zzso binding to zzso an zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso a zzso R group at position 1 to maintain this zzso zzso and the correct zzso of the first zzso zzso
