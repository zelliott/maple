We screened 20,000 clones of an expressed sequence tag zzso library from zzso zzso zzso and obtained one zzso clone zzso a protein with similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso We also cloned the corresponding zzso designated as zzso from the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence consisted of a putative signal zzso of zzso acids and a mature protein of zzso zzso We engineered zzso for zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the aid of fused zzso zzso signal zzso and accumulated as an active zzso in the culture medium to a final level of 190 zzso after 5 zzso zzso zzso before and after treatment with zzso H migrated by zzso with a molecular mass of 31 and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed the greatest zzso activity toward zzso zzso lower activity toward zzso zzso and no zzso activity toward zzso zzso containing four or more carbon zzso The zzso zzso zzso the release of zzso acid from zzso zzso No activity was zzso using zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso in comparison to other zzso from zzso
