We have recently zzso et zzso 1992) introduced a family of novel zzso zzso zzso antagonists, based on the zzso structure, where the nitrogen accepts zzso that make zzso possible zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso where zzso cannot zzso In this paper, we present the details of a design strategy where the structurally closely related biologically active and inactive compounds are suggestive of zzso requirements of zzso Furthermore, since even those derivatives of the zzso peptides where the zzso was free were either devoid of zzso zzso activity or were extremely weak zzso it is suggested that these zzso do not interact with the conventional zzso nitrogen zzso To find this zzso site, a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso were zzso and their biological activities were determined in the mouse zzso zzso zzso
