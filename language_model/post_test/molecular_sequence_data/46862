To evaluate the role of zzso in producing zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso growth related gene product zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso in patients with zzso arthritis zzso and zzso zzso and subjects after traumatic injury zzso 

zzso cartilage specimens were obtained from 38 patients with zzso and 18 with zzso undergoing joint replacement zzso Healthy human cartilage was obtained from zzso zzso removed after trauma in 11 subjects with no history of joint pathology zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso cartilage by sequential zzso zzso and cultured in zzso zzso production was investigated in zzso condition and after 72 h incubation with zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso were evaluated by zzso 

zzso produce all these zzso to a different zzso zzso was a more potent stimulus than zzso in inducing production of all zzso except zzso We found no statistical differences among zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso for zzso production in either zzso conditions or after zzso zzso zzso induced zzso production can be modulated by zzso in different ways according to the various zzso while zzso does not affect zzso induced zzso zzso 

zzso produce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors zzso zzso effectively zzso zzso production, but production is scarcely modulated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso derived zzso may play a role in triggering the mechanisms involved in zzso and persistence of joint zzso
