DNA fragments from the temperate zzso zzso zzso were cloned into the zzso zzso zzso Five DNA fragments zzso promoter activity were selected by transformation of zzso zzso and were functional in zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequences of these fragments were determined, and primer extension analysis was used to locate the site of initiation of zzso from each promoter in both zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso was initiated from the same zzso in these two organisms, and the promoters contained zzso and zzso regions similar to the consensus sequence for zzso coli zzso The activities of three of the five promoters were decreased two- to zzso when a compatible zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso in either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Data from zzso zzso zzso experiments, and DNA sequence analysis indicate that this decrease in promoter activity requires a region of zzso that contains a zzso open reading zzso This region has been designated zzso (for zzso promoter zzso
