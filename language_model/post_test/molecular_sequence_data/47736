zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the first step of this reaction, is composed of two zzso each of which binds one copper zzso The zzso are held 11 A apart on either side of a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso reaction requires electron transfer between these zzso A plausible mechanism for electron transfer might involve zzso motion to decrease the distance between the copper zzso Our experiments show that zzso zzso core zzso is zzso active in the crystal phase, where zzso motion is not zzso Instead, structures of two states relevant to zzso indicate that water, zzso and active site zzso may provide an electron transfer zzso that exists only during the zzso zzso zzso
