While zzso in genes that function in the core molecular clock may disrupt zzso zzso their relevance to zzso variation in zzso zzso and respiratory function is zzso The zzso Clock gene product is an essential regulator of central and peripheral zzso rhythms in zzso We have zzso the complete zzso organization of the Clock gene in rat and have carried out an extensive search for single zzso zzso zzso in a panel of 12 zzso rat strains that exhibit diversity in studies of central and peripheral organ function and zzso The rat Clock gene consists of 23 zzso spanning approximately 75 zzso Comparative sequence analysis identified 33 novel zzso including 32 that distinguish the Brown Norway zzso rat from the other strains zzso Most notable were two novel zzso in the zzso sequence at zzso 8, zzso and zzso occurring in a segment of the highly zzso zzso domain of the zzso These results afford the opportunity to assess the impact of genetic variation in Clock on central and peripheral functions subject to the core molecular clock and to test the importance of Clock zzso in explaining diversity among rat strains in the expression of zzso such as blood pressure, subject to zzso zzso
