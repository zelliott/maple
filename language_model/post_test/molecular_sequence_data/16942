Here we describe the design and construction of zzso circular DNA zzso Four zzso binding motifs directed at zzso targets are used as a model set from which larger, zzso zzso are constructed in a straightforward zzso zzso or zzso zzso of precursor zzso provides a stabilizing mechanism against degradation by the zzso zzso activity of blood products without the need for zzso chemical zzso In many cases, circular DNA zzso zzso are extended beyond 10 h in serum and zzso making such zzso viable for therapeutic and diagnostic zzso zzso and three-way junctions are used as scaffold zzso around which two, three, or four zzso motifs can be arranged in a structurally defined manner, giving rise to improved binding characteristics through stability and zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted against zzso display improved zzso potency with zzso values zzso better than those of the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso duplex regions provide an opportunity to incorporate additional zzso factor binding zzso whereas ancillary zzso can be used to provide further zzso These zzso zzso provide a starting point for merging the principles of DNA zzso with zzso zzso
