During zzso maturation of zzso zzso maternal zzso undergo changes in translation and in the length of their zzso zzso In general, those zzso that are zzso zzso zzso zzso become zzso while zzso zzso lose their zzso zzso The activated class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B and zzso zzso while the proteins that stop being made include zzso and zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso zzso can be brought about in zzso by preventing the interaction of zzso with central portions of the 3' zzso regions zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso A zzso In this report, we show that clam egg extracts are capable of zzso zzso of added zzso since the 3' untranslated regions zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso while that of zzso zzso is zzso In contrast, zzso zzso as in zzso are essentially devoid of zzso zzso We present an initial zzso of the zzso sequences in the 3' zzso of zzso zzso zzso required for zzso The results suggest that the sequences for zzso zzso are more complex and extensive than those determined in zzso and that they may partly overlap with the masking zzso
