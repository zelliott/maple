zzso genes from two laboratory grown human zzso virus type 1 zzso strains and from two zzso that had not been zzso in zzso were introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso The stable expression of all four zzso proteins was associated with an almost complete zzso of zzso cell surface zzso The consequences of the presence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso surface zzso and zzso zzso effect were examined in zzso cells in which the zzso zzso gene was expressed from a zzso virus zzso The presence of zzso did not modify the processing of zzso into its zzso but resulted in a significant decrease of cell surface levels of zzso associated with a dramatic reduction of the zzso cell zzso Surface levels of zzso envelope zzso unable to bind zzso were not altered in zzso cells, suggesting that the phenomenon was zzso zzso The zzso zzso of fully processed envelope zzso could significantly delay the zzso effect associated with envelope surface expression in zzso cells and may be relevant to the selective advantage associated with zzso during the in zzso infectious zzso
