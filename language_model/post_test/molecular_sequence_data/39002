Complete zzso sequences of the coat protein gene zzso of banana zzso top virus zzso were obtained from five geographical zzso by zzso Analysis of these sequences revealed two distinct groups of zzso zzso with those from the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam forming the Asian group while the South zzso group consisted of zzso from Australia, zzso and zzso At the zzso level, the sequences of zzso were more similar between zzso from the same group zzso zzso than between members of the two different groups zzso zzso At the zzso acid level, the zzso coat protein remained highly zzso with a maximum of zzso zzso sequence variation between all zzso in this zzso There was a significantly higher degree of divergence between the Asian zzso which may indicate that zzso has been present in this region for an extended period of time or that there have been multiple introductions of zzso into zzso The high level of conservation in the zzso coat protein suggests that any of the zzso sequences presented in this study would probably be equally effective as zzso in attempts to generate transgenic banana plants with resistance to both groups of zzso zzso
