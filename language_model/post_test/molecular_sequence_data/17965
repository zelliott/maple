zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of Y zzso from primary zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of the DNA yielded several zzso DNA clones which zzso in screening the different clone zzso By DNA sequencing we found that the zzso of these zzso clones contain blocks of zzso zzso zzso contains a large fraction of transcripts with this simple repeated zzso zzso With the aid of transcript in zzso zzso we discovered that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the primary sites of zzso of zzso in zzso In addition, we found a zzso zzso of zzso In both the zzso and zzso the zzso strand is zzso while in the zzso zzso is also zzso zzso zzso zzso also react with the protein bodies in zzso zzso These observations are discussed in the context of possible functions of zzso transcripts in zzso
