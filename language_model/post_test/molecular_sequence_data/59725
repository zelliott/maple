A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso zzso zzso did not take up nitrate or accumulate zzso when grown in zzso supplemented with up to 10 zzso nitrate under zzso zzso however, it displayed zzso levels of zzso Delta zzso nitrate zzso zzso zzso in zzso with nitrate under zzso conditions, zzso zzso accumulated fivefold less zzso than the zzso The zzso in zzso zzso zzso could be zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso The gene affected by zzso zzso in zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that this zzso designated zzso encodes a highly zzso zzso zzso protein of 388 zzso acids and shows similarities to transport proteins that play a role in nitrate import or zzso zzso The inability of zzso to take up nitrate under zzso conditions and its ability to take up and accumulate zzso in the presence of zzso zzso a nitrate zzso under the same conditions suggest that zzso represents a transport protein required for nitrate zzso under zzso conditions in zzso zzso
