Using the suppression zzso zzso method, we isolated five gene families, including zzso proteins zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso transfer proteins zzso from fast zzso cotton fiber zzso zzso profile analysis using zzso array technology showed that most of these gene families were highly expressed during early cotton fiber zzso stages zzso zzso days post zzso zzso Many transcripts accumulated over zzso in 10 zzso fiber cells than in 0 zzso zzso The entire gene family zzso together with 20 individual members in other 4 gene families, are reported in cotton for the first zzso zzso of cell wall zzso wall loosening zzso zzso and zzso transfer protein may contribute directly to the zzso and development of fiber zzso
