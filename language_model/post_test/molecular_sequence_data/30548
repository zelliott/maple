The zzso zzso structures on the envelope zzso zzso of human zzso virus 1 derived from chronically infected zzso zzso cells have been investigated by zzso zzso after release from protein by zzso labeling with zzso and zzso on zzso columns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (Mr zzso and on zzso zzso A substantially greater diversity of zzso structures was detected than among those released by zzso from zzso zzso produced in Chinese zzso zzso cells and investigated by similar procedures zzso zzso zzso zzso Larkin, zzso Solomon, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso and among those released by zzso from zzso zzso isolated from infected zzso cells after zzso labeling with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Schneider, zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso of the zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Such structures were lacking on zzso zzso and could not be detected on the metabolically labeled, zzso zzso As in the earlier zzso zzso chains lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a series of high zzso structures with zzso zzso zzso were zzso In addition, an array of zzso chains having one or more outer chains with zzso zzso were detected in this study, but with additional zzso that require further zzso The number of potential zzso sites on zzso is on the order of 20, but the zzso structures are far more zzso Thus, the salient conclusion from this and earlier investigations is that alternative structures occur on at least some of the zzso sites and that numerous zzso zzso of this zzso are produced even within a single cell zzso Since the zzso is the product of host cell zzso an even greater number of zzso zzso of zzso are predicted to arise from the zzso cell populations harboring the virus in in zzso zzso
