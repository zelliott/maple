A zzso model to explain the biological activity of zzso zzso a potent blocker for zzso channels, was developed by searching common spatial arrangements of functionally important zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The first three are structurally and functionally related to one another, and specifically target to zzso type zzso zzso The last three are structurally unrelated to the first three but have the ability to zzso zzso zzso on the same types of zzso zzso In order to obtain the correct electronic surface potential, thought to be crucial for the zzso function, we determined the three-dimensional solution structure of zzso by zzso zzso using its correct zzso acid sequence recently determined by our zzso The most interesting characteristic of our model is that zzso has two binding sites to zzso zzso one is the zzso domain made up of zzso zzso at positions 5 in the zzso 28 and 29 in the zzso and the other is the zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso The zzso domain and the zzso are located at the opposite sides of the molecular structure and are separated by about 25 A between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The functional zzso is characterized by three zzso zzso approximately zzso A zzso zzso center of the zzso aromatic zzso zzso approximately zzso A zzso zzso center of the zzso ring of the zzso zzso group), and zzso approximately zzso 3 A (the center of the zzso aromatic zzso center of the zzso ring of the zzso zzso zzso This model should aid in the pharmaceutical design of zzso and zzso drugs with zzso channel blocking zzso as well as in understanding of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso
