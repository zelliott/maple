zzso of the zzso zzso have been widely described in plants, but only recently have zzso organisms been shown to zzso zzso In this work we describe novel zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which we name zzso and zzso zzso elements do not have Terminal zzso zzso zzso at their zzso and generate Target Site zzso zzso of 9 base zzso zzso zzso code for a zzso zzso and zzso zinc finger zzso while zzso elements comprise these same zzso plus a zzso zinc zzso zzso of transcript sequences from both elements back to the zzso indicates that they are subject to zzso to produce mature zzso zzso analyses indicate that these zzso represent a new lineage of zzso zzso elements with characteristics that are distinct from the recently described Phantom zzso zzso of these novel zzso zzso provides new insights in the evolution of zzso elements in zzso
