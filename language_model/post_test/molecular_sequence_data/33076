The zzso : zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso transport by zzso it to zzso Previously, we reported a zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso by zzso Here we report that zzso zzso R contains an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso organized in a cluster with a putative zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso While single gene disruption strains of either zzso or zzso were able to zzso zzso or zzso as sole carbon sources, a double disruption strain exhibited defects in zzso of both carbon zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso was induced in the presence of either zzso or zzso although disruption of zzso affected only zzso zzso Moreover, in the presence of either zzso or zzso zzso completely zzso the expression of zzso but only slightly zzso that of zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso have a redundant role in zzso transport even though the zzso repression control of their zzso genes is zzso We also show that expression of both zzso and zzso requires the general zzso
