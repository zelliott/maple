zzso zzso plays essential roles in zzso zzso zzso Like zzso in animals, the zzso core zzso protein zzso is progressively zzso and becomes extensively zzso before its zzso In this study, by using zzso zzso protein from zzso we identified 43 in zzso zzso zzso sites by mass zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso and zzso are responsible for most zzso zzso events and identify an additional 33 zzso sites by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isotope labeling and quantitative zzso analyses suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso profile is primarily due to progressive zzso at the majority of these newly discovered zzso zzso Furthermore, systematic zzso of the identified zzso zzso sites led to either long or short period zzso These changes in zzso period are attributed to increases or decreases in zzso stability, zzso Together, this comprehensive study of zzso zzso reveals that regulation of zzso stability by multiple independent zzso events is a major factor that determines the period length of the zzso A model is proposed to explain how zzso stability is regulated by multiple zzso zzso
