The mouse orphan nuclear zzso zzso suppressed the expression of reporters fused to a hormone response element of the mouse cellular zzso zzso protein I gene zzso zzso was able to bind to a direct repeat with four zzso in the zzso zzso located within this hormone response element as zzso The specificity of zzso interactions was demonstrated by competition in gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso critical for zzso binding were mapped to both repeated zzso whereas the zzso and the zzso sequences were less zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso binding to this direct repeat were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso system, it was demonstrated that zzso of zzso was zzso by its zzso zzso The actions of zzso in regulating cellular zzso zzso protein I gene will likely influence zzso action and availability within the zzso
