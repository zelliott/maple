We describe and review progress towards a global strategy that aims to extend the sensitivity, dynamic range, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso for microbial systems based upon the use of zzso accurate mass tags zzso produced by global protein zzso zzso The zzso strategy exploits high accuracy mass zzso using zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso to validate zzso zzso for a specific zzso from potential mass tags tentatively identified using tandem mass zzso zzso providing the basis for subsequent zzso without the need for routine zzso A high-resolution zzso liquid zzso separation combined with high sensitivity, and high-resolution accurate zzso zzso is shown to be capable of characterizing zzso zzso of more than zzso zzso sufficient for broad protein identification using zzso zzso of the approach include the high confidence of protein zzso its broad zzso coverage, and the capability for zzso labeling methods for precise relative protein abundance zzso The strategy has been initially evaluated using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional developments, including the use of zzso capabilities and methods for dynamic range expansion of zzso zzso that promise to further extend the quality of zzso zzso are also zzso
