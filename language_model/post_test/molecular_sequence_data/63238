The model marine zzso zzso zzso is until now the only zzso zzso known from a marine zzso Here, zzso analyses based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso genes revealed the presence of putative zzso zzso zzso in a diverse range of sponges from the western Pacific, Caribbean and zzso zzso diversity was limited even between different zzso with many of the obtained sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso forming a zzso apparently zzso (and zzso specific zzso analogous to those previously zzso from comparative zzso zzso gene studies of zzso zzso The presence of zzso in sponge larvae, as detected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as by zzso in zzso zzso suggests they are vertically transmitted and thus might be of importance for zzso zzso within the zzso
