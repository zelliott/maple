Short sequences that were over represented in a database of zzso promoter region sequences were zzso These sequences and others that were selected on the basis of the characteristics of known zzso were tested to determine if they were found predominantly at particular distances from the zzso start zzso In several cases obvious clusters were zzso This has allowed the objective identification of potential promoter core zzso In some cases these may define novel promoter zzso 150 zzso promoters have been listed and grouped on this zzso A new and extended consensus sequence for the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters was zzso It showed differences from that of zzso both in sequence and in the spacing between the zzso and zzso zzso
