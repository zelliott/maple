zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sharing similarity to the bovine zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso have been identified in the human zzso database of zzso zzso zzso cloning of the corresponding zzso showed that zzso zzso is the human zzso of bovine zzso while zzso zzso is a distinct although related zzso All available information indicates the zzso 1120 is a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso coding for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso into zzso virus and expressed in differentiated human zzso and their effect on the zzso zzso was assessed by zzso using zzso The results showed that zzso of both zzso proteins leads to zzso up of the cells and loss of stress fibers and focal contact zzso In addition, the cell to cell zzso belts gradually disappeared, an effect that was particularly pronounced in infected cells zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results imply that zzso zzso play a role in modulating the activity of the zzso proteins as their zzso mimics zzso changes associated with the zzso of these zzso
