zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso is an essential step in initiation of protein synthesis in zzso Here, zzso zzso was used to identify active site zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Of the nine zzso investigated, only zzso zzso zzso and zzso were important for the function of the zzso zzso zzso Replacement of these zzso with Ala resulted in a significant reduction in the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that this was not due to a zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso reduced the affinity of the zzso for the zzso zzso whereas the zzso and zzso zzso affected zzso but not zzso zzso Replacement of zzso zzso and zzso with functionally similar zzso also affected the activity of the zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso whereas zzso is involved in zzso zzso In the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso which also uses zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate in the zzso zzso Together, these observations imply that this group of zzso uses the same basic mechanism in zzso their zzso
