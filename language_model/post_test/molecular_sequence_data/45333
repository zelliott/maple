zzso zzso zzso clones zzso a protein highly similar to zzso zzso factors and plant zzso factors zzso were used to isolate a zzso clone containing the full-length gene zzso The gene is likely to be zzso in contrast to small gene families zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The sequence contains zzso regions 2-4 typically found in zzso factors, and an unusually long zzso terminal extension, which by in zzso analysis has properties of a zzso transit zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed by zzso of a 85 zzso zzso in a preparation enriched for zzso zzso To demonstrate functionality in zzso zzso a zzso zzso fusion protein was zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso core zzso and tested in zzso This zzso zzso specifically bound the spinach zzso and zzso zzso promoters in gel mobility shift zzso and exhibited specific zzso initiation from the same two zzso providing evidence for the role of zzso as a functional zzso zzso
