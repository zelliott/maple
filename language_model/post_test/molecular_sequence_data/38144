Analysis of the human zzso hormone zzso zzso gene zzso zzso region revealed the presence of multiple zzso zzso and zzso start zzso In addition, at least three different transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by Northern zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicated the existence of multiple promoter elements in the zzso zzso and these promoters are responsible for the zzso of regulation of human zzso zzso In this report, by progressive zzso and 3' deletion zzso to zzso relative to the zzso and zzso zzso scanning zzso coupled to transient zzso into the mouse zzso zzso cell, a zzso promoter element was identified at zzso The promoter was located immediately zzso to a previously identified zzso site at zzso in human zzso and it drove a zzso zzso zzso increase in reporter gene zzso Within the promoter, a zzso zzso element zzso zzso and a zzso box zzso were found and zzso of these elements zzso both protein zzso and promoter zzso By zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple nuclear factors (40 to 54 zzso were found to interact specifically with this promoter zzso These nuclear factors were also present in other cells, including zzso zzso and zzso cells, and these findings were consistent with functional studies which showed that the promoter is also active in these zzso
