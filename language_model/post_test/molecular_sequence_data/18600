zzso zzso is one of the largest zzso of the flowering plants, and comprises more than 2,000 zzso In zzso section zzso with broader leaves distributed in East Asia is thought to be an ancestral zzso We aimed to clarify the zzso relationships and zzso variations within the section zzso and to examine the relationship of zzso species of the sections zzso and zzso from East Asia, zzso from DNA sequences and zzso zzso Our results indicate that a zzso zzso zzso including the sections zzso zzso and zzso as the earliest zzso group in the tribe zzso Low zzso numbers, zzso zzso 12 or 24, with large sizes were observed in these three zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso might have originated or zzso restricted in the East zzso zzso zzso of zzso species are restricted in zzso areas, while those of zzso species are wider in East zzso It is concluded that zzso variations in zzso zzso may have been caused by zzso and that zzso species may have been able to exploit their zzso by zzso
