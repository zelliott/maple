The zzso synthetic malaria zzso developed and obtained almost 2 decades ago, represents the first approach towards developing a zzso zzso synthetic zzso vaccine composed of zzso derived from different zzso zzso stage zzso It is shown here that batches zzso zzso zzso zzso 07, zzso zzso 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 produced from a few milligrams to zzso amounts and used in zzso on monkeys and humans showed high zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional studies also revealed high zzso even in zzso zzso zzso was also high, especially in zzso studies carried out on zzso clinical trials Phase I, zzso and zzso and zzso carried out in La zzso Rio zzso zzso zzso zzso La zzso zzso zzso zzso in which there was high zzso zzso production, having similar population distribution when done with different zzso These results provide great support for zzso vaccines containing minimal zzso from zzso zzso which have several advantages, such as low cost, safety, zzso stability, being zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso make them the vaccines of choice for the future in a worldwide attempt to scourge diseases such as zzso
