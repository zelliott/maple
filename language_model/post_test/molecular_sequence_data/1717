zzso pox and zzso pox are highly contagious viral diseases of small zzso These diseases were earlier thought to be caused by a single species of virus, as they are zzso zzso zzso one of the major zzso genes of zzso was isolated and zzso from two Indian zzso of goat zzso zzso and a vaccine strain of sheep zzso zzso The sequences were compared with other zzso sequences of zzso available in the zzso zzso analysis revealed that sheep pox and goat zzso share zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and zzso acid level, zzso A major difference between them is the presence of an additional zzso acid at 55th position of zzso of sheep zzso that is absent in both goat zzso and zzso skin disease zzso Further, six unique neutral zzso zzso were observed at positions 77, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the sequence of goat zzso which can be taken as zzso signature zzso Similar unique zzso signatures could be identified in zzso and zzso sequences zzso zzso analysis showed that members of the zzso could be delineated into three distinct clusters of zzso zzso and zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso Using this information, a zzso method has been developed for unequivocal zzso differentiation of zzso and zzso
