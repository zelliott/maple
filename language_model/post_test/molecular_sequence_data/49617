We developed a completely homogeneous and zzso method of detecting zzso sequences and demonstrated zzso and direct zzso of zzso gene expression with high zzso The zzso is based on performing zzso zzso sequence amplification in the presence of our novel DNA probe, an zzso zzso zzso DNA probe, and measuring the zzso intensity of the reaction zzso When detecting zzso gene expression of zzso zzso zzso we zzso starting copies ranging from 10 to zzso copies within zzso The primer sequences were designed to bind to secondary zzso sites of the target zzso which enabled a totally zzso protocol to zzso zzso specifically in a sample of existing zzso zzso When we applied this to zzso the expression of marker genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain, the results correlated well with the viability of each zzso We also demonstrated monitoring zzso gene expression of zzso zzso zzso during zzso with zzso The present method can potentially realize rapid zzso zzso testing of slowly growing organisms, such as zzso
