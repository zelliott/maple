The zzso family of proteins play a prominent role in the regulation of zzso From the initial identification of zzso as an zzso in zzso zzso through genetic studies in zzso zzso to recent functional studies focusing on the importance of zzso events in cell death zzso the members of this protein family continue to be implicated in pivotal decision points regarding the survival of the zzso The family can be divided into two zzso those such as zzso and zzso that suppress cell death, and others, such as zzso and zzso that appear to promote zzso The zzso family is characterized by specific regions of zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are critical to the function of these zzso including their impact on cell survival and their ability to interact with other family members and regulatory zzso The identification of the zzso domain as a potent zzso of cell death has led to the emergence of an additional family of zzso proteins (such as zzso zzso Bid and zzso that share identity with zzso only within this death zzso These zzso proteins may be part of a regulatory network serving to integrate cell survival and death signals, an assertion that is supported by the identification of a zzso zzso zzso as part of the central core of cell death zzso in zzso zzso While the mechanism of action of the zzso proteins remains zzso recent studies on the regulation of critical zzso interactions and activity of Bad by zzso in response to growth factor zzso suggest that the active state of zzso proteins may be regulated by zzso zzso Additional modes of regulation, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also likely to be zzso
