zzso is a major zzso zzso involved in various steps of zzso zzso in zzso zzso As zzso plays a significant role in zzso zzso zzso we were interested in examining in detail the expression of zzso across different stages of zzso and correlate with the zzso status of zzso DNA in germ zzso 

By zzso zzso and western zzso analysis we found that zzso is strongly down regulated in zzso zzso and zzso germ zzso We have identified a new zzso related protein zzso gene in the rat zzso which is over expressed in the zzso and is up regulated several fold in zzso zzso and zzso germ zzso The zzso protein lacks the zzso stretches in its N terminal domain, and it is zzso in rat zzso 15 having a different zzso organization as compared to zzso gene present on zzso zzso We have also found zzso genes zzso in zzso of other zzso zzso We performed zzso zzso zzso where we have observed that zzso is transcribed at much lower level in zzso zzso and zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso By zzso knock down experiments we could also demonstrate that zzso can support zzso zzso in the absence of zzso 

We have identified a new zzso zzso over expressed in germ cells in rat and analyzed its domain zzso We attribute that the zzso activity of zzso genes in the late zzso is due to the presence of this zzso zzso The expression of this zzso in the germ cells in the absence of zzso could have additional functions in the zzso zzso which needs to be investigated zzso
