A fatal disease of sheep and zzso in the northwestern part of China has been reported to be due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, some characteristics of the zzso agent are not in accordance with attributes ascribed to this zzso We therefore determined the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso and the zzso identified in China and compared it with that of other zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso tree the zzso sequence of the Chinese zzso was found to be most closely related to zzso zzso and clearly divergent from zzso zzso suggesting that it is an as yet zzso zzso zzso zzso structural similarities were observed between the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealing a close zzso relationship between these two zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were designed that specifically amplified zzso DNA of the Chinese zzso zzso These zzso may be valuable tools in future epidemiology zzso
