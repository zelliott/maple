The zzso of Crohn's disease in humans is largely zzso Clinical signs of Crohn's disease partly resemble the clinical picture of zzso disease in zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of the high prevalence of these bacteria in zzso zzso zzso and their remarkable zzso concern has been raised about the possible role of these bacteria in the zzso of Crohn's zzso In an attempt to develop a molecular typing method to facilitate meaningful comparative DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the human and animal zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso was explored and compared to zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso zzso typing subdivided the most zzso zzso type, zzso into six zzso and thus provides a promising molecular zzso approach to study the diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso
