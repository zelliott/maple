zzso hormone zzso is one of key players in regulation of insect growth, zzso zzso zzso and is expressed specifically in the two pairs of lateral zzso zzso cells in the zzso Analysis of zzso elements of the zzso promoter might zzso the regulatory mechanism controlling zzso zzso In this study, the zzso gene promoter of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso elements in zzso gene promoter were predicted using zzso software, including zzso zzso factor 2, zzso leukemia zzso 1, zzso box, zzso zzso zzso zzso using a series of fragments linked to the zzso reporter gene indicated that the zzso spanning zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso promoter showed high ability to support reporter gene zzso but the region of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity in the zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that the nuclear protein could specifically bind to the region spanning zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed that the nuclear protein could specifically bind to the zzso to zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso A classical zzso box, zzso localized at positions zzso to zzso zzso which is a potential site for interaction with zzso box binding protein zzso zzso of this zzso box resulted in no distinct binding zzso Taken together, zzso box was involved in regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
