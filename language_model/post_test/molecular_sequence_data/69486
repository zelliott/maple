The zzso type I zzso gene was extensively screened for zzso using single strand zzso zzso zzso zzso During the analysis of the zzso zzso domain, zzso abnormal fragments were zzso zzso sequencing of these fragments allowed us to identify the presence of a zzso highly zzso sequence zzso A detailed analysis of a hybrid panel located this sequence on zzso zzso An accurate search through several data banks demonstrated that this sequence is a new zzso zzso This report shows how it is possible to find zzso sequences at random, and subsequently to make wrong zzso
