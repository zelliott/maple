The zzso channels zzso by the human zzso Related zzso zzso are zzso involved in controlling heart and brain zzso and are selectively influenced by zzso oxygen species zzso To zzso the molecular regions involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso exchanges between the zzso zzso and the zzso bovine zzso gene zzso zzso channels were generated, and the sensitivity of these zzso channels to zzso was studied with the zzso zzso technique upon their expression in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso with the corresponding zzso region removed channel sensitivity to zzso whereas the reverse zzso exchange introduced zzso sensitivity into zzso zzso of each of the two zzso zzso at positions zzso and 587 within the zzso zzso generated zzso channels insensitive to zzso by zzso In addition, the two iron zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso outward zzso currents and prevented zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso effect exerted by the iron zzso was prevented by the zzso zzso double zzso zzso the results obtained suggest that zzso at positions zzso and 587 in the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso channels are crucial players in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
