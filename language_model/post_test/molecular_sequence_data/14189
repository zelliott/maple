The modular nature of repeat proteins makes them a versatile platform for the design of smart materials with predetermined zzso Here, we present a general strategy for combining protein zzso with specified stability and function into zzso for the assembly of zzso zzso We have designed zzso repeat zzso zzso which contain zzso zzso that specify the strength and zzso of network zzso in combination with zzso zzso that specify zzso geometry and overall stability of the zzso By combining such zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gels are zzso Using zzso we characterized the zzso of zzso as a function of concentration and zzso of the zzso We also show that such gels are effective in zzso and releasing small zzso Moreover, zzso gels alone are fully compatible with cell growth, whereas gels loaded with an zzso compound release the compound, resulting in cell zzso Thus, we have demonstrated that this new class of zzso zzso is ripe for further development as tissue engineering and drug delivery zzso
