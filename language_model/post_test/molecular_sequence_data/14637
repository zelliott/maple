The zzso zzso amplification zzso is a well-developed method for replicating a targeted DNA sequence with a high zzso but multiplex zzso detection is difficult because zzso zzso are very complicated in zzso To allow simultaneous detection of multiple zzso products, a series of zzso zzso were designed and zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso The targeted zzso were zzso by zzso on zzso zzso zzso To enable the zzso reaction to occur just near the zzso regions, the recognition sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was also introduced into the zzso zzso After the zzso reaction, zzso started at the zzso 3' end when the added zzso zzso zzso was complementary to the zzso zzso To efficiently zzso multiple targets, the zzso were designed with a reporter base and two zzso zzso so that the decoding of a zzso zzso only required a single peak in a zzso We have successfully detected the four kinds of pathogens including zzso B virus zzso zzso C virus zzso human zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are easily infected in blood, by a zzso zzso in a single tube, indicating that zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso is a simple, zzso and reliable way in multiple target zzso
