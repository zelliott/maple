In the zzso nitrogen metabolism is controlled by a complex genetic regulatory circuit which ensures the preferential use of primary nitrogen sources and also zzso the ability to use many different secondary nitrogen sources when zzso Most structural genes zzso nitrogen zzso zzso are subject to nitrogen zzso repression, zzso by zzso zzso factors of the zzso family of zzso However, certain zzso family members, such as the zzso zzso factor, act zzso to repress gene zzso Selective expression of the genes which zzso zzso for the metabolism of secondary nitrogen sources is often achieved by zzso zzso by zzso factors, many of which have a zzso zzso DNA binding zzso zzso within the nitrogen circuit also involves specific zzso zzso as exemplified by the specific binding of the zzso zzso protein with the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation appears to play a significant role in the zzso of certain animal and plant zzso zzso
