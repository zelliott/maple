We have developed zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso as a method of screening for zzso zzso zzso modification converts zzso to zzso but zzso zzso remain zzso This modification creates sequence differences between zzso and zzso samples, which can be resolved by zzso zzso is zzso efficient at detecting single base changes in a zzso As zzso modification of zzso DNA would typically involve several base changes in a fragment, the efficiency of detecting zzso using zzso could approach zzso We applied this method to analyze the zzso promoter zzso island in breast cancer zzso About zzso of sporadic breast zzso are zzso at the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso rapidly detected those tumors that had previously been shown to be zzso by Southern zzso The zzso bands detected by zzso were analyzed by sequencing and shown to be zzso zzso is a simple method for screening large numbers of samples for zzso and can accelerate zzso sequencing, as all bands can be isolated and zzso zzso
