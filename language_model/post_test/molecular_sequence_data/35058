The zzso zzso the control system for growth hormone zzso zzso and its zzso factors involved in the regulation of metabolism and energy zzso has promising zzso for producing economically valuable traits in farm zzso Here we investigated single zzso zzso zzso of the genes of factors involved in the zzso axis for growth hormone zzso growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso using zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing methods in zzso individual zzso zzso A zzso method to allow zzso detection was used for zzso DNA and zzso amplification of six zzso zzso 4 and 5 of zzso zzso 10 of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 of zzso zzso zzso 1 of zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso 3 of zzso zzso zzso were detected in five of the six zzso zzso Two zzso patterns were detected for zzso zzso zzso Five zzso patterns were detected for zzso zzso 5 and zzso zzso 3, and three for zzso zzso zzso Only zzso and zzso were zzso Changes in protein structures due to variable zzso were also zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso a major breed that is important for the animal industry in Middle East countries, has high genetic zzso opening interesting prospects for future selection programs and preservation zzso
