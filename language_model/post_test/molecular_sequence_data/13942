We have reported previously the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizing a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso In this study, the zzso acid sequence of this zzso in zzso was zzso First, the zzso was localized near the N zzso of the protein by probing zzso overlapping fragments spanning zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso was then determined by using overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the smallest zzso zzso zzso in an zzso The sequence zzso zzso acids zzso in the zzso zzso was shown to contain two overlapping zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of the gene zzso zzso in seven different zzso zzso strains demonstrated that these sequential zzso are totally zzso zzso of mice with synthetic peptides derived from zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and formulated in zzso zzso or zzso resulted in the production of zzso capable of recognizing the peptides as well as the native zzso
