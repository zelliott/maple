zzso is the major component of the embryonic basement membrane and consists of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso is induced in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells upon differentiation into zzso zzso through zzso zzso of the genes zzso these zzso Here, we identified a zzso zzso in the zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso gene that activated its zzso in a zzso zzso This zzso was also active in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso indicating that it was a zzso zzso zzso This zzso was also active in zzso zzso zzso cells characterized by excessive production of zzso and other basement membrane zzso suggesting that zzso tumors have a zzso control mechanism similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analyses revealed four protein binding sites zzso in the zzso zzso However, these zzso proteins were detected not only in zzso zzso cells zzso differentiated zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso but also in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that three of these binding sites zzso zzso and zzso function zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The proteins binding to zzso and zzso were identified as the zzso family of zzso factors and zzso zzso
