We have identified and characterized a zzso complex that forms with the zzso virus zzso terminal zzso The complex formed only if the terminal zzso was in the zzso closed or hairpin zzso little if any binding was detected with the open duplex form of the terminal zzso This fact suggested that both secondary structure and primary sequence are essential elements of zzso zzso I protection studies indicated that virtually all of the zzso zzso and significant portions of the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The zzso terminal resolution site of zzso also is zzso zzso mapping of the sequences necessary for binding indicated that almost all of the terminal zzso must be present for binding to zzso zzso which are similar in size and shape to the zzso zzso did not exhibit competition for zzso and the complex formed only if zzso extracts were zzso Thus, the binding reaction is specific for zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso complex on neutral zzso gels, suggesting that one or both of these proteins are components of the zzso The characteristics of the complex suggested that it has a role in zzso DNA zzso
