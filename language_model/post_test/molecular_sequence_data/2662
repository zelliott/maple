zzso zzso of zzso coli was modified by zzso zzso in order to investigate the effects of zzso distance, and orientation between the components of a putative zzso relay system zzso zzso to be involved in zzso zzso zzso The importance of polarity between zzso and zzso was studied by zzso the zzso and the modified zzso inactive in all modes of zzso The effect of distance and/or orientation between zzso and zzso was investigated by zzso zzso with zzso thereby moving the zzso one zzso around putative zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso also completely zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso paper of three in this zzso and zzso indicate that a zzso zzso at position zzso zzso the zzso The zzso orientation between His and zzso was then restored by further zzso of zzso to introduce a His zzso into position 323 or by zzso zzso with zzso The resulting zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso orientation, but the zzso zzso pair is rotated about the zzso axis by 100 degrees relative to zzso in putative zzso zzso Both zzso are inactive with respect to all modes of zzso The results provide strong support for the contention that the polarity between zzso and zzso and the geometric relationship between zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
