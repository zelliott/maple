zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso have been shown to exhibit zzso zzso zzso have the capacity to directly activate B cells, zzso and zzso cells, and we show here that this is reflected by cell surface binding of zzso to these cell zzso However, T cells are not directly activated by zzso which zzso with the failure to bind to the zzso zzso zzso competition for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso suggests that zzso might bind to an as yet undefined zzso zzso prior to cellular zzso zzso of protective zzso responses against challenge infection with zzso zzso virus zzso or with zzso zzso virus expressing the zzso zzso was achieved by zzso mice with the zzso major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso In these experiments, B cells, potentially serving as zzso zzso cells zzso were not required for induction of protective immunity since zzso zzso mice were equally protected against challenge infection with both zzso This finding suggested that zzso and/or zzso cells were sufficiently activated in zzso by zzso to serve as potent zzso for the induction of zzso T zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso alone induced protection against infection with zzso zzso via zzso zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells may provide a critical step in zzso zzso zzso
