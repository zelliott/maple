zzso zzso or the removal of zzso from precursor zzso zzso depends on the accurate recognition of zzso sequences by the plant zzso zzso The major components of this machinery are small nuclear zzso protein particles zzso which consist of zzso and zzso zzso We have zzso various aspects of zzso sequence and structure in relation to zzso site selection and zzso efficiency and we have cloned zzso genes and a gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso In the absence of an in zzso zzso system for plants, transient expression in zzso and stable plant transformations have been used to zzso zzso of zzso zzso We aim to address the function of the zzso zzso zzso via the production of transgenic plants expressing zzso zzso transcripts and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have cloned genes zzso other proteins which potentially interact with zzso such as zzso zzso and strategies involving transgenic plants are being developed to zzso their zzso
