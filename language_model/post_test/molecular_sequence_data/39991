zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso is both an zzso and an zzso binding zzso In an attempt to separate the two activities of zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso gene product was zzso The resulting strain had high zzso activity but was defective in zzso The zzso was at a late stage of zzso specifically affecting expression of zzso zzso many of which are important for spore coat assembly and require zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein was delayed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso in in zzso gel mobility shift zzso strongly suggesting that zzso zzso binding activity may stabilize zzso zzso in order to allow efficient zzso synthesis and proper timing of spore coat zzso
