We established a novel way to clone zzso ends of unknown length and sequence of individual zzso T4 DNA zzso is employed to zzso an zzso duplex of complementary zzso one of them with a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso generating a new zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso primer and a primer with specificity for this new zzso end leads to products that can easily be cloned and zzso zzso for the choice of zzso for zzso and amplification are zzso We have used this method to determine the zzso sequences of three independent zzso the human collagen zzso zzso the chicken zzso zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso We will discuss this method in comparison with other methods published for the amplification of unknown zzso ends of zzso zzso
