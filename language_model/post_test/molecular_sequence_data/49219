The zzso organ zzso is a zzso organ specialized in the detection of zzso in higher zzso In mouse and zzso two gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in sensory zzso whose cell bodies are located in, respectively, the zzso and zzso layers of the zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso of the zzso layer express another zzso family, termed zzso representing zzso class I genes of the major zzso zzso The nine zzso genes are expressed zzso in zzso of zzso More than one zzso gene can be expressed in an individual zzso In zzso zzso with zzso for zzso and zzso genes reveals complex and zzso combinations of zzso While neural expression of zzso class I molecules is increasingly being zzso the zzso family is distinguished by variegated expression across seemingly similar zzso and zzso with a distinct zzso family zzso neural zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso sensory zzso may consist of multiple lineages or zzso defined by particular combinations of zzso and zzso gene zzso
