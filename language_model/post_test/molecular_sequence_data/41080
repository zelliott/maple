We have begun an early phase of zzso discovery in three clinically important types of breast cancer using a panel of human cell zzso zzso positive, hormone zzso positive and zzso negative, and triple negative zzso zzso zzso We identified and characterized the most abundant zzso zzso or leaked proteins released into serum free media from these breast cancer cell lines using a combination of protein zzso methods before zzso mass zzso zzso A total of zzso proteins were detected in the zzso fluid of 7 breast cancer cell zzso The expression of a selected group of high abundance and/or breast zzso potential zzso including zzso 1, zzso binding zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the breast cancer cell lines and in their culture media were further validated by Western zzso zzso Interestingly, mass zzso identified a zzso D protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso to zzso replacement from the zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso of each cell line media zzso displayed unique and consistent zzso regardless of the individual group zzso demonstrating the potential for zzso of breast zzso On the basis of the cell line media zzso zzso Tree software was able to categorize each cell line as zzso positive, zzso negative, and hormone zzso positive and triple negative based on only two zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso Tree software clearly identified zzso cell line zzso the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso D zzso
