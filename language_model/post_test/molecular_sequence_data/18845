An engineered zzso zzso from zzso zzso was used for zzso production of zzso a human milk zzso case compound, from zzso zzso zzso and zzso components abundantly present in industrial dairy side zzso Four different zzso zzso methods were compared to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation per amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a membrane zzso zzso immobilized on zzso gave a zzso productivity of 84 zzso zzso zzso after seven consecutive reaction zzso zzso and membrane zzso were zzso Using free zzso in a 10 zzso membrane reactor produced a zzso zzso productivity increase compared to using free zzso in a batch reactor giving zzso zzso zzso zzso after seven consecutive reaction zzso The zzso yield on zzso zzso acid in zzso was zzso Using circular zzso a temperature zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso stability of free zzso was similarly high and the zzso was stable at the reaction temperature zzso zzso for at least 24 zzso
