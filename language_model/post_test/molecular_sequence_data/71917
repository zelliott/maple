zzso inhibitor 10 zzso an zzso zzso contains a series of basic zzso acids in the loop between zzso C and D that exhibit zzso to known nuclear targeting zzso zzso of zzso cells with plasmids zzso enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso coupled to zzso revealed an intense zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated a single Mr zzso zzso complex in isolated zzso zzso of four basic zzso acids in the zzso loop to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the fluorescent complex being confined to the zzso Further evidence for a nuclear targeting signal in this region was provided by zzso of the fluorescent label to the nucleus in cells zzso with a zzso zzso zzso fused to the 25 zzso acids zzso the zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso to zzso whereas a zzso distribution was noted for the construct zzso zzso coupled to the zzso zzso zzso These data raise the possibility that zzso may play a role in regulating zzso activity within the nucleus, a property unique in the field of zzso zzso
