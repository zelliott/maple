zzso zzso patterning is a special zzso patterning event of establishing the zzso body zzso Though zzso patterning has been extensively zzso the initiation of zzso zzso zzso remains largely zzso In zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression to promote zzso zzso fate, but the expression zzso of zzso and zzso initially overlap in the entire marginal zone of the zzso Defining zzso and zzso territories is therefore a premise of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated why and how the initial expression of zzso becomes zzso in the zzso marginal cells during zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that a maternal zzso factor zzso is essential for restricting zzso expression within the zzso margin and preserving zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso margin of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso in combination with core consensus sequence zzso analysis further revealed that zzso can directly repress zzso by binding to the zzso promoter at a specific zzso zzso maternal zzso translation resulted in confusion of zzso and zzso zzso markers expression and zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrated that direct zzso repression of the decisive zzso zzso gene by maternal zzso factor is a crucial regulatory mechanism of initiating zzso zzso patterning in zzso
