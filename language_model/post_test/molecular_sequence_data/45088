We identified a viable zzso zzso of the zzso gene that encodes the zzso activity in zzso zzso The zzso protein possesses a single zzso acid substitution zzso in a zzso motif nearby the active site and exhibits a greatly reduced zzso zzso The zzso single zzso exhibits growth delay and cell cycle abnormalities and shows a strong spontaneous zzso zzso All zzso of the zzso zzso are suppressed by the simultaneous zzso of the zzso DNA zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso double zzso accumulates zzso in its zzso zzso The viability of the zzso zzso is greatly impaired by the simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso result from the incorporation of zzso into DNA subsequently converted into zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso strain zzso spectrum showed that zzso are zzso incorporated in front of zzso sites in a zzso manner during zzso zzso These results point to a critical role of the zzso protein in the maintenance of the genetic zzso zzso the normal cellular zzso and not only its zzso is an important source of zzso DNA damage and genetic instability in zzso zzso
