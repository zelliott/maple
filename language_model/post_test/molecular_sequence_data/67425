zzso mobile marine species in areas with no obvious geographic barriers are expected to show low levels of genetic zzso However, small-scale variation in habitat may lead to resource zzso and drive local differentiation by zzso zzso Using nuclear zzso zzso at 20 zzso and zzso control region sequencing, we investigated zzso population structuring of zzso zzso dolphins zzso zzso inhabiting a range of zzso in and around zzso Bay, zzso zzso structure analysis identified two genetic clusters within zzso Bay, with evidence of zzso between them zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was only weak isolation by distance but one cluster of dolphins was more likely to be found in shallow southern areas and the other in the deeper waters of the central northern zzso In further analysis removing zzso individuals, southern dolphins appeared genetically restricted with lower levels of variation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and high mean zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso In contrast, northern dolphins were more diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were mixing with a group of dolphins outside the bay zzso zzso zzso which appears to have historically been distinct from the bay dolphins zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This study demonstrates the ability of genetic techniques to expose zzso patterns of population structure and explore their origins and zzso A complex variety of zzso factors including local habitat variation, differential resource use, social zzso and learning, and anthropogenic disturbances are likely to have played a role in driving zzso population structure among zzso dolphins in zzso zzso
