zzso proteins belong to a zzso family characterized by a unique DNA binding domain, known as the high mobility group box, that is related to that of the zzso determining gene zzso zzso sequences for more than 30 zzso genes have been identified, and some are known to have diverse roles in zzso differentiation and zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of mouse zzso that was uncovered during a screen for high mobility group box containing zzso factors that are expressed at different levels during skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso were found at a much higher frequency in zzso prior to their differentiation into zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso zzso protein was capable of binding to a consensus DNA binding site for zzso zzso When zzso in zzso zzso wild type zzso but not a zzso truncated form or the related protein zzso specifically inhibited zzso of zzso genes and expression of the basic zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso resulting in a failure of the cells to differentiate into zzso These results suggest a specific and repressive role for zzso requiring the zzso domain, during zzso
