zzso from one of the two initiation sites, zzso and zzso of the dual human zzso promoter seems to be essential in all zzso zzso To identify proteins and target structures for zzso regulation, a DNA region was analyzed that is critical for zzso promoter zzso Here, we show that a nuclear factor binds to a DNA element within zzso which is zzso perfectly between mouse and man and displays a striking zzso to the zzso zzso promoter of zzso type 5 zzso We demonstrate that the same zzso factor, defined recently as zzso which plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso early promoters and zzso also interacts as a dominant nuclear factor with the zzso zzso The presence of an intact zzso binding site is required for basic expression and for zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso The human zzso promoter is the first cellular target described for zzso The results suggest that expression of zzso might be regulated via zzso of zzso by cellular zzso zzso
