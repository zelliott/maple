Two zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso the same zzso zzso zzso 1) have been identified and characterized from zzso zzso The sequence of these two zzso clones is identical to a previously described zzso clone zzso except in the location of their zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso and its zzso zzso clone zzso shows two putative zzso signals which could direct the variable 3' processing of the observed zzso zzso zzso protection analysis in this 3' zzso region confirms the presence in the alpha zzso gene from zzso zzso of these two main functional zzso sites and possibly other related zzso The relative zzso of zzso bearing the two main zzso sites has been tested by using a zzso analysis of several zzso of the zzso It appears that a higher proportion of shorter zzso species is found in actively dividing zzso
