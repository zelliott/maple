zzso response zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso involved in zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to mediate the repulsive effect of zzso on zzso and to participate in zzso zzso The X-ray crystal structure of zzso zzso was determined at zzso A resolution and demonstrates that zzso is a zzso zzso protein forming a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was employed to map functional zzso As a rapid zzso for zzso we exploited a zzso zzso signaling system in zzso cells expressing the zzso components zzso and zzso zzso In these cells, zzso and zzso form a physical complex that is reduced in amount by zzso but enhanced by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in one domain of zzso produce a zzso active protein that causes zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso mimics the zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso and reduces zzso zzso zzso These data provide a structural view of zzso function in zzso zzso zzso
