We had previously shown that the in zzso zzso response to a single zzso zzso extra sheep E zzso present on some sheep E but absent from others could be monitored by zzso of the zzso cell response on both zzso and zzso zzso We had shown also that the response was seen only in certain strains of mice and that the zzso controlling the response mapped to the zzso V region of the zzso chain zzso An additional feature of the response is that it is only seen in zzso and is absent and, we zzso is suppressed in zzso The strain distribution of the response to the zzso zzso suggested that the response may only use one V gene (or a small set of closely related V zzso that would be present in the zzso strains and absent from the zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we made zzso with specificity for the zzso zzso and for the shared zzso zzso from these zzso were zzso All four zzso zzso were almost identical in V region zzso but varied considerably in D and J segment zzso thus confirming the hypothesis that the zzso response would be limited at the V zzso The four zzso zzso used two zzso zzso genes that differed only by one, or possibly two, zzso zzso these genes are quite different from most other published zzso zzso The sequence is very similar to an zzso sequence from a zzso zzso mouse and slightly less similar to two other zzso zzso It was quite similar to two sequences from zzso one an zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other, an zzso zzso zzso with specificity for a mouse E zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso by the V zzso gene react with an zzso that the B cells persist in the animal, but that the zzso of zzso is somehow zzso
