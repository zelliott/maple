zzso zzso from fish serum of Atlantic salmon zzso zzso are characterized by zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with both zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso detection zzso zzso zzso with zzso charged fluorescent label zzso zzso were separated to obtain a zzso profile of the complex zzso mixture, and the profile concurs with that obtained by using zzso mass zzso The identity of the zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso The same zzso can be identified also in their native state by zzso without zzso The structural variations of zzso zzso acid zzso in fish serum zzso are investigated by zzso zzso zzso monitoring provided useful structural information of the zzso zzso from fragmentation zzso New complex fish serum zzso that are not reported previously were observed and zzso These methods may be useful not only for the characterization of zzso of complex zzso but also to study other types of zzso zzso as well as to allow determination of overall zzso composition in zzso
