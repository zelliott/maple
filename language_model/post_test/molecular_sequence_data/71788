Previous studies have shown that the satellite zzso in zzso account for zzso of the zzso They mainly zzso to a single family, or to several zzso having the same evolutionary zzso We have now showed that the satellite zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are transcribed in both males and zzso Satellite DNA transcripts could only be extracted with zzso indicating that they are strongly associated with zzso The satellite DNA in zzso zzso was transcribed on the two DNA zzso The satellite DNA transcripts were zzso and not zzso in zzso The transcripts were found in zzso larvae and zzso zzso The transcripts detected included one major transcript zzso zzso and several discrete smaller zzso The in zzso synthesis of these satellite DNA transcripts was explored by identifying their putative initiation zzso
