Four zzso zzso markers were mapped to rat zzso 12 by linkage analysis of zzso zzso progeny of Fischer zzso and Lewis zzso rat zzso The markers formed a single linkage group, covering zzso zzso with the following order and distance between zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso sequence 2 zzso zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso All markers were identified and zzso by zzso analysis of simple sequence zzso The gene zzso zzso was previously assigned to rat zzso 12, which allowed us to assign the entire linkage group to this zzso These markers were highly zzso in 13 additional zzso rat strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These markers should be useful tools for further genetic studies in zzso
