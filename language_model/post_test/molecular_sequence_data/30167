We have now demonstrated that activated complement component zzso zzso beta zzso at the position identical to that at which beta zzso is zzso in serum of patients suffering from lung zzso The main zzso is in the zzso loop zzso to zzso generating a modified form of beta zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the A chain is highly susceptible to removal by a zzso activity causing the formation of zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of a zzso protein zzso for the zzso activity of zzso The zzso zzso of beta zzso can be inhibited in the presence of C1 zzso zzso demonstrating a regulatory function of C1 zzso inhibitor in the zzso zzso of beta zzso
