zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA virus infecting a variety of zzso zzso In order to affect cell zzso like most zzso zzso zzso uses the zzso zzso In this study, we identified two accessory zzso zzso zzso and zzso coding for proteins zzso and zzso zzso Using genetic zzso zzso we show that protein pair zzso is a functional and interchangeable analogue of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso molecular biology, zzso as well as various microscopic techniques, we characterized the zzso zzso of zzso host cells infected with zzso zzso Our results indicate that proteins zzso and zzso zzso a competitive advantage to the zzso by securing the efficient disruption of the infected cell and zzso release of the zzso progeny under less zzso growth zzso In zzso with prior data and the results obtained in this study, we propose a model explaining the role of zzso proteins in the zzso process: zzso complexes transform the mechanical stress caused by the zzso zzso at the CM to the zzso leading to its zzso Finally, identification of the zzso genes in zzso suggests that zzso zzso zzso are involved in genetic trade with zzso zzso
