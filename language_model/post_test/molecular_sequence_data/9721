To identify the structural zzso necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso we serially zzso potential zzso sites in the zzso tail of the zzso and examined their effects on zzso zzso zzso First, we replaced zzso with zzso zzso and zzso expressed this zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not zzso after 1 h of treatment with zzso indicating that zzso is required for zzso early zzso To test whether zzso was the only zzso necessary, we investigated the importance of 7 potential zzso sites between zzso zzso and zzso which were all replaced by zzso with the zzso zzso This zzso zzso showed partial loss of zzso zzso which was attributable to the Ala zzso at zzso since complete zzso was achieved by restoring zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is the primary recognition site for G zzso zzso zzso but zzso is also required for complete zzso zzso The specificity of zzso as the primary initiation site appears to be dependent on the preceding zzso zzso acid stretch, because in a zzso in which zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso identical to the zzso zzso
