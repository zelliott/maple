zzso zzso zzso the key regulatory zzso in zzso zzso zzso is rapidly induced by zzso and tumor zzso We used transient expression zzso and zzso binding studies to examine the regulation of zzso promoter activity by zzso zzso and serum growth zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region zzso to zzso was sufficient to zzso zzso zzso expression to a zzso reporter gene when zzso into zzso zzso However, induction by zzso was not observed in zzso zzso although zzso of zzso zzso cells with fresh zzso medium rapidly induced a fivefold to zzso increase in zzso promoter activity, zzso about 8 h after zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that several sequences contributed to zzso zzso promoter activity but that zzso zzso to zzso was sufficient for induction by zzso or by zzso This sequence lacked zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso consensus zzso failed to compete effectively for proteins binding to this zzso Two of four protein complexes observed by zzso analysis of zzso zzso to zzso were competitively inhibited by zzso but not zzso zzso encompassing a zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso however, a consensus zzso did not zzso zzso of this site demonstrated that it contributes to zzso expression of the zzso promoter but not to zzso or serum zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso to zzso responds to zzso and serum stimulation in a zzso manner that is not zzso by zzso zzso zzso
