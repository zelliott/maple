The zzso zzso factor zzso belongs to the family of zzso proteins and is known to play an important role in the differentiation of zzso zzso Here we report the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso from the brackish water fish, zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of 1910 zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids containing a zzso domain, zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We inserted the coding region of zzso zzso obtained by zzso into a zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon induction with zzso zzso zzso was expressed and accumulated as inclusion bodies in zzso zzso The protein was then zzso in one step by affinity zzso on a zzso acid zzso column under zzso zzso This method yielded zzso zzso of highly pure and stable protein per 200 zzso of bacterial zzso A band of 40 zzso resolved as zzso zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso agrees well with the molecular mass calculated from the translated zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in zzso through Western zzso analysis, using its zzso zzso This zzso zzso detected zzso in the zzso of zzso developing zzso by zzso zzso It serves as a good zzso for the detection of zzso zzso in zzso
