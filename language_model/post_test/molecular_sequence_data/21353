zzso in the human zzso 23 zzso gene cause deafness, zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso hearing loss or Usher syndrome, type zzso zzso by hearing zzso zzso dysfunction, and visual zzso zzso zzso mouse strains each harbor a zzso zzso and present with hearing loss and zzso zzso Two additional zzso mouse zzso salsa and zzso each carry a zzso zzso zzso zzso and have progressive hearing zzso We report the identification of a novel mouse strain, zzso with inherited hearing loss caused by an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso generates a zzso change, zzso in zzso zzso mice have profound zzso deafness, with no zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso because zzso mice have milder and more progressive hearing loss in advanced zzso The zzso affects a highly zzso zzso motif in zzso domain 22, thought to be important for zzso structure and zzso zzso modeling suggests that the zzso zzso alters the structural zzso of the protein and affects zzso zzso Similar to salsa mice, but in contrast to zzso mice, hair bundle development is normal in zzso and hearing loss appears to be due to the loss of tip zzso Thus, zzso is a novel mouse model for zzso
