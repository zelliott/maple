zzso in the gene zzso the zzso factor neural zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to cause zzso dominant zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In an zzso Spanish family, we detected a novel sequence variation zzso in the zzso gene that results in the zzso protein zzso A functional test of the ability of zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso to zzso a human zzso zzso promoter was used to evaluate the zzso mechanisms of zzso We found zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso protein similar to that shown by other zzso zzso zzso that cause zzso zzso zzso patients of the family carry the zzso change, although two other family members that also carry the zzso variation remain zzso This result zzso the genetic zzso of the zzso The zzso mechanisms associated with zzso zzso zzso appear to be caused by a gain of zzso To suppress the negative effect of an zzso zzso the suppression and replacement strategy seems to be the most suitable therapeutic approach capable of overcoming the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso Thus, we evaluated this methodology in the zzso gene for the first zzso
