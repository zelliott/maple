Overlapping fragments of zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso from zzso end of spike zzso protein gene to 3' end of zzso zzso protein gene of turkey coronavirus zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso were derived from the corresponding sequences of infectious zzso virus zzso The zzso products were cloned and zzso and their zzso acid structure and similarity to published sequences of other zzso were zzso zzso and subsequent analysis revealed 9 open reading frames zzso representing the entire S protein zzso zzso gene 3, membrane zzso protein zzso zzso gene 5, and N protein gene in the order of zzso The overall zzso acid structures of these zzso regions of zzso were very similar to the zzso regions of zzso The consensus zzso sequence zzso of zzso zzso was highly zzso in zzso zzso at the levels of zzso sequence and location in regarding to the initiation zzso of individual zzso zzso comparison of gene 3, M zzso gene 5, or N gene sequences with their counterparts of zzso revealed high levels zzso of zzso zzso analysis based on the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso M, or N protein demonstrated that zzso was clustered within the same zzso lineage as the zzso strains while all the other zzso zzso were grouped into separate clusters corresponding to zzso groups I or zzso There were substantial differences of S protein sequence between zzso and zzso with only zzso of zzso
