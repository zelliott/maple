We have analyzed the DNA sequence requirements for the functioning of zzso elements by examining the zzso activities associated with 24 zzso including representatives of each of the 21 point zzso in the consensus sequence from plants, zzso in a zzso in zzso system and in a zzso in zzso system in which human zzso protein zzso was replaced by zzso zzso of zzso zzso Although the relative zzso activities varied among these zzso both systems gave virtually identical zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso those with the sequences zzso and zzso had zzso zzso The rest had activities that ranged from zzso to zzso of the activity associated with the consensus zzso These results suggest the functional conservation of zzso between plants and zzso
