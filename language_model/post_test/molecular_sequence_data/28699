zzso zzso factor zzso zzso contains two distinct types of zzso zzso zzso elements in the zzso zzso In addition to several copies of the zzso element the zzso zzso also contains a zzso region that includes several predicted zzso zzso We report here that the zzso activity resides in a single zzso structure within this zzso A consensus sequence for the active structure has been derived by zzso zzso revealing that a zzso loop of sequence zzso and zzso bases either side of the stem contribute to the zzso The zzso nature of the stem is essential and the stem must be less than 11 zzso in zzso but the zzso activity is relatively insensitive to the sequence within the zzso The zzso increases the rate of zzso zzso most likely by enhancing the zzso of the zzso zzso A protein that binds the zzso but not an inactive zzso form, has been detected in zzso zzso
