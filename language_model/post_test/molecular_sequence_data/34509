Gene clusters containing multiple similar zzso regions in close proximity are of great interest for biomedical studies because of their associations with inherited zzso However, such regions are difficult to analyze due to their structural complexity and their complicated evolutionary zzso reflecting a variety of large-scale zzso zzso In particular, conversion events can mislead zzso about the relationships among these regions, as traced by traditional methods such as construction of zzso trees or zzso zzso 

To correct the distorted information generated by such methods, we have developed an automated pipeline called zzso zzso History Analysis zzso for detecting conversion zzso We used this pipeline to analyze the conversion events that affected two well-studied gene clusters zzso and zzso and three gene clusters for which comparative sequence data were generated from seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso family zzso zzso is freely available at zzso 

These studies reveal the value of characterizing conversion events in the context of studying gene clusters in complex zzso
