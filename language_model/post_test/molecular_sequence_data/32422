Two related satellite DNA families zzso I and satellite zzso with complex zzso repeat zzso zzso represent major DNA components zzso in the zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained upon zzso DNA restriction revealed two zzso of satellite II zzso and also identified regions of transition between satellite I and satellite II zzso The two zzso differ not only in diagnostic zzso but also in flipped orientation of constituent zzso zzso zzso fragments comprise directly linked satellite I and satellite II zzso that cannot be distinguished from randomly cloned zzso of corresponding zzso An exception is the most zzso satellite I zzso in the hybrid zzso named zzso which shows sequence divergence typical for repeats evolving at array ends, in zones of low homogenization zzso This pattern points to the extensive zzso processes generating abrupt transitions between satellite zzso combined with array maintenance by unequal zzso Switching points between adjacent satellites as well as the edges of flipped zzso are localized within a short sequence segment, indicating a preferential site of zzso within satellite zzso Multiple copies of zzso junction zzso support the hypothesis that sites of evolutionary origin of novel satellite repeat zzso can be localized at array ends, in regions of enhanced sequence zzso
