Two strains of bacteria were isolated from zzso sediments of the South China Sea using enrichment zzso technique and they were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T4 zzso based on zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was only capable of transforming zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso without further degradation while zzso zzso T4 exhibited ability in zzso zzso as the sole source of carbon and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso degradation was through zzso and zzso acid zzso as major zzso degradation zzso in the culture media by both zzso zzso zzso T4 zzso zzso and zzso via zzso of zzso and zzso in the initial steps in degradation as confirmed by total organic carbon analysis of the culture medium and zzso activity zzso of the zzso cells and zzso The specific zzso activity of zzso induced by zzso or zzso showed that greater zzso of zzso zzso by zzso induced by zzso cells than that induced by zzso zzso of this research suggest that the zzso of the two identical zzso zzso groups of zzso zzso are carried out by highly specific zzso of the same bacteria in the zzso
