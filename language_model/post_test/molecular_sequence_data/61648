Two known zzso constitutional zzso zzso and zzso as well as a zzso zzso display zzso zzso that have joined to a common site within the low copy repeat B zzso region of zzso This zzso is located between two zzso zzso repeats that form a nearly perfect zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso partner zzso also fall near the center of zzso zzso In the present work the zzso of a fourth zzso involving zzso a balanced zzso zzso were characterized not only to zzso this junction relative to known zzso but also to further understand the mechanism underlying these zzso FISH mapping was used to zzso the zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso to single zzso zzso zzso mapping narrowed the zzso zzso to a 1990 zzso zzso region, and junction fragments were amplified by zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence indicates that the zzso zzso splits a zzso zzso zzso capable of forming zzso secondary zzso In contrast, the zzso reference zzso sequence from clones in the database does not exhibit this zzso suggesting a predisposition for regional zzso instability perhaps zzso for this zzso Given its similarity to known zzso fragile site zzso zzso this zzso zzso sequence may represent one of the zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the secondary structure of sequences surrounding zzso zzso that involve zzso with those not involving this region indicate a unique ability of the former to form zzso zzso The relative likelihood of forming these zzso appears to be related to the rate of zzso zzso Further analysis suggests that constitutional zzso in general occur between sequences of similar melting temperature and propensity for secondary zzso
