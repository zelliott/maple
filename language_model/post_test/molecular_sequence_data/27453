zzso zzso disorders form a clinical spectrum of diseases that include progressive cone zzso zzso and complete and incomplete zzso zzso The underlying disease mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso Our aim was to identify zzso genes for these disorders by zzso zzso zzso We investigated 75 zzso 97 zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso and excluded the involvement of known genes for zzso and zzso zzso we performed high-resolution zzso analysis and identified large zzso regions spanning the zzso gene in one sibling pair with zzso zzso and one sibling pair with incomplete zzso The zzso gene encodes the cone alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso and thereby plays an essential role in cone zzso zzso analysis of the coding region of zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both sibling zzso zzso analysis of 104 zzso with zzso and 10 zzso with zzso revealed compound zzso zzso zzso in three complete zzso patients from two zzso One patient had a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso the other two had a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso retinal imaging via optical zzso zzso revealed a more pronounced absence of cone zzso in patients with zzso compared to patients with zzso zzso Our findings identify zzso as a gene for cone zzso disorders and show that zzso and zzso constitute genetically and clinically overlapping zzso
