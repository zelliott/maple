zzso zzso zzso channels allow for the controlled and selective passage of zzso zzso across the plasma membrane via a zzso pore zzso In zzso zzso channels, gating is the result of the coordinated action of two coupled zzso an zzso gate at the zzso entrance of the pore and an zzso gate at the selectivity zzso By using solid-state zzso structural studies, in combination with zzso experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the zzso region connecting the outer zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and the pore zzso behind the selectivity filter contributes to zzso channel zzso and exhibits a remarkable structural plasticity that zzso to zzso channel zzso The zzso zzso 1 zzso when the zzso channel enters the zzso state and zzso during the transition to the closed zzso In addition to zzso changes at the zzso zzso coordination sites, this process is accompanied by zzso changes within the zzso region and the pore zzso Further zzso and zzso results show that the same channel domain is critically involved in establishing functional contacts between pore domain and the cellular zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the interaction between the zzso channel zzso region and the zzso zzso exerts an important influence on the selective passage of zzso zzso via the zzso channel zzso
