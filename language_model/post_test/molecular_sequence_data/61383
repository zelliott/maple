We investigated zzso gene zzso in advanced gastric zzso by direct DNA sequencing, in order to determine the frequency of zzso in gastric zzso having different zzso backgrounds, tumors of the zzso were compared with those arising in the zzso or zzso zzso type zzso were compared with diffuse or other zzso zzso We have chosen to assess the frequency of zzso solely based on DNA zzso 

zzso embedded zzso from 100 gastric zzso were zzso The zzso status of the zzso gene in zzso 5 through 9 were determined by direct sequencing of zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso 5, 6, 7 and 8 were found in 35 of zzso zzso One tumor had zzso in both zzso 5 and zzso No zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were significantly more frequent in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso than the zzso and corpus zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were more frequent in zzso type zzso zzso zzso than diffuse zzso or other zzso types of cancer zzso zzso but the difference was not statistically zzso 

zzso of the zzso more frequently contain zzso zzso than do zzso and corpus zzso suggesting that zzso in the zzso and zzso stomach evolve through different molecular zzso
