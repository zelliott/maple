zzso and killed zzso were compared for the ability to induce zzso oxide zzso production in normal zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with viable zzso resulted in a strong expression of zzso NO zzso followed by an enhanced production of zzso However, those responses were not induced after stimulation with killed zzso or when zzso were zzso with killed and viable zzso The same level of zzso zzso expression was observed in reverse zzso after stimulation of zzso cells with viable and killed zzso However, zzso production was induced only when zzso cells were zzso with viable zzso zzso stimulation of zzso with either viable or killed zzso resulted in a strong zzso production by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso caused a complete zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso plus complement treatment abolished zzso production after stimulation with viable zzso indicating that the zzso cell was the major source of zzso and its production was triggered only by stimulation with viable zzso The present study showed that the ability of viable zzso to induce NO production is superior to that of killed zzso and both zzso and zzso are essential for zzso NO production by zzso zzso zzso cells appeared to be important as a source of zzso and the insufficient NO induction by killed zzso was due to the inability to induce zzso from zzso zzso
