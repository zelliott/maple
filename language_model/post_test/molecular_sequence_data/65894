The coat proteins zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mosaic virus zzso two members of the zzso zzso share zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso level and contain four highly zzso regions, identified as putative zzso zzso zzso To assess the contribution of the zzso zzso sequence within each zzso and the structural features contained zzso toward zzso assembly and zzso packaging, we engineered a set of zzso independent zzso zzso and zzso encompassing all four zzso The effect of each zzso on viral biology, zzso and zzso packaging was analyzed in zzso infection zzso Among the four zzso two zzso engineered into the zzso domain zzso I) and two of the four zzso engineered into the zzso domain zzso zzso proved to be more debilitating zzso to zzso while only selected regions in the central zzso zzso II or zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso effects were observed when zzso zzso that are predicted to affect calcium binding were zzso To further analyze the importance of N and C terminal interactions leading to virus assembly and zzso packaging, four zzso hybrids were constructed by precisely exchanging either the zzso 77 or the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Despite the fact that the zzso composition of the hybrid viruses is distinct from either of the parents, the symptom zzso in zzso zzso migration pattern of zzso in Western blots and zzso mobility in zzso gels was indistinguishable from the respective parent providing the genetic zzso zzso the data provide insight for assessing the relative importance of each zzso during zzso packaging and in molecular processes regulating the overall architecture of the assembled zzso
