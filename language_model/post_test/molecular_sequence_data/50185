zzso growth factors zzso and their receptors play an important role in cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso Four distinct genes zzso zzso growth factor receptors zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the genes for zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso are zzso by the same zzso zzso To study the regulation of expression of the zzso receptors we zzso the DNA sequence zzso the zzso region of the zzso of zzso zzso to seek elements that control its zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso end of the zzso was isolated from mouse zzso library and used to map the promoter zzso We found that the sequence zzso the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso contains an zzso located 210 zzso upstream from the translation start zzso Using zzso protection and primer extension, we identified the zzso start 37 zzso upstream from the beginning of the zzso zzso The promoter activity was found to reside in a zzso zzso upstream from the zzso and deletion mapping further localized the promoter to a zzso zzso The sequence of this region shows high zzso content zzso which is particularly emphasized in the 200 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso This region contains the zzso zzso AND zzso motifs also found in promoters of other growth factor zzso Neither zzso nor zzso boxes were found near the zzso start zzso The characterization of this promoter will allow studies of the regulation of expression of the zzso during development and in zzso zzso The differences between the promoter sequence of the gene for zzso zzso and zzso zzso may explain their differential expression during zzso
