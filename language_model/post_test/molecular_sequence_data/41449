In rare instances, zzso presents as a zzso zzso zzso involving peripheral neural zzso zzso In all known reported cases, peripheral nerve zzso have had zzso zzso zzso composition and occurred in the context of zzso 

A 46-year-old man presented with progressive zzso right zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso nerve biopsy was performed on an enlarged zzso nerve after earlier zzso zzso nerve biopsy was zzso zzso dissected mass zzso of the discovered zzso protein was performed after zzso failed to identify the specific zzso zzso Complete gene sequencing of zzso A1 zzso was zzso 

Only zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso component in the zzso 

This case highlights the utility of zzso zzso nerve biopsy combined with zzso mass zzso zzso zzso the case expands the known causes of zzso to include zzso zzso
