We have shown that zzso Host Factor of zzso coli can successfully be used in the zzso Achilles' zzso zzso zzso technique zzso et zzso zzso for generating rare natural zzso zzso The first step of this procedure is zzso of DNA in the presence of zzso when the overlapping zzso sites are protected from zzso and in the second step the DNA is cut by the zzso restriction zzso The extent of zzso could be controlled by varying the zzso ratio and zzso The aim of the present study is to demonstrate that zzso procedure might serve as a useful tool for finding new zzso sites which overlap known restriction zzso I have used this approach in conjunction with several zzso to find several other unknown zzso zzso
