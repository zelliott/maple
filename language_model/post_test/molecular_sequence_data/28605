DNA zzso facilitated the evolution of a human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso with enhanced replication in zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso This zzso consists exclusively of zzso sequences with the exception of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso spanning the zzso zzso zzso region from several zzso zzso were shuffled and cloned into a parental zzso backbone containing zzso zzso Neither this full-length parent nor any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso appreciably or zzso in zzso zzso Upon selection of the shuffled viral libraries by serial zzso in zzso zzso a species emerged which zzso at substantially higher levels zzso to 100 zzso zzso than any of the zzso parents and most importantly, could be continuously zzso in zzso zzso The parental zzso zzso when selected similarly, became zzso zzso of full-length improved zzso clones indicate that multiple zzso events in the shuffled region and zzso changes in the rest of the zzso contributed zzso to the improved zzso This improved zzso may prove useful in establishing a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso
