A zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso isolated from the celery zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a new virus based on differences in zzso and DNA zzso profiles between this isolate and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso type zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso Southern zzso zzso comparison of their genetic organization in the zzso gene region zzso zzso zzso and zzso comparison of the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of eight viral genes in this zzso Both zzso zzso strongly to one another in zzso zzso experiments under stringent conditions, and physical mapping showed that gene order was zzso between the two viruses in the zzso gene region, though the zzso zzso and zzso genes were absent from this region in the zzso Gene and deduced zzso acid sequences for zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso 453 and zzso showed identity between the two viruses of greater than zzso The sequences for the zzso zzso located on a different zzso fragment, were also compared and had a zzso sequence identity of zzso and zzso acid sequence identity of greater than zzso The zzso gene showed the least zzso between the two zzso with a zzso sequence identity of zzso and a deduced zzso acid sequence identity of zzso Based on these results, we conclude that the zzso should be considered a zzso of the zzso These results also indicate that caution must be used in basing zzso relationships of zzso on analysis of a single zzso especially the zzso zzso as is the current zzso
