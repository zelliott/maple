zzso is an important bacterial zzso with a complex zzso that contains species of both ecological and zzso importance, including nine closely related species collectively termed the zzso zzso complex zzso Unfortunately, zzso zzso gene analysis has proven to be not sensitive enough to discriminate between species of the zzso Alternative species identification strategies such as zzso zzso followed by restriction zzso length zzso analysis, although initially useful, have proven to be inaccurate with the increasing species diversity of the zzso zzso gene sequence analysis is more zzso and corroborates other zzso and zzso means of zzso zzso However, it is limited by the fact that certain zzso species are subdivided into discrete zzso sequence zzso that may confuse clinical zzso In this study, an effective approach is described for the rapid differentiation of zzso species from both environmental and clinical sources by means of a zzso sequencing and zzso zzso using fur as a target gene that provides sequence zzso that are species specific and, with few exceptions, not divided into subspecies zzso This zzso is specific and can be used to correctly determine the species status of zzso strains tested following sequencing and amplification of the fur gene by both general and zzso zzso Based on our results, this typing strategy is simpler than and as sensitive as established tests currently in use zzso This zzso is useful for the zzso definitive identification of all nine current zzso species and potentially novel species zzso
