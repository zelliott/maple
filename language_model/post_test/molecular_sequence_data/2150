zzso of zzso type 12 adapted to growth in zzso cells were studied by restriction zzso and sequence zzso zzso zzso were isolated either after long-term passage of the virus in zzso cells zzso zzso or from zzso cells zzso with viral DNA zzso zzso The zzso activity of these zzso was equal or even slightly higher in zzso cells than in zzso cells, whereas the activity of zzso virus in zzso cells exceeded that in zzso cells by about one to two orders of zzso All zzso tested had an zzso of variable length consisting of zzso sequences at the right end of the viral zzso zzso of the insertions were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or 180 zzso zzso Additional insertions of multiple size and less than zzso amount were detected and seem to exist in some of the viral zzso Furthermore, all four zzso tested showed an identical zzso deletion in the first zzso of the zzso zzso
