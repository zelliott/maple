zzso receptors and their zzso termed zzso have been implicated in zzso guidance, zzso zzso regional zzso and synaptic functions in nervous zzso These activities of the zzso family molecules prompted us to investigate whether these molecules play roles in the zzso zzso and plasticity in the mature peripheral zzso zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso we identified distinct and zzso expression patterns of full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that correlated with structural features of the peripheral zzso system in adult zzso All of the zzso receptors and zzso examined were localized in the cell bodies of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso and were readily detected in their zzso zzso in zzso In the zzso these molecules were localized in distinct cellular and zzso compartments corresponding to discrete features of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso branching and zzso zzso Taken together, these results identify the zzso receptors and zzso as candidate molecular zzso for defining some aspects of the structural organization of the adult peripheral zzso zzso
