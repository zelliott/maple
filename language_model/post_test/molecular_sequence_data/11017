zzso differences in the zzso zzso end of the zzso zzso of three species of Pacific zzso accumulated zzso times more rapidly than did changes within the zzso zzso b gene zzso Rapid evolution in this region was accompanied by strong zzso bias and large variation in the probability of a DNA substitution among zzso These substitution constraints placed an absolute ceiling on the magnitude of sequence divergence that could be detected between zzso This divergence zzso was reached rapidly and led to a zzso in the relative rate of zzso b zzso A high rate of evolution in this section of the zzso of zzso stands in marked contrast to the patterns reported in some other fish zzso Although the mechanism underlying rate variation remains zzso all zzso with rapid evolution in the zzso of the zzso showed extreme transition zzso By contrast, in zzso with slower zzso evolution, transitions accumulated at nearly the same rate as zzso More information is needed to understand the relationship between zzso bias and the rate of evolution in the zzso of the zzso Despite strong constraints on sequence change, zzso information was preserved in the group of recently differentiated species and supported the zzso of sequences into three major zzso zzso Within these groups, very similar zzso sequences were widely distributed across the Pacific Ocean and were shared between recognized species, indicating a lack of zzso sequence zzso among zzso
