zzso zzso strains which possess the zzso gene zzso may have clinical importance as new zzso pathogens and should therefore be differentiated from other zzso zzso zzso We characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso which were positive in the zzso test for the zzso zzso using zzso tests not routinely used for identification of members of the family zzso and compared them with zzso strains isolated from different clinical and nonclinical sources to find characteristics useful for zzso Random amplified zzso DNA zzso and partial sequencing of the zzso zzso gene were zzso to study the genetic diversity of the zzso The zzso strains were found to have many characteristic zzso zzso zzso reactions in the zzso and zzso zzso tests and a positive reaction in the zzso zzso test may be useful in routine zzso Nearly identical zzso profiles and identical zzso fragments of the zzso zzso genes indicated little genetic diversity among the zzso zzso The low level of zzso zzso in the partial zzso zzso genes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains raises questions about the zzso positioning of zzso zzso zzso
