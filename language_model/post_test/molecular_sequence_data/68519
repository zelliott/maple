The mechanisms that regulate cell zzso and zzso patterns of gene expression in the gastric units of the stomach are largely zzso zzso mice were generated in order to identify zzso sequences that determine the zzso zzso pattern of expression of the mouse intrinsic factor zzso gene and the zzso zzso pattern of expression of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of each gene were linked to the human growth hormone zzso gene beginning at its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies combined with zzso zzso surveys using a panel of zzso zzso and zzso indicated that zzso zzso to zzso of the mouse zzso zzso gene direct a pattern of reporter production which zzso the zzso zzso and zzso patterns of expression of the zzso zzso Analysis of three mosaic founders containing zzso zzso to zzso revealed that they had zzso gastric zzso a given unit contained either a wholly zzso or a wholly zzso population of zzso zzso These latter findings provide very strong evidence that gastric units are zzso zzso they are supplied by stem cells having one zzso Although some, but not all, zzso cells are apparently derived from the same committed zzso as zzso cells, virtually all zzso cells in a given gastric unit, but none of its zzso cells, express zzso to zzso This suggests that zzso to zzso may contain zzso sequences which allow zzso cell expression in other species zzso zzso but lack additional elements which normally function in mice to suppress zzso expression in this zzso The absence of zzso in zzso cells also means that the zzso regulatory environments of zzso and zzso cells derived from the same precursor are distinguishable by zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso are the only two sequences reported to date that are able to direct foreign gene expression exclusively to a gastric zzso cell lineage in transgenic zzso This ability to deliver gene products to zzso cells can now be exploited to identify factors that control their normal proliferation and differentiation programs and/or to specifically alter their biological zzso
