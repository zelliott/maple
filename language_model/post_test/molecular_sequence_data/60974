A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the apple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fuji and its zzso expression pattern was studied during flower zzso zzso shares a high degree of zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is transcribed through all stages of flower development, and its zzso was seen in the four floral zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is expressed both in the zzso zzso and in the floral zzso The zzso transcript was detected at all stages of flower zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso protein was excluded from the zzso and zzso zzso in which a considerable zzso zzso signal was zzso This indicates that zzso regulation may be involved in the zzso control of flower zzso zzso tobacco expressing the zzso gene from the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter showed early flowering and shorter bolts, but did not show any zzso changes in the floral zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role during early stages of flower zzso
