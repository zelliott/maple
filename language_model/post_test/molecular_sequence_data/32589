Plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso maintain proper zzso zzso levels by zzso zzso from the zzso zzso genes and zzso forms are expressed in zzso patterns in zzso suggesting that these zzso may regulate specific biological zzso However, knockout zzso die as zzso or undergo cell zzso thus, it is unclear whether other cell processes zzso zzso or whether these pumps are largely committed to the control of toxic levels of zzso Here, we analyze the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We report that partial zzso zzso disrupt zzso zzso in a class of scavenger cells called zzso Moreover, components of early zzso machinery are zzso in zzso zzso including zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain protein zzso This zzso in zzso in the zzso can be reversed by lowering zzso Together, these data support a function for zzso in the regulation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, they suggest that zzso can be blocked by high calcium zzso
