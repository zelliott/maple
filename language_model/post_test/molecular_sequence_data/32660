The rugged zzso landscapes of zzso often display many competing zzso How do zzso discriminate among competing zzso in their search for the native zzso By using optical zzso we show that the zzso landscape can be manipulated to control the fate of an zzso individual zzso molecules can be induced into either native or zzso pathways by modulating the relaxation rate of applied force and even be redirected during the folding process to switch from zzso to native folding zzso Controlling folding pathways at the zzso level provides a way to survey the zzso of folding zzso and zzso a capability that previously was available only to theoretical zzso
