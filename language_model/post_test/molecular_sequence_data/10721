We have previously defined the promoter zzso sites zzso and zzso in the rice zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso gene that are essential for zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized zzso zzso proteins that specifically bind to sites zzso and zzso The two DNA binding zzso designated zzso and zzso share zzso zzso zzso in common zzso sequences at the zzso zzso The zzso regions are responsible for DNA binding and zzso and zzso formation, and they contain a putative basic zzso zzso zzso The structure and DNA binding specificity of the zzso motif are distinguishable from those of other known zzso proteins that bind to the zzso The motif is zzso zzso zzso to several expressed sequence tags from zzso and rice, suggesting that zzso and zzso are members of a novel family of proteins that are zzso in zzso and zzso A zzso zzso using an zzso zzso showed the involvement of zzso in site zzso zzso zzso binding activities in rice nuclear zzso particularly in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also more likely to form zzso than zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso expression of the rice zzso gene through binding to sites zzso and zzso and formation of zzso or zzso
