The zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso for full zzso and its zzso is a candidate zzso molecular pattern that may elicit plant zzso zzso extracts from zzso zzso contained a strong zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso is not this zzso because extracts from zzso bacteria and zzso or zzso zzso defective in zzso production all zzso similar plant zzso Equally important, live zzso zzso caused similar disease on zzso zzso zzso regardless of the presence of zzso in the zzso or the zzso zzso recognition system in the zzso Unlike the previously studied zzso zzso zzso a zzso based on the corresponding zzso zzso segment of zzso zzso zzso did not elicit any response from zzso zzso Thus recognition of zzso plays no readily apparent role in this zzso zzso also was not the primary zzso of responses in zzso The primary zzso activity in boiled zzso zzso extracts applied to zzso was attributable to one or more proteins other than zzso including species zzso at approximately 5 to 10 zzso and also at larger molecular masses, possibly due to zzso zzso of this zzso activity did not require zzso zzso regulator of type III zzso zzso zzso regulator of zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso global zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was virulent on zzso despite the presence of this zzso in pathogen zzso
