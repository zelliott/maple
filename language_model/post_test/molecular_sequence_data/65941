zzso is a zzso toxin that is made by the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso has a wide range of effects on zzso cells in culture, including induction of zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso production by zzso These activities have led to the proposal that zzso contributes to zzso during invasive zzso We tested this hypothesis by creating zzso strains of zzso and zzso zzso 

We deleted zzso the gene that encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first zzso step in the synthesis of zzso We then tested for zzso production and zzso in different animal zzso 

zzso of zzso resulted in strains that were wild type for growth, but they did not zzso zzso Transformation of zzso deletion zzso with a full copy of zzso restored zzso zzso The zzso deletion strain had attenuated zzso in zzso mice zzso with zzso but had normal zzso in zzso zzso It also had reduced zzso in a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso only contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso mice and in fruit flies with functional zzso These results suggest that the principal targets of zzso are zzso or other zzso
