The zzso zzso zzso and zzso behave as zzso for cell zzso human zzso virus types 1 and 2 zzso and zzso and for zzso zzso zzso which also use the zzso zzso The cell zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso strain zzso were able to zzso zzso cells expressing human zzso while only zzso was able to zzso cells expressing the rat zzso of zzso This strain selectivity was addressed by using zzso zzso zzso All zzso tested zzso zzso infection, but only those containing the third zzso domain zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain might be required for the functional interaction of zzso and zzso but not zzso with zzso zzso zzso might also interact with zzso but in a different zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against human zzso did not stain cells expressing rat zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed us to map the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to neutralize infection by certain zzso and zzso strains is also consistent with the role of zzso in the zzso activity of zzso The deletion of most of the zzso zzso domain zzso abolished the zzso activity of human zzso for zzso and zzso but not for zzso These results indicate that zzso strains have different requirements for their interaction with zzso They also suggest differences in the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso
