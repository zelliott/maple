zzso signaling in animals ensures the rapid and accurate transmission of information, often carried by zzso zzso zzso and zzso channels that are activated by membrane zzso In heart and zzso a distinct type of zzso channel called the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel is activated by membrane zzso Recent zzso studies have revealed that zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso U S zzso zzso had evolved in zzso one of the zzso relatives of zzso To date, zzso channels have been considered to be zzso Here, we demonstrate the presence of an zzso channel zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains highly zzso functional zzso and sequence motifs that are correlated with the unique zzso activities of zzso zzso These findings provide novel zzso insights into the evolution of complex electrical signaling before the emergence of zzso zzso
