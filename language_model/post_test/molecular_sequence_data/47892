zzso (for downstream of zzso zzso proteins are a newly identified family of zzso molecules that are characterized by the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, a central putative zzso zzso domain and numerous potential sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we explore the potential role of the zzso family member zzso (also known as zzso or zzso in signaling pathways zzso by the zzso growth factor zzso zzso An intact zzso domain in zzso was critical for its association with two zzso consensus sites on the zzso zzso and the zzso domain further contributed to stable in zzso binding and zzso zzso of zzso Multiple sites on zzso were zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are proposed to dock the tandem zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso mediates an association with the zzso domain of the adapter protein zzso Interestingly, we have found that zzso could zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso independently of its association with zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso has an important role downstream of growth factor receptors as a potential negative regulator of signal zzso
