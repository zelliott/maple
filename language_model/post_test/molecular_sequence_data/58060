Many proteins exhibit a large-scale movement of rigid zzso zzso Among these, bacterial zzso binding proteins involved in zzso zzso or transport and zzso can be used as prototypes for understanding the mechanism of the zzso Such movements have been found to be associated with specific functions, such as zzso zzso zzso and recognition by other zzso We have determined the three-dimensional structures of the zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso with and without zzso by zzso zzso methods at zzso and zzso resolution, zzso The structures are composed of two zzso held together by two short connecting zzso The two zzso are far apart in the zzso structure, but in contact with each other in the zzso zzso The large movement of the zzso is a consequence of a 52 degrees rotation of a single backbone zzso angle in the first connecting strand and of distributed smaller changes of three backbone zzso angles of the second connecting zzso The absence of contact between the zzso and the connecting strands suggests that the zzso does not induce the zzso change zzso We instead propose that the zzso protein zzso a dynamic change between an zzso and a zzso zzso and that the role of the zzso is to stabilize the closed zzso We discuss the nature of a surface area which might be recognized by the zzso complex of these zzso acids transport zzso
