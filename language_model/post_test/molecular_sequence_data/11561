zzso bacteria were isolated from a natural environment potentially favorable to zzso zzso An improved colony plate zzso was developed and used to identify putative zzso colonies with high zzso Fourteen new zzso were zzso and partially zzso These new zzso exhibit a DNA sequence zzso of up to zzso with the zzso regions in the zzso and zzso genes of the soluble methane zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso The copper regulation of soluble zzso expression in the same zzso however, differs from that of zzso zzso Bath, as the new zzso can tolerate up to zzso zzso copper without loss of zzso activity while a drastic reduction of zzso activity occurs already at zzso zzso copper in zzso zzso zzso The zzso can be cultivated and zzso at elevated temperatures, and their zzso and zzso zzso activity makes these bacteria ideal candidates for future zzso zzso
