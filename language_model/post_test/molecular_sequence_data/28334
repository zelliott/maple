In zzso DNA amplification followed by zzso mismatch zzso was used to study the frequency of zzso zzso in the benign zzso skin tumors zzso and in zzso cell zzso We used freshly obtained zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso from both types of zzso DNA from 50 samples of each tumor type was analyzed for zzso zzso involving zzso 12 and zzso A relatively high percentage zzso of zzso zzso was found in the zzso compared with zzso in the zzso cell zzso The most frequent zzso identified is the zzso zzso in the second position of zzso zzso The present findings demonstrate the involvement of the zzso zzso in human benign zzso Moreover, they indicate that an activated zzso zzso is not sufficient to maintain a zzso zzso and argue against a role of zzso in the progression of skin zzso
