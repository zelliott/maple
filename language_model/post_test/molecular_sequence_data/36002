zzso syndrome caused by a complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the result of a zzso group of germ line zzso Identification of each zzso gene provides valuable information as to the type of zzso that occurs zzso We report here a newly identified zzso zzso in a Japanese patient with zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso Tokyo, had a single zzso change from G to A, as identified by sequencing zzso amplified by the zzso chain zzso zzso specific zzso zzso analysis using amplified zzso DNA showed that the zzso gene was transmitted from the maternal germ zzso This zzso would lead to an zzso acid substitution of zzso for zzso at the zzso acid position 140 located within the putative zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso in human zzso deficient patients thus far reported tend to accumulate in this functionally active zzso However, a comparison of the data suggested that both zzso and synonymous zzso can occur at any coding sequence of the human germ line zzso zzso but that a limited percentage of all the zzso zzso cause zzso The probability that a zzso will cause disease tends to be higher when the zzso zzso is within a functionally important zzso
