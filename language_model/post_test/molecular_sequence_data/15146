A case of human infection with zzso zzso has been recently discovered in zzso To investigate the prevalence of this malaria species, a zzso survey was zzso 

Blood samples from zzso patients were tested for zzso species by zzso and zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso was characterized by sequencing the zzso surface protein 1 gene zzso 

Of all zzso species identified, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contributed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso infections were more common in northwestern and southwestern regions bordering Myanmar zzso than in eastern and southern areas zzso In northwestern and southwestern regions, zzso infections had a significantly higher prevalence in dry than in rainy seasons zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in 10 patients, mostly from southern and southwestern zzso were zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso Thai zzso were more closely related to zzso from zzso than to zzso from zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso from the same area of zzso differed and possessed novel zzso indicating genetic zzso in zzso zzso infecting zzso 

This survey highlights the widespread distribution of zzso zzso in zzso albeit at low prevalence and mostly occurring as cryptic zzso
