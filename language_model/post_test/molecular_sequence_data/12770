zzso a protein zzso by zzso 6 is highly zzso to the zzso domain and most of the zzso domain of zzso In order to clarify its functional role we analyzed its expression during human fetal zzso We carried out zzso analysis on muscle from normal human fetuses at different ages of gestation using an zzso directed against a specific zzso sequence of the zzso In addition, we stained serial sections with zzso against zzso and zzso zzso Our findings show that, at week 9 of zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso From week 12 to 22 the zzso is still zzso though the reaction intensity progressively zzso zzso we observed a strong reaction in fetal nerve at week 18 and zzso There was no correlation between zzso expression and progressive zzso membrane zzso
