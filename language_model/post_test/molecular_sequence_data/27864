zzso zzso gene expression is known to be zzso by several factors, including zzso hormone and zzso This effect of zzso appears to be zzso by zzso resulting from zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso The elements of the rat zzso gene important for zzso hormone stimulation and zzso expression have been previously mapped using gene zzso zzso zzso expression of the gene is zzso by two zzso elements located from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone stimulation are thought to be located between zzso and zzso In this study, using three different methods to elevate zzso levels in cells zzso a direct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso we show that zzso DNA of the rat zzso gene can mediate stimulation by zzso zzso to zzso The zzso region was mapped to sequences between zzso and zzso which contains the zzso zzso element zzso important for zzso zzso Either the zzso or the zzso region of the zzso cloned upstream of a zzso promoter, zzso only minimal or no zzso by zzso This suggests that these sequences are not the direct target of zzso action or that they are insufficient alone to mediate the zzso zzso The zzso regulatory element zzso is not found between - 104 and zzso and zzso zzso does not appear to act via putative zzso zzso since zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
