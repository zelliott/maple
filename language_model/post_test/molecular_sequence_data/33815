The zzso zzso zzso assessment is conducted to evaluate the status of molecular modeling and zzso zzso for human G zzso zzso The present round of the assessment was based on the recent structures of zzso D3 and zzso zzso receptors bound to small zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthetic zzso Thirty-five groups submitted their zzso complex structure predictions prior to the release of the zzso zzso With closely related zzso modeling templates, as for zzso D3 zzso and with incorporation of zzso and zzso data, modern zzso techniques predicted complex details with accuracy approaching zzso In zzso complexes that had zzso interactions and only distant zzso to the known zzso structures still remained very zzso The assessment results provide guidance for modeling and zzso communities in method development and target selection for further expansion of the structural coverage of the zzso zzso
