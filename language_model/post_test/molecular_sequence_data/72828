We have isolated and characterized a zzso zzso from an zzso zzso library zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence exhibits about zzso overall similarity to the corresponding gene of other zzso The zzso displays extreme zzso bias with a preference for C or G in the third zzso A putative initiation site and an zzso site are zzso An zzso acid content of 388 and a molecular mass of about zzso zzso are deduced for the zzso zzso zzso sites which might be involved in regulation of the zzso are zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso and the identity of the protein product confirmed by Western zzso zzso Northern analyses of the expression of the zzso SAM zzso gene during development revealed a pronounced reduction in the level of transcripts as zzso converted to zzso
