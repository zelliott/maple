The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an economically important fish, which is endemic to China, restricted to large freshwater systems zzso lakes, large rivers and zzso and typically exhibit low zzso The continuous distribution ranges from the temperate region of the zzso and Yellow River zzso to the zzso region of the Pearl River zzso This wide ranging distribution makes the species an ideal model for the study of zzso effects on population genetic structure and zzso Here, we aim to analyze population genetic differentiation within and between river zzso and demographic history in order to understand how this species responded to severe zzso zzso decline of the sea levels during the zzso ice ages and zzso zzso 

We obtained the complete zzso zzso b sequences zzso zzso of 354 individuals from 13 populations in the Pearl River, the zzso River and the zzso River zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso frequency zzso were strongly zzso with most zzso zzso zzso 24) represented only in single samples each and thus restricted to a single zzso The most common zzso zzso was found in zzso of all zzso Analysis of molecular zzso zzso revealed a random pattern in the distribution of genetic diversity, which is inconsistent with contemporary zzso zzso zzso levels of genetic subdivision were detected among populations within zzso rather than between the three zzso zzso analysis revealed that the population size in the Pearl River basin has remained relatively constant whereas the populations in the zzso River and the zzso River zzso expanded about 221 and 190 zzso ago, respectively, with the majority of zzso occurring after the last glacial maximum zzso 

The observed complex genetic pattern of zzso zzso is coherent with a scenario of multiple unrelated founding events by long-distance colonization and zzso combined with zzso population expansion and locally restricted gene zzso We also found that this species was likely severely impacted by past zzso More zzso climate and the formation of large suitable zzso together facilitated population expansion after the late zzso (especially the zzso We proposed that all populations should be managed and zzso zzso especially for habitat zzso
