zzso zzso of the mouse gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, or zzso zzso causes severe defects in the recovery of cone zzso However, zzso zzso analyses of human zzso patients with defective zzso zzso showed normal or slightly abnormal zzso zzso It remains unclear why the loss of zzso yields such different zzso in the recovery of mouse and human zzso We examined the zzso and zzso activity of zzso the human zzso of the seventh member of the zzso family, in an attempt to understand its potential role in zzso zzso 

zzso approaches were used to identify the human zzso zzso Human and bovine zzso zzso were isolated by zzso zzso zzso expressed in insect cells, was used to zzso activated zzso zzso raised against zzso peptides were used to examine the zzso specific expression of zzso by zzso and its zzso zzso by zzso 

The human zzso gene is located on zzso zzso spans at least 10 zzso and consists of 4 zzso In human, zzso is expressed exclusively in the zzso and is found in all retinal zzso and specifically, in cone outer zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso in a light dependent zzso We provide evidence that zzso and zzso are zzso in human zzso In contrast, mouse zzso is expressed in many zzso including zzso where zzso apparently do not express zzso 

The presence of zzso in human, but not in zzso cone outer segments suggests that zzso may function to provide the normal zzso vision reported by zzso patients with a defective zzso zzso The absence of zzso expression in cone outer segments of mice is consistent with the notion that mouse cones rely solely on zzso to zzso cone visual zzso
