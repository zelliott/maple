zzso of zzso zzso represent a sheer unlimited resource for discovery of novel zzso Here, we report on the zzso zzso of a novel, soil zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was similar to a family 5, single domain zzso with no distinct cellulose binding domain from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli and the corresponding zzso zzso protein zzso using three-step zzso The zzso zzso protein was highly active against soluble cellulose zzso containing zzso zzso such as zzso and barley zzso and not active against zzso zzso zzso was not among the initial zzso products, indicating an zzso mode of zzso zzso displayed a wide range of pH activity with a maximum at pH zzso and at least zzso activity at pH zzso and zzso The zzso was highly stable at 40 degrees C for up to 11 days, and retained zzso activity after incubation with 3M zzso 3M zzso or zzso zzso for 20 zzso zzso was also active in the presence of diverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso This highly stable, salt and pH tolerant zzso is an ideal candidate for industrial zzso
