We have characterized a novel type of zzso zzso which consists of tandem repeats of similar zzso approximately zzso zzso in zzso This zzso termed zzso zzso specific zzso zzso is zzso at a single locus (6 zzso in the rat zzso where 100 to 150 copies of the zzso zzso sequences are repeated in zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the rat central nervous system zzso especially in zzso old structures, such as the zzso and zzso amygdala, zzso and zzso In the developing zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso of zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Despite the finding that zzso zzso appears to be zzso only among the zzso species, the specific expression pattern of zzso zzso suggests that it might have some role in the rat zzso
