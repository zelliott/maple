A gene discovered by zzso cloning has been identified as the von zzso zzso disease tumor zzso zzso A restriction zzso encompassing the gene showed zzso in 28 of 221 zzso zzso zzso of these zzso were due to deletions in the candidate zzso including three large zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in cell lines derived from zzso patients and from sporadic zzso cell zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso and encodes two widely expressed transcripts of approximately 6 and zzso zzso The partial sequence of the zzso gene product shows no zzso to other zzso except for an zzso repeat domain found in the zzso surface membrane zzso of zzso zzso
