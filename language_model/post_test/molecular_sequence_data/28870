A new family of zzso crystal proteins was discovered by screening zzso zzso zzso cultures for oral activity against western corn zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso activity attributable to zzso inclusion bodies containing proteins with molecular masses of zzso 14 and 44 zzso The genes zzso these zzso reside in apparent zzso and the zzso protein open reading frame zzso precedes the zzso protein zzso zzso of either gene in the apparent zzso dramatically reduced zzso activity of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with separately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also demonstrated that both proteins are required for zzso zzso zzso comparisons with other known zzso zzso zzso proteins failed to reveal zzso with previously described zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, there is evidence that the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso are zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been designated zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the zzso zzso from these zzso have been designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso
