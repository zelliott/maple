We cloned and zzso the zzso zzso gene zzso which encodes a zzso zzso that mediates the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso A probe derived from the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was used to identify the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso library constructed in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that the initial translation product contains a zzso zzso The reading frame of the zzso gene is interrupted after zzso acid 28 of the mature protein by a zzso termination zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso DNA in the region surrounding this zzso by the zzso chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing of the cloned DNA zzso established that this stop zzso was not an experimental zzso A zzso beginning 29 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso was required to access the only large open reading frame in the zzso zzso acid sequences of six zzso peptides derived by limited zzso of zzso with zzso zzso matched the downstream zzso acid sequence derived by translation of the large open reading zzso The gene coding sequence of zzso zzso contains sufficient information for the synthesis of an zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected 38 zzso downstream from the zzso stop zzso
