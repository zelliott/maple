Defining regulatory elements governing zzso gene expression can be difficult because zzso may reside tens of zzso away from start zzso of zzso zzso zzso which harbor hundreds of zzso of zzso DNA, preserve a large sequence landscape containing most, if not all, regulatory elements controlling the expression of a particular zzso Here, we report on the use of a bacterial artificial zzso zzso to begin understanding the in zzso regulation of smooth muscle zzso zzso Long and accurate zzso chain reaction, sequencing, and in zzso analyses facilitated the complete sequence zzso of a zzso harboring human zzso zzso zzso protection, in zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso showed the zzso clone faithfully expressed zzso in both cultured cells and transgenic zzso Moreover, expression of zzso mirrored that of zzso mouse zzso suggesting that all zzso elements governing zzso expression in zzso were contained within the zzso These zzso mice represent a new model system in which to systematically assess regulatory elements governing zzso zzso in zzso
