The zzso program of the zzso zzso zzso a distant relative of zzso zzso has been zzso zzso of the zzso zzso occurred in two zzso early and zzso Early genes were expressed from two promoters equivalent to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas late zzso started at a site equivalent to the zzso late A3 zzso The activity of the zzso early zzso and zzso promoters diminished 10 minutes after infection, a time at which expression of the late promoter increased zzso The switch from early to late zzso required protein zzso suggesting the need for viral zzso An open reading frame was found in the zzso zzso coding for a protein showing a 53 % similarity to zzso regulatory protein zzso and was named zzso In zzso protein zzso zzso the early zzso and zzso promoters and activates the late A3 promoter by recruiting zzso zzso to zzso A binding site for protein zzso localized upstream from the zzso late A3 promoter, overlapping with the early zzso zzso In zzso protein zzso the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso early zzso promoter but, unlike in zzso had no effect on the expression of the late A3 promoter: zzso zzso could efficiently bind and initiate zzso from the A3 promoter in the absence of protein zzso zzso zzso of late zzso occurs differently in zzso and zzso We propose that protein zzso an zzso which zzso the binding to the late promoter of an unknown zzso factor present in the host zzso
