zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso that is, zzso alpha zzso beta zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso membrane of zzso zzso in zzso media containing zzso and zzso zzso in amounts above a threshold concentration zzso of about zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this work, we found that above zzso the zzso zzso do not undergo fusion and that the zzso can be reversed or zzso This means that the zzso induced by the zzso results from zzso or zzso of the zzso in the polar head of zzso To investigate this question, we used zzso transform infrared zzso zzso to identify the molecular sites in zzso which are modified by interaction, or zzso formation with zzso zzso and zzso We also determined whether the zzso affect the zzso hydrogen bonding between the zzso zzso C zzso O and the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso The major conclusions are: zzso the zzso do not zzso at least directly, the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso the most probable sites of zzso or zzso for the zzso are the ring zzso and zzso the ring zzso are the sites of either zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso in interacting zzso zzso Within this zzso the zzso of the zzso with Gal might induce total or partial zzso of the zzso zzso and thus provides the means to overcome the repulsive zzso forces that hinder zzso of the zzso zzso
