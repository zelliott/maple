Type II collagen is the most abundant collagen in zzso cartilage and, together with other zzso zzso and zzso provides the tissue with its zzso properties and its resiliency to zzso zzso zzso which recognize various collagen types have been very useful in the study of collagen zzso structure and metabolism in normal and pathological zzso zzso which recognize zzso of type II collagen have been described zzso however, many of these zzso display zzso with other zzso or with type II collagen from other species, reflecting the high degree of zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we prepared zzso to sequential zzso of human type II zzso employing synthetic peptides with sequences deduced from the zzso sequence of the human alpha 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso were highly specific for zzso in either the zzso zzso or the zzso of the human type II collagen and did not zzso with other human zzso zzso or with zzso type II zzso These zzso were used in conjunction with zzso labeling to study the zzso and processing of human type II zzso and collagen in human zzso in zzso The results indicated that a lag period of about 90 zzso was required for the zzso of newly zzso type II zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into fully processed zzso and their deposition in the cell layer were first apparent 240 zzso following the initiation of zzso zzso The zzso were also used to zzso by zzso zzso the structure of the zzso zzso produced by human zzso maintained in long-term cultures under conditions which permit the preservation of the zzso zzso These highly specific zzso provide valuable tools to study the metabolism and structure of human type II zzso and collagen in normal and zzso zzso
