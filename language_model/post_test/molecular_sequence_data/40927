zzso zzso probe amplification zzso is a multiplex copy number analysis method that is routinely used to identify large zzso in many clinical and research zzso One of the most important drawbacks of the standard zzso setup is a complicated, and therefore expensive, procedure of generating long zzso zzso This drawback substantially limits the zzso of zzso to those zzso regions for which zzso commercial kits are zzso Here we present a simple protocol for designing zzso probe sets that are composed entirely of short zzso zzso generated through chemical zzso As an example, we present the design and generation of an zzso zzso for parallel copy number and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso
