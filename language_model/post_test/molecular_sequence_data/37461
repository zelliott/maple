Plant zzso zzso zzso proteins are the most abundant and ubiquitous zzso proteins found in the zzso of higher zzso There are only two families of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso wheat zzso protein was isolated and zzso Wheat zzso zzso encodes a protein of 189 zzso acid zzso At its N zzso there is a zzso zzso structure, which is a common feature of plant zzso zzso followed by four zzso zzso zzso chain reaction results show that the gene contains a single zzso of zzso zzso All four zzso motifs are zzso by the second zzso Northern zzso results show that the expression of zzso gene is much higher in zzso undergoing active cell zzso zzso zzso analysis show that wheat zzso zzso c and zzso zzso bind to zzso DNA with high binding zzso but affinity is dramatically reduced with increasing zzso and zzso zzso zzso Competition binding studies show that proteins share overlapping binding sites on zzso zzso zzso does not bind to zzso zzso
