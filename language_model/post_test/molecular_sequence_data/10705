A point zzso zzso predicting the zzso acid exchange zzso in segment zzso of the human muscle sodium channel zzso was identified in a family presenting features of zzso periodic paralysis and zzso zzso with sex-related modification of zzso In this family, only one male member is clinically affected, presenting episodes of zzso weakness as well as paradoxical zzso and zzso zzso Three female family members who have the same zzso show only zzso bursts on zzso We studied the functional zzso caused by this zzso by investigating zzso wild type zzso and zzso sodium channels expressed in a zzso cell line zzso using the zzso zzso With zzso channels, the zzso of the sodium currents was two times slower than with zzso the zzso zzso curve was shifted by zzso zzso and recovery from zzso was zzso times zzso High zzso zzso (9 zzso did not affect channel zzso zzso zzso revealed prolonged mean open times and an increased number of channel zzso The results are remarkable with respect to the lack of complete zzso usually seen with sodium zzso and the site of zzso that was formerly not thought to be involved in channel zzso
