zzso zzso across the zzso zzso membrane occurs at the zzso zzso This has two essential zzso the zzso zzso membrane protein zzso and the zzso zzso which has been proposed to zzso the zzso We have analyzed the function of zzso using a series of domain zzso and found that both the zzso and zzso clamp zzso of zzso are essential for protein zzso Our data reveal that the zzso domain is required for zzso interaction but that the zzso clamp domain is required to complete zzso of the zzso after precursor targeting to zzso
