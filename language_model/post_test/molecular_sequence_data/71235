A major action of zzso zzso in zzso fish is the maintenance of zzso balance in zzso species in fresh zzso The function of zzso in marine zzso is less certain and unlike zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso there is relatively little information about protein or gene zzso Associated with studies to determine potential functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso from sea zzso zzso zzso a marine zzso The sequence obtained spanned zzso zzso and contained an open reading frame zzso a protein of 212 zzso acids composed of a putative signal zzso of 24 zzso and a mature protein of 188 zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the native protein confirmed zzso the zzso site, zzso zzso predicted from alignments of the sea zzso zzso zzso with that of other zzso The presence of only one form of zzso in sea zzso was supported by identification using Northern blots of only a single transcript of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction techniques coupled with Southern zzso analysis resulted in the detection of zzso in the zzso but also in the zzso liver, zzso and zzso
