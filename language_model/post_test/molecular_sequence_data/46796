A zzso zzso zzso has been previously reported upstream of the mouse zzso zzso A zzso sequence is also present upstream of the human zzso zzso but the mouse and human zzso enhancers differ markedly in their ability to activate zzso of a zzso zzso Although the 2 enhancers share high zzso in their zzso promoter zzso portions, their zzso zzso portions are zzso zzso enhancers were used to test the role of the zzso segment zzso of the zzso by using transient zzso analysis in mouse kidney zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso from the mouse zzso zzso or its addition to the human zzso zzso did not significantly change zzso activity when placed close to a mouse or human zzso zzso However, when placed further upstream of a zzso promoter, the same deletion and substitution markedly altered zzso zzso zzso gel mobility shift analysis identified 2 zzso a and zzso in zzso that specifically bound nuclear proteins from zzso zzso zzso and transient zzso analysis revealed that element b accounts for the function of zzso and that element a zzso the positive influence of element zzso zzso competition and zzso analysis revealed that nuclear zzso a ubiquitous zzso binding zzso binds to element zzso zzso analysis revealed that the human zzso zzso has a natural zzso zzso in element b that affects its ability to zzso when placed far upstream of a zzso zzso of the human zzso element b to match the mouse sequence restored zzso of the zzso in mouse zzso zzso These data suggest that element b zzso with the rest of the zzso to maintain full zzso activity, whereas element a may regulate zzso zzso zzso differences in these elements may explain the functional differences in the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso
