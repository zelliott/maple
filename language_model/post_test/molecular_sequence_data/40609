Architectural designs for DNA zzso typically fall within one of two broad zzso zzso designs zzso from chemically zzso zzso and zzso designs zzso structures employing a biological scaffold strand and synthetic staple zzso Both previous designs typically contain many zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the design, zzso and testing of a unique architectural strategy incorporating some aspects of each of the two previous design categories but without zzso junction zzso zzso for the new design were to use only chemically zzso DNA, to minimize the number of component zzso and to mimic the zzso woven strand zzso of the zzso zzso The resulting architectural strategy employs zzso zzso formed from only two zzso as basic building blocks, thus decreasing the burden of matching multiple strand zzso compared to previous zzso zzso and resulting in a structurally flexible zzso As an example application, we have shown that the zzso weave tile can be used to increase the zzso activity of zzso zzso in zzso
