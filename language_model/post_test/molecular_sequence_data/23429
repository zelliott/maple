Two new temperate zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso strains B6 and zzso zzso respectively, and partially zzso The zzso zzso genes were zzso in zzso coli, and their zzso proteins were zzso The zzso and zzso genes are very similar zzso zzso and appeared to belong to the group of the so-called typical zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a characteristic zzso deletion zzso although they exhibited several differential zzso properties with respect to the zzso zzso zzso they were inhibited in zzso by sodium zzso and showed a more zzso pH for optimal zzso However, and in sharp contrast with the zzso zzso a short dialysis of zzso or zzso resulted in zzso zzso to the zzso state zzso of the fully active zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso with that of the zzso zzso suggested that zzso might be responsible for at least some of the peculiar properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that changed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso produced a fully active zzso zzso that differs from the parental one only in that the zzso zzso can zzso recover the zzso zzso upon zzso This is the first report showing that a single zzso acid zzso is involved in the conversion process of the major zzso zzso zzso Our results also showed that some zzso zzso zzso strains possess a zzso zzso something that was previously thought to be exclusive to zzso zzso Moreover, the newly discovered zzso zzso constitute a missing link between the typical and zzso zzso zzso known zzso
