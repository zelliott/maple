The reduced folate carrier zzso zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models for these zzso zzso predict up to 12 zzso zzso zzso with internally oriented zzso and zzso and a large central loop between zzso 6 and zzso The zzso are localized mostly in the zzso However, there is little similarity in their zzso and zzso zzso and the central zzso zzso connecting putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso To explore the functional role of the zzso acid central zzso in the human zzso zzso we introduced deletions of 49 and 60 zzso acids into this region, differing by the presence of a stretch of 11 highly zzso zzso acids between the human and zzso zzso zzso zzso An additional zzso construct was prepared in which only the 11 zzso zzso acids were zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were zzso into zzso zzso zzso The deletion zzso were all expressed in plasma zzso however, they were completely inactive for zzso and (6 S zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid fragments from the structurally analogous zzso zzso region into position 204 of zzso zzso restored low levels of transport zzso of the wild zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso zzso at position 215 restored zzso of zzso levels of zzso zzso our results suggest that the role of the zzso zzso zzso is to provide the proper spatial orientation between the two halves of the zzso protein for optimal function, and that this is largely independent of zzso acid zzso Our results also demonstrate a critical transport role for the stretch of 11 zzso zzso acids starting at position 204 of zzso
