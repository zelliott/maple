The amount of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso protein family, which plays a regulatory role in zzso oxygen evolution, decreased significantly during the progress of appearance of zzso spots in cucumber mosaic virus strain Y zzso tobacco zzso zzso zzso leaves zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study was conducted to determine if the amount of other zzso of the zzso complex and the zzso activity also decreased in zzso tobacco zzso The amount of a zzso zzso which is essential to oxygen evolution, did not decrease in zzso leaves showing early symptoms, although the amount of zzso and zzso zzso began to zzso However, comparative analysis of electron transport in zzso zzso indicated that the zzso activity in zzso tobacco leaves was only partly reduced, compared with the activity in zzso tobacco leaves which did not show clear zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity, by a differential decrease in the amount of zzso of the zzso complex, seems to be associated with the primary molecular process of symptom expression in zzso tobacco zzso
