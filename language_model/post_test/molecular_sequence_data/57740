zzso strategies offer the potential to generate and screen extremely large numbers of compounds and to identify individual molecules with a desired binding specificity or pharmacological zzso We describe a zzso strategy for zzso in which the library is generated and screened without using zzso Freedom from zzso enables the use of zzso zzso This dramatically extends the scope of both the compounds and the targets that may be zzso We demonstrate the utility of the method by screening zzso and zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso have been identified that bind to the activated zzso zzso and that have potent zzso activity against the human zzso zzso zzso
