zzso zzso of the zzso gene (also designated zzso zzso one of the receptors for the nerve growth factor, are frequently detected in zzso zzso Such zzso fuse the zzso zzso zzso domain to zzso sequences belonging to different zzso In previously reported studies we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso involves two zzso zzso and zzso both localized similarly to the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso arm of zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso named zzso A zzso zzso capable of transforming activity, was isolated from a zzso cell zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso contains zzso zzso of zzso preceded by zzso zzso belonging to a novel gene that we have named zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence displays, within the zzso region, a zzso motif that could zzso the zzso with the capability to form zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein reacting with zzso zzso By zzso zzso experiments the zzso zzso was shown to form, in zzso zzso complexes, most likely zzso or zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed and is located on zzso zzso The zzso producing the zzso zzso occurs within zzso of both the zzso gene and the zzso gene and produces a zzso zzso that zzso alternative zzso zzso analysis of the zzso rearranged fragments indicated that the zzso zzso is zzso and balanced and involves loss of a few zzso of germ line zzso
