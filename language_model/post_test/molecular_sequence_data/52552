We demonstrate here the zzso activity and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso product of zzso a new member of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lacombe, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso 99, zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli as the full-length protein and as a truncated form missing the zzso extension characteristic of zzso zzso The truncated form possesses zzso zzso activity, whereas the full-length protein is zzso suggesting that the extension prevents zzso folding and/or zzso X-ray zzso analysis was performed on active truncated zzso Like other zzso zzso zzso it is a zzso zzso naturally possesses a zzso zzso at position zzso equivalent to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure shows that the presence of zzso has local structural effects that weaken zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso to heat and zzso treatment, because the zzso zzso is greatly zzso zzso of human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso by zzso zzso shows a specific zzso zzso of zzso that was also demonstrated by Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso of these zzso zzso into zzso is accompanied by zzso of the zzso extension that results in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso is associated with zzso zzso possibly to the contact sites between the outer and inner zzso
