zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are expressed primarily in zzso and contain a combination of four functional and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins 1-3 zzso the best characterized zzso of zzso function in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso 1-2 zzso The pairing of zzso and zzso in zzso depends on cell zzso zzso we investigated the expression of these genes in zzso using in zzso zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in human rod and cone zzso while zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso As a consequence of extensive zzso the zzso gene is not expressed in mouse zzso However, this lack of evolutionary conservation appears to be restricted to only some species as we cloned all three zzso from zzso zzso zzso and localized them to rod cells, short single cones zzso and all zzso of cones zzso Furthermore, sequence comparisons and evolutionary trace analysis coupled with functional testing of the different zzso allowed us to identify the key zzso zzso that are critical for zzso structure and function, and to define zzso zzso for the zzso zzso
