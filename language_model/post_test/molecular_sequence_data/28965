The zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso responsible for the zzso processing of numerous precursor proteins of the zzso and regulated zzso zzso zzso are themselves zzso as inactive zzso zzso of zzso occurs via the zzso zzso removal of the zzso zzso zzso have been proposed as templates in the development of potent and specific zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the specificity and potency of complete zzso and short zzso zzso peptides of each zzso on highly zzso soluble zzso preparations of human zzso zzso and zzso Progress curve kinetic analysis of zzso peptides and complete zzso showed competitive zzso profiles in the low zzso zzso Complete zzso were zzso times more potent than zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are involved in the recognition zzso However, complete zzso and zzso peptides exhibit only a partial specificity toward their zzso zzso zzso structure activity studies indicated the importance of basic zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso positions for zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso as well as basic zzso in zzso and zzso were critical for zzso of zzso Our data demonstrated that the use of zzso as specific zzso acting in trans would be of limited zzso unless modified into more specific zzso
