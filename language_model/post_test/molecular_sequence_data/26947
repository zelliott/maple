In recent years, several independent zzso factors in zzso normal acute zzso leukemia zzso have been zzso zzso or the expression levels of certain genes have been often used as molecular markers for prediction of a patient's outcome or for evaluation of treatment zzso One of them, the gene zzso zzso binding protein alpha zzso plays an important role in zzso differentiation and, when zzso zzso a favorable prognosis for patients with zzso Complete zzso screening of the zzso gene is therefore beneficial and requires fast, precise, and sensitive diagnostic zzso Thus, for routine zzso we developed a screening method using high-resolution melt curve analysis prior to direct sequencing, where only positive samples zzso to zzso are further zzso With this approach, all positive and negative patients were successfully zzso and the results obtained were in absolute zzso with the direct sequence zzso
