The zzso surface protein 2 of zzso zzso is highly zzso in nature, but has regions of almost complete conservation at its zzso and zzso We produced a zzso zzso protein zzso these regions only zzso termed zzso Mice zzso with the NC zzso produce zzso at levels comparable to those zzso with zzso a full-length zzso protein representing zzso from zzso zzso zzso raised against NC recognized zzso zzso zzso by zzso and a zzso zzso protein of Mr 45 zzso by Western zzso However, zzso zzso were observed to differ between zzso and zzso zzso and this resulted in differences in zzso recognition, despite similar levels of zzso having been zzso The response to the NC zzso was also shown to be restricted in some mice zzso but this was overcome by including appropriate zzso help, which was accomplished by creating zzso protein zzso that contained NC and zzso zzso from zzso zzso or zzso from zzso zzso
