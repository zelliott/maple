The zzso zzso group of zzso molecules are produced by both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as the zzso of a zzso transformation carried out by the zzso zzso They are the only non zzso zzso sensing compounds presently known in zzso The zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso was found in many important zzso Here, we surveyed its occurrence in a collection of 165 marine zzso belonging to abundant marine zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of selected positive bands to determine if the presence of the zzso gene is zzso zzso or dependent on the zzso 

The zzso gene was not present in any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains zzso zzso 29) zzso by contrast, these bacteria zzso the zzso zzso coding for an alternative zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso in the activated zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in all zzso zzso and zzso zzso and some zzso and zzso species, while zzso was detected in zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to have neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso We then studied the production of zzso in the zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso All ten species of zzso tested produced a pronounced peak of zzso towards the end of the exponential growth phase in several media zzso The maximum of zzso activity was different in each zzso species, ranging from zzso to zzso of the positive zzso 

The data are consistent with those of fully zzso bacterial zzso and show that the potential for zzso related zzso is dependent on zzso affiliation rather than ecological niche and is largest in certain groups of zzso in the marine zzso This is the first report on zzso production in zzso zzso its zzso role in these organisms remains to be zzso
