To investigate the selectivity of zzso deposits in zzso the authors determined the zzso sequence of two zzso proteins of two zzso pulmonary zzso case of systemic zzso without myeloma and a localized zzso produced a specific zzso to the zzso protein of the systemic case to stain other zzso lung zzso Moreover, the authors extracted zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the systemic case to assess their affinity with the lung zzso Both zzso pulmonary zzso proteins had an zzso structure similar to that of the zzso III zzso zzso light chain and reacted with the same zzso In other cases, zzso forms also stained positively with the same zzso but zzso forms were zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso III light chains reacted with pulmonary zzso deposits on sections of both zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso III zzso zzso light chains are precursor proteins of zzso pulmonary zzso and that their affinity for pulmonary tissue may be a main zzso of pulmonary zzso in zzso zzso
