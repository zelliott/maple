zzso zzso was performed with zzso 21 zzso to identify those that may be involved in the zzso of Down syndrome, or several of the genetic diseases that map to zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed two zzso with significant zzso to a zzso protein zzso and an zzso coli protein zzso zzso protein zzso both of unknown zzso The zzso also showed identity with several expressed sequence tags zzso zzso from all zzso derived from this gene and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis were used to determine the full zzso zzso which corresponded to an zzso of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of 268 zzso zzso The zzso from this zzso termed zzso is zzso zzso but strongly so in heart and skeletal zzso Potential zzso targeting signals were found in both the human and zzso zzso consistent with the high expression levels in muscle zzso The strong zzso between the zzso coli, zzso and zzso proteins suggests an important biological zzso zzso of zzso products to a zzso zzso in zzso zzso mapped zzso just zzso to zzso a critical mapping region for several genetic zzso Given the mapping position, this gene is a candidate for involvement in these disorders, including zzso zzso disease type I and the zzso zzso deafness zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the initial method of zzso identification for gene isolation presented here is valid for many genes and can be used to obtain initial sequence zzso without cloning or library zzso
