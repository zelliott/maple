The zzso proteins interact with diverse cellular molecules involved in various signal zzso pathways controlling cell zzso zzso and zzso To aid our investigation of the biological function of zzso zzso we have set out to identify zzso zzso By screening zzso display libraries, we have identified a set of peptides which bind zzso zzso One of these zzso termed zzso exhibited a high affinity for different zzso of zzso with estimated zzso values of 7-9 zzso zzso zzso zzso of multiple zzso of zzso suggests the targeting of zzso to a structure that is common among zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso that alter critical zzso in the zzso site of zzso drastically decreased the level of zzso zzso zzso efficiently blocked the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and effectively abolished the protective role of zzso against zzso zzso of zzso The zzso structure of zzso in complex with zzso revealed the occupancy of the general binding groove of zzso by zzso explaining the potent zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso Such a zzso zzso will be an effective tool for probing the role of zzso in various signaling zzso and may lead to the development of zzso zzso with pharmacological zzso
