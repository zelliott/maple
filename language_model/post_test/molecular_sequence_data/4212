The components and functions of the insulin zzso zzso signaling zzso have been zzso in a broad range of zzso ranging from zzso to insects and zzso There is a high degree of sequence zzso and functional similarity between the human insulin zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso form zzso of this zzso Similarly, a high degree of zzso exists between human protein zzso zzso zzso zzso (which directly regulates zzso and its zzso counterpart zzso zzso However, genetic and zzso studies have yet to demonstrate that zzso acts in the zzso zzso Comparative structural modeling techniques using the known structures of human zzso and zzso as templates have yielded structures for the zzso zzso The derived structures confirm that there is a high level of structural conservation at the zzso zzso Association of the zzso and zzso zzso with each other was then investigated with a view to zzso whether zzso might be a zzso of the zzso zzso of the interaction surfaces, including zzso patch, shape, hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso strongly suggested that the zzso insulin zzso is a zzso of the zzso The interaction surfaces of the human and zzso zzso are structurally similar, although changes in critical zzso modify possible zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that in the mixed systems, zzso or zzso the zzso domain will be a comparatively poor zzso for zzso activity when compared with the native zzso
