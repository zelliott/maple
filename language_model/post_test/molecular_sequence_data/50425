T4 zzso V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repair of damaged DNA by zzso of the zzso bond at the zzso side of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso To study one of the active sites of T4 zzso zzso systematic zzso zzso was performed on the synthetic T4 zzso V zzso in parallel with three-dimensional structure analysis by zzso zzso The zzso proteins were evaluated for DNA zzso activity using an zzso duplex zzso containing a single zzso zzso as a zzso Replacement of either zzso with zzso or zzso acid or zzso with zzso completely abolished DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso or of zzso to zzso or zzso in a basic zzso acid cluster caused serious defects in DNA zzso activity, which are reflected in the increases in zzso and decreases in zzso of DNA zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso for zzso or of zzso for zzso or zzso resulted in increases in the zzso zzso The completely inactive zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, were further investigated by CD zzso for their ability to bind the zzso zzso It was found that the zzso protein retained specific zzso ability, whereas the zzso protein did zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an important role in zzso of the DNA zzso reaction, and that zzso is a crucial zzso for zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the basic zzso acid cluster also participate in zzso zzso We conclude that the basic zzso acid cluster in T4 zzso V is an essential structure for DNA zzso zzso
