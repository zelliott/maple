Here we use zzso de zzso assembly of second-generation sequencing reads to map structural variation zzso in an Asian zzso and an African zzso Our approach identifies small- and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and their precise zzso and in contrast to other methods, can resolve complex zzso In total, we identified zzso zzso ranging in length from zzso zzso zzso using zzso and experimental methods suggests that we achieve overall zzso zzso rate and zzso zzso rate in zzso regions that can be zzso which zzso other zzso Analysis of the zzso in the zzso of 106 individuals zzso as part of the 1000 zzso Project suggests that zzso account for a greater fraction of the diversity between individuals than do zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso de zzso assembly is a feasible approach to zzso more comprehensive maps of genetic zzso
