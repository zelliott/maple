The zzso zzso zzso described as an autonomous folding unit zzso & Baldwin, zzso has been used to examine the effect of zzso acid replacements on zzso zzso zzso zzso at positions 4, 9, and 14 in the zzso sequence were replaced either zzso or multiply by either zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso dependence of the zzso transition of each zzso was observed by zzso circular zzso Within experimental variation, all three single replacements exhibit a common zzso transition, and all three double replacements exhibit a different common zzso zzso These results suggest that replacement of the central zzso zzso in the repeat zzso located in the zzso in the middle, or in the zzso of the zzso zzso has the same effect on zzso zzso The melting temperature of each zzso transition was estimated by assuming a linear zzso zzso plot and a change in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Such analysis indicates that each replacement of an zzso zzso by a zzso zzso diminishes the melting temperature by 11 zzso 1 degrees C and that each replacement of an zzso zzso by a zzso zzso diminishes the melting temperature by 6 zzso 1 degrees zzso These results suggest that the effect of these replacements on zzso stability is zzso
