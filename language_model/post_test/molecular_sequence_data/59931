The primary structure of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently deduced from the corresponding zzso zzso It consists of two zzso chains and three zzso bonds in an arrangement similar to both zzso and zzso As in zzso zzso an zzso sequence exists within the zzso zzso zzso although it is located four zzso towards the zzso from the corresponding position within zzso This sequence of zzso acids is known to be essential for zzso biological activity and its presence in zzso zzso suggested that the zzso might possess a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assembled by zzso synthesis of the separate chains followed by their combination in solution at high zzso The purity and identity of the zzso zzso was confirmed by chemical characterization including mass zzso At zzso zzso the zzso was shown not to possess zzso activity in the rat isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso This strongly suggests that zzso zzso is not a zzso in the zzso In order to explore further a possible structural relationship between zzso zzso and zzso we prepared a synthetic analogue of zzso zzso zzso containing a single replacement of zzso zzso 12, zzso with zzso This was found to possess significant zzso zzso and zzso activity demonstrating that the zzso structure of zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso and highlighting the key requirement for the zzso zzso zzso to be present in position zzso for characteristic zzso zzso
