To test the hypothesis that zzso insulin resistance might originate from abnormalities in insulin zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on in zzso zzso zzso of the insulin zzso and the insulin zzso zzso zzso in rat skeletal zzso Male zzso rats were treated with zzso zzso zzso for 5 zzso and compared to zzso zzso zzso treatment of rats resulted in both zzso and zzso zzso animals were injected with 10 zzso insulin via cardiac puncture and, after 2 zzso zzso muscles were removed, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso with zzso zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso were identified and zzso with specific zzso zzso treatment increased the amount of insulin zzso protein by zzso but decreased the total level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of control, P zzso zzso The decreased level of zzso zzso was explained by a reduced number of receptors containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of control, P zzso zzso zzso excess decreased skeletal muscle zzso content by zzso but did not significantly alter the total level of zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso of zzso was reduced by approximately 10 zzso Treatment with protein zzso reduced zzso zzso in control but not in zzso muscle indicating that the lower zzso likely results from lower zzso and/or zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the zzso response, rats were made zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso for 5 d had no effects on insulin levels, zzso zzso of insulin receptors or zzso or the zzso of zzso In conclusion, zzso skeletal muscle is characterized zzso zzso decreased total zzso zzso of insulin receptors as a result of a reduction in the pool of receptors undergoing zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso content and reduced zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso appears to be essential for the development of these zzso
