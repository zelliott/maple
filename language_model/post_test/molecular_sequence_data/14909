To reveal the zzso mechanism of B8 strain to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tagging method and zzso walking were deployed to clone zzso related fragments around zzso zzso site in the zzso strain zzso The function of zzso regulatory sequence of gene zzso involved in the zzso activity was further identified by gene knocking out zzso An zzso related left zzso of zzso zzso site, 2 zzso zzso in zzso was obtained by tagging with Kan resistance gene of zzso A 2 354 zzso right zzso of zzso zzso site was amplified with 2 rounds of zzso zzso The length of the B zzso around the zzso zzso site was 4 611 zzso containing 7 open reading frames zzso zzso analysis revealed that these zzso corresponded to the partial coding regions of zzso zzso two zzso family zzso regulators, hypothetical protein zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and partial sequence of zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was inserted in the zzso of 200 zzso or zzso zzso of the sequence corresponding to zzso zzso or zzso gene on zzso zzso The zzso and B-2 zzso that lost zzso activity were selected by zzso zzso technology in association with knocking out zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso and expression of zzso gene might be disrupted as a result of the knocking out of zzso regulatory sequence by zzso in zzso strain, further causing zzso regulation of the zzso related gene zzso Thus, the zzso related genes in B8 strain is a gene family similar as zzso zzso gene zzso and the upstream regulatory region appears to be critical for the antibiotics zzso
