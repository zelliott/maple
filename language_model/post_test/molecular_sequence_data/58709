Members of the Ras zzso of zzso zzso proteins have been shown to be essential in specific steps of zzso transport and zzso in widely divergent zzso We report here the characterization of a gene from zzso zzso zzso a deduced zzso acid zzso sequence belonging to the zzso class of zzso zzso zzso products shown in other organisms to be essential for zzso transport between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso sequences of this zzso zzso indicates that it contains five zzso one in the zzso zzso All zzso are typical in beginning with zzso and ending with zzso The region of the zzso start point displays a number of features characteristic of zzso and other zzso but it does not contain zzso or zzso zzso A single transcript is produced from the zzso which is zzso but the gene does not contain a recognizable zzso zzso zzso DNA blots indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso sequences indicate that zzso zzso is more closely related to algae and higher plants than to the true zzso The protein product of the zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, zzso with zzso against zzso zzso protein and binds zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene is able to functionally complement a zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and functional attributes of zzso make it likely that it is an authentic zzso gene which zzso in zzso transport in zzso zzso
