Growth zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and frequently contain not only zzso zzso but also variable numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sections of 59 surgically removed zzso and/or zzso zzso classified by zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso were studied using in zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and combined with zzso for the coded zzso zzso zzso (10 densely and 10 sparsely zzso zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso contained both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 4 densely and 4 sparsely zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso only zzso zzso and its product were zzso In 28 cases (6 densely and 6 sparsely zzso zzso zzso 10 mixed zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso were present, although no zzso zzso was not in 2 densely zzso zzso zzso In these cases, zzso for zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso revealed the presence of variable numbers of zzso In 9 zzso stem cell zzso only zzso zzso and its product were zzso one zzso expressed both zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso Nine zzso zzso contained only zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results show that zzso and/or zzso zzso content could not be correlated with zzso for coded proteins and zzso zzso The zzso were more numerous using zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso are closely related and they can be considered to represent one basic zzso type originating in a cell committed to zzso zzso This may undergo zzso differentiation towards a zzso and further to the zzso zzso The results also indicate that zzso zzso arise in a cell committed to zzso zzso zzso stem cell zzso seem to be more closely related to zzso cells than zzso
