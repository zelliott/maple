zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disorder characterized by weakness of the anterior compartment of the lower zzso sparing the zzso zzso Recently, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene have been identified as the genetic basis of zzso To investigate the zzso spectrum of the zzso gene in Korean patients with zzso we performed clinical and genetic analysis of nine unrelated patients suspected to have zzso zzso sequencing analysis revealed that eight out of nine patients zzso were either zzso or compound zzso for zzso gene zzso including three known zzso zzso and zzso and two novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that screening for zzso gene zzso in patients suspected to have zzso would be helpful for molecular diagnosis of zzso in the Korean zzso
