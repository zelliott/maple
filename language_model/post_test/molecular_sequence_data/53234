The zzso zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso a member of the commercially important group of zzso bacteria, was cloned and zzso An expression library of zzso linens genes was constructed and a zzso of the zzso cluster was obtained by functional zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso screening transformed cells for production of a yellow zzso zzso screening of a zzso library resulted in the cloning of the whole zzso cluster from zzso zzso All genes necessary for the synthesis of the aromatic zzso zzso were identified on the basis of sequence zzso In addition a novel type of lycopene zzso was identified by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso named zzso zzso and zzso zzso which code for zzso of 125 and 107 zzso zzso respectively, are necessary to convert lycopene to zzso The zzso acid sequences of these zzso show no similarity to any of the known lycopene zzso This is the first example of a zzso zzso conversion in which two different gene products are involved, probably forming a zzso
