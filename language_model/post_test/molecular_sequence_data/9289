The zzso apparatus is composed of proteins zzso by genes from both the nuclear and the zzso zzso The activities of the nuclear and zzso zzso must therefore be closely coordinated through zzso zzso The zzso produce multiple retrograde signals at different times of their development, and in response to changes in the zzso These signals regulate the expression of zzso photosynthesis genes to match the current status of the zzso Using forward zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso component involved in zzso retrograde zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated a zzso of zzso nuclear gene expression in response to excess light, and an zzso of zzso electron zzso As a consequence of the zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso displayed a high zzso zzso with significant zzso of zzso II, indicated by a reduced variable to zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized to the zzso and zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso is required for full expression of genes transcribed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso with impaired zzso activity also demonstrated a zzso of zzso and zzso expression in response to excess light, suggesting a direct role for zzso activity in zzso retrograde zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso is part of the zzso machinery, and that the zzso complex responds to zzso electron transport and generates a retrograde zzso enabling the plant to zzso the expression of zzso genes from both the nuclear and zzso zzso
