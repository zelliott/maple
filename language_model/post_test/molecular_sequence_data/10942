We have examined neutral zzso zzso expression in embryonic zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso brain employing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (both zzso zzso and zzso directed toward specific zzso Several previously unknown zzso zzso zzso or zzso 4) zzso have been zzso Four zzso have been zzso and characterized as zzso or zzso zzso beta zzso zzso alpha zzso or Lewis X zzso and a novel zzso beta zzso A few transient bands appear at different zzso zzso Several fast zzso zzso have also been identified during the early phase of active zzso and tentatively characterized as derivatives of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in adult zzso brain shows unique and specific cellular zzso of these zzso zzso
