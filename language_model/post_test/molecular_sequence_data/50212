The dynamics of zzso turnover were studied in zzso whose zzso structures consist of zzso zzso sequences of two distinct repeats zzso and zzso Independent zzso clones containing a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso both before and after a rare zzso event took place, were obtained from zzso zzso populations and zzso The zzso which splits the original zzso and causes a significant reduction in the size of the zzso structure, is shown to consist of an zzso number of zzso repeats typical of zzso flanked on both sides by zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso repeat sequence zzso in the otherwise homogeneous populations zzso is compatible with a model in which diversification of a given zzso is driven by the occurrence of zzso whose frequency rapidly increases along the zzso tract when moving in the outward zzso The zzso might be due either to terminal deletions followed by random serial addition of the two repeat versions, or to zzso zzso The zzso mechanism is zzso against the zzso hypothesis because of the absence of zzso patterns in the sequence of zzso zzso
