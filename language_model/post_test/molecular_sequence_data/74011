A novel zzso origin zzso from a zzso mercury resistance zzso zzso 304 zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was restricted to one of five genetically distinct classes zzso I) of narrow host range, zzso that persist as a genetic component of the zzso community indigenous to the zzso of sugar zzso The zzso of zzso was located within a unique sequence of 300 zzso which initiated the replication of zzso derived suicide zzso in zzso zzso zzso The limited size of the DNA sequence required to initiate zzso and the presence of two zzso zzso directly repeated zzso indicate that this group of zzso contain a single origin of zzso which zzso replication via a zzso dependent rolling circle zzso
