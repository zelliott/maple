We have investigated the relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso plus zzso zzso induced zzso detected by zzso or by labeled zzso production and by a specific zzso against zzso zzso zzso of zzso B (a zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso in NO production by zzso whereas zzso (a zzso zzso zzso inhibited it only by zzso and not zzso zzso of zzso B together with zzso abolished zzso and zzso zzso as well as the amount of zzso zzso in activated zzso Moreover, addition of zzso B 6 or 12 h after zzso also decreased the zzso and zzso production by zzso although zzso zzso content by Western zzso was the same in the presence or in the absence of zzso B added 12 h after zzso Since zzso B failed to inhibit zzso activity directly, its zzso effects on NO production by zzso is likely to be zzso through zzso network in central regions of cells, but not in filaments seen at zzso or edging zzso Our findings demonstrate that disruption of zzso but not of zzso prevents the zzso induction process and zzso its zzso activity in activated zzso
