Ten zzso zzso zzso differing in zzso acid content, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso of EPO, were obtained from baby zzso kidney zzso zzso human EPO by zzso Q column zzso The mean zzso values of the EPO zzso determined by zzso zzso systematically shifted from zzso to zzso coinciding with the zzso acid content, without a change in the constitution of zzso zzso zzso of each zzso Although a linear relationship between the in zzso zzso and the zzso acid content of the zzso samples was observed until zzso zzso zzso of EPO, there was no further increase in their activity over zzso zzso zzso of zzso On the other hand, an inverse relationship between the in zzso zzso and zzso acid content of EPO was zzso Also, we showed that the in zzso zzso of some zzso with low zzso acid contents was increased after treatment with alpha zzso but the in zzso zzso of the other zzso with high zzso acid contents was either decreased or not zzso
