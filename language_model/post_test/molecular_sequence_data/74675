zzso zzso indicate a key role for regulatory T cells zzso on the host response to zzso The zzso tumor zzso zzso is zzso in several human zzso and thus considered as promising target for development of leukemia zzso However, recent studies indicated that the generation of effective zzso zzso T cells can be largely affected by the presence of zzso We have generated zzso lines and clones that specifically recognized a zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso they recognized zzso fresh zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso These clones exerted a T helper 2 zzso profile, had a zzso zzso zzso and significantly inhibited the zzso activity of zzso T cells independently of cell zzso zzso of zzso T cells in the presence of zzso strongly inhibited the expansion of natural killer zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells and had an zzso effect on zzso T zzso activity but not on zzso T zzso Furthermore, zzso of T cells with the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso strongly inhibited the induction of zzso zzso zzso responses as evidenced by both very low zzso activity and zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso clones specifically produced zzso B and selectively induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have also detected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in five of eight zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso our in zzso and in zzso findings strongly suggest important implications for the clinical manipulation of zzso in cancer zzso
