The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso surface protein A zzso are major zzso of zzso that are zzso variable and capable of zzso protective immune zzso By genetically switching the zzso genes of the capsule type 2 strain zzso and the capsule type 3 strain zzso we showed that the different abilities of zzso to zzso to protect against these strains was not related to the zzso type zzso Similarly, the level of specific zzso binding to zzso other surface zzso and zzso zzso did not depend on the zzso type but instead was correlated with the capsule zzso The type 3 strain zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso that expresses the type 3 capsule bound nearly identical amounts of zzso to zzso and other surface zzso and these amounts were less than one-half the amount observed with the type 2 parent strain zzso zzso of the type 3 capsule in zzso also reduced the amount of zzso deposited and its accessibility to zzso resulting in a level intermediate between the levels observed with zzso and zzso Despite these effects, the capsule type was not the determining factor in zzso protection, as both zzso and its zzso expressing the type 3 capsule were more resistant to protection than zzso The specific combination of zzso and capsule type also did not determine the level of zzso The capsule structure is thus a major zzso in accessibility of surface zzso to zzso but certain strains appear to express other factors that can influence zzso zzso
