The DNA zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in low zzso In zzso binding analysis to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue sections demonstrated that domain zzso zzso bound along the zzso of the zzso zzso indicating that this zzso retains binding functionality in the absence of domain zzso zzso of domain zzso to the zzso brush border membrane proteins from zzso zzso larvae indicated that zzso toxin and domain zzso bind to the same 150 zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin binds to 200 and 120 zzso zzso and domain zzso only binds to the 200 zzso zzso Finally, binding zzso with isolated brush border membrane zzso showed that the interaction of domain zzso with the membrane zzso is highly zzso supporting the proposition that the integration of domain I into the membrane could participate in the irreversible binding of the zzso These studies confirm that this part of the toxin is involved in binding interactions and could be separated as a discrete zzso that zzso at least part of its zzso
