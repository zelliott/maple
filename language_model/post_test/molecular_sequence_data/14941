zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer from zzso to zzso to zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso from several sources can use zzso as alternative zzso to zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso reached with the zzso zzso are approximately 50% of those displayed with the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only reported zzso zzso displaying higher activity with zzso and lower affinities for the zzso zzso To zzso the molecular basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso selectivity for zzso a zzso analysis was carried out on a zzso model based on zzso structures of zzso and pig zzso zzso Some zzso acid zzso involved in the zzso ring binding site not previously described were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene for the corresponding zzso acid zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso proteins were zzso zzso analysis of the zzso showed that the single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased their zzso efficiencies zzso with zzso as a result of both, increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso Furthermore, a higher zzso efficiency in the double zzso zzso was zzso which was mainly due to an increased affinity for zzso with a zzso diminished affinity for zzso The main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso involved in the selectivity for zzso zzso were thus zzso
