The zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso activate zzso zzso in distinct zzso zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso and zzso active sites, whereas zzso only activates the zzso zzso zzso The three zzso zzso differ in zzso sequences that are located next to zzso zzso on their zzso binding zzso To assess the importance of these zzso sequences in the zzso of specific zzso beta zzso zzso we characterized zzso in which 8 or 12 zzso were exchanged among the three zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso zzso activated all three zzso zzso zzso regardless of the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso activated the zzso at lower zzso than zzso zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso were needed for zzso zzso because exchanged zzso sequences can stabilize zzso or destabilize zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso were equivalent to zzso in their zzso properties, but they bound the zzso less tightly than the zzso zzso zzso zzso also bound the zzso more zzso than zzso zzso and were virtually unable to activate zzso Our findings demonstrate that the zzso sequences of zzso zzso can affect zzso stability and zzso zzso but they do not determine which zzso beta zzso become zzso
