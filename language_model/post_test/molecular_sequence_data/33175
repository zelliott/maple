An zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso enrichment culture from zzso hot spring located within the Black Rock Desert zzso zzso zzso were generally straight or slightly bent zzso zzso zzso in zzso and 3-6 zzso in length during exponential zzso zzso from stationary phase were variable in size and shape, showing curved or bent zzso zzso was not seen and zzso were not observed in electron zzso zzso was not zzso zzso zzso stained zzso but is zzso zzso zzso Growth occurred at zzso degrees zzso zzso with optimum growth at pH zzso no growth occurred at pH zzso or above or at zzso or zzso With zzso or zzso as the carbon source, strain zzso grew at zzso degrees zzso no growth occurred at 76 degrees C or above or at 42 degrees C or zzso However, the optimum temperature was 62 and 66 degrees C when grown on zzso and zzso zzso The shortest doubling time observed with zzso was approximately 4 zzso and with zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerated an atmosphere containing up to zzso % zzso no growth occurred at a gas atmosphere of zzso % zzso zzso growth occurred with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When grown in mineral media containing 1 g zzso extract zzso as an electron zzso zzso and sulfur were reduced to zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis placed strain zzso within the order zzso and within the zzso zzso zzso Family III, specifically between zzso classified within the zzso zzso and zzso The closest zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wagner, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mills, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso Based on zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to represent the type strain of a novel species in a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
