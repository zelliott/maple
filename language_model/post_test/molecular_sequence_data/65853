The human zzso type 16 zzso zzso zzso protein is very poorly expressed from zzso expression plasmids zzso zzso into zzso zzso The results described zzso demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso expression from zzso zzso zzso with the presence of zzso regulatory sequences in the zzso coding zzso This zzso effect zzso with the binding of zzso A1 to the zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso sites that may retain zzso in the nucleus, regulatory zzso zzso elements may also inhibit gene expression in the absence of zzso The results presented here explain the inefficient expression of zzso zzso protein from the wild type zzso zzso expression plasmids in zzso zzso These results may be of general interest since zzso of zzso sequences to prevent unwanted zzso interactions may increase expression of many different genes in transient zzso or after zzso zzso in DNA vaccination zzso
