The association zzso of zzso syndrome zzso predictably and prematurely zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Hence studies of zzso are potentially useful in defining the earliest zzso events in Alzheimer's disease zzso Previous reports have described altered expression of several zzso in zzso zzso but the zzso stage at which expression of these zzso begins to zzso from the norm has not been zzso We have examined this issue in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso known to be altered in zzso cortex, was studied by Northern analysis, comparing frontal zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso controls and with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso including transcripts expressed zzso in zzso zzso light zzso and zzso precursor zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were increased in zzso zzso as zzso Except in the zzso case with extensive zzso zzso zzso was expressed at levels significantly below the control, suggesting that zzso 21 exerts a zzso effect on zzso gene zzso We found no instance in which zzso changes of transcript expression preceded the appearance of zzso zzso The findings indicate that in zzso 21, certain changes of zzso prevalence previously described for zzso zzso are not a necessary zzso to zzso zzso
