The zzso zzso zzso has been used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by zzso However, many zzso bacteria show zzso zzso Several zzso resistance genes have been identified, and these genes mediate responses to diverse zzso zzso but the mechanisms underlying their functions are zzso To shed light on the function of zzso a zzso zzso resistance protein from a zzso of zzso pneumoniae, we have determined its three-dimensional structure in solution using zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso formed by two zzso zzso and six short zzso The structure exhibits two negative clusters in loop regions on the top of the zzso suggesting that zzso may bind metal zzso Indeed, zzso zzso experiments monitored by circular zzso and zzso studies reveal that zzso binds zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso shows that the binding ratio of zzso to zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso monitored by one-dimensional zzso yield estimated zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for the two zzso sites of zzso zzso structures incorporating two zzso zzso define a novel zzso zzso motif that is predicted to be highly zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso sites are also predicted to be present in two additional zzso resistance zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that some form of zzso signaling plays a crucial role in zzso resistance and in other responses of bacteria to multiple external stimuli that depend on the zzso zzso
