It has become clear that a given cell type can zzso and zzso affect the expression of the zzso growth factor B zzso gene at multiple zzso In a previous report, we showed that zzso zzso region has a zzso modulating activity during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso This study points to the mechanism used for this zzso zzso The unusual zzso leader, which zzso a major barrier to conventional zzso zzso was found to contain an internal zzso entry site that becomes more potent in zzso cells and was termed zzso internal zzso entry site zzso The zzso element defines a functional role for the cumbersome zzso zzso leader and accounts for its zzso evolutionary zzso zzso The zzso enhancement of internal translation, which provides an additional step to the fine tuning of zzso gene zzso might be employed by numerous critical regulatory genes with unusual zzso leaders and might have widespread implications for cellular growth and zzso
