zzso zzso zzso zzso function as zzso sensors that selectively bind zzso oxide zzso triggering reactions essential to animal zzso Recent discoveries place zzso in the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso which includes bacterial proteins from zzso and zzso zzso Some zzso proteins tightly bind oxygen zzso whereas others show no measurable affinity for zzso providing the basis for selective NO signaling in zzso zzso Using a series of zzso and zzso zzso we established a molecular basis for zzso zzso A zzso pocket zzso is requisite for zzso binding in the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso uses a kinetic selection against zzso we propose that the zzso zzso rate in the absence of this zzso is fast and that a stable zzso complex does not zzso
