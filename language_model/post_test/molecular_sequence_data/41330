zzso zzso possesses two distinct DNA repair zzso zzso and zzso that have been identified by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso triple zzso deficient in the ability to repair zzso (AP) sites and DNA strand breaks with blocked zzso While zzso zzso directly zzso zzso sites and removes zzso groups, such characterization has not been previously reported for zzso We recently documented that zzso zzso zzso for zzso is unable to maintain integrity of the zzso Despite the presence of zzso the zzso zzso animals are also defective in the division of the zzso zzso an observation consistent with the zzso of zzso DNA zzso suggesting a unique role for zzso DNA repair zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed as zzso protein in zzso zzso only when it carries a nuclear zzso zzso and with this requirement rescued the DNA repair defects of the zzso zzso zzso triple zzso We zzso the zzso from the zzso expression system and established that it displays zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we showed that zzso also possesses a zzso to zzso and the zzso incision repair zzso This latter activity is capable of directly zzso DNA at the zzso of various zzso damaged zzso as previously observed for zzso coli zzso IV and zzso zzso zzso zzso the importance of this family of zzso in removing these types of zzso zzso substitution of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso corresponding to zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso in the active site pocket of zzso coli zzso IV, resulted in an inactive zzso that lose the ability to rescue the DNA repair defects of zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso did not sustain zzso and yielded a truncated zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso may have a broader role in maintaining the structure of the zzso
