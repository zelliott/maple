A zzso molecular dynamics simulation has been performed on a fully zzso complex of zzso with the B DNA zzso zzso The simulation indicates a possible mechanism by which zzso might induce the formation of a left-handed zzso the B to Z zzso zzso was initially located in the major groove, hydrogen bonded to the zzso During the simulation the zzso zzso deeper into the DNA, maintaining strong hydrogen bonding to the central zzso bases and destroying the zzso base pairing with their respective zzso zzso rotation of these and other zzso bases was observed, in part due to interactions of the zzso with the zzso chains of zzso An intermediate zzso zzso might be of importance in this zzso
