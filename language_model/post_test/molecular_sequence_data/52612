Despite the zzso nature of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso gag zzso multiple zzso of the zzso gene coexist in zzso zzso We cloned and zzso 31 zzso genes from four zzso zzso The zzso zzso between the zzso genes ranged from zzso to zzso whereas the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes were evenly distributed in the zzso zzso with 27 and zzso respectively, located within host human zzso zzso class I recognition zzso This would suggest only a minor influence from the host zzso zzso response on the evolution of the zzso zzso The importance of minor variations within zzso was analyzed by designing zzso zzso from two distinct zzso zzso genes simultaneously derived from one zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice, a clear influence from the host major zzso complex was noted on the immune responses, fully consistent with those noted when a zzso zzso protein is used as the zzso The two zzso DNA zzso did not differ in their zzso indicating that the limited genetic zzso zzso had little influence on the immune zzso
