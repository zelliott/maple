We have previously identified a zzso binding site zzso of a zzso factor involved in zzso and zzso gene zzso We now zzso the potential factors interacting with the pros and characterized their zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso DNA affinity zzso zzso zzso shift zzso zzso zzso zzso and transient zzso 

Several proteins bound to the pros site, but only upstream zzso factor 2 zzso was confirmed to be part of the zzso factor zzso zzso interaction was detected between zzso and the zzso factor zzso Physical proximity between the zzso response element zzso and the pros was shown to be important for their zzso In the presence of pros and zzso zzso achieves its zzso efficiency even at low zzso 

The protein complex binding to the zzso site does not have a significant independent function, but may interact with zzso if zzso is physically close to the ARE and enhances the zzso function of zzso
