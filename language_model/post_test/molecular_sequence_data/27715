We have isolated bovine lens intrinsic membrane proteins zzso having molecular masses of 19, 21 and 23 zzso Limited zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso portion of each of these zzso revealed a zzso zzso in sequence for the number of zzso determined (20 zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of bovine lens zzso using a labeled zzso zzso probe common to the zzso acid sequence of these three peptides revealed a single band having an apparent molecular size of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest a genetic zzso between these zzso
