zzso zzso is a zzso produced by activated zzso and mast cells that is active on a broad range of zzso cells and in the nervous system and appears to be important in several chronic inflammatory zzso In this study, zzso zzso were used to investigate the role of zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We show that the domain 1 zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso are important for high affinity zzso binding and zzso zzso as shown previously for the related zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor, which also signal through this zzso zzso From the zzso structure of zzso it is clear that the domain 1 zzso cooperate with domain 4 zzso to form a novel zzso interface involving the two protein chains of the intertwined zzso zzso We demonstrate by zzso that the zzso zzso is also a zzso Its high sequence zzso with zzso suggests that their structures are zzso and we identified an analogous binding interface in zzso for direct zzso binding to the high affinity binding site in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of domain 1; zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of domain 4 were shown to have critical individual roles and zzso and zzso major secondary roles in direct zzso zzso binding to the zzso Most surprising, none of the key zzso for direct zzso binding were critical for high affinity binding in the presence of the zzso zzso alpha zzso indicating a fundamentally different mechanism of high affinity binding to that used by zzso
