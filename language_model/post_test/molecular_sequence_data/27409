zzso from pathogens have been implicated in evasion of the host immune zzso We identified a new zzso protein zzso analyzed its zzso and detected using Western zzso 

zzso zzso proteins with an expect score less than 1 zzso zzso were checked against zzso database zzso by Local zzso Search zzso search and confirmed with Database of zzso Families and zzso Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the zzso The sequence zzso the mature protein was amplified by zzso cloned into the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso generated against the zzso protein was used in zzso zzso 

A new zzso zzso named zzso was identified form zzso zzso zzso The coding sequence of this gene is 1155 zzso length with a putative signal zzso and contains the zzso zzso zzso A specific band of approximately 45 zzso was recognized by the zzso zzso 

The finding of zzso in zzso zzso raises new questions about their possible role in zzso which deserves further zzso
