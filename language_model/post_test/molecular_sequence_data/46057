zzso of microbial zzso by pattern recognition receptors triggers the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso synthesis and its deposition on the surface of invading zzso Several zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be involved in the zzso zzso in zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was found and isolated as a zzso protein from zzso of the freshwater zzso zzso zzso by its binding property to a partially zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso Two other zzso the zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso were also found in the several different zzso zzso However no zzso zzso was zzso Neither was any putative zzso found after searching available zzso sequence zzso If zzso interference of zzso zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso tissue cell culture was performed, it resulted in lower PO activity following zzso of the zzso by soluble zzso zzso Taken together, we report for the first time that zzso zzso is a trigger of zzso zzso in a zzso and that two zzso are involved in this zzso possibly by forming a complex with zzso and without a zzso
