Although zzso zzso affects zzso of the total population, the relationship between the protein structure and zzso activity of the zzso is still largely zzso We observed that group 5 grass zzso are characterized by repeated structural zzso Using a new algorithm, zzso we predicted zzso zzso zzso within the repeated motifs of the zzso zzso zzso from rye zzso In zzso binding studies confirmed the zzso binding characteristics of these zzso Moreover, most of the predicted zzso were novel T cell zzso that were able to stimulate T cells from zzso zzso We generated a panel of zzso zzso T cell zzso the majority of which recognized the peptides in a zzso zzso The zzso prediction of DR zzso might thus allow the design of T cell zzso with potential useful application in novel zzso zzso
