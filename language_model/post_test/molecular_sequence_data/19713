We report here the crystal structure of a protein from zzso zzso zzso that represents the first characterized heat shock zzso factor in zzso zzso specifically zzso the expression of heat shock genes at zzso temperature in zzso and in zzso but is released from the promoters upon heat shock zzso zzso analysis revealed a stable zzso each zzso consisting of an zzso winged zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso coiled zzso zzso zzso The overall structure shows as a molecular zzso with significant folding similarity of its zzso to the bacterial zzso family, while its zzso part was found to be a remote zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein recognizes a zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses suggested a novel binding mode in which the major specific contacts occur at the minor groove interacting with the strongly basic wing containing a cluster of three zzso zzso
