The zinc finger zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso in zzso and zzso where it has been shown to mediate zzso insulation at a zzso zzso A mode of genetic regulation that involves zzso and zzso binding proteins to establish independent zzso units is currently not known in zzso including zzso zzso We therefore searched in zzso for zzso of proteins that are involved in zzso zzso 

While zzso for other zzso proteins were absent in all 35 zzso zzso species, we find zzso of zzso in a subset of zzso As an example for these we cloned the zzso zzso zzso gene and revealed a zzso structure very similar to the zzso zzso To investigate the pattern of zzso occurrence in zzso we performed zzso analysis with the zzso protein sets of completely zzso zzso We show that three zzso proteins from three zzso zzso cluster together with known zzso proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of zzso zzso and other derived zzso does zzso 

Our findings show that zzso and possibly zzso insulation are present in zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso protein zzso has been zzso lost in derived zzso like zzso zzso We propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during zzso evolution, from the common zzso and insect type involving zzso acting regulatory elements and zzso insulation to a so far poorly zzso mode present in more derived zzso Here, all or some of these components are zzso Instead zzso zzso zzso units common in derived zzso seemingly adopted their zzso
