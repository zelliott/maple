The zzso of predatory marine snails zzso zzso contain diverse zzso of zzso toxins with high potency and selectivity for a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the chemical and functional characterization of three novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso Each toxin was observed as an approximately zzso protein by zzso size exclusion zzso and zzso After reduction, the zzso sequences were determined by zzso degradation chemistry and tandem zzso Combining the sequence data together with zzso and zzso data revealed that in solution these toxins are zzso of paired zzso zzso The toxin zzso exhibited a novel arrangement of 10 zzso zzso zzso and additional zzso modifications contributed zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso clamp analyses showed that zzso zzso and zzso are potent zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso with selectivity for zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso represent a fifth and highly divergent structural class of zzso targeting zzso
