To explore the pathogen and molecular basis of zzso zzso in a zzso 

zzso was collected from a patient, male, aged 56, with zzso zzso zzso zzso markers were zzso tested, and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso determined zzso zzso DNA in serum was zzso tested using zzso and zzso using zzso quantitative zzso S gene was zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso were negative, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA were all zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso An uncommon point zzso at zzso 336 zzso to zzso in S gene was found, resulting in the change of the 61st zzso into a novel stop zzso and failure of synthesis of zzso 

zzso proves the pathogen of this zzso This special zzso well explains the patient's unusual zzso zzso Moreover, this finding possesses important clinical and theoretical zzso
