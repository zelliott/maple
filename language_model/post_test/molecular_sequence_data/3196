Human zzso hormone zzso is a zzso natural zzso for the human zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, the smaller zzso encompassing the zzso ring and zzso of zzso zzso zzso binds to and activates equally well both human zzso receptors present in the zzso To separate the zzso functions of zzso from those of zzso new potent and zzso selective zzso are zzso In the present study, zzso of zzso were prepared and tested in binding and functional zzso on cells expressing the zzso zzso In these zzso zzso in position 6 was replaced with various zzso acids and/or zzso in position 10 was zzso with various zzso zzso Several of the new compounds turned out to be potent zzso at zzso with improved selectivity over zzso For example, zzso 26 with zzso in place of zzso in position 6 and zzso in place of zzso in position 10, zzso was a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso with more than zzso selectivity with respect to zzso Apparently, these structural changes in positions 6 and 10 results in zzso zzso that allow for efficient interactions with zzso but are zzso for molecular recognition at zzso
