The zzso stability of a protein plays an important role during evolution and adaptation in order to maintain a folded and active zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the regulation of numerous zzso Human zzso has an unusually low zzso stability and is frequently zzso by zzso zzso zzso Here, we examined the zzso and kinetic stability of zzso DNA binding zzso from selected zzso and zzso species by differential scanning zzso and equilibrium zzso zzso There is a correlation in the apparent melting temperature of zzso with the body temperature of zzso zzso We found that zzso from these organisms has a zzso for spontaneous unfolding at zzso body temperature of zzso zzso We also found that zzso from zzso has higher stability, bearing more resemblance towards zzso and zzso from zzso Using zzso zzso on the human zzso scaffold, we demonstrated that the zzso acid changes on the protein surface and in the protein interior lead to the elevated stability of zzso zzso We propose a model in which the zzso DNA binding domain has been shaped by the complex interplay of different selective pressures and underwent zzso evolution leading to pronounced effects on its zzso zzso from zzso has evolved to have a low zzso stability and similarly short spontaneous zzso at zzso body temperature, which is related to zzso
