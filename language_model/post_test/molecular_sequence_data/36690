The zzso highly toxic components of death cap zzso mushrooms, bind strongly to zzso zzso II (or zzso in cell zzso thus preventing the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso the precursors of zzso zzso Three of the binding sites of the zzso zzso have been zzso an zzso side chain in position 6, a zzso group at zzso in position 2 and a zzso zzso side chain in position zzso No information exists about the zzso conditions at the zzso zzso 3) of this side zzso We have now zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso in position 3, zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso In the last zzso besides the zzso zzso zzso 4, an zzso zzso was zzso The affinities for zzso zzso zzso II were 100 times weaker as compared to zzso for 1, 10 times weaker for 2, 200 times weaker for 3, 100 times weaker for 4, and more than 1000 times weaker for zzso The results point to the importance of a zzso group in zzso at the zzso atom of side chain zzso
