A zzso clone zzso an zzso fatty acid binding zzso zzso protein was isolated from a gut zzso library of zzso zzso It contained a 423 zzso open reading frame corresponding to a deduced protein of 140 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso fell outside the zzso zzso of fatty acid binding proteins zzso being positioned at the base of the zzso zzso and was almost equally zzso to various zzso zzso suggesting that it may be the archetype of zzso zzso Both northern zzso and in zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso and although at a much lower level, it was also present in the zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso in zzso zzso revealed that zzso was initially expressed in the zzso two thirds of the primitive gut, including the zzso where the zzso zzso will form later, in zzso zzso The expression pattern is closely similar to that of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso supporting the hypothesis that the zzso zzso in the zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso
