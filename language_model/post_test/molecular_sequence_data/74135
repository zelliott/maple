zzso precursors are the building blocks of zzso on the surface of zzso zzso however, the assembly mechanisms of these adhesive fibers are zzso Here, we describe the chemical bonds that assemble zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso precursor between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of its zzso sorting signal and zzso formation of an zzso bond between zzso zzso of the sorting signal and zzso zzso in the zzso motif of another zzso zzso Three zzso B zzso of zzso generate zzso zzso bonds, and one of these contributes also to zzso zzso Conservation of zzso and structural elements in zzso precursors in zzso bacteria suggests a universal mechanism of fiber zzso
