zzso zzso in the zinc finger domain of zzso essential zzso zzso cause zzso zzso syndrome with zzso zzso zzso Here we report that patient B cells are characterized by an absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and defective class switch zzso zzso despite normal induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This indicates that AID expression alone is insufficient to support zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that patient B cells zzso with zzso zzso are impaired in both zzso and zzso zzso and whereas addition of zzso can enhance zzso activity, zzso activity remains zzso This suggests that these zzso components have different zzso requirements and that zzso can augment some but not all zzso zzso zzso Finally, using zzso analysis of patient B cells we identified downstream effects of impaired zzso zzso and candidate factors that may be necessary for zzso and zzso in B zzso
