A soluble form of a mouse class I major zzso zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso These molecules were efficiently zzso (up to 4 zzso as zzso zzso and zzso to zzso from cell zzso The isolated soluble zzso molecules were devoid of zzso zzso Using these zzso we have characterized the zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly as well as zzso binding in zzso In zzso solution the heavy chains readily zzso with beta zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso binding is rapid and zzso and dependent on the heavy chains being assembled with beta zzso Likewise, zzso zzso from zzso molecules without the displacement of beta zzso zzso binding experiments using various peptides confirmed that zzso bind to zzso molecules with the highest affinity and form the most stable zzso However, in contrast to earlier studies, the zzso positioning of zzso to zzso molecules was more crucial than the zzso positioning and zzso of the zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso molecules could selectively bind zzso peptides among a mixture of randomly zzso zzso in zzso however, no dominant zzso was observed at the zzso zzso of bound zzso This suggests that the previously observed zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of peptides may reflect the specificity of zzso or zzso involved in zzso processing in zzso
