The zzso portion of the rat insulin I gene zzso DNA contains two sequence zzso the Far and zzso zzso that can function in zzso but not zzso as a zzso zzso zzso We have isolated several zzso zzso proteins that bind to the zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso represent zzso box containing zzso with restricted patterns of zzso The protein zzso by zzso also contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso can activate zzso of a zzso gene when expressed in a normally zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso the addition of the zzso basic zzso protein zzso (the zzso equivalent of human zzso causes a dramatic synergistic zzso zzso causes no zzso in zzso expressing zzso zzso or the related zzso protein zzso zzso of one or both of the zzso zzso from the zzso end of the zzso zzso removes this synergistic interaction with zzso without any loss of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso functions by binding to the zzso element and interacting through the zzso zzso zzso with zzso bound at the Far zzso These proteins form the minimal components for a functional zzso zzso
