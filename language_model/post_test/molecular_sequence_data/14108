We have identified regulatory regions of the zzso gene zzso that are capable of zzso a linked white zzso in a manner that is sensitive to zzso zzso Normally, the eye color of zzso containing white in a zzso zzso is affected by the number of copies of the zzso zzso flies have darker eyes than zzso However, we found that flies zzso for select zzso zzso zzso had lighter eyes than zzso Several zzso DNA fragments are capable of causing this pairing sensitive zzso negative regulation of zzso Two fragments in the upstream DNA of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso two zzso sites are located in the second zzso including a zzso region and zzso zzso This zzso is not observed when two zzso sites are located at different zzso zzso sites (in zzso transgenic zzso indicating that the zzso repression of white is dependent on the pairing or proximity of the zzso zzso The observed phenomenon is similar to zzso in which certain zzso of a gene can complement each other, but only when zzso zzso are zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso regions contain positive regulatory sequences for zzso whereas the upstream zzso sites contain zzso negative regulatory zzso
