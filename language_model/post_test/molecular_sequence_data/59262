We have isolated a full length zzso clone zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein from leaves of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso insert revealed that the open reading frame encodes a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso consists of a zzso zzso domain with two identical repeat motifs zzso The N zzso lacks zzso and is zzso Unlike other zzso proteins this protein contains five zzso repeat motifs zzso representative of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that zzso is a member of a small gene family within the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso experiments revealed that the zzso gene is significantly down regulated by water zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso to zzso in leaves and stems after zzso days of water zzso The zzso zzso when the zzso plants were zzso The in zzso zzso experiments also revealed that zzso zzso were more abundant in leaf sections of plants watered regularly compared with those of plants submitted to water zzso Down regulation of the zzso gene was also observed in desiccated cell suspensions of zzso zzso and in those treated with zzso acid, zzso and zzso Based on the common features of zzso proteins zzso zzso content, repeated zzso and a putative signal zzso and their involvement in the cell wall, it is likely that the zzso protein is targeted to the cell zzso Its down regulation by drought could be correlated with the zzso of the plant cell wall in response to water zzso
