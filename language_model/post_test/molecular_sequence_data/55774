The zzso are an extensive family of proteins whose cell zzso synthesis is zzso to control multiple events during the cell zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso begins at the start of S zzso In zzso cells, association with the zzso zzso suggests that zzso A complexes are important for DNA replication and regulating other zzso zzso required for S zzso We report here that a zzso promoter element previously shown to be important for the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso promoter in zzso cells is a cellular target of zzso A and the zzso zzso Though the zzso and other nuclear factor complexes exhibit zzso binding to the zzso zzso regulatory domain, the binding activity of a zzso zzso protein complex is greatly enhanced when the cells enter S phase, zzso with the increase in the zzso zzso levels and the replication of zzso The binding activity of the zzso A complex is maintained throughout S zzso zzso of the DNA sequences on either half of the zzso protein binding site results in the loss of its ability to compete efficiently in zzso for the zzso complexes, including that of zzso zzso zzso The loss of zzso binding for the zzso complexes also substantially reduces the zzso regulation of the zzso promoter in zzso Our results support the hypothesis that a zzso A complex, in association with the zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso
