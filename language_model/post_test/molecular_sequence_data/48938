The directional dependence of folding rates for zzso zzso such as parallel zzso zzso DNA zzso and collagen triple zzso is largely zzso This is mainly due to technical difficulties in measuring rates in different zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso These are usually located at the zzso zzso suggesting that triple zzso folding proceeds from the zzso to the zzso zzso Evidence is presented here that effective nucleation is possible at both ends of the zzso zzso zzso using designed proteins in which this zzso is fused either zzso or zzso to a nucleation domain, either zzso zzso or the zzso knot of type III zzso The location of the nucleation domain influences zzso stability, which might be explained by differences in the zzso sequences and the presence or absence of repulsive charges at the zzso end of the triple zzso Triple zzso folding rates are found to be independent of the site of nucleation and consistent with zzso zzso being the zzso zzso
