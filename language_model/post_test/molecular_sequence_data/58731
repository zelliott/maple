zzso is the zzso of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso transport of both, proteins and zzso and also in cell cycle zzso Here, we report a zzso zzso clone of zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It contains a zzso zzso untranslated region zzso with a G + zzso of zzso followed by a zzso open reading frame and a zzso 3' zzso preceding a zzso zzso zzso zzso shows differential patterns of expression in human zzso In addition to the zzso transcript present in all zzso and highly expressed in brain, zzso and zzso we found a second transcript of zzso zzso in zzso In order to analyze this shorter transcript, we screened a human zzso zzso zzso zzso library and cloned an alternatively zzso zzso zzso Taking the 3' zzso of zzso which lies downstream of the first zzso zzso as a probe in Northern zzso analysis, we confirmed that this second transcript found in zzso results from a distinct 3' zzso
