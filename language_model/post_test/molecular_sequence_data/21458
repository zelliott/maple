The multiple zzso resistance regulators zzso constitute a family of zzso zzso regulators abundantly distributed throughout the bacterial and zzso zzso Here we describe the identification and characterization of zzso as a new member of this family, in the zzso zzso zzso and report zzso zzso and zzso investigation of its stability and DNA binding zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso of zzso expression by aromatic compounds in the zzso growth phase and allowed the identification of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso possesses in solution a zzso structure and a high stability against both temperature and chemical zzso zzso the protein binds site specifically to its own promoter, zzso with a zzso binding affinity at two zzso sites overlapping zzso and the zzso start zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso members, are zzso of binding of DNA by zzso Moreover, two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso properly designed for obtaining information about the zzso and the DNA binding sites of the zzso have been produced and zzso The results point out an involvement of zzso in the regulation of the stress response to aromatic compounds and point to zzso 19 as a key zzso acid involved in protein zzso while the introduction of zzso 65 increases the DNA affinity of the zzso making it comparable with those of other members of the zzso zzso
