Two bacterial zzso designated strains zzso and zzso were recovered from air samples collected in zzso zzso zzso of both strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these strains were positioned within the radius of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that the strains shared zzso % sequence similarity and had sequence similarities of zzso % with respect to type strains of species belonging to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso tests, the two strains showed zzso % zzso with respect to strains of closely related species of the zzso zzso and 27 % zzso to each zzso Both strains contained zzso as the zzso zzso zzso and possessed summed feature 3 zzso zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso zzso zzso was found to contain the fatty acid zzso : zzso (in small zzso a feature that served to distinguish it from both zzso and recognized members of the zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data accumulated in this study revealed that zzso and zzso represent novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed, zzso
