The DNA sequences within the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso have been identified through deletion analysis and zzso of the zzso zzso and proper phasing of two zzso tandem sequences zzso separated by six zzso and overlapping with the zzso region of the zzso promoter, was essential for zzso zzso of a zzso fusion in zzso zzso The spacing between equivalent bases in each of the zzso is 21 zzso zzso two turns of DNA zzso The activity of zzso varieties containing identical zzso suggested that the zzso element is arranged as a direct zzso the zzso sequence being the one which provided the most stringent regulation when zzso The role of the repeats as the target for zzso binding to zzso is zzso
