zzso zzso response zzso zzso is an zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso protein that can both activate zzso mechanisms and inhibit zzso zzso zzso contains a highly zzso zzso region that serves as the primary recognition domain for a large number of binding zzso zzso is also tightly regulated by the aforementioned binding partners and by zzso zzso zzso data obtained in the present study indicate that zzso primarily comprises an zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the highly zzso zzso reveals low sequence complexity and enrichment in polar and charged zzso zzso The high zzso zzso and an increased zzso radius are consistent with a largely extended structure in zzso zzso zzso using CD and zzso also reveal characteristic features of intrinsic zzso Under zzso conditions, the data obtained show that zzso zzso via the zzso domain, forming a zzso zzso of zzso by zzso also resulted in loss of secondary zzso These results are consistent with the stabilization of the zzso motif through an zzso zzso
