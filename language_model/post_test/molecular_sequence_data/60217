To assess the genetic diversity in zzso zzso we have zzso the small zzso zzso zzso gene of seven zzso zzso various zzso of zzso zzso from eight zzso and a zzso isolate from a desert zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso sequences confirmed the zzso nature of the zzso zzso with at least four distinct species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other species previously defined by zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the desert monitor zzso clustered together or within zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso were present among zzso zzso zzso from humans, calves, zzso dogs, mice, zzso zzso and a zzso In general, specific zzso were associated with specific host zzso A zzso zzso length zzso technique previously developed by us could differentiate most zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but sequence analysis of the zzso product was needed to differentiate zzso zzso and zzso zzso from some of the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate a need for revision in the zzso and assessment of the zzso potential of some animal zzso zzso zzso
