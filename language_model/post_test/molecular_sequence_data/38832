zzso is an essential cell wall zzso synthesis of which is regulated throughout the cell cycle in the zzso zzso zzso We cloned an zzso zzso zzso zzso whose product is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso localized mainly in the 10,000 zzso g zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso fraction showed an zzso higher zzso transport activity in cells harboring a zzso zzso zzso than in cells harboring zzso zzso The activity distribution is identical with the protein distribution in zzso whether the gene is zzso or not, suggesting its native zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso further revealed zzso zzso The increase in transport activity due to the zzso zzso is specific for zzso but not for zzso and zzso zzso cells showed a reduced rate of zzso zzso contained less zzso and were larger and zzso in shape than the wild type zzso Our results indicate that zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso that is required for cell wall zzso synthesis in zzso zzso
