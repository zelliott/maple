The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is one of the best characterized of the bacterial positive regulators that enhance the zzso ability of zzso zzso zzso consisting of 239 zzso zzso binds to specific sequences located upstream of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso half of zzso consisting of about 120 zzso zzso exhibits an inherent zzso zzso To address the issue of DNA binding by zzso we selected a set of zzso zzso each of which has a single zzso acid substitution in the zzso half of zzso In particular, we characterized a number of zzso zzso which are defective in DNA binding and thereby result in an zzso zzso zzso Among them, a putative positive control zzso zzso was also zzso which appears to be defective in zzso zzso zzso but not in DNA zzso These results are discussed with general emphasis on DNA recognition by the zzso coli family of zzso regulatory zzso
