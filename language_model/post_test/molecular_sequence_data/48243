zzso monkeys and other nonhuman Old World primates are naturally infected with zzso zzso that are closely related to zzso virus zzso A zzso zzso isolate zzso was derived from a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso and a previous zzso zzso isolate zzso were zzso on zzso so the zzso genes from these two zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso genes have zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso and the differences are similar to those between the type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso zzso from a portion of the zzso gene which is extremely divergent among different zzso was virtually identical between the zzso and zzso zzso confirming a common zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso defines the presence of two different zzso zzso types, and both zzso zzso types were found to be prevalent in the zzso monkey population at the New England Regional zzso Research zzso The existence of two zzso zzso types suggests that the selective pressure for the evolution of two zzso types is shared by human and nonhuman zzso zzso
