Twist is a zzso factor that plays an important role in proliferation and zzso Twist is a nuclear protein that regulates a variety of cellular functions controlled by zzso interactions and gene zzso zzso The focus of this study was to characterize putative nuclear zzso signals zzso zzso and zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso and zzso we observed that altered zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso cells, while zzso zzso expression was zzso and retained to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso formed zzso and restored nuclear zzso despite the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso we identified a novel zzso candidate zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso confirmed using zzso rescue zzso where nuclear expression of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was also seen using standard zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrates the presence of two putative zzso motifs in zzso and suggests that these zzso sequences are zzso Furthermore, we identified and confirmed the interaction of zzso with a novel protein candidate zzso
