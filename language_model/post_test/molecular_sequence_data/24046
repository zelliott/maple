In experiment 1, specific pathogen free rats underwent zzso total body surface area burn or sham burn and were given zzso zzso zzso saline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or 50 zzso saline (nearly equal sodium load with zzso zzso in the right zzso vein for 15 zzso for fluid resuscitation at 0, 4, or 8 zzso after zzso In experiment 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso was given immediately after burn to rats from different groups as in experiment zzso At 24 zzso after burn, the zzso zzso was zzso for zzso activity and zzso zzso the distribution of zzso zzso across the zzso of the small zzso was determined, and bacterial zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso induced significant increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso saline administration at 0 or 4 zzso after burn worsened zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with those of burn + zzso zzso saline and burn + 50 zzso saline zzso To the contrary, burn + zzso rats with zzso saline injection at 4 or 8 zzso after burn showed an improvement of gut barrier function compared with burn + zzso + zzso zzso saline and burn + zzso + 50 zzso saline zzso Administration of zzso saline at 8 zzso after burn and zzso injection also significantly attenuated the bacterial zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Using zzso saline as a resuscitation fluid in early burn shock markedly zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deposition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso not only significantly attenuated zzso deposition and zzso zzso zzso but also reversed the deteriorating effects of zzso saline on zzso zzso gut barrier dysfunction and bacterial zzso
