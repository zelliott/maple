A full-length zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso The predicted primary structure of the zzso exhibits a sequence similarity of zzso and zzso with human zzso and the soybean zzso zzso I, zzso When all three zzso are zzso there are two distinct regions of significant sequence identity including a cluster of five zzso zzso zzso in all three zzso Because zzso can serve as zzso for the zzso active iron, this region may be critical to zzso zzso These results provide a basis for exploring functional zzso of zzso
