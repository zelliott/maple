In zzso zzso zzso in the zzso complex or zzso zzso exhibit defects in zzso zzso the formation of the zzso and male tail, and the zzso to zzso transition of zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso activity can be zzso but arrest in zzso of zzso I and are blocked from further zzso To examine the cell cycle and zzso consequences of reducing but not fully depleting zzso activity, we analyzed defects in zzso and larvae of zzso zzso grown at zzso zzso zzso zzso developed to the zzso stage but were slow to complete zzso I and displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso More severely affected zzso skipped zzso II altogether and exhibited striking defects in zzso zzso These latter zzso failed to produce normal zzso or establish normal zzso prior to the first zzso zzso In developing larvae, extended zzso delays in zzso cell lineages were associated with defects in the zzso of the male zzso This study reveals the importance of zzso zzso in analyzing molecular functions of a zzso functioning protein within different cell types and zzso and striking correlations between specific abnormalities in cell cycle progression and particular zzso zzso
