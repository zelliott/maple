zzso zzso zzso includes a zzso mechanism during the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso leading to a collection of zzso in which the zzso terminal leader sequence is fused to zzso zzso zzso It has been previously shown that zzso sequences zzso preceding each gene regulate zzso Base pairing between the leader zzso zzso and the complement of the body zzso zzso in the nascent zzso is a zzso factor during zzso zzso In fact, in zzso zzso zzso a good correlation has been observed between zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and the free energy zzso of zzso and zzso duplex zzso The only exception was zzso zzso zzso the most abundant zzso zzso during viral infection in spite of its minimum zzso associated with duplex zzso We zzso that additional factors should regulate zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this report, we have described a novel zzso regulation mechanism operating in zzso by which a zzso zzso sequence located 449 zzso upstream of the N gene zzso core sequence zzso interacts with a complementary sequence just upstream of zzso specifically increasing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed a correlation between the predicted stability of the base pairing between zzso sequences and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This interaction is exclusively zzso in group zzso zzso the only zzso zzso in which the N gene is not the most 3' gene in the viral zzso This is the first time that a long-distance zzso interaction regulating zzso activity specifically enhancing the zzso of one gene has been described to occur in zzso
