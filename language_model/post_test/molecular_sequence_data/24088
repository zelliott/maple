The zzso gene encodes zzso zzso the key zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcripts is zzso with the system 1 zzso production in the zzso tomato fruit, and both are down regulated by zzso zzso zzso To zzso the possible role of system 1 zzso in plant development and investigate the promoter tissue specificity of zzso zzso stable transformation of zzso with a zzso zzso fusion construct by zzso method has been zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso in transgenic zzso plants showed strong expression of zzso in zzso and zzso of 6 d zzso but no zzso activity was detected in zzso The zzso activity of 6 d zzso was increased significantly when treated with zzso zzso In 40 d zzso leaf zzso promoter driven zzso gene was predominantly expressed in mature zzso Lower level of zzso expression was detected in younger and older zzso zzso was found to increase zzso gene expression in transgenic zzso Again, zzso zzso was found to increase the zzso activity in wounded leaf zzso Strong zzso reaction was observed in the top part of rapidly growing zzso In different zzso stages of zzso seeds, zzso zzso pods were strongly zzso but zzso zzso were not zzso These observations are zzso with the system 1 zzso production, suggesting a popular mechanism in regulating zzso zzso in different plants, at least in tomato and zzso
