zzso zzso of zzso transient zzso potential zzso proteins are responsible for zzso zzso influx in zzso zzso We previously reported the involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso transient zzso potential 5 zzso zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso an important sensor of changes in zzso zzso and its downstream zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso channels in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso entry through zzso channels, induced upon stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso was abolished by treatment with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso and the expression of a zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso channel activity, revealing an essential role of zzso in maintaining zzso channel zzso It is important to note that zzso impaired the plasma membrane zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso channel activity measured using the zzso zzso technique was inhibited by zzso whereas zzso channel activity observed in the zzso zzso patch was unaffected by zzso An zzso that recognizes zzso zzso light chain zzso revealed that the zzso level of zzso zzso under zzso conditions was reduced by zzso in zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso activates zzso thereby maintaining zzso channel activity through the promotion of plasma membrane zzso channel distribution under the control of zzso equilibrium of zzso
