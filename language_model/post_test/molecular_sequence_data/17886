The zzso zzso contains multiple copies of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse and rat zzso libraries with cloned zzso zzso yielded zzso independent zzso zzso 4A zzso zzso containing twelve and five genes for mouse and rat zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that all of these zzso genes contain the entire coding sequence zzso 700 zzso but lack zzso The zzso sequence of a mouse gene zzso exhibiting the highest zzso with the mouse zzso zzso revealed genetic zzso which would zzso the translation of an intact zzso from a putative zzso Based on these features we propose that these clones represent processed genes of which most, if not all, are zzso
