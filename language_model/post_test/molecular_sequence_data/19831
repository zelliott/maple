zzso factor 4 zzso an essential zzso of the zzso complex acts as a zzso for multiple zzso regulators, including zzso and zzso However, little is known regarding the structural properties of the zzso zzso that lead to the zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure at zzso resolution of the human zzso domain, a zzso domain among all zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso The zzso structure adopts a completely zzso fold with a large zzso groove that forms a binding surface for zzso interacting zzso Using zzso zzso display, we have characterized the binding preference of the zzso domain for a zzso zzso zzso that is present in a number of nuclear factors, including several important zzso regulators with roles in zzso zzso and modulating zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso structure with the zzso zzso domain reveals several critical zzso important for zzso target specificity and suggests that zzso has evolved in response to the increased zzso complexity of zzso
