The zzso zzso zzso is expressed primarily by small zzso zzso cells and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso across the zzso zzso Here we describe the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene by zzso zzso reporter zzso into a variety of zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the promoter showed strong activity in the zzso cell line zzso but was inactive in a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso Within this region, three zzso a zzso nuclear zzso zzso and two zzso box sites are critical for maintaining the zzso zzso level of zzso The two zzso boxes bind to several members of the zzso family of zzso factors and, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso A novel zzso element just downstream of one zzso box was also shown to influence the interaction of zzso to its binding zzso In zzso we report the identification and characterization of the human zzso minimal promoter and the critical role that zzso and zzso members have in enhancing the zzso level of its zzso in zzso zzso
