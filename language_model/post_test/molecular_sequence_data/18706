Many zzso families develop zzso regulated zzso spots on their zzso The zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso develops zzso spots on its zzso The zzso arise simply from the deposition of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso To determine how zzso development was zzso we zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and isolated and characterized an zzso gene specific to zzso zzso All zzso zzso genes were expressed in zzso regions of zzso but not in other regions, indicating that zzso pigmentation is caused by the zzso regulation of zzso zzso Previously characterized zzso regulators were not involved in zzso zzso but, instead, a new zzso of the zzso zzso zzso isolated in this study, contributed to zzso zzso In zzso and other zzso plants expressing zzso zzso was zzso transcribed in the zzso region of zzso zzso segregation analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso among the F1 population, indicating that zzso determines the presence or absence of zzso zzso contributes to zzso development, but not to zzso pigmentation and raised spot zzso As a result of its unique sequences and different zzso profiles, this new zzso of zzso should be a novel zzso specifically zzso with zzso spot zzso
