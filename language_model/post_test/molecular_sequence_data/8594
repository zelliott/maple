Recently we have shown that zzso instability zzso is a zzso phenomenon in aborted embryonic zzso In the present study we investigated if instability is also zzso in a zzso located at the zzso of the zzso zzso affecting either the repetition number of the zzso core generating larger or smaller zzso or its sequence creating a zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso Among 30 aborted embryonic zzso zzso at the repetition number of the core were found in 3 zzso while point zzso were detected in 7 zzso zzso These results indicate that structural zzso of the zzso zzso may be associated with the rejection of the zzso
