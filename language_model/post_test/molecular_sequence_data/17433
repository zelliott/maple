To investigate the properties of zzso zinc finger peptides with zzso zzso combinations, the zzso and zzso zinc finger proteins zzso and zzso zzso were created by mutating zzso to His in the zzso zinc finger of the zzso factor zzso zzso The CD zzso clearly show that the zzso zzso zinc finger peptides zzso and zzso are folded by zzso with zzso From the gel mobility shift zzso the zzso zinc finger proteins zzso and zzso evidently bind to the zzso DNA, though the DNA binding affinity is lower than that of the wild zzso zinc finger zzso Furthermore, the zzso and zzso peptides catalyze the zzso of the zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso inactive zzso zzso This is the first study of the zzso zinc finger proteins and also provides useful information for redesigning artificial zzso
