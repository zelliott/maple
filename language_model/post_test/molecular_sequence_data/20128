zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in their zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, followed by the zzso addition of zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso to generate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study ten zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso domain of the best characterized family member, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso did not affect zzso activity with the zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso and zzso considerably slowed down zzso and resulted in incomplete zzso zzso of zzso slowed down both steps of the net zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso elimination step to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to Met or zzso resulted in zzso that had zzso activity but displayed greatly decreased zzso elimination zzso The zzso zzso retained both activities, zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso but had compromised elimination zzso Finally, zzso of zzso or zzso to zzso led to zzso zzso that lacked zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso retained zzso elimination activity, the zzso zzso was not able to eliminate zzso from a zzso zzso zzso A model is presented that accounts for the observed zzso of these zzso zzso
