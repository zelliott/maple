We present here a codification structure, entirely zzso with the main packages for zzso database management, associated with a new search zzso to retrieve quickly a sequence in a zzso This system is derived from a method previously proposed for zzso search in zzso with a zzso codification of an entire database in which all the overlapping zzso of a specific length in a sequence were converted into a code and stored in a zzso zzso This new zzso is designed for an improved use of the zzso It is based on the recognition of the zzso strings which characterize the query sequence and the intersection of sorted lists read in the codification zzso The system is zzso to both zzso acid and protein sequences and is used to find patterns in zzso or large sets of zzso A few examples of applications are zzso In addition, the comparison of our method with existing ones shows that this new approach speeds up the search for query patterns in large data zzso
