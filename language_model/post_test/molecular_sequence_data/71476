Although zzso processes involved in the formation of active steroids are well known, less information is available about the zzso responsible for the metabolism of these zzso Moreover, the expression of these zzso zzso which include zzso may play a role in the regulation of the level and action of steroid hormones in steroid target zzso Previous studies have shown that the zzso monkey contains high levels of circulating zzso zzso indicating that it represents the best animal model to study the zzso of steroids in zzso zzso Two zzso libraries were constructed from monkey liver and prostate zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from both zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone was zzso into zzso cells and a stable cell line expressing zzso protein was zzso The activity of zzso on zzso and zzso positions of steroids was zzso The zzso also zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso steroids with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for testosterone, zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcript was zzso by specific reverse zzso analysis in the liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The molecular characterization of zzso zzso demonstrates relevance of using monkey as an animal model to study and understand steroid zzso in zzso target zzso
