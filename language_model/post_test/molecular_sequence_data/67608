zzso are specialized zzso zzso characteristic of single cell organisms belonging to the zzso zzso These zzso play a key role in the invasion process of host cells by accumulating and subsequently zzso an unknown number of proteins zzso host cell zzso Despite their essential role, little is known about their zzso components and targeting zzso Here, we report on a zzso zzso protein termed zzso zzso zzso protein that we localized to the zzso face of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that the first 20 zzso zzso acids are sufficient for zzso membrane zzso This protein relies on both - zzso and zzso motifs - for membrane zzso Although these zzso modifications are essential, they are not sufficient to direct zzso to the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed additional zzso within the first 20 zzso acids of zzso that play an important role for zzso membrane zzso the positively charged zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the exchange of zzso with a negative charge entirely zzso membrane attachment, whereas the exchange of zzso (and to a lesser extent zzso alters only its membrane zzso Additionally, 17 proteins predicted to be zzso and zzso in the first 20 zzso zzso acids were identified in the zzso of the malaria zzso While most of the corresponding zzso fusion proteins were zzso to the zzso plasma zzso two were sorted to the zzso zzso Interestingly, these proteins have a similar motif identified for zzso
