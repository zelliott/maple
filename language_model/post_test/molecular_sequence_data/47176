We have cloned the guinea pig zzso Y zzso zzso zzso and found it to be zzso identical to other cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed affinities of 43 zzso and 48 zzso zzso zzso and zzso had 6- and zzso lower zzso respectively, than intact zzso zzso zzso was measured by using a zzso Human zzso and zzso were zzso in causing zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas zzso and zzso were about zzso and zzso less zzso respectively, than zzso The present study shows that the cloned guinea pig zzso zzso is very similar to its zzso in other zzso both with respect to sequence and zzso Thus, results from previous studies on guinea pig zzso receptors might imply the existence of an additional zzso zzso sensitive to zzso
