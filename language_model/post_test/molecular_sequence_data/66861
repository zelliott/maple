The two minor zzso bands, previously detected in symptomatic leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to further zzso zzso cloning and sequencing revealed that the smaller of the two zzso bands is actually a zzso consisting of two zzso zzso segments and the resulting three segments were designated as zzso 3, zzso 4, and zzso zzso zzso 3 was zzso zzso in length and potentially zzso a protein of about zzso zzso containing all of the six zzso motifs shared by the zzso dependent zzso zzso of members of the family zzso zzso 4 and zzso 5, which zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso in length and each zzso a putative protein of unknown zzso Their molecular masses, as calculated from the deduced zzso acid, were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of all three segments shared regions of high sequence similarities, but were distinct from those of the zzso 1 and zzso zzso Taken together, these results along with those described in the previous report, suggest that more than one zzso was zzso zzso zzso
