By multiple sequence alignments of DNA zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso we have identified five positively charged zzso zzso specifically zzso located zzso to the zzso zzso Here, we have zzso by zzso zzso the functional role of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in specific reactions dependent on a zzso zzso zzso introduced at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to a lower extent zzso and zzso showed a defective zzso initiation zzso Analysis of the interaction with zzso DNA and terminal protein zzso displayed by zzso derivatives zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso allows us to conclude that zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso essential to form stable DNA zzso complexes, while zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be playing a role in establishing contacts with the zzso template during the first step of DNA zzso The importance of zzso zzso to make a functionally active DNA zzso complex is also zzso These results, together with the high degree of conservation of those zzso among zzso DNA zzso strongly suggest a functional role of those zzso acids in establishing the appropriate interactions with DNA zzso zzso DNA and zzso to successfully accomplish the first steps of zzso zzso
