zzso stimulates the synthesis and zzso of zzso alpha from zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso late in the zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso is dependent upon the availability of free zzso acid which is released through the activity of zzso releasing zzso In the present study, the following hypothesis was zzso the zzso zzso expresses a zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression or activity of zzso increases as zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso develops late in the zzso zzso zzso tissue was collected from zzso zzso on day 15 of the zzso cycle for the preparation of tissue zzso and isolation of zzso to determine whether zzso zzso expressed a zzso A 110 zzso band was detected by western zzso indicating the presence of a putative zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso shared zzso zzso with human and mouse zzso and northern zzso zzso analysis indicated a single zzso zzso zzso A total of 20 zzso were zzso and treated with zzso and zzso to simulate the zzso cycle to determine whether the expression or activity of zzso zzso changed during the onset of zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso in zzso On days zzso zzso zzso 5 per day) of a simulated zzso cycle, zzso zzso was evaluated for expression of zzso zzso zzso and protein and the synthesis of zzso alpha in response to zzso (a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed on all days and did not increase during the development of zzso responsiveness to zzso in zzso Similarly, zzso increased the synthesis of zzso alpha irrespective of day, indicating the presence of a functional zzso on all days zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso expresses a functional zzso and that ample zzso of zzso are present by day 11 of a simulated zzso zzso
