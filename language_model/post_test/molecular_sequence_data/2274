We have previously reported that a block of zzso zzso is functioning in zzso and in zzso within the leader sequences of zzso and the zzso 2 major late zzso units and in the regulation of zzso of the zzso promoter of minute virus of zzso In the present study using the zzso whole cell zzso system with zzso 2 major late promoter as a template we have analyzed several basic parameters that can contribute to our understanding of the mechanism that regulates the zzso block at the zzso 2 zzso zzso We show that the zzso block is zzso at elevated temperatures zzso degrees zzso The zzso block can be reversed by the addition of zzso M zzso to the zzso reaction and the zzso is zzso Furthermore, while at zzso degrees C the zzso block is zzso with dilution of the zzso at zzso degrees C it is only partially zzso These results may indicate that a zzso is involved in the regulation of the zzso block and/or that the zzso of the zzso complex is temperature zzso Finally, we show that the extent of the zzso block is dependent on the consecutive T zzso at the zzso site and we discuss the involvement of zzso secondary structure in zzso the zzso zzso
