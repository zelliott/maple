zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that associates intimately with the zzso particle zzso zzso zzso and serves as an important structural and functional component of the zzso We investigated the structure and zzso activity of the human zzso protein by the use of comparative sequence analysis, zzso structure zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to consist of two distinct regions (called zzso and zzso zzso that are separated by a boundary of approximately zzso zzso acid zzso Both regions contain an zzso and several zzso that are connected by zzso or zzso In agreement with the hypothetical model, zzso zzso demonstrated the zzso accessibility of two sites: one in a surface loop of the zzso region zzso and another site in the zzso tail at zzso zzso and zzso The zzso activities of zzso zzso with changes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that the zzso accessible loop of the zzso region is in direct contact with the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of a certain basic zzso acid zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso and zzso as well as a deletion of four zzso acid zzso located at the boundary between the two regions, had no effect on the zzso zzso The structural model that emerges from our data is thematically similar to that of zzso protein zzso the zzso of which contains a loop motif believed to interact with zzso zzso The presence of a similar structural feature in protein zzso has significant implications for the structure and function of the zzso zzso
