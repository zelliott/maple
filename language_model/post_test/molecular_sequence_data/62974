The present study was undertaken to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso cell, and to analyze the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing partial zzso sequence of zzso were isolated from zzso library of the zzso zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the clone containing the longest zzso insert zzso zzso was identified as a member of the zzso transport protein family and exhibited about zzso identity with zzso of other zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis identified a single transcript longer than 10 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso showed a high amount of zzso zzso during the growing stage and the level was retained until zzso zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated the expression of zzso zzso in the auxiliary cells closely associated with growing zzso suggesting that the synthesis of a major zzso protein in the zzso occurs through zzso zzso without mediation through the blood flow but occurs de zzso in the zzso The content of zzso zzso in the zzso tissue cultured in zzso with zzso promoting factor zzso which strongly promotes zzso protein zzso from the cerebral plus pedal zzso zzso showed no zzso The zzso of zzso zzso appeared to be promoted by zzso zzso not by zzso although zzso may enhance the translation of zzso zzso
