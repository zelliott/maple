zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso are folded in the zzso zzso zzso and proceed to the trans zzso network for sorting and targeting to the zzso or zzso sides of the zzso where they exert their zzso These processes depend on diverse protein zzso Here, we used zzso zzso a zzso of zzso and zzso which contains an zzso and two zzso zzso zzso as a model protein to address zzso the role of native zzso in zzso polarized transport and biological zzso In zzso cells, zzso exits zzso zzso and is targeted to the zzso side of the zzso Although the zzso zzso possesses an zzso targeting zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are not required for zzso targeting of zzso zzso and transport to the plasma membrane relies only on the zzso zzso while the zzso one is zzso Nevertheless, both zzso and zzso zzso as well as genuine zzso are critical for optimal zzso activity and zzso by zzso We conclude therefore that zzso are not just mechanical zzso between proteins and zzso but are also able to control folding and zzso as well as biological activity via sensing components of zzso zzso
