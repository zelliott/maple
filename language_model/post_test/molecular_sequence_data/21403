Regulators of zzso signaling zzso proteins are a family of zzso which accelerate zzso intrinsic to the alpha zzso of zzso zzso and play crucial roles in the zzso control of zzso zzso Here, yellow grouper zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by zzso affinity zzso The expression level of the fusion protein was up to zzso of the total cellular zzso zzso analysis showed that a band with the molecular mass of about 21 zzso was zzso The zzso zzso protein was used to prepare zzso zzso and zzso obtained was highly specific with the zzso of over zzso Additionally, zzso protein was expressed in the zzso insect zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the expressed protein had zzso
