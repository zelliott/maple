The green fluorescent protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso is finding wide use as a genetic marker that can be directly zzso in the living cells of many zzso zzso We have sought to express zzso in the model plant zzso zzso but have found that proper expression of zzso is curtailed due to zzso zzso zzso An zzso cryptic zzso is efficiently recognized and excised from transcripts of the zzso coding zzso The cryptic zzso contains sequences similar to those required for recognition of normal plant zzso We have modified the zzso usage of the zzso gene to mutate the zzso and to restore proper expression in zzso zzso is mainly localized within the zzso and zzso of transformed zzso cells and can give rise to high levels of fluorescence, but it proved difficult to efficiently zzso transgenic plants from such highly fluorescent zzso However, when zzso is targeted to the zzso zzso transformed cells zzso routinely to give highly fluorescent zzso These modified forms of the zzso gene are useful for directly monitoring gene expression and protein zzso and dynamics at high resolution, and as a simply scored genetic marker in living zzso
