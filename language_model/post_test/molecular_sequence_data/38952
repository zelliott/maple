The Hopi gene is a member of the zzso zzso gene zzso By genetic and molecular analyses we report that Hopi consists of a single gene residing on zzso 10 approximately zzso zzso zzso to zzso Hopi conditions zzso deposition in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves, and zzso thus representing one of the broadest specifications of pigmentation pattern reported to date of all the zzso zzso A unique feature of the Hopi gene is that seeds are completely devoid of zzso at maturity but show a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Our analysis has shown that the Hopi transcript is not present in zzso of developing seeds but is induced only upon zzso and that the simultaneous presence of both C1 and Hopi zzso is necessary to achieve A1 zzso in zzso We conclude that the expression pattern of the Hopi gene accounts for the zzso zzso synthesis in zzso whereas the zzso competence of zzso seeds to induce zzso production in zzso results from the combination of the zzso expression of C1 and the zzso regulated expression of the Hopi zzso
