zzso protein 1 zzso is a highly zzso protein with multiple functions, one of which is to act as an interaction partner of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for its nuclear import and zzso zzso Here, the crystal structure of full-length human zzso is zzso The protein contains six zzso zzso repeats that pack into a zzso zzso zzso This zzso domain is unique within the zzso protein family zzso to the presence of several unusual structural zzso Moreover, zzso contains significant and novel zzso structures zzso both ends of the central zzso zzso A strong continuous zzso core runs through the whole structure, indicating that the zzso and zzso structures fold together to form an integral zzso This structure defines a highly restrictive and zzso zzso groove that is not observed in other zzso zzso The presence of a cluster of zzso zzso in the groove implies a zzso zzso mechanism that may regulate protein binding zzso The many unique structural features of zzso establish it as a distinct member of the zzso protein zzso The structure provides critical insights into the molecular interactions between zzso and its protein partners, especially zzso
