The zzso zzso at the motor zzso has served as a zzso for understanding structure, function and zzso recognition in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Yet despite this advanced state of knowledge, zzso understanding of such elementary processes as zzso recognition has remained elusive zzso to the lack of a high-resolution zzso zzso However, the field has recently entered a state of rapid advancement following the discovery and atomic structural determination of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso structure provides the theoretical foundation for generating zzso models of the corresponding zzso zzso binding zzso within this structural family of zzso Experimental assignment of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso subsequently yielded zzso models ready for experimental zzso One such test is zzso determination of zzso zzso orientation in conjunction with zzso of predicted contact zzso and zzso of zzso binding zzso zzso to different zzso of the competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso that incorporate intrinsic protein flexibility reveal fundamentally distinct zzso of each analog bound to zzso The different contact zzso predicted for each analog were tested and confirmed by zzso of zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso By applying the same zzso and experimental approaches to the adult human muscle zzso we find that the two zzso zzso also dock in distinctly different zzso Thus subtle structural changes in the zzso and by extension, structural differences in zzso zzso among zzso zzso and species, can dramatically alter the orientation of the bound zzso The results have important implications for design of drugs targeting zzso receptors and members of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
