zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso one of the final steps in the degradation of zzso zzso Here we have analyzed the zzso expression and regulation of the human and mouse zzso zzso We isolated and characterized human and mouse zzso zzso sequences including the promoter zzso zzso extension zzso revealed multiple zzso start sites in both zzso characteristic of a zzso zzso The zzso comparison studies zzso an approximately zzso pair zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso In the functional analysis of human zzso zzso zzso the critical promoter region was zzso and an additional upstream region of 181 zzso exhibiting an zzso effect on zzso was zzso zzso and gel shift zzso indicated protein binding to the core promoter region consisting of two zzso binding sites, which were sufficient to produce zzso promoter activity in the functional zzso The results also suggested the binding of a previously zzso zzso factor to a zzso stretch in the zzso zzso
