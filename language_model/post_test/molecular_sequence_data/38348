A consensus approach has been developed for identifying distant structural zzso This is based on the zzso Dictionary of zzso zzso zzso a database of validated multiple structural alignments zzso with consensus functional information for evolutionary protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple structural alignments have been generated for 362 zzso zzso in the zzso structural domain database and zzso with secondary structure, zzso properties, functional sequence patterns and zzso interaction zzso Consensus functional information for each zzso includes descriptions and zzso extracted from zzso and the zzso zzso The Dictionary provides a powerful resource to zzso examine and zzso key structural and functional features of each zzso zzso The value of the zzso for assessing functional zzso and identifying distant evolutionary zzso is illustrated using the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso The zzso also provides a tool for examining zzso relationships for proteins within each fold zzso
