Human zzso 21 is associated with many disorders, including Down syndrome zzso In an effort to identify genes involved in brain development or function and therefore implicated in the mental zzso associated with zzso we chose zzso from three regions of zzso zzso a region within the so-called zzso syndrome critical zzso a region zzso to it, and one zzso to zzso We made zzso libraries from these zzso and generated high-resolution physical maps by constructing zzso zzso These are the first zzso zzso on zzso 21 outside the critical zzso The zzso were used for direct selection of zzso to isolate zzso 21 expressed zzso We have isolated 45 zzso partial zzso and mapped these back to the zzso zzso We isolated 3 zzso portions of zzso and a part of zzso and identified 3 zzso partial zzso with similarity to the rat zzso zzso which turned out to be the human zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Twelve sequences had matches with either zzso or zzso entries in the databases, including a zzso 21 zzso a zzso 21 zzso and 6 zzso expressed sequence zzso Only 1 sequence resulted in a match with a protein zzso The remaining 25 sequences revealed no similarity to any database zzso All of these partial zzso are expressed as determined by Northern zzso or by zzso
