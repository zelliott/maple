zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso column zzso followed by zzso liquid zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of three major bands at 42, 33, and 32 zzso with identical zzso zzso By Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso the zzso zzso was found to be widely distributed in the zzso and on the surface of the outer zzso The open reading frame corresponding to the zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso was detected by a search of the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This sequence showed zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and included a zzso region signature, suggesting that the zzso is a member of the zinc zzso zzso The zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso acid, and some metal zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso activated the zzso The zzso released zzso and/or zzso from biologically active peptides containing these zzso acids at the C zzso but did not cleave zzso when zzso was present at the penultimate zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso is an zzso type of zzso This zzso may function to release zzso in collaboration with an zzso zzso zzso zzso to obtain specific zzso acids from host zzso during the growth of zzso zzso
