The accessory gene regulator zzso of zzso zzso is a global regulator of the zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso factors and surface zzso The zzso locus is important for zzso in a variety of animal models of infection, and has been assumed by zzso to have a major role in human zzso Although most human clinical zzso zzso zzso are zzso there have been several reports of zzso zzso isolated from infected zzso Since it is well known that the zzso locus is genetically zzso in zzso we have addressed the question of whether the reported zzso zzso were involved in the infection or could have arisen during zzso zzso We obtained a series of new zzso zzso from local clinical infections and handled these with special care to avoid zzso zzso Among these zzso we found a number of strains with zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso and others with zzso zzso We have also obtained zzso in which the population was continuously zzso with respect to zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso having otherwise indistinguishable zzso zzso This finding suggested that the zzso zzso arose by zzso during the course of the zzso Our results indicate that while most clinical zzso are zzso and zzso zzso and zzso strains are found in zzso zzso infections, and that zzso and zzso zzso may have a cooperative interaction in certain types of zzso
