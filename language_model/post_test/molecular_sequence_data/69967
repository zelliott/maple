zzso The zzso that degrade zzso zzso in human and guinea pig plasma were studied by kinetic and zzso zzso zzso The extremely rapid degradation of zzso in zzso plasma seems to be caused by both increased activity of zzso and reduced role of zzso zzso The increased role of zzso in zzso as compared to Homo appears zzso caused by the presence in the former species of a considerable number of very active zzso zzso The sum of these data indicates the existence of noticeable zzso differences either in zzso zzso present in zzso or in plasma zzso or in zzso
