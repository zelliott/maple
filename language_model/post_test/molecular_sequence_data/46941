Plasma membrane zzso of Ras requires zzso addition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso motif zzso is zzso a is any zzso zzso X is the zzso terminal zzso To better understand the relationship between zzso processing and the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso genetic screen was undertaken based on the loss of function of a zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in an zzso open reading frame zzso that we have designated zzso and a previously described zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with four predicted zzso zzso segments and a motif consisting of the zzso acids zzso zzso within a zzso domain zzso called zzso zzso within the zzso abolish zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments reveal that zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso marker zzso zzso lacking zzso are viable, but they have a synthetic growth zzso in the absence of zzso and partially suppress the heat shock sensitivity resulting from expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed in an zzso strain have a reduced level of zzso and are partially zzso to the zzso Based on these zzso we propose that zzso is a component of a previously zzso Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso members of an zzso family of proteins have been uncovered in zzso plant, worm, zzso and zzso zzso databases, suggesting that zzso plays a role in Ras zzso in all zzso
