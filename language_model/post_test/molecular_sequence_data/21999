Members of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso family are crucial for the zzso zzso zzso signaling and cellular stress zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso remain largely zzso In this study, we identified a key regulatory zzso site, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this zzso to an zzso severely impaired zzso zzso We generated an zzso zzso and used this zzso to demonstrate that zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso on their regulatory zzso We found that the zzso zzso was crucial for zzso zzso 6 production and this process is regulated by zzso a key zzso zzso for the zzso zzso We further demonstrated that many, but not all, zzso zzso induced the regulatory zzso zzso suggesting an involvement of different zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso leading to different cellular zzso In conclusion, this study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for zzso zzso by the zzso and cellular stress zzso
