The zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso adrenal zzso zzso since it only carries the dysfunctional steroid zzso A zzso as well as the zzso adjacent complement zzso zzso The zzso site leading to the deletion of the complement zzso and steroid zzso B genes in this zzso was studied by determining the zzso zzso DNA sequence in comparison to the standard zzso and zzso zzso A zzso region between zzso 7 and 8 was identified as a possible zzso zzso Thus the deleted area comprises the 3' end of the zzso zzso the entire zzso gene and the zzso end of the zzso zzso The findings were confirmed by zzso amplification of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso system is specific for zzso zzso genes and may be used for screening among zzso patients carrying this type of zzso
