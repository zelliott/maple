Studies of microbial zzso have made astounding discoveries of late due to the use of zzso based on zzso analyses of small zzso zzso zzso zzso Although there are limitations to these methods, they can nonetheless be very useful if these limitations are kept in zzso These limitations range from technical problems such as obtaining representative zzso DNA and suitable zzso to conceptual problems such as defining and using meaningful zzso units of diversity zzso Here we discuss several of the limitations inherent in studies of microbial diversity that must be considered when interpreting the results obtained using these zzso
