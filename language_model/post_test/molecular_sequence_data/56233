The zzso gene of zzso zzso is required early in the cell cycle, and its transcript varies in concentration in step with the cell cycle, with a peak level at the zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso gene and of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso open reading frame, which is interrupted in the zzso by a single zzso very close to its zzso end, encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso which has an zzso acid sequence highly similar to that of the large zzso of zzso zzso from several zzso The zzso gene contains an uninterrupted open reading frame of 391 zzso zzso very similar to the sequence of the small zzso of zzso zzso zzso of either gene is zzso zzso of the zzso coding region are seven short sequence elements similar to the recognition sequence for zzso which are involved in regulating periodic zzso of the zzso zzso of DNA synthesis by zzso results in a zzso increase in the level of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso does not induce the zzso zzso transcript of zzso but results in the induction of a zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso zzso
