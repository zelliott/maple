A region of zzso zzso zzso upstream of the muscular zzso promoter zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso cloned and zzso Analysis of this sequence for the presence of putative zzso control elements identified several similarities with known zzso sequence motifs including two zzso and two zzso zzso One of these zzso motifs was found to be completely zzso within an otherwise highly variable region among five zzso zzso Complete zzso to a human fetal brain expressed sequence tag zzso was also observed over 201 zzso at the zzso end of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using a zzso zzso probe identified a 1 zzso zzso expressed in human zzso and at lower levels in the zzso These results raise the possibility that additional zzso regulatory elements are located upstream of the core muscle promoter, and provide the first evidence for the existence of a gene that zzso the human zzso zzso
