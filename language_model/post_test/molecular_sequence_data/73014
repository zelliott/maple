We have characterized the three zzso elements responsible for promoter strength present in the zzso zzso region of zzso a human zzso gene zzso a zzso protein present in zzso complexes of high molecular zzso The first element consisted of an zzso sequence that, curiously, was present in reverse orientation compared to that of the standard zzso zzso The other two elements were contained in a region of 126 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site, and consisted of a tandem array of one zzso box and one zzso zzso The zzso box zzso to a consensus site for the nuclear factor zzso whereas the zzso box deviates from this consensus, although it was able to compete for the binding of zzso in zzso and to respond to zzso by zzso in zzso This simple promoter lacks an apparent zzso box and lost more than zzso of its activity when a zzso of 60 zzso containing the zzso and zzso boxes was zzso A synergistic effect on zzso zzso was observed in the presence, but not in the absence, of the zzso element when both zzso and zzso boxes were zzso
