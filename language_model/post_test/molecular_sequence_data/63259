zzso is the most effective way to control infectious zzso A variety of microbial pathogens use zzso variation, an immune evasion strategy that poses a challenge for vaccine zzso To understand protective immune responses against such zzso we have been studying zzso zzso a zzso that causes zzso zzso due to zzso zzso An zzso response is necessary and sufficient to control zzso zzso zzso We have recently found a selective expansion of zzso cells concurrent with the resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso but not zzso mice zzso long-lasting zzso but the zzso driving the protective zzso responses is zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes complement factor zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein and putative zzso factor that does not undergo zzso variation and is expressed by all clinical zzso A progressive increase in the zzso response to zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso cell expansion, diminished the severity of zzso episodes, and led to the eventual resolution of the zzso These data indicate that zzso is a specific target for protective zzso cell zzso zzso recognized by zzso cells may be considered as an important component in vaccination zzso
