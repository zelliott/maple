The expression of the gene zzso tumor necrosis factor beta zzso zzso is induced in T cells by various zzso zzso We noticed that most such stimuli also activate the zzso B zzso zzso Here we demonstrate binding of zzso human zzso B to a sequence within positions zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, which is zzso between the human and mouse zzso Also the zzso B from the human zzso line zzso activated upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment in zzso or upon zzso treatment in zzso binds with high affinity to the sequence in the zzso zzso Apart from a single zzso the site is identical to a zzso element that is involved in the zzso expression of the zzso class I gene zzso and which interacts with both the zzso zzso B zzso factor and the zzso factor zzso as we demonstrate here for the site in the zzso zzso The high zzso of the well characterized zzso zzso sequence with the zzso site with regard to sequence and factor binding strongly supports a zzso role for zzso B in the zzso expression of the zzso zzso Our observation that the zzso protein can rapidly induce the zzso activity of zzso B in zzso T cells and zzso increase zzso zzso levels suggests that zzso B can mediate a positive zzso of zzso zzso
