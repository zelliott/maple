Human zzso zzso encodes several highly zzso envelope zzso however, the biological relevance of this zzso is zzso zzso N zzso is one member of this zzso protein zzso Four major zzso zzso zzso have been zzso We have tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso represents a mechanism to evade a zzso zzso zzso zzso Four zzso viruses that differed only in the expression of the zzso zzso were constructed on the genetic background of zzso strain zzso Exchange of zzso zzso had a minor zzso influence on virus zzso zzso expression and zzso complex zzso zzso selected human zzso were zzso for zzso activity against the zzso zzso Of these, 70 % showed no difference in zzso zzso between the zzso whereas 30 % showed zzso zzso zzso in 50 % zzso zzso reached zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso were neutralized significantly better than those expressing the other zzso zzso zzso zzso or lack zzso could not be attributed to the presence or absence of zzso zzso as all zzso contained zzso reacting with zzso (as determined by zzso Thus, zzso of zzso could contribute to evasion of an efficient zzso response and facilitate zzso in previously zzso zzso
