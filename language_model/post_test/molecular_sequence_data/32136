In a zzso aquaculture system the zzso zzso can be used as zzso for zzso bacterial production, which can be recycled as zzso Because the bacteria might contain zzso which could reduce its suitability as feed, it is important to characterize these zzso zzso were produced in growth zzso under different conditions: 7 h zzso retention time zzso zzso 2 zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The community of the zzso zzso was different from those found in the zzso However, all major community components were present in the zzso and reactor zzso zzso influenced the bacteria community, resulting in a zzso profile dominated by a band corresponding to an zzso zzso population at 2 h zzso compared to 7 h zzso where bands indicative of zzso populations most closely related to zzso and zzso zzso were most zzso zzso influenced the bacterial zzso It was dominated by an zzso zzso zzso Providing total zzso nitrogen zzso in addition to nitrate led to the occurrence of bacteria close to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was concluded from these results that a zzso h zzso is recommended, and that the type of zzso is less important, and results in communities with a comparably low zzso zzso
