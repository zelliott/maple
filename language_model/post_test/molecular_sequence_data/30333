The addition of transforming growth factor type beta to zzso zzso zzso cultures enhances zzso switching to zzso and zzso the appearance of two sizes of alpha zzso zzso One of these is the same size as zzso for zzso zzso but the other, which is zzso base pairs zzso zzso does not correlate in size with any form of productive alpha zzso Both sizes of transcript were shown to contain zzso sequences zzso to the alpha switch region, suggesting that the longer transcripts included both zzso and productive forms of alpha zzso whereas the shorter transcripts were only zzso alpha zzso We isolated zzso clones corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso transcript by using an anchored zzso chain reaction and a specific primer for the constant zzso zzso of these zzso clones show that the short transcript consists of a zzso zzso located approximately zzso zzso zzso to the alpha switch region spliced to the first zzso of the alpha constant region zzso Furthermore, a minor fraction of the longer, approximately zzso zzso transcripts also contains this zzso These results demonstrate that transforming growth factor type zzso zzso switching to zzso is preceded by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
