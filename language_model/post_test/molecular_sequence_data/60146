Transition protein 2 zzso 137 zzso acid zzso from zzso late zzso zzso has three potential zinc finger motifs in the zzso 34 zzso zzso shift zzso revealed that zzso zzso recognized a zzso island sequence in a zzso zzso However, there was some zzso recognition of the zzso Then, we constructed the expression system of zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments zzso zzso were zzso as 18 fragments with 103 zzso zzso and cloned into the expression zzso zzso zzso was expressed upon induction with 1 zzso zzso and extracted with acid including zzso M zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso 300 zzso and on zzso Atomic zzso and CD zzso showed that zzso bound three atoms of zinc per zzso of the protein and underwent a zzso zzso change in a manner similar to that for intact zzso zzso shift zzso indicated that zzso recognized a zzso island sequence more specifically than intact zzso and that the specificity is dependent on zzso
