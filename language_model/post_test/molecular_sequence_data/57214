We previously identified a zzso zzso protein of the plasma membrane zzso which zzso at the zzso microscopic level with zzso and occurs not only in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso To clarify the nature and possible functions of this zzso we cloned its full-length zzso and zzso zzso zzso we found mouse zzso protein to be highly zzso to rat protein zzso only a part of which had been already zzso This relationship was confirmed by zzso with zzso zzso As protein zzso was originally identified as a component exclusively underlying tight junctions in zzso cells, where zzso are not believed to be zzso we analyzed the distribution of zzso and the zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that in zzso cells lacking tight junctions zzso and the zzso protein zzso whereas in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing well-developed tight junctions zzso and the zzso protein are clearly zzso into zzso and tight zzso zzso Interestingly, in zzso cells such as zzso which tight junctions are not so well developed, the zzso protein is detected not only in the tight junction zone but also at zzso zzso Furthermore, we show in mouse L cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso interact directly or indirectly with the zzso zzso zzso functions of the zzso protein zzso are discussed with special reference to the molecular mechanism for zzso and tight junction zzso
