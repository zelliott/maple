zzso zzso zzso 180 zzso is a component of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the function of specific sequences of zzso to its incorporation in zzso we have zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and deletion zzso forms of human zzso The results show that the zzso domain of zzso contains sufficient information for the recruitment of the protein into zzso because removal of the zzso and zzso zzso does not abolish zzso zzso of zzso zzso which consist of the membrane targeting sequence of zzso fused to the zzso domain of zzso with increasing internal deletions or lacking the zzso zzso indicates that the zzso of zzso in zzso is zzso by a segment that spans 265 zzso zzso This segment comprises two important regions located within the central part and at the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso To investigate the effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso distribution of zzso we have zzso zzso cells, which lack zzso and zzso with zzso for zzso as well as for human zzso and zzso We provide evidence that a zzso form of zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain as well as a zzso zzso which contains the entire zzso domain of zzso are zzso with zzso In contrast, when cells were zzso with zzso for zzso and zzso forms of zzso either lacking the zzso zzso half or carrying zzso zzso in the zzso zzso motif of the zzso domain, the zzso zzso molecules were mostly not zzso with zzso but remained zzso distributed at the cell zzso Moreover, in cells zzso with zzso for zzso and a zzso zzso in which the zzso domain of zzso was replaced by that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso with the zzso zzso in focal zzso but remained again zzso zzso These results indicate that sequences within the zzso domain of zzso determine the zzso distribution of zzso
