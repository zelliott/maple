zzso protein C zzso is generated from the zzso of protein C by zzso coupled to zzso and, zzso is released as protein C zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso activated with 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso after zzso with zzso Similarly, zzso analysis revealed that 2 and 4 zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso increased in zzso treated with zzso compared to those without zzso Furthermore, zzso cell zzso to zzso induced by zzso was significantly inhibited after the addition of zzso compared to zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, a control zzso analog to zzso showed no effect on the expression of zzso and zzso on the surface of zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso exerts zzso effects on zzso zzso
