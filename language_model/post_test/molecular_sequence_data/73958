The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso and the DNA sequence was zzso The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso consisting of zzso zzso acids zzso Mr of zzso Also, there was a partial zzso zzso gene that was 4 zzso overlapped in the end of zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso expressed in zzso coli under the control of zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli was simply zzso by heat treatment at 90 degrees C for 10 zzso and column zzso of zzso The Mr of the zzso zzso was estimated to be 45 zzso on zzso gel zzso However, Mr of the cloned zzso was 185 zzso on native condition, indicating that the zzso consists of zzso zzso The zzso has an optimum temperature at 90 degrees zzso zzso tests revealed that half life at 85 degrees C was 2 zzso and 2 h at 95 degrees zzso The optimum pH is around zzso close to where zzso formation is zzso The zzso yield of the cloned zzso was about zzso from zzso indicating that the yield is higher than those of reported zzso The zzso values for various sugar zzso were calculated as 106 zzso for zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are required for the zzso activity and 100 zzso zzso completely inhibited the zzso zzso
