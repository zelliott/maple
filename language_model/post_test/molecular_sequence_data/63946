We report the kinetic characterization of a previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso activity in extracts from zzso zzso zzso This activity was about zzso of the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso differed from most zzso in that its pH optimum was zzso and was inhibited by high zzso zzso zzso these are zzso at which zzso is usually zzso The optimal temperature was above 40 degrees C with negligible activity below 20 degrees zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso with respect to both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it exhibited a zzso behavior with respect to zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso did not require zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was a potent zzso zzso it increased the affinity for zzso without modification of the zzso or the affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso A putative zzso gene zzso found in zzso was zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso zzso contain an active zzso which might contribute to the generation of zzso zzso for zzso zzso
