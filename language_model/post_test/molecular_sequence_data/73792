We have isolated zzso clones zzso the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso The clones were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line, where the gene is relatively strongly zzso giving a transcript of zzso zzso in zzso We present the sequence zzso the full-length zzso and deduced the zzso organization of the gene by comparison to previously published zzso partial sequence zzso zzso shows that zzso is localized in small zzso probably zzso in zzso zzso The data presented suggest a role for zzso zzso in immune functions in zzso It is likely to participate in the degradation of zzso material in zzso zzso
