zzso B, the regulatory zzso of zzso a zzso protein zzso is highly zzso throughout the evolutionary scale including zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, in these zzso the protein is required for zzso host cell invasion and zzso and stress zzso With the aim of determining the presence of zzso B in zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso the respective gene was amplified by zzso cloned and zzso Two sequences of 531 zzso in length showing a zzso zzso zzso were obtained in spite of a zzso gene was revealed by Southern zzso These zzso probably the zzso from the zzso showed a zzso of identity with those from zzso zzso and clustered as the sister group of this zzso species in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparison with zzso and other organisms through the zzso scale as well as the obtained protein structural zzso model suggested the presence of the four potential zzso regions and the corresponding calcium binding sites of the last three of these zzso Having assessed the expression of this protein in zzso zzso zzso and taking into account the following facts: zzso zzso zzso have zzso effect on the in zzso replication of zzso zzso zzso zzso major zzso growth is inhibited by zzso agents, and zzso zzso zzso does not seem to zzso zzso zzso cells, it is hypothesized zzso that the function of this protein in zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso
