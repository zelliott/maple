The structure of the zzso active zzso of human plasma zzso N was modeled based on the zzso with bovine zzso zzso The active site of zzso N is well zzso in comparison with zzso zzso From a comparison of energetically favorable binding sites for different atomic probe groups a hypothesis for the differences in zzso specificity between zzso A and N was zzso Small synthetic zzso zzso were zzso to confirm this zzso This study shows that even with very low zzso model building by zzso can be employed to build models of sufficient quality to aid in drug zzso
