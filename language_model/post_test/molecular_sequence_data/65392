In zzso analyses of the zzso promoter previously demonstrated that a zzso spanning sequences zzso to zzso targets promoter zzso to brain vascular zzso cells, whereas a longer zzso including zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the first zzso and the first zzso activated expression in zzso cells of the heart and muscles as well as the brain of transgenic zzso These results suggested that additional zzso gene sequences were required for expression in other vascular zzso cells in zzso We have now identified a region within zzso 51 of the zzso gene that is zzso zzso zzso specifically in zzso cells and interacts with zzso and zzso specific complexes that contain zzso We demonstrate that zzso is associated with zzso specifically in the nucleus of zzso cells and is a component of the nuclear protein complexes that interact with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso sequences containing this zzso site do not significantly affect zzso promoter zzso However, in zzso analyses demonstrated that addition of these sequences to the zzso promoter zzso to zzso results in promoter zzso in lung and brain vascular zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso sequences in zzso 51 of the zzso gene contain zzso elements that are necessary for the zzso gene zzso in a subset of lung zzso cells in zzso
