The two zzso of zzso delta virus zzso cleave faster in zzso metal zzso than in zzso zzso and a variety of zzso metal zzso can act as zzso in supporting these higher zzso Although the zzso are closely related in sequence and structure, they display a different metal zzso zzso the zzso form zzso moderately faster in zzso than in zzso while the reverse is true for the zzso zzso This difference raises questions about understanding the zzso role of the metal zzso in the zzso We found that the metal zzso zzso preference correlated with the identity of a single zzso zzso of the zzso site zzso zzso It is a U in the zzso sequence and a C in the zzso zzso With both zzso the zzso preference for zzso and zzso could be reversed with a change at this position zzso to U or U to zzso Moreover, with an A at position zzso there was a relative increase in zzso rates in low zzso of zzso for both zzso Metal zzso zzso preference was also linked to changes in zzso and the zzso profiles could be shifted with zzso changes at position zzso Together, the data provide zzso evidence in support of an organized active site, as seen in the crystal structures, where at least one metal zzso an zzso group, and the zzso of the zzso backbone at the zzso site interact in concert to promote zzso
