zzso expression of zzso factors can be an effective means to zzso zzso entire zzso pathways in zzso It can also provide useful information concerning the identities of genes that constitute zzso zzso Here, we used zzso expression of a zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso to alter zzso and zzso metabolism in tomato zzso zzso zzso Despite the importance of zzso and zzso to plant and human health, the zzso for zzso synthesis has not been zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso fruits from transgenic and control plants permitted identification of a suite of zzso genes involved in synthesis and further metabolism of zzso The pattern of zzso gene expression facilitated discovery of the tomato gene zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso The expression and zzso data establish an zzso zzso for zzso synthesis in tomato zzso zzso profiling and zzso flux analysis of ripe fruits further revealed large increases in the levels of a specific subset of zzso zzso However, while increased levels of these human zzso zzso may be desirable, there were no increases in levels of zzso flavor zzso
