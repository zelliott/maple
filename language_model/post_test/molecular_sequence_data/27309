A minor core zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso functions of zzso have been documented in zzso using zzso zzso its definitive role in zzso replication remains zzso In this study, using a recently developed zzso zzso reverse zzso system for zzso we examined the importance of zzso in virus zzso We show that zzso is active early in zzso consistent with a role as part of the zzso or packaging complex, and that its action can be provided in trans by a newly developed complementary cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso segment zzso zzso was zzso to reveal the zzso sequences required for replication or packaging, which subsequently enabled the construction of a zzso zzso expressing enhanced green fluorescent zzso These data confirm that one of the 10 zzso segments of zzso can be replaced with a zzso zzso containing the essential packaging and replication signals of zzso and the coding sequence of a foreign zzso
