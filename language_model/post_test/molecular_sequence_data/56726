The zzso sequences of the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were determined by using zzso selected from the known zzso zzso zzso zzso for these determined zzso sequences were used to sequence the zzso When this technique was applied to the DNA of 10 unrelated patients with zzso zzso zzso the following eight different zzso in the coding region were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found repeatedly in unrelated individuals, even in the zzso zzso The context with respect to a zzso at zzso zzso was compatible with a single origin for this zzso and it may represent a balanced zzso In normal subjects, five differences from the published zzso sequence were zzso
