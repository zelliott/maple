The zzso potential of zzso C virus zzso core protein has been demonstrated, but the precise mechanism of cell transformation triggered by zzso core is still zzso This study shows that zzso expression of zzso core protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso zzso At the zzso stage, clones that expressed zzso core zzso demonstrated zzso instability seen as disruption of the zzso zzso cell checkpoint leading to increased zzso Transformation was completed by the loss of DNA and resistance to zzso induced by serum zzso zzso cells acquired a capacity for zzso independent growth and absence of contact zzso zzso of these transformed cells into severe combined immune zzso zzso mice led to formation of solid zzso zzso Transformation and zzso of zzso cell lines coincided with a zzso to zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso Thus, long-term zzso core expression alone is sufficient for complete transformation of zzso zzso that can then induce tumors in a susceptible zzso This data suggests that zzso transformation by zzso core may occur through primary stress, induction of zzso instability, and further zzso zzso rescue of surviving zzso zzso
