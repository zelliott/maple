Studies on zzso II zzso zzso zzso type zzso have suggested that interaction between the two highly zzso zzso zzso in the 7th zzso domain zzso and the zzso in the 2nd zzso is critical for linking the zzso II binding and zzso zzso protein zzso In the zzso II zzso type zzso the zzso is zzso zzso in 2nd zzso however, there is no zzso zzso in the 7th zzso and zzso occupies the analogous position to zzso of the zzso zzso this zzso with Ala reduced zzso affinity to zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but retained the ability of the zzso to reduce zzso levels in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of the zzso does not mimic the role of zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso upon zzso II zzso We have also shown that the zzso zzso of the zzso with the 7th zzso similar to that of wild type zzso can couple to zzso like the zzso and bind the zzso zzso with high zzso Since the zzso II is shown to bind to both the zzso and the zzso in an identical manner, we propose that the absence of zzso in the 7th zzso of the zzso does not prevent the zzso from zzso to zzso rather may contribute to the freedom of the zzso to couple to zzso zzso in both zzso zzso dependent and independent manners upon zzso II zzso
