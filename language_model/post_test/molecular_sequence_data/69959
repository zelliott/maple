The segment polarity gene zzso zzso encodes a novel signaling protein that mediates local zzso interactions in the developing zzso zzso Here we describe the existence of an zzso gene family in the zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso sonic zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso floor plate, and zzso fin zzso zzso associated with polarizing activities in various zzso zzso The pattern of zzso expression in zzso zzso affecting zzso structures, together with the consequences of its zzso expression in normal zzso is consistent with a role for zzso in floor plate zzso By expressing zzso in transgenic zzso zzso we also demonstrate a strong functional conservation between the fish and fly zzso zzso
