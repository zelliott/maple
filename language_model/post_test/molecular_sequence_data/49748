Recent evidence, obtained in a zzso zzso zzso II zzso system, indicated that the promoter escape stage of zzso requires template DNA located downstream of the zzso zzso In the absence of downstream DNA, very early zzso complexes are unable to zzso transcripts longer than approximately 10-14 zzso In contrast, once transcripts longer than approximately 15 zzso have been zzso an extended region of downstream DNA is no longer required zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work, we sought to define precisely when, during the synthesis of the first zzso zzso bonds, downstream DNA is zzso We report that, for complete promoter escape, downstream DNA extending to position zzso is zzso The zzso can be forced to arrest at several points prior to the completion of promoter escape by removing downstream DNA zzso to positions zzso The positions at which the zzso arrests appear to be determined by the length of available downstream DNA, with arrest occurring at a relatively fixed position of approximately 28 zzso to the zzso end of the zzso A similar requirement is observed for zzso zzso zzso the formation of the first zzso bond of nascent zzso In addition, we show that the requirement for a downstream region is independent of downstream DNA zzso suggesting that the requirement reflects a general zzso Taken together, our results indicate zzso that downstream DNA is required continuously through the synthesis of the first zzso zzso bonds of nascent zzso and zzso that a major zzso change in the zzso complex likely occurs only after the completion of promoter zzso
