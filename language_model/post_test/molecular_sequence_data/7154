zzso protein A zzso is required for zzso virus zzso DNA replication in zzso and for zzso zzso repair zzso Here we report that zzso and the human repair protein zzso specifically interact both in zzso and in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso revealed that both of the largest zzso of zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso at distinct zzso A domain involved in zzso the interaction with zzso was located between zzso zzso 153 and zzso zzso of highly zzso motifs within this region identified two zzso that were deficient in binding zzso in zzso and highly defective in zzso both in zzso and in zzso A second domain zzso the interaction with zzso was identified within the first 58 zzso in zzso zzso of this region, however, only moderately affects the zzso activity of zzso in zzso Finally, the zzso complex is shown to have a greater affinity for damaged DNA than zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the interaction between zzso and zzso is required for zzso but that only the interaction with zzso is zzso
