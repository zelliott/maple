zzso binding of a synthetic DNA zzso with zzso zzso factor zzso has been studied in zzso of human colon zzso zzso zzso For binding we used zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA duplex containing an zzso recognition site zzso in which one of zzso zzso groups was replaced by a chemically active zzso zzso zzso Using gel zzso under zzso conditions zzso zzso followed by zzso revealed selective irreversible binding of zzso DNA duplex with zzso in zzso of tumor cells in the presence of other cell zzso zzso on delivery of this DNA duplex containing zzso at 3 zzso of the modified chain in an intact cell revealed that zzso DNA penetrated through the plasma membrane of tumor cells without any additional delivery zzso Using fluorescent zzso we found that the zzso DNA is initially localized in the zzso zzso laser scanning zzso revealed that subsequent treatment of the cells with zzso promoted partial zzso of the DNA zzso into the zzso
