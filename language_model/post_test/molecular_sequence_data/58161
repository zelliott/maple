A model is proposed for the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The model is broadly similar to the structure of the influenza virus zzso and is based on the identification of zzso zzso acids among zzso sequences which have counterparts in the zzso center of influenza virus zzso The influenza virus zzso site is constructed from zzso functional and framework zzso but in this model of zzso it is primarily the functional zzso zzso those that make direct contact with the zzso zzso acid, which have identical counterparts in zzso The framework zzso of the active site are different in zzso and in zzso and appear to be less strictly zzso within zzso sequences than within zzso zzso
