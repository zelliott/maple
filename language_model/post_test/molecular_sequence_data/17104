zzso are zzso that play a complex role in the resistance of zzso hosts to zzso zzso zzso is zzso by activated zzso and natural killer zzso zzso is involved in a wide range of zzso zzso including zzso activity, immune response, cell proliferation and zzso as well as the stimulation and repression of a variety of zzso zzso activity is modulated by the binding of its zzso domain to HS zzso zzso a zzso found in the zzso zzso and at the cell zzso In the present study, we zzso the interaction of isolated zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso We observed marked changes in the chemical shifts of both zzso and zzso compared with the free zzso Our results provide evidence of a binding through zzso interactions between the charged side chains of the protein and the zzso groups of zzso that does not induce specific zzso of the zzso part of zzso Our data also indicate that an zzso size of at least eight zzso displays the most efficient zzso
