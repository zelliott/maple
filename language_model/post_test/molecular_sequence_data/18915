Late zzso abundant zzso proteins are a family of zzso proteins that accumulate in response to cellular zzso Originally identified as plant proteins associated with seed zzso zzso zzso proteins have been identified in a wide range of organisms such as zzso and zzso zzso proteins are thought to protect proteins and zzso under zzso zzso Here, we characterized zzso a wheat zzso zzso protein that belongs to a class of plant proteins of unknown function, and provide evidence that zzso shares common features with zzso zzso zzso was induced during cold zzso in winter zzso Based on its zzso acid zzso zzso is highly zzso like zzso zzso despite having no significant sequence similarity to any of the known classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was soluble after zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso revealed that the structure of zzso is random and has no zzso zzso zzso exhibited in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso DNA binding activity, suggesting that zzso may protect both proteins and DNA during environmental zzso The biological relevance of these activities was supported by the zzso zzso of a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso protein in the nucleus and zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso plants zzso enhanced freezing zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso represents a novel class of zzso proteins and is involved in freezing zzso
