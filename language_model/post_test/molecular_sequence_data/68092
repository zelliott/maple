We zzso rabbit zzso of zzso family protein and a zzso associated protein which has proved to be a novel zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso the binding site of zzso zzso on zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso completely inhibited the interaction of native zzso with zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso We then constructed and expressed zzso zzso for wild type and four different deletion zzso lacking zzso zzso The wild type zzso and zzso zzso lacking three zzso acids from zzso bound to zzso zzso with zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso with seven, twelve and zzso zzso acids deleted, respectively, did not bind to zzso zzso Moreover, the truncated zzso from zzso 4 to 7 zzso decreased the binding zzso These observations suggest that four zzso acids zzso zzso at the zzso portion of zzso play an important role in the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso
