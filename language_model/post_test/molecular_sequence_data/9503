zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso functions in zzso zzso formation and nuclear movement in budding and zzso zzso A zzso zzso is also expressed by the zzso fungus zzso zzso which exhibits different nuclear movement challenges from its zzso zzso Presented here is a zzso zzso crystal structure and zzso analysis of the zzso motor domain zzso Compared to the previously published zzso zzso zzso structure zzso zzso displays differences in the zzso of some of its zzso motifs and peripheral zzso Unlike zzso the salt bridge between zzso I and zzso II in zzso is zzso Most of the zzso I, and the adjoining region of zzso zzso are also zzso instead of zzso into the active site zzso as is observed in zzso These aspects of zzso are highly reminiscent of the zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso II salt bridge and zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso differences in the disposition of secondary structure elements in the small lobe zzso zzso and zzso at the edge of the MD are also apparent even though it contains approximately the same number of zzso as zzso These differences may reflect the unique zzso properties we measured for this zzso which include a lower zzso zzso rate relative to zzso or they could relate to its interactions with different regulatory companion proteins than its budding zzso zzso
