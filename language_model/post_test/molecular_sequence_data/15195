The zzso zzso zzso produces zzso zzso crystal zzso that are deposited in their spore mother zzso When susceptible zzso larvae zzso these spore mother cells, the zzso get zzso in the alkaline gut zzso Of zzso 140 zzso proteins described thus far, zzso protein zzso has been applied extensively as the main ingredient of spray zzso as well as the principal zzso introduced into crops as zzso for agricultural crop zzso The 135 zzso zzso zzso upon zzso by the zzso is processed successively at the zzso and zzso by the insect zzso zzso to generate a 65 zzso zzso core zzso The activated core protein interacts with specific receptors located at the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of cells and eventual death of the zzso A zzso population of zzso zzso displayed zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A careful zzso analysis of zzso insects revealed an altered zzso zzso The altered zzso profile resulted in improper processing of the zzso protein and as a consequence increased the zzso zzso of zzso The 135 zzso zzso insect zzso population processed the protein to the biologically active 65 zzso core zzso while the resistant insect zzso population yielded a mixture of 95 zzso and 68 zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of these 95 and 68 zzso zzso produced by gut juices of resistant insects revealed an intact zzso zzso gene zzso profiling by zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed and demonstrated to be responsible for proper processing of zzso zzso The zzso population displaying resistance to zzso do not show an altered sensitivity against another zzso zzso zzso The implications of these observations in the context of the possibility of development of resistance and its management in zzso zzso to zzso through transgenic crop zzso are zzso
