We have isolated and zzso a full-length zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso 70 zzso heat shock zzso zzso zzso The protein coding region exhibited high identity with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the two genes are the result of a zzso zzso event which occurred in zzso over 30 million years zzso Also, zzso displayed a high level of identity with zzso zzso However, the identity of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was only zzso At the zzso end of the zzso zzso the identity with zzso was zzso while the identity for zzso was only zzso These data support the theory that the zzso and zzso members of the zzso family zzso well before the emergence of zzso Also, zzso contains a number of zzso elements including an zzso domain, a nuclear zzso signal and the zzso terminal zzso zzso which may have a role in zzso zzso
