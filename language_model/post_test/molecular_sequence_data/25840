zzso yellow dwarf virus zzso can be separated into two groups based on, among other criteria, zzso relationships that are presumably governed by the viral zzso zzso zzso sequences for the coding regions of coat proteins of approximately 22 K were identified for the zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso 2) zzso of zzso The zzso and zzso coat protein sequences shared zzso deduced zzso acid similarity whereas that of the zzso isolate shared no more than 51% similarity with either the zzso or the zzso zzso Other comparisons showed that these and other zzso coat protein sequences examined to date share a high degree of identity with those identified from other zzso Among zzso coat protein sequences in general, several highly zzso zzso were identified whereas other zzso differentiate zzso and zzso zzso from zzso and other zzso zzso similarities and differences among zzso coat proteins zzso zzso are consistent with the zzso relationships exhibited by these zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons between zzso zzso that share common zzso zzso indicate that it is unlikely that these coat proteins are involved in zzso zzso
