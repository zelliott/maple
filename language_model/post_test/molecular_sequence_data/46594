We have investigated the folding behavior of zzso and zzso zzso versions of the zzso zzso zzso coiled zzso derived from the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso indicate that folding occurs along multiple routes with nucleation sites located throughout the zzso The similarity in zzso energies of the different routes together with an analysis of intrinsic zzso zzso indicate that minimal zzso is present before a productive collision of the two zzso However, approximately one-third to one-half of the total zzso structure is formed in the zzso transition state zzso For the zzso zzso version, folding occurs along a single robust zzso Here, the region nearest the zzso with the least zzso zzso is structured in the transition state whereas the region farthest from the zzso with the most zzso is completely zzso zzso the existence of transition state zzso and the selection of folding routes critically depend on chain zzso
