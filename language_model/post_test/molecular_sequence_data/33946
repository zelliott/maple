zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that is dependent on its host cell for zzso zzso imports zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and instead uses zzso zzso to convert imported zzso into zzso for DNA zzso The genes zzso zzso zzso have been recently shown to be zzso controlled by a zzso regulator called zzso In this study, we provide direct evidence that zzso coli zzso is a zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso encodes its zzso zzso We showed that zzso binds specifically to two zzso boxes upstream of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso we confirmed that these zzso boxes function as an operator since they were necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso We validated our in zzso findings with reporter studies in zzso coli showing that both zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoters in zzso This in zzso repression was reversed by zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduces zzso zzso levels, these results suggest that zzso activity is modulated by a zzso zzso
