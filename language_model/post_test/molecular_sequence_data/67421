The role zzso play in defending plants against zzso feeders such as zzso and zzso is currently not clear as these zzso may avoid bringing zzso from the zzso sap into contact with zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effects of high levels of zzso and zzso zzso on life history traits and zzso gene expression in two sibling species, B and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso decreased the average zzso rate of both species and reduced the survival and zzso rate of Q zzso High levels of zzso zzso decreased the zzso rate and survival of zzso stages of the B species and the zzso rate of both zzso zzso analyses revealed two major zzso between the B and Q zzso First, specific zzso genes zzso and zzso were significantly induced during exposure to zzso zzso only in zzso This may reflect the genes putative involvement in zzso zzso zzso and explain the zzso good performance on plants accumulating zzso zzso Second, the zzso expression of eight of the 10 zzso genes zzso was higher in the Q species than in the B zzso Interestingly, four of these genes were induced in B in response to high levels of zzso It seems, therefore, that the B and Q species differ in their zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso that are profitable if the probability of experiencing the stress is small and its severity is low, while Q invests significant resources in being always zzso for a zzso
