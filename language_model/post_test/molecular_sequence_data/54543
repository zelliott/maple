The zzso zzso represent an important source of zzso compounds that are widely used as an ingredient in functional zzso Recently, the strain zzso zzso zzso was reported as a potential zzso for the industrial production of zzso due to its high yields of zzso zzso In this work, we used a zzso strategy to clone the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as a previous step for zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso size with a zzso similarity with other zzso zzso strains and between 1 to zzso identities with other zzso zzso This gene encodes for a 525 zzso acids protein with zzso similarity with other zzso zzso strains and between 11 to zzso similarities with other zzso zzso Finally, an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure model was predicted base on its similarity with other zzso zzso 32 family zzso The active site was located inside the zzso domain and was formed for zzso polar and charged zzso zzso In zzso these results shows the high level of sequence conservation between zzso zzso strains and represent a first step towards the development of a zzso production industrial process using zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso
