zzso zzso is an important cause of urinary tract infection zzso particularly among young women, and is second only to zzso zzso coli as the most frequent cause of zzso The molecular mechanisms of urinary tract colonization by zzso zzso remain poorly zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso strain zzso which we have termed zzso factor B zzso zzso is a zzso zzso repeat protein that is expressed on the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso also functions as a major cell surface zzso zzso To characterize the role of zzso we generated an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso by interruption with a group II zzso The zzso zzso had a significantly reduced ability to bind to zzso and zzso Furthermore, we show that a zzso protein containing the putative binding domain of zzso binds specifically to zzso and zzso zzso was not involved in zzso in a mouse model of zzso however, we observed a striking zzso zzso zzso to human zzso zzso We have also identified genes zzso to zzso in other zzso which, like zzso appear to be located on zzso zzso Thus, our data indicate that zzso is a novel zzso of zzso zzso that contributes to cell surface zzso mediates zzso to zzso and zzso and exhibits zzso for human zzso zzso
