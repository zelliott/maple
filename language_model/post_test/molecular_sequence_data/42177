zzso in the tumor zzso gene zzso have been detected in many zzso zzso gene zzso are also known to be involved in the progression of human zzso zzso We investigated structural zzso in the entire coding region of the zzso gene in primary human zzso zzso using zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso Of 25 samples obtained from patients, 6 zzso were found to have zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso products revealed 6 point zzso resulting in single zzso zzso in the regions of zzso 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 of this zzso zzso Five of 6 cases with zzso zzso were zzso with zzso or high-grade zzso Interestingly, the one remaining case was a zzso zzso and superficial zzso zzso In this early stage zzso zzso loss of the zzso gene was also found, using a zzso chain zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso Our findings are in agreement with previous observations that zzso zzso occurred in a high percentage of high grade or invasive zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso loss of the zzso gene were also detected in a zzso and zzso tumor in the present study, it is suggested that the zzso gene is involved in early stages of some zzso zzso as well as in their late zzso
