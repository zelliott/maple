We present the mapping of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have been described as binding their zzso zzso The zzso were identified using zzso overlapping zzso scans prepared by spot zzso To identify zzso essential for binding within the two zzso each position was replaced by all other zzso zzso The zzso peptides were further characterized with respect to zzso affinity and their zzso of the zzso zzso One zzso zzso binds to zzso which are completely buried in the X-ray structure of zzso zzso of this hidden zzso is enhanced upon binding of the zzso zzso which recognizes a zzso zzso located zzso The recognition of the hidden zzso zzso as well as the cooperative binding zzso of the two zzso provides evidence that zzso can adopt a zzso state other than that observed in the crystal zzso
