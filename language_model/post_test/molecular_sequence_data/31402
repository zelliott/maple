zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso are being engineered to treat zzso We zzso zzso technology to generate a novel zzso zzso (named zzso that binds an zzso of zzso distinct from that of zzso Although these zzso bind to the same cell surface zzso they have different cell distribution zzso After zzso of zzso almost zzso of the total zzso reaches the zzso compared to less than zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso from zzso whereas zzso remains bound to the zzso zzso zzso distribution is not affected by the zzso binding zzso thus zzso this mechanism as the reason for the difference in zzso trafficking of zzso versus zzso Each of zzso and zzso was zzso with either a small zzso or zzso zzso to better understand the influence of zzso on cellular zzso Relative to zzso alone, zzso zzso resulted in a higher concentration of zzso in the zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso did not affect cell trafficking to the zzso Given the importance of zzso zzso these results demonstrate the importance of understanding the influence of the zzso on cell trafficking for ultimate zzso of treatment zzso
