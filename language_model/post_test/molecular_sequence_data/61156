The copper zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso metal zzso into zzso by an unknown zzso We demonstrate here that this process involves the cooperation of three distinct regions of the copper zzso for zzso zzso an zzso zzso I zzso to the zzso zzso a central portion zzso zzso zzso to zzso and a short zzso zzso unique to zzso molecules zzso zzso These regions fold into distinct zzso zzso as revealed through zzso protection zzso The biological roles of the zzso zzso zzso were examined in zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso I was found to be necessary only under conditions of strict copper zzso zzso I and zzso were not interchangeable in zzso zzso the specificity of the corresponding zzso A putative copper site in zzso II was found to be irrelevant to zzso zzso activity, but zzso zzso invariably required a zzso in zzso III that binds zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso changes in zzso III and also enhanced zzso formation of the zzso Our results are consistent with a model zzso zzso I recruits cellular copper, zzso II zzso target recognition, and zzso III, perhaps in concert with zzso I, mediates copper zzso into zzso
