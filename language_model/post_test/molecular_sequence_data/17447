Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that operate during differentiation of zzso dividing zzso cells into zzso lags way behind what is known about other zzso zzso Given the evolutionary conservation of the zzso process, we screened for mouse proteins that could specifically activate early zzso promoters in zzso zzso zzso cells, when fused to the zzso zzso domain zzso Our screen yielded the zzso gene that encodes a short zzso of 45 zzso zzso We show that a zzso fusion protein activates expression of reporter genes through the promoters of the early zzso genes zzso and zzso and that this zzso is dependent on the zzso protein zzso zzso is transcribed predominantly in mouse primary zzso and in zzso of female zzso undergoing the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of primary zzso and zzso and to specific type A zzso cells, suggesting it might play a role in the processes leading to zzso zzso The potential functional relationship between zzso and zzso proteins that regulate expression of early zzso genes is zzso
