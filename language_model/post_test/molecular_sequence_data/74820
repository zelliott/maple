The crystal structure of a zzso from zzso zzso has been solved by the molecular replacement method and is reported to a resolution of zzso zzso This zzso belongs to family 19 of the zzso zzso zzso have been obtained in the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso solution and two zzso zzso molecules have been identified in the zzso zzso of the zzso at zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso bind to the protein via an extensive network of interactions which also involves many hydrogen bonds zzso by water zzso underlying their role in the zzso zzso A complex of the zzso with a zzso zzso has been zzso using the experimental interactions observed for the bound zzso zzso This model allows to define four major zzso interacting regions in the zzso zzso zzso located around the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the short segment zzso containing the second zzso zzso zzso the region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso segment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Water molecules from the crystal structure were introduced during the modeling zzso allowing to pinpoint several additional zzso involved in zzso binding that were not previously reported in studies of zzso 19 zzso zzso This work zzso the role played by zzso hydrogen bonding in zzso binding as well as in the zzso mechanism of the zzso family 19 zzso Finally, a new sequence motif for family 19 zzso has been identified between zzso zzso and zzso
