The zzso of the three zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is investigated by CD, zzso and extensive computer simulations in zzso solution and a zzso zzso The structural analysis of these zzso designed to stabilize different regions of the sequence in zzso zzso is an important step in addressing the correlation between zzso content and binding affinity and zzso in this zzso zzso zzso from CD and zzso zzso of all three zzso in zzso solution indicate the presence of zzso only in regions containing a zzso zzso zzso Upon addition of zzso the three zzso display differences in the anticipated increase in zzso zzso The high-resolution structures produced at zzso zzso indicate specific differences in the extent and location of the zzso zzso These zzso provide insight into the biological profiles of these zzso reported in the previous manuscript zzso et zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso Since all three zzso are zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso have been previously identified as containing the binding zzso and display similar binding zzso we conclude that this zzso feature is important for the interaction between the zzso and the zzso The extent of the zzso zzso the zzso and the presence of a hinge in the central region of the zzso play roles in the observed efficacy as measured by antagonism of zzso zzso zzso zzso The most active analogue consists of zzso segments from zzso zzso and zzso separated by a zzso centered at zzso
