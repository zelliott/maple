The zzso zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was labeled with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso pump activity in the absence but not in the presence of zzso The labeled protein was zzso and zzso with zzso After isolation and sequencing of zzso peptides two zzso zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequences of the obtained zzso peptides were zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso From zzso of zzso kidney zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso 181 of the 183 zzso acids which overlap in the sequence derived from the zzso and the zzso peptides were zzso and the two zzso are due to single base zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence derived from the cloned zzso with sequences of zzso zzso zzso communicated by other laboratories revealed zzso zzso and zzso identity with sequences from bovine adrenal zzso from bovine kidney zzso and from zzso zzso of bovine zzso Between zzso and zzso identity was obtained with sequences from zzso and zzso The data show that the zzso zzso of zzso is highly zzso during zzso They indicate organ and species specificity in zzso
