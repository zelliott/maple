A gene coding for a DNA zzso beta from the zzso zzso Miranda zzso belonging to the zzso zzso was cloned zzso zzso zzso using the information from eight peptides of the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso The gene encodes for a protein of zzso zzso acids which is very similar to the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences published, but has three different zzso in highly zzso zzso At the zzso acid level, the identity of zzso beta with zzso pol beta and pol zzso from other zzso was between zzso and zzso zzso Miranda zzso beta protein has an zzso sequence similar to that described in the zzso zzso zzso pol zzso which suggests that the zzso beta plays a role in the zzso Northern and Western analyses showed that this zzso zzso gene is highly expressed both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that, in addition to replication of zzso in zzso cells, this zzso may have another function in zzso cells, such as DNA repair role similar to that which has extensively been described in a vast spectrum of zzso zzso
