zzso temperature zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequences was zzso to monitor the zzso population present in water and sediments of a small zzso lake, zzso Pot, in the English Lake zzso The production of zzso zzso profiles due to the generation of zzso chain reaction zzso artifacts initially proved zzso The use of a zzso zzso in the zzso was found to be essential and fully zzso protocols were established and tested to ensure confidence that the zzso profiles truly reflected sequence zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso population to be less diverse in water than in zzso The most genetic diversity was observed in zzso profiles of zzso DNA isolated in winter and the least was in zzso DNA isolated in zzso DNA sequencing analysis of bands recovered from zzso gels revealed the presence of two zzso zzso One clustered with zzso species and the other with the zzso Many sequences showed low DNA sequence similarity to known zzso suggesting that zzso Pot harbors previously zzso zzso zzso
