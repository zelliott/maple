Fourteen zzso zzso cell lines were generated and assessed for the presence of structural zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Single or multiple changes were observed in 11 of the zzso zzso of the zzso gene were most frequent and documented for 10 lines by zzso using the zzso zzso 240 and zzso zzso sequencing studies and Southern zzso zzso A detailed study was performed in one of the cell lines zzso 4) for which material of the original tumor sample was zzso Two point zzso identified by sequencing zzso derived from the cell line were also present in the original tumor zzso In contrast, DNA prepared from zzso of the same patient did not show the zzso Six of the 14 lines demonstrated zzso zzso while zzso changes were observed in zzso The presence of zzso was associated with shorter survival of this group of patients with aggressive zzso None of the other changes present as single or composite zzso were correlated with clinical outcome zzso
