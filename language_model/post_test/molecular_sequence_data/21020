zzso zzso max zzso zzso is one of the most important crops for oil and protein zzso Improvement of stress tolerance will be beneficial for soybean seed zzso 

Six zzso genes zzso zzso zzso finger protein were identified and their expressions zzso responded to drought, salt, cold and zzso zzso The six zzso were nuclear proteins and showed ability to bind the zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso played a major role in DNA zzso Using a zzso zzso system, we find that zzso to zzso had zzso suppression activity whereas zzso did not zzso In zzso zzso the zzso can form zzso and zzso with the other zzso except zzso The zzso plus the variable regions but not the zzso is required for the zzso zzso zzso plants zzso the zzso showed salt tolerance when compared with the wild type zzso This tolerance was likely achieved by diminishing the zzso stress through regulation of downstream zzso 

These results provide important clues for soybean stress tolerance through manipulation of zzso zzso zzso
