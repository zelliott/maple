The purpose of the current study was to determine if saliva contains zzso that can be used as diagnostic tools for zzso syndrome zzso Twenty seven zzso patients and 27 zzso healthy controls were recruited for these zzso zzso zzso saliva was collected from the Wharton's duct using a zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso were processed for mass zzso analyses on a zzso 2000 zzso laser zzso zzso time of flight zzso zzso mass zzso Raw data were analyzed using zzso tools to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of saliva samples were highly zzso and the mass zzso generated were very rich in peptides and zzso fragments in the zzso Da zzso Data analysis using zzso tools resulted in several zzso models being built and several zzso zzso One model based on 7 putative zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso and an accuracy of zzso One zzso was present only in zzso samples and was identified as a zzso zzso originating from human basic zzso zzso protein 3 zzso We conclude that zzso zzso detected by high-resolution mass zzso coupled with powerful zzso tools offer the potential to serve as zzso tools for zzso
