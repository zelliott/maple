The cell surface of zzso microbes is critical in directing their interactions with the zzso The discovery of a 120 zzso zzso zzso on the zzso or zzso form of zzso zzso has zzso the molecular basis of zzso interactions in zzso zzso has three structural zzso zzso an zzso zzso domain that spans the cell zzso zzso a zzso zzso growth zzso domain that may bind zzso zzso and zzso a central domain of many zzso or 25 zzso repeats arrayed in zzso The repeat is zzso to zzso a zzso zzso and binds zzso zzso and zzso receptors on host zzso zzso expression is altered on genetically related strains of B zzso differing in zzso and zzso how zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso also evokes zzso and zzso immune responses in acquired resistance to B zzso that may help clear the fungus in the zzso These observations on zzso provide new insight into a key zzso factor and zzso of the fungus and may ultimately help in designing new ways to zzso treat, and prevent zzso
