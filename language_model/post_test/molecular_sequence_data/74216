The zzso zzso zzso is produced by zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we identified seven strains of zzso zzso containing the zzso gene zzso These strains could be classified into zzso and low-level zzso producers relative to the levels of zzso production by indicator strains in zzso This zzso was dependent upon the zzso levels of the structural zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis upstream of zzso in the zzso and low-level zzso strains revealed differences at zzso position zzso relative to the zzso start zzso Interestingly, the zzso start site was present upstream of the point zzso indicating that both groups of strains have the same promoter zzso and that the differential expression of zzso and zzso zzso occurred subsequent to zzso zzso In addition, zzso fusion expression was higher when it was regulated by the sequences of strains with high-level zzso activity than when it was regulated by the comparable region from strains with low-level zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso or low-level zzso expression is dependent on the presence of a G or a T zzso at position zzso relative to the zzso zzso start site in zzso zzso zzso zzso
