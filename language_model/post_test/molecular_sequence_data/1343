The specificity of zzso trafficking in inflammation is controlled by the interactions of zzso with zzso zzso Reliable zzso studies of zzso interactions would benefit from cell lines that express consistent high levels of zzso zzso We describe zzso two new Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell lines in which the genes for zzso receptors zzso and zzso have been incorporated into identical positions in the host zzso zzso is the primary zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is the primary zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both receptors are expressed at zzso copies per cell, substantially higher levels than in previous cell lines, and both are competent for binding and zzso by the zzso zzso for these zzso Using these cell lines we confirm that zzso and zzso can act as an zzso and an zzso respectively, of zzso In addition, we show that zzso is an zzso of zzso and zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso sequences reveals several positions that are identical in zzso and zzso but different in zzso and zzso suggesting that these zzso acids play a role in zzso zzso
