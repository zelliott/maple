A wide variety of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified using data emerging from the various zzso zzso sequencing zzso Although many of these elements are clearly members of the previously described zzso group of zzso zzso a substantial number, including elements from a variety of zzso and animals, belong to a distinct and previously zzso zzso We refer to these latter elements as the zzso group after a representative from zzso Like the members of the zzso group, zzso elements zzso proteins bearing reverse zzso zzso and zzso H zzso zzso similar to those of long terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso analyses based on alignments of zzso and zzso zzso however, indicate that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso in coding capacity also support the distinction between the two zzso For instance, we found that zzso elements all zzso a protein domain which is similar in sequence to the DNA zzso of certain zzso whereas this domain is absent from all zzso zzso Together, the zzso and zzso groups of zzso zzso contain elements with an astonishing diversity in structures, with variations in the nature of the associated repeat sequences and in the arrangement and complement of coding zzso In addition they contain elements with some surprising features, such as zzso zzso and long overlapping open reading zzso
