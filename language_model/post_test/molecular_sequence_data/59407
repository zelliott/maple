The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso signal sequence was further zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in both the precursor and zzso forms was observed when the protein was expressed from both low- and zzso zzso zzso of the cells followed by zzso with zzso zzso suggests that the precursor is zzso while the signal zzso form is present in the soluble zzso zzso data on the processing of zzso a native zzso zzso showed much more rapid processing and zzso but nevertheless still revealed zzso zzso zzso
