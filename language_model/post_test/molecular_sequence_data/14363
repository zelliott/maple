zzso zzso a priority environmental zzso is hazardous to humans and zzso However, the information relating to the zzso degradation pathways and their zzso remain zzso 

zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso activated sludge and was shown to degrade zzso Two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso of zzso This indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso by two different zzso namely the zzso pathway, and the zzso zzso zzso (also referred to as the zzso zzso A gene cluster zzso was identified in a zzso zzso DNA zzso of a zzso library, which cluster zzso the following zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Four genes zzso were expressed in zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene products were shown to convert zzso to zzso zzso to MA and MA to zzso respectively by in zzso activity zzso 

The zzso sequencing, and characterization of these genes along with the functional zzso degradation studies identified zzso zzso zzso and MA as zzso in the degradation zzso of zzso by zzso zzso This is the first conclusive report for both zzso and zzso zzso degradation of zzso by one zzso
