zzso kinds of the zzso zzso or zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which were prepared by chemical modifications of an zzso hydrolysate of zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined for oral zzso activity by gastric zzso with bovine serum zzso zzso in zzso into zzso zzso The gastric zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited the most marked oral zzso activity in terms of enhanced production of serum zzso zzso zzso Some derivatives showed a less marked zzso and others were totally zzso Thus the oral zzso of test zzso derivatives of zzso in zzso was dependent upon their chemical zzso
