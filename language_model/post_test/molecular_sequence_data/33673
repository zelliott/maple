The two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished induction of both zzso and the resistance to zzso zzso and survival in the stationary phase, suggesting that zzso might be a global zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso were investigated at a transcript and protein level using zzso amplification of zzso ends experiments, real-time reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was actively transcribed and the promoter sequences corresponded to a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression as well as that of the zzso genes was positively zzso the level of transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso genes were, respectively, increased zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso zzso I zzso showed that zzso specifically bound to tandem repeats centered at positions zzso and zzso upstream from the zzso and zzso zzso start zzso Interestingly, the binding site at zzso overlapped the zzso region of the zzso promoter, although the region essential for induction lies at the beginning of the zzso This result indicates that zzso is most probably only one component of a novel regulatory system involved in the expression of zzso in zzso zzso
