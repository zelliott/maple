Studies of zzso by zzso zzso II have revealed two promoter zzso the zzso motif and the zzso zzso capable of directing specific zzso zzso Although binding to the zzso motif by one of the components of the zzso machinery has been shown to be the initial recognition step in zzso complex formation, many promoters that lack a traditional zzso motif have recently been zzso In such zzso zzso the zzso element is critical in positioning zzso zzso zzso Various zzso elements have been described and classified according to sequence zzso These zzso elements are recognized specifically by zzso zzso zzso between these zzso proteins and components of the zzso zzso machinery provides a means through which a zzso competent complex can be zzso
