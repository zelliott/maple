A clear picture of animal relationships is a prerequisite to understand how the zzso and ecological diversity of animals evolved over zzso Among others, the placement of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso has fundamental implications for the origin and evolution of various animal organ zzso Their position, however, has been inconsistent in zzso studies using one or several zzso Furthermore, zzso has been among the least stable zzso in recent animal zzso zzso which simultaneously examine many genes from many species, while zzso has not been sampled in any zzso zzso New sequence data are presented here from organisms targeted for their instability or lack of representation in prior zzso and are zzso in combination with other publicly available zzso We also designed new automated explicit methods for identifying and selecting common genes across different species, and developed highly zzso zzso tools to reconstruct relationships from gene zzso The results of the work corroborate several recently established findings about animal relationships and provide new support for the placement of other zzso These new data and methods strongly zzso previous suggestions that zzso is sister zzso to all other zzso animals, find diminishing evidence for the placement of the enigmatic zzso within zzso and place zzso with zzso and zzso The work highlights the implications that these arrangements have for zzso evolution and permits a clearer picture of ancestral zzso and life histories in the deep zzso
