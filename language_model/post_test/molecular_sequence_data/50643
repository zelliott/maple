We have studied the regulation of zzso processing of the zzso zzso by zzso mosaic virus zzso and zzso For that purpose zzso were introduced in full-length zzso clones of these zzso zzso transcripts were translated in rabbit zzso zzso and the effect of zzso on the processing was zzso These studies revealed that the zzso protein is released from the zzso zzso by an zzso zzso and remains associated with the zzso zzso probably by interaction with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso In this complex the zzso of the zzso protein is such that further zzso are very zzso This complex carries out the processing of the zzso site in the zzso The zzso protein produced by a zzso zzso that lacks the zzso coding region was efficiently processed into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso protein regulates the zzso processing by slowing it down and, on the other hand, enhances trans zzso of zzso at a zzso zzso
