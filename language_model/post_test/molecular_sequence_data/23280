In adult skeletal muscle, beta zzso heavy chain zzso gene expression is primarily restricted to slow type I zzso however, its expression is zzso in response to muscle zzso Little is known about the signaling pathways and zzso factors that mediate this important functional zzso This study demonstrates that increased binding of zzso to zzso elements in the zzso promoter is a critical event in zzso of zzso gene expression under zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso to these elements decreased while zzso binding increased with nuclear extracts from zzso muscle exposed to mechanical overload, a stimulus that increases zzso gene zzso In addition, these experiments revealed the existence of an zzso binding complex when using adult skeletal muscle nuclear extract was used but not when nuclear extracts from cultured zzso were zzso zzso proteins are competitive zzso of zzso zzso reporter gene zzso in both zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso is a weak zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso cells, which lack zzso zzso activity, but does not activate zzso gene expression in zzso zzso which have high levels of zzso These results suggest that competitive binding of zzso family proteins regulate zzso gene zzso in response to altered zzso zzso
