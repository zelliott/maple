The zzso factor zzso is essential for zzso zzso In this study, we describe a zzso zzso gene deletion in at least zzso of patients with zzso syndrome zzso a zzso of T cell zzso Loss of zzso results in enhanced proliferation and cell cycle progression via zzso of the zzso zzso and the cell cycle regulator zzso Furthermore, by examining the gene expression profile of SS cells after restoration of zzso zzso we identify several zzso genes that interfere with zzso signaling zzso including the Ras zzso Several of these genes are zzso or lost in primary SS tumor zzso These data demonstrate a tumor zzso function of zzso in human zzso cells and could help to develop new treatment strategies for human zzso with altered zzso zzso
