zzso in higher zzso species classically zzso with the generation of zzso cells in the primitive streak by zzso transformation of zzso zzso However, the primitive streak also zzso with its zzso orientation in the zzso part of the zzso the zzso (or zzso axis of the zzso zzso obtained in chick and mouse suggest that signals zzso by the zzso (or visceral zzso the zzso tissue covering the zzso zzso zzso the zzso induction cascade in the anterior part of the zzso and thereby restrict streak development to the zzso pole (and possibly initiate head development zzso In this paper we took advantage of the zzso zzso of the rabbit zzso for defining the expression compartments of the zzso molecules zzso and zzso at zzso and early zzso stages in a zzso other than the zzso The two molecules are expressed in novel expression compartments in a complementary fashion both in the zzso and in the emerging primitive zzso In zzso experiments, carried out in a zzso zzso system, zzso was removed prior to culture at defined stages before and at the beginning of zzso The zzso shows a zzso and zzso restricted zzso to express zzso a zzso gene pivotal for zzso formation, and to transform into zzso zzso zzso These results confirm for the zzso zzso that the zzso axis of the zzso is formed first as a molecular zzso in the zzso and then zzso zzso under the control of signals zzso from the zzso by zzso transformation zzso streak zzso in the zzso
