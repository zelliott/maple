A protein species zzso expressed in zzso cells with a molecular mass of 80 zzso and zzso point zzso of zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso and characterized as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso in both the zzso cycle and the zzso zzso We report the cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso and zzso a predicted protein with 787 zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso was obtained in order to analyze the zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso The protein is present in the zzso fluid, cell wall enriched zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells as demonstrated by western zzso and zzso zzso The expression analysis of the zzso gene was performed by quantitative real-time zzso and results demonstrated an increased expression in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso was also used to evaluate the zzso expression when the fungus grows on media with zzso and ethanol as sole carbon sources and in different iron zzso The results demonstrated that zzso transcript is over expressed in zzso and ethanol as sole carbon sources and in zzso zzso
