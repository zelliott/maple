The goal of this study was to characterize the zzso expressed in zzso zzso of the New World zzso monkey zzso zzso and zzso monkey zzso zzso The various zzso were amplified from total zzso from zzso monkey and zzso monkey zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction and the deduced zzso acid sequences compared to those of other zzso zzso zzso monkey and zzso monkey zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso were determined to be zzso zzso to the human zzso The sequences of mature beta zzso of zzso stimulating hormone zzso from zzso monkey and zzso monkey zzso zzso acids in zzso are zzso zzso to human zzso New World zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso showed conservation of all zzso zzso and consensus zzso zzso zzso Attempts to amplify the zzso of zzso hormone from zzso monkey and zzso monkey zzso zzso were zzso Rather, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was amplified from zzso of both New World zzso Squirrel monkey and zzso monkey zzso are 143 and 144 zzso acids in length and zzso zzso with human zzso The greatest divergence is in the C zzso where all four sites for zzso zzso in human zzso responsible for delayed zzso zzso are predicted to be absent in New World zzso zzso It is likely that zzso zzso from zzso of New World primates exhibits a relatively short zzso compared to human zzso
