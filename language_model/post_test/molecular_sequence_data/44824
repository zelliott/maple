Recent identification of a zzso gene in sea urchins revealed the presence of a complement system in zzso To zzso further the components and function of the zzso complement system, we attempted to isolate an zzso zzso zzso zzso After identification of zzso zzso from zzso zzso a Japanese zzso reverse zzso amplification of zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso highly zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and C2 zzso zzso zzso Two candidate sequences were identified, and the corresponding zzso clones were isolated from a zzso zzso Surprisingly, neither clone is related to zzso but rather share the same domain structure of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and are more related zzso to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso or zzso The identification of the zzso zzso zzso amplified with zzso designed to amplify zzso or zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso the classical and alternative pathways of complement zzso
