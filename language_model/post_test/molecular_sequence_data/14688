The generation of zzso zzso of proteins is highly desired for a number of zzso and zzso zzso To this end, many strategies have been developed that allow the specific modification of certain zzso zzso acids and, more recently, zzso functional zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso involved in zzso metabolism and in the zzso of a variety of secondary zzso We became interested in the zzso modification of these zzso zzso in particular, through our studies of their in zzso zzso properties and our desire to exploit their remarkable ability to zzso zzso zzso bonds in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso via a partial zzso approach, a functional triple zzso of zzso zzso is reported here which is zzso modified at zzso by zzso zzso While zzso of the zzso zzso abolished zzso of its zzso activity, this zzso retained zzso of the activity of the unmodified zzso zzso with 9 of the 18 zzso that were zzso These included both fluorescent and zzso zzso The loss of activity observed after labeling with some zzso is attributed to direct zzso zzso rather than to zzso zzso We also demonstrate the functional zzso of this zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
