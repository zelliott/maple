zzso zzso stress zzso bone formation and zzso age-related bone loss in zzso The zzso family is widely accepted to play an important role in protecting diverse cells from zzso oxygen species zzso zzso of zzso the main zzso in bone, stimulates proliferation and differentiation as well as zzso zzso of zzso lineage zzso Despite the important role of zzso little is known about how zzso expression in bone is zzso Meanwhile, several recent studies reported that zzso zzso could play a role in zzso differentiation and bone formation by targeting various zzso zzso Here, we identified one additional crucial zzso zzso which regulates zzso by zzso zzso and thereby zzso affecting zzso zzso of zzso in zzso lineage cells increased cell zzso and inhibited zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso impaired bone zzso From in zzso analysis and validation experiments, zzso was identified as the target of zzso and restoration of zzso expression in zzso zzso rescued them from the zzso effects of zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso inhibitor to antagonize zzso proliferation and zzso with a subsequent negative effect on zzso To treat bone aging, an zzso approach targeting zzso could be of therapeutic zzso
