The zzso clone is a major cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infections in the UK and elsewhere but existing typing zzso have limited capacity to discriminate closely related zzso and are often poorly zzso between zzso Here, we report the design, development and validation of a zzso single zzso zzso zzso typing method and compare it to established methods for typing of zzso In order to identify zzso zzso the zzso of 17 zzso zzso selected to represent the breadth of zzso and zzso diversity of zzso zzso in Scotland, were determined and zzso reconstruction was carried zzso In addition to 17 zzso zzso zzso five zzso markers were included to form the basis of an zzso zzso zzso The zzso typing zzso was as zzso as zzso gel zzso and significantly more zzso than zzso protein A zzso typing for typing of a representative panel of diverse zzso zzso zzso from two zzso hospital outbreak zzso and a panel of zzso zzso obtained in zzso facilities in the east of Scotland during a 12-month zzso The zzso is a zzso and zzso approach for zzso analysis of zzso clinical zzso in zzso Unlike established methods the DNA zzso method is zzso suited for zzso comparison of identified zzso and its flexibility lends itself to supplementation with additional zzso or markers for the identification of novel zzso strains in other regions of the zzso
