The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is composed of at least three different zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of one of these chains was determined at the protein and zzso zzso Each zzso domain of the zzso chain displays the standard structural zzso The first domain is preceded by a zzso extension containing an zzso unprecedented zzso segment and a zzso zzso segment which is zzso to the zzso segments of other zzso zzso zzso Both zzso are linked together by a zzso segment, which is zzso to other zzso segments and lacks the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso chains by the formation of a zzso bridge linking the unique zzso near the zzso results in a zzso zzso zzso zzso The flexible zzso extension most likely zzso zzso The gene coding for this zzso chain is interrupted by six small zzso Each domain displays two zzso zzso at the zzso positions zzso and zzso A zzso zzso occurs at position zzso and a bridge zzso at occurs zzso We propose a crossover event as the most likely mechanism for zzso zzso zzso trees reflect the added effects of gene diversification, gene duplication, and species zzso The position of zzso zzso zzso in the tree suggests that they resemble the ancestral zzso more than the derived zzso zzso zzso zzso
