Recent work in this laboratory has shown that the gene coding for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso of the region surrounding zzso revealed that it is adjacent to zzso which codes for zzso and that these two genes are part of an zzso composed of at least two additional genes in the following order: an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso and the partial sequence of a gene with an zzso zzso that has a high degree of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso combining zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso fusion, zzso analysis with zzso zzso and the creation of zzso in zzso and zzso all indicated that the zzso genes are zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso extension was used to map the position of the zzso zzso zzso start sites upstream of zzso The start sites were found to be preceded by a sequence having similarity to zzso boxes from other zzso genes in zzso zzso and to the consensus zzso box in zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso in the zzso strain eliminated elevated levels of zzso zzso and zzso activities in response to zzso limitation and also eliminated the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in either zzso alone or both zzso and zzso did not affect the zzso or nitrogen fixation zzso of zzso zzso
