zzso how protein structures and functions have diversified is a central goal in molecular zzso zzso of very divergent proteins from model organisms, however, are often insufficient to determine the features of ancestral proteins and to reveal the evolutionary events that yielded extant zzso Here we combine zzso zzso functional, zzso and zzso analyses to reconstruct the early evolution of nuclear receptors zzso a diverse zzso of zzso regulators that play key roles in animal development, zzso and zzso By zzso the structure and functions of the ancestral zzso we zzso to current zzso zzso evolved from a zzso ancestral zzso that existed near the base of the zzso with fatty acids as possible ancestral zzso zzso tinkering with this ancestral structure generated the extraordinary diversity of modern zzso sensitivity to different zzso evolved because of subtle modifications of the internal zzso and zzso zzso evolved repeatedly because of various zzso that stabilized the active zzso in the absence of zzso Our findings illustrate how a zzso dissection of protein evolution in a zzso context can reveal the deep zzso that links apparently zzso molecular functions to a common ancestral zzso
