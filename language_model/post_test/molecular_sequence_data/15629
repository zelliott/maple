The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso carrier 13 zzso zzso This study examined zzso transport by zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso membrane zzso The zzso values for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso were similar, approximately 30 zzso The single zzso of zzso was replaced to produce the zzso zzso zzso which demonstrated functional characteristics similar to those of the wild zzso zzso zzso were made in zzso at positions that are functionally important in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was sensitive to chemical labeling by zzso zzso from both the zzso and zzso sides, depending on the zzso state of the zzso suggesting that zzso may be found in the zzso pore of the zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso in the presence of zzso but only from the zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso was insensitive to zzso although changes in its kinetic properties indicate that this zzso may be important in zzso zzso In conclusion, this work identifies zzso as a key zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso accessible in different states from both sides of the zzso zzso characterization of zzso should provide useful structural as well as functional details about zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
