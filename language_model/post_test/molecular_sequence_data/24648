zzso are zzso zzso that have become one of the most frequently studied groups of defensive zzso in zzso When tissue damage occurs, the zzso linkage is zzso by zzso known as zzso resulting in the formation of a variety of products that are active against zzso and zzso In an effort to learn more about the molecular genetic and zzso regulation of zzso zzso product formation, we analyzed leaf samples of 122 zzso zzso A distinct zzso was observed with all zzso producing primarily zzso or primarily zzso The zzso Columbia zzso and zzso zzso zzso differed in their zzso zzso therefore, the Col zzso zzso zzso zzso lines were used for mapping the genes controlling this zzso The major quantitative trait locus zzso affecting zzso versus zzso formation was found very close to a gene zzso a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which causes the formation of zzso instead of zzso during zzso zzso in the seeds of certain zzso The zzso expressed zzso zzso was able to convert zzso both to zzso and to simple zzso in the presence of zzso and thus it was more versatile than previously described zzso The role of zzso in plant defense is uncertain, because the zzso zzso zzso zzso (the cabbage zzso was found to feed more readily on zzso than on zzso zzso However, zzso are frequently used as recognition cues by specialist zzso and so the formation of zzso instead of zzso may allow zzso to be less apparent to zzso
