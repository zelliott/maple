The partial zzso acid sequence of zzso of adult chicken zzso zzso was determined by direct protein zzso zzso was prepared by limited zzso of adult chicken zzso zzso with zzso Ten peptides were then obtained by zzso this zzso with zzso zzso The zzso acid composition and zzso acid sequence of the obtained peptides were subsequently zzso By sequence comparison with the corresponding region of adult chicken zzso myosin, three zzso with differing sequences that corresponded to the same position in zzso were zzso This indicates that at least three zzso of zzso zzso exist in adult chicken zzso zzso One of the three peptides was identical to zzso zzso while the remaining two peptides were markedly zzso Furthermore, four of these ten peptides were completely different from zzso zzso These four peptides were presumed to be fragments of zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso suggest the expression of at least two species of zzso zzso heavy chain in the zzso muscle of adult zzso
