The two zzso found in zzso delta virus zzso form related but zzso secondary structures and display similar zzso properties in zzso Three of the zzso elements hypothesized to contribute zzso to the zzso core vary slightly in length between the two zzso and the differences are zzso in clinical zzso zzso functional relationships of the core sequence elements were tested by systematically exchanging sequences between the two zzso It was found that switching two of the elements zzso and zzso from one zzso to the other reduced zzso activity in zzso On the other hand, exchanging the third region zzso resulted in enhanced activity for one zzso and a smaller increase in activity for the zzso Combining exchanges did not reveal any zzso interactions involving these particular elements nor did a pattern emerge that would suggest an optimal combination of core sequences for a generalized zzso zzso zzso behavior reinforces the idea that the zzso sequences may form zzso contacts with duplex portions of the zzso but, in addition, these data suggest that there may be selective pressures on the zzso sequences in the virus that are not reflected in the in zzso zzso zzso
