a functional single zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso C zzso gene has been linked to the zzso to zzso disease zzso The implication remains zzso 

zzso for the zzso zzso was conducted on 280 unrelated Taiwanese children with zzso and zzso healthy ethnically and zzso zzso The clinical manifestations and laboratory data were zzso zzso 

the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso were overrepresented in zzso patients zzso was zzso C zzso zzso zzso than those in the controls zzso was zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso patients, those with zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were more likely to have zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso site than those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Such association was particularly strong in patients aged zzso months zzso zzso P zzso zzso The other clinical manifestations were not related to this zzso There were 160 zzso patients with coronary zzso zzso The development and the severity of coronary zzso zzso were also not associated with this zzso zzso between patients with and without zzso zzso revealed only one difference: patients with zzso were zzso 

in a cohort from a population with the world's third highest zzso of zzso we demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso during the acute phase, although its frequency is lower than that in the Japanese cohort zzso suggesting this zzso contributes to zzso zzso through induced zzso function reflected in the zzso zzso
