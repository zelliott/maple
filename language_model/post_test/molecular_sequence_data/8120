We have isolated the zzso zzso zzso which is a single copy gene located at the zzso end of mouse zzso zzso zzso exhibits a zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso which contains two zzso zzso and a putative protein zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso contain all motifs found in zzso zzso zzso zzso acids previously described to be diagnostic of either zzso or zzso are not zzso It is demonstrated that zzso protein can zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso motif zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso showed preferential expression of a zzso zzso message in adult spinal zzso and zzso In zzso zzso confirmed high expression levels in the nervous system, particularly in the spinal zzso and the zzso nerve and zzso root zzso zzso also contains two tandem zzso These zzso like zzso can mediate zzso interactions and have been described in nuclear and zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso may provide a novel route by which zzso zzso can be zzso
