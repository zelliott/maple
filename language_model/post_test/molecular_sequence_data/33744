A novel zzso of zzso was identified in a patient with zzso delay and intractable zzso The zzso deletion included 15 zzso of which zzso zzso gene zzso zzso the only gene highly expressed in the zzso Western zzso revealed reduced amount of zzso in cell zzso derived from immortalized zzso of the patient, suggesting the association between zzso zzso and the patient's zzso then 140 patients were screened for zzso zzso and four zzso zzso were zzso Although all four zzso zzso were common with parents, reduced zzso was observed in the cell zzso with a zzso zzso identified in a zzso region among zzso A full-length zzso of human zzso was identified in zzso with zzso identity to zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso brain, and zzso of which resulted in brain zzso zzso zzso we suggest that zzso is a candidate gene for zzso zzso
