We investigated the molecular basis of type I protein S zzso zzso in two unrelated Japanese families, in which both zzso developed pulmonary embolism associated with deep vein zzso zzso sequencing of amplified DNA revealed distinct point zzso in the zzso gene of the zzso which were designated protein S zzso 1 and protein S zzso zzso Additional zzso in the zzso gene were excluded by DNA sequencing of all zzso and zzso zzso In the 25-year-old Japanese male patient who carried protein S zzso 1, we identified a zzso zzso change in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site of zzso f of the zzso zzso This zzso is a novel zzso site zzso that zzso normal zzso zzso leading to zzso 7 zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso transcript would result in a truncated protein that lacks the entire zzso growth zzso domain 3 of the zzso zzso In a 31-year-old Japanese male and his younger brother who each carried protein S zzso 2, we detected a previously described zzso zzso transition at zzso position zzso in zzso 10 of the zzso zzso which predicts an zzso acid substitution of zzso by zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso Both zzso would cause zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in the impairment of zzso which is consistent with the type I zzso zzso zzso
