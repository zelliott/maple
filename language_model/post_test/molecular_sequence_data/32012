zzso zzso zzso is able to resist to high zzso of zzso through the expression of an zzso zzso zzso found in a mobile element zzso which carries the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The regulation of zzso zzso present in zzso which is controlled by a zzso regulator, zzso was characterized in the current zzso zzso of zzso promoter, or zzso promoter and zzso zzso upstream of a zzso reporter zzso identified the most probable promoter sequence within the zzso zzso zzso This region contains an zzso imperfect zzso repeat zzso which zzso a part of the zzso zzso The results of the in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso showed that the protein binds directly to the zzso promoter zzso In order to identify the zzso functional domain for sensing zzso stress and for zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso Among several single zzso acid zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso prevented zzso induction without any modification to the zzso zzso Interestingly, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso active, regardless of zzso stress conditions, indicating that the zzso most probably belong to the zzso binding zzso As such, the zzso was classified as a zzso regulator that recognizes a specific DNA zzso regulating the expression of a zzso resistance zzso
