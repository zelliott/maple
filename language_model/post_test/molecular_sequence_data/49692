To zzso the mechanism of zzso (a zzso resistance of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso group, we isolated zzso zzso sensitive to this agent using zzso Four zzso zzso showed reduced levels of resistance, at least, to zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of three zzso fragments adjacent to zzso from the zzso revealed that two partial open reading frames zzso were disrupted by a zzso zzso acid sequences of partial zzso products had strong zzso to those of zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso carried a zzso zzso inserted by zzso together with zzso zzso and by itself zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso portions, zzso Since zzso in zzso produce zzso coli cells sensitive to zzso treatments by zzso it is concluded that decreases of the minimum zzso zzso zzso of the agents for zzso zzso resulted from disruption of the zzso zzso Another zzso carried a zzso gene inserted by zzso There is no reasonable explanation why disruption of the zzso gene caused a decrease of the zzso of zzso for this zzso although zzso zzso zzso related to DNA zzso was reported to be zzso
