zzso screening of a human zzso zzso library led to the isolation of zzso clones zzso to zzso specifically expressed in zzso but zzso or not expressed in the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso transcript among zzso isolated from normal human zzso but with several transcripts ranging from zzso to zzso zzso when zzso were isolated from cultured zzso We examined the effects of zzso of zzso differentiation such as calcium and zzso acid on the production of these zzso Their amount was found to increase in the presence of high calcium zzso but to decrease in the presence of zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that A8 messages are zzso during zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso of A8 zzso shows a very high zzso zzso Because of its zzso with the zzso zzso zzso A8 is likely to zzso either to the human zzso or to a related zzso
