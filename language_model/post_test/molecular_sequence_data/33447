zzso zzso zzso cause severe problems like microbial zzso and zzso zzso in zzso oil production zzso One strategy to control zzso activity is the addition of nitrate to the injection zzso zzso waters from two zzso hot zzso degrees zzso oil zzso one with and one without nitrate treatment, were compared for zzso community structure and activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene analyses revealed higher zzso abundance but lower diversity for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene clone libraries from both fields were dominated by sequences affiliated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Potential zzso nitrate zzso zzso were exclusively found at the zzso field, possibly zzso by nitrate zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes revealed that zzso zzso zzso dominated the zzso communities, but with lower relative abundance at the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in only low abundance at both sites and were nearly exclusively affiliated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite the high abundance of zzso zzso no zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso at 80 degrees zzso zzso reduction was found at 60 degrees C in samples from the zzso field and accompanied by the growth of zzso bacterial zzso in batch zzso zzso from the zzso field generally lacked zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso can be a major player in hot oil zzso and zzso nitrate may act in zzso zzso only by zzso zzso but also by changing the overall community structure, including the stimulation of competitive nitrate zzso
