zzso mimicry between zzso zzso protein zzso 65 and host tissue zzso have been implicated in the zzso zzso of certain idiopathic zzso Here, we demonstrated that two of our previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were directed to a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 65, specifically zzso with zzso zzso of the normal human zzso These zzso also showed similar zzso zzso of hair zzso zzso and produced no reaction with other zzso zzso Both zzso strongly stained the zzso of the majority of freshly isolated zzso zzso from the normal human zzso None of these zzso showed zzso with human zzso cells and with human skin zzso zzso using total zzso extract prepared from isolated zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso specifically reacted with a molecular size of zzso zzso zzso zzso and such zzso was not observed from zzso proteins extracted from zzso cells and skin zzso zzso of zzso zzso with conventional zzso zzso further revealed that zzso zzso recognized a zzso zzso zzso protein corresponding to zzso 1/2 from the same zzso extract as zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 65 abolished this zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso Moreover, these zzso showed no zzso zzso in zzso zzso skin and also reacted zzso with cultured zzso zzso Since zzso zzso specifically recognized a zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso and the known characteristics of zzso zzso 1/2 appeared to be consistent with present results, we concluded that zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso of the previously mapped zzso zzso region of zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 65 with the entire sequence of human zzso zzso zzso revealed that a stretch of nine zzso acids of the zzso zzso sequence resembled certain regions of the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso This similarity of the zzso zzso 65 probably contributes to the zzso zzso zzso Our results presented here demonstrate direct evidence of zzso zzso between zzso zzso 65 and human zzso zzso zzso We speculate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso might be an important target for skin zzso
