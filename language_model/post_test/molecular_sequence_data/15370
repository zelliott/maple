zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso type III zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso to produce zzso In our recent work zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso a zzso type III zzso gene zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and functional analyses revealed this zzso zzso to be a zzso In this study, another zzso type III zzso gene zzso and its corresponding zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso However, functional and zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with both, zzso and zzso zzso DNA gel zzso analysis indicated that there are two to four zzso copies in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis revealed that zzso is highly expressed in the zzso and in young leaves, but not in the roots of the zzso zzso transcripts in leaves were zzso by pathogen infection and zzso zzso is thought to play a crucial role in the construction of the zzso zzso found in a variety of zzso yet so far zzso have not been isolated from zzso zzso However, since zzso and zzso zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso it is possible that such compounds are also produced in that plant, albeit in low zzso
