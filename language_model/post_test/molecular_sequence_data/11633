We have isolated a unique zzso zzso zzso human zzso 4 zzso 4) of the zzso zzso gene family, whose members include pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso We have determined that the coding sequence of zzso 4 resides on a single zzso found on human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 4 was detected by Northern analysis in a number of human zzso zzso including zzso zzso skeletal muscle, heart, kidney and zzso but not zzso liver represents the most abundant zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso 4 is approximately 2 zzso in zzso which is approximately twice as large as the zzso zzso other members of this gene zzso A larger zzso zzso zzso second transcript was detected in zzso pancreatic and zzso zzso The approximately 2 zzso zzso 4 zzso was detected in cells of the human zzso leukemia line, zzso that had been treated with zzso to promote zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso zzso zzso 4 could be detected in cells treated with zzso zzso acid zzso an agent promoting differentiation toward zzso suggesting the existence of elements regulating tissue specific expression of this zzso
