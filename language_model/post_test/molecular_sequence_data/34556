The zzso zzso has proven difficult to zzso since its description as a new zzso in zzso zzso placed it with the zzso but it was unclear with which zzso if any, it should be zzso Recent identification of abundant samples of zzso has aided a zzso of its zzso as a zzso zzso evidence based on light and scanning electron zzso of recently collected specimens and on the type zzso of zzso suggested that it might be synonymous with the zzso zzso Analysis of DNA sequences from freshly isolated samples indicates that the zzso zzso is related closely to an zzso diverged, zzso group of zzso that includes several zzso zzso among them zzso zzso and zzso Comparisons of the zzso and DNA sequences of authentically identified specimens of zzso zzso indicate that it is synonymous with zzso zzso The zzso implications of this discovery are zzso
