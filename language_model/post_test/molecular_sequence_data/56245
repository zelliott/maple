We are investigating the mechanisms for deletion formation through the use of zzso which alter deletion frequency together with well characterized systems for deletion zzso We report here on three zzso which were isolated for their ability to stimulate deletions in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso is a new zzso of zzso a group of genes coding for the zzso components of the major zzso zzso complex in zzso zzso the second one, zzso may be a new zzso of zzso which codes for DNA zzso zzso and the third one, zzso has the zzso of a mismatch repair zzso Here we compare the effects of zzso in zzso genes to those of the zzso zzso on three different deletion events: zzso the deletion of short zzso zzso and zzso zzso in derivatives of zzso zzso zzso larger zzso deletions in zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our results indicate that some form of zzso processing stimulates the loss of zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is necessary for zzso zzso of zzso but this event is inhibited by zzso or its zzso zzso Each of the zzso zzso showed unique effects on different classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically deletions in zzso but had no effect on the deletion of zzso in zzso and reduced the zzso of the other deletion events tested including loss of zzso zzso in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, zzso all deletions tested to varying zzso while zzso did not affect markedly deletion formation in zzso plasmids but had a large zzso effect on both deletions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results reveal that zzso some zzso functions participate in deletion formation, zzso zzso selected for altering the zzso of one class of deletions may have totally different effects on other deletion events, and zzso the differences in zzso behavior may result in part from the ability of some pathways to discriminate among different deletion zzso such as zzso or zzso formed by zzso sequences zzso transient secondary structures stabilized by direct repeats zzso zzso zzso
