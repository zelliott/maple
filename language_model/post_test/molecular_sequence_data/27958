It is demonstrated by theoretical zzso that no favorable energy profile for zzso transfer can be obtained in a model of the zzso channel constructed with the sole five zzso zzso of the inner zzso A favorable profile is obtained upon including the effect of the remaining zzso of the five zzso The decisive role, for the exit of the zzso of the charged zzso situated at the zzso of the zzso zzso established before, is zzso zzso The role of the other elements of the channel wall zzso zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso and polar side zzso is zzso
