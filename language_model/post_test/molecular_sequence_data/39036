zzso zzso zzso is necessary for normal zzso and fertility in zzso Human zzso binding motif protein 3 zzso is structurally highly similar to the zzso zzso protein zzso and both zzso are induced in human cells at the zzso temperature (32 degrees zzso We report here the cloning of mouse zzso zzso which zzso an zzso protein with zzso identity in zzso acid sequence to that of human zzso In the zzso of adult mice, zzso zzso and protein were detected in zzso cells, but not germ cells, of zzso zzso at all zzso The expression was not observed in zzso cells of zzso but was observed in newborn and older zzso In the zzso mouse zzso cell line, the zzso expression level was increased or decreased within 12 hours after temperature shift from 37 degrees C to 32 degrees C or 39 degrees C, zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso growth suppression of zzso cells was not affected by suppression of the zzso zzso When mouse zzso was exposed to heat stress by experimental zzso the level of zzso was decreased in zzso zzso zzso may play important roles distinct from those played by zzso in zzso and zzso by regulating the gene expression in zzso zzso
