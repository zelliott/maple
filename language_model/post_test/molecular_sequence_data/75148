The Toll gene of zzso a maternal effect gene that plays a central role in the establishment of the embryonic zzso pattern, has been cloned using P element zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript from the cloned region was zzso by hybrid selection with the cloned zzso This zzso transcript zzso the Toll zzso zzso when injected into zzso zzso which proves that it is the Toll zzso The sequence of zzso suggests that the Toll protein is an integral membrane protein with a zzso domain and a large zzso zzso The putative zzso domain contains at least 15 repeats of a 24 zzso acid, zzso sequence found in both human and zzso membrane zzso
