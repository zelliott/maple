Recently we reported the characterization of zzso zzso virus zzso from a central African zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso that revealed a distant relationship to zzso isolated from a zzso zzso The present report describes a novel zzso zzso isolated from a healthy, zzso zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso another member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a variety of human zzso lines and in peripheral blood zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso monkeys zzso zzso A full-length infectious clone of zzso was zzso and genetic analysis revealed that zzso was most closely related to zzso with an zzso acid identity of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso This degree of similarity is reminiscent of that observed between zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso species of African green zzso The close relationship between zzso and zzso despite their geographically distinct zzso is consistent with evolution from a common zzso providing further evidence for the ancient nature of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, this observation leads us to suggest that the zzso lineage should be designated the zzso zzso
