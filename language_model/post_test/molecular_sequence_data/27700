To define zzso sequences in human T zzso a zzso library was constructed by zzso zzso using resting and zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso was achieved by triggering with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library screening with zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso resting peripheral blood zzso led to identification of a novel zzso termed zzso The predicted primary and secondary structure of zzso deduced from the translated zzso sequence suggest that the gene encodes a zzso protein of 92 zzso acids including a zzso leader zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso is induced in peripheral blood T zzso and zzso zzso T cell clones within 10 zzso following stimulation via zzso while zzso zzso expression is zzso by 2 zzso Although the zzso of zzso expression are similar after stimulation via the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso triggering leads to less zzso of zzso zzso than zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso 2 does not induce zzso zzso zzso expression in T cell zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso cells results in a readily zzso protein band in sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of zzso cell zzso consistent with zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis reveals a striking zzso (up to zzso identity at zzso acid zzso with other members of a recently described zzso family whose functions are yet to be zzso
