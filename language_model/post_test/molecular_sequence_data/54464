Species formation generates biological diversity and occurs when traits evolve that prevent gene flow between zzso Discerning the number and distribution of genes underlying these traits and, in a few cases, identifying the genes involved, has greatly enhanced our understanding over the past 15 years of species formation zzso by zzso and zzso and Wolf et zzso However, this work has almost exclusively focused on traits that restrict gene flow between populations that have evolved as a zzso of genetic divergence between geographically isolated zzso By contrast, little is known about the characteristics of genes associated with zzso the process by which natural selection directly zzso restricted gene flow during the formation of zzso Here we identify changes in two genes that appear to cause a flower zzso change in zzso zzso which previous work has shown contributes to zzso Both changes involve zzso zzso to genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because one change is zzso whereas the other is dominant, hybrid offspring produce an intermediate flower zzso that is visited less by zzso and is presumably zzso Thus genetic change selected to increase zzso isolation also appears to result in increased zzso zzso
