zzso of zzso bonds essential for zzso of bovine zzso was identified using a randomly zzso transcript zzso in zzso It was found that zzso of zzso bonds after zzso in positions 21, 22, zzso zzso 62 and 64 were critical for zzso capacity of zzso These zzso sites were located in the regions of zzso zzso protected by the zzso zzso against chemical modification and in the regions presumably outside the contact area as zzso These results indicate that for maintenance of zzso ability the zzso of the certain regions of the zzso backbone structure is zzso Random splitting of zzso zzso with zzso followed by separation of active and inactive molecules and identification of zzso sites developed in this work may become a general approach for studying the role of zzso zzso structure in its interaction with zzso
