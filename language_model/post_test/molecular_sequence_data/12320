The genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso from several geographic regions was evaluated by zzso sequence analysis of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and outer surface protein zzso zzso of zzso sequences spanning zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA from two unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso County, zzso and zzso zzso New zzso to zzso sequences from other zzso zzso zzso from the United States and Russia identified several zzso sequence zzso that are unique to these two zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso segment of the gene zzso outer surface protein A also revealed greater similarity of strains zzso and zzso zzso compared to other US and zzso zzso These data were further zzso by zzso zzso analysis, in which zzso and zzso demonstrated unique restriction zzso zzso Our findings suggest that substantial genetic diversity of zzso zzso rivaling that of European zzso exists among zzso from the United zzso zzso zzso and zzso are unique among all zzso zzso zzso tested to date, and though isolated from opposite zzso extremes of the North American continent, are closely zzso
