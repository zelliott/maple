One of the early genes of zzso large zzso zzso has been classified in zzso as an zzso zzso In order to determine the ability of zzso to cause the formation of zzso or tumors in zzso we generated transgenic mice harboring the zzso for zzso linked to the zzso responsive zzso promoter zzso The zzso was primarily expressed in zzso and seminal zzso but expression was also detected in heart of a single transgenic zzso The expression of the zzso in the heart of zzso line 8 mice was correlated with zzso and zzso zzso formation leading to premature death at approximately 160 days due to cardiac zzso The heart of affected animals was from zzso to zzso fold greater in weight and 2 fold greater in dimensions than normal zzso zzso zzso hearts fell short of frank tumor zzso and no zzso nor microscopic focal growth was zzso zzso the heart has a zzso zzso population with markedly enlarged cells mixed with relatively normal zzso Both cell types express zzso zzso The primary cell type affected is the zzso however, as heart proportions are zzso zzso and zzso cells must be affected either directly or zzso zzso of zzso has upset normal strict control of cell growth in these hearts to result in a new model of zzso zzso
