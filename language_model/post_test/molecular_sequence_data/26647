We recently found that several zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso when terminally attached to zzso can promote the in zzso assembly of active protein zzso (or active inclusion bodies, zzso in zzso zzso In this work, we systematically examined the zzso induced by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso with altered zzso zzso zzso electron microscopic and zzso transform infrared zzso analyses suggested that the zzso appeared to adopt an zzso zzso structure, and were likely induced by zzso structures formed by the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso analysis revealed that the zzso resided around the periphery of the cell membrane or in the zzso depending on the distribution of zzso pairs on the zzso zzso which suggested that the association between the zzso and the cell membrane was zzso by the zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso zzso were further used in constructing zzso zzso tags zzso in conjunction with an zzso zzso for protein zzso and verified using two model zzso This extends the zzso approach for laboratory and potentially industrial zzso Our study might also provide new insights into zzso zzso
