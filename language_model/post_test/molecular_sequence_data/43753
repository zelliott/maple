At some stages of development, it is impossible to identify the zzso zzso worms zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the species level using zzso zzso A molecular approach utilizing genetic markers in the second internal transcribed zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA was developed to overcome this zzso The zzso sequence of each species was determined, and specific zzso zzso were designed to regions of greatest sequence difference between the zzso zzso these zzso rapid zzso procedures were developed for the specific amplification of DNA of zzso zzso or zzso zzso which are now used routinely to monitor the purity of zzso cultures and to confirm the identity of larvae derived from the zzso or zzso The application of specific zzso has major implications for studying the population biology of zzso worms in the pig zzso
