zzso is vitally required for plants at low zzso but extremely toxic for plants at elevated zzso Plants have evolved a series of mechanisms to prevent the consequences of the excess or deficit of zzso These mechanisms require zzso proteins involved in copper zzso Blue zzso proteins zzso are a class of copper proteins containing one blue zzso domain binding a single type I zzso To investigate the role of zzso in plant development and in response to zzso we isolated nine zzso zzso the putative blue zzso proteins zzso from cotton zzso zzso Meanwhile, four corresponding genes (including zzso which contain a single zzso inserted in their zzso position, were isolated from cotton zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis indicated that the nine zzso genes are zzso expressed in cotton zzso Among them, zzso and zzso were predominantly expressed in zzso while the transcripts of zzso and zzso were accumulated at relatively high levels in zzso These four genes were strongly expressed in early fiber zzso but dramatically declined with further fiber zzso In addition, these zzso genes were zzso in fibers by zzso , zzso , zzso and drought zzso but zzso in fibers by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the cell growth rate under zzso , zzso and zzso zzso These results suggested that these zzso may participate in the regulation of fiber development and in response to zzso and heavy metal stresses in zzso
