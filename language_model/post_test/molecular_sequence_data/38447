The zzso sequence of human zzso necrosis factor was measured according to two- and zzso zzso The measured frequency and probability were compared with predicted frequency and zzso Of 232 zzso sequences in human zzso necrosis factor, 64 zzso and 24 zzso sequences can be explained by the predicted frequency and the predicted probability according to a purely random zzso Of 243 zzso zzso sequences in human zzso necrosis factor, 176 zzso zzso and 42 zzso sequences can be explained by the predicted frequency and the predicted probability according to a purely random zzso No measured zzso transition probability matches the predicted conditional zzso No zzso sequences can be explained by a purely random zzso
