Known zzso of the zzso shock protein zzso system suggest that it is an zzso stress response, as are the well-studied zzso and zzso zzso However, a random approach to identify conditions and proteins that induce the zzso system has not been zzso It is also unknown whether the proteins or zzso that induce zzso are specific or if they also activate the zzso and zzso zzso This study addressed these issues for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Random zzso zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso that increase zzso zzso fusion zzso The results suggest that zzso may respond exclusively to zzso zzso zzso zzso affected zzso zzso zzso which plays a role in cell envelope zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The screen also revealed that in addition to several zzso the zzso of three novel putative inner membrane proteins zzso induced the zzso zzso We also compared induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or the three zzso or the presence of an zzso zzso zzso only induced the zzso zzso Similarly, known zzso of the zzso and zzso responses did not significantly induce the zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso zzso induced all three zzso zzso zzso is induced distinctly from the zzso and zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso may be valuable tools to probe specific signal zzso events of the zzso response in future zzso
