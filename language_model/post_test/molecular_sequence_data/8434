We have examined the role of two zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors in mouse zzso zzso zzso In organ cultures of zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso scatter zzso promoted branching of the zzso trees but inhibited the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso budding and the production of milk zzso These functional effects are paralleled by the expression of the two factors in zzso zzso is produced in zzso cells during zzso branching in the virgin zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso during zzso development at zzso The receptors of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed in the zzso cells, are not zzso In organ culture, branching zzso and zzso differentiation of the zzso zzso could be abolished by blocking expression of zzso zzso and zzso by the respective zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso could again be induced by the addition of zzso zzso and zzso We thus show that two major zzso zzso periods of zzso zzso development are dependent on sequential zzso interactions zzso by zzso and zzso
