Type 2 zzso comprise a class of zzso zzso inhibitor presumed to mediate protective functions at various locations, including the oral zzso Seven zzso genes are clustered within a zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso 2, 4, and 5, are present in saliva at significant levels but have also been reported in other secretions, such as tears, suggesting that during their evolution, these genes have acquired mechanisms directing differential zzso zzso However, their patterns of zzso which might also provide additional clues to their individual functions, have not been zzso zzso zzso protection zzso were used to examine the qualitative and quantitative distribution of expression of these seven genes within a collection of 23 adult human zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso C, was expressed at modest levels in all zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not expressed at zzso levels in any zzso The zzso 2, 4, and 5 genes were expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was restricted to the zzso and zzso zzso while zzso and zzso were expressed in these zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso studies localized expression to the zzso zzso end zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was also observed in the zzso lining of the gallbladder and seminal zzso The zzso product was detected in the zzso zzso and zzso in the kidney and zzso Despite their different adult patterns of zzso analysis of zzso 2, 4, and 5 zzso levels in infant zzso zzso demonstrated a coordinate zzso of expression of between zzso and 9 months of zzso The patterns of zzso gene expression are consistent with several proposed oral functions of the zzso zzso but also suggest they are important in other locations and that, despite their close sequence zzso they are individually zzso
