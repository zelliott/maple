We describe the identification and expression of a zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso previously thought to lack zzso The zzso gene is a zzso open reading frame that encodes a protein 70 to zzso similar to zzso from other zzso zzso possesses a single zzso copy of zzso located immediately upstream of the zzso zzso It is transcribed as a single zzso zzso zzso and, in contrast to most other zzso the level of zzso expression in zzso is unaffected by variable copper zzso during zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not prevent zzso growth, but does induce a dramatic increase in zzso for the alternative electron carrier zzso zzso Despite this adjustment, loss of zzso results in slower growth, lower zzso I content, and a decreased maximum capacity for zzso electron zzso The zzso is also more susceptible to zzso zzso during a shift from 37 to 25 degrees C, at which temperature its inherently lower zzso capacity zzso the normal slowing of electron transfer reactions at low zzso Under similar conditions, the amount of zzso message in the wild type decreases by 50% in the 1st zzso but then increases dramatically to almost three times the 37 degrees C level by 9 zzso
