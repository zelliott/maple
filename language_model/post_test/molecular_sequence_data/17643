zzso zzso factor was discovered during attempts to define the normal regulators present in cell zzso that could induce terminal differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso The zzso and subsequent cloning of both zzso and human zzso allowed the normal functions of this zzso to be zzso and indicated that it was a relatively zzso zzso of the survival, zzso and differentiation of precursor cells of the zzso zzso cell lineage as well as an zzso of mature zzso zzso zzso and human zzso as well as the zzso zzso of zzso receptors have been strongly zzso so that the biological activities and zzso characteristics of zzso are completely species zzso The evolutionary conservation of zzso is suggestive of an important role for the zzso in maintaining zzso levels and activity in zzso a role zzso supported by a series of animal experiments and clinical trials that have been performed zzso These experiments and trials have suggested that zzso will be clinically useful in zzso patients' resistance to certain infections, in enhancing the zzso responses of some patients with reduced zzso counts or defective zzso and in reducing the decline in zzso that occurs during chemotherapy or zzso therapy and bone zzso zzso The special capacity of zzso among the zzso to induce terminal differentiation in some zzso zzso is not understood in molecular zzso However, the capacity of zzso to stimulate proliferation in some zzso zzso as well argues that caution needs to be exercised in the timing of zzso administration and patient selection before considering this form of therapeutic zzso
