The variable zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an abundant surface zzso zzso that may mediate important interactions of this zzso zzso pathogen with the human zzso zzso zzso variation of zzso size, as well as sequence and zzso zzso has been described zzso Using a series of zzso zzso representing an zzso lineage of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is further shown in this study to undergo zzso phase variation in zzso which correlated precisely with the ability of zzso zzso to adhere to cultured human zzso Although no DNA zzso or sequence differences in the zzso regions zzso zzso zzso were detected between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences from this lineage revealed an zzso zzso involving a single zzso zzso in a short tract of zzso zzso near the zzso end of the mature zzso coding zzso which created a zzso zzso resulting in either a complete zzso zzso or an zzso zzso stop zzso immediately downstream of the zzso zzso Evidence for the occurrence of this zzso zzso zzso in zzso was obtained from analysis of zzso zzso sequences amplified from the joint zzso fluid of a patient with zzso zzso arthritis, which indicated that zzso phase variation occurs during zzso zzso infection in the natural zzso These results identify a distinctive zzso zzso element in the zzso gene that zzso zzso zzso adherence and highlight the importance of zzso zzso of primary gene products on the mycoplasma surface as a means of generating and maintaining functional diversity in the zzso
