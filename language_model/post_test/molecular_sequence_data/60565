The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso essential for neural development in zzso zzso Here we report the identification of three zzso zzso in the zzso We demonstrate that the mouse zzso protein can bind zzso a zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso Both zzso and section in zzso zzso studies reveal unique and complementary patterns of expression of the three mouse zzso genes and of zzso both within the central nervous system and in other developing zzso The complementary expression patterns of zzso and zzso and their in zzso interaction suggest a zzso zzso The expression of all three zzso genes in the floor plate suggests that they are likely to share the same functional properties with their zzso zzso in zzso neural development and zzso zzso The complementary expression of zzso and zzso in different subdivisions of the zzso suggests their possible function in zzso zzso and neural crest cell zzso The unique expression pattern in limb and other zzso indicates additional potential functions of the zzso gene zzso
