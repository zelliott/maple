Despite the strong conservation of zzso zzso DNA zzso cell zzso and transgenic animal studies have failed to provide a unifying hypothesis to explain the expression of both mouse and human zzso zzso Recently, sequences contained in the mouse zzso gene zzso DNA zzso to zzso were shown to contain an zzso element that stimulates zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso cells approximately zzso Earlier studies using transgenic mice had suggested that this same region is required for the zzso expression of mouse zzso zzso Since existing human zzso zzso clones lack sequences zzso to the mouse zzso zzso we isolated several human zzso and zzso artificial zzso zzso clones that contain zzso 80 zzso spanning the human zzso zzso Analysis of these clones by Southern zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction showed that they contain sequences zzso to the mouse zzso at approximately 12 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso Mouse and human sequences were 59% identical over a zzso region that contained the minimal zzso from the mouse zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso containing the entire human zzso zzso failed to stimulate human zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso Further zzso analysis showed that a zzso region of the human sequence highly zzso in the mouse zzso gene exhibited up to zzso zzso zzso although this was lower than the zzso effect exhibited by the minimal mouse zzso zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that sequences surrounding the zzso zzso core stimulate zzso activity in the mouse gene but suppress activity in the human zzso The high zzso activity of the mouse zzso may have evolved to support the exceptionally high plasma zzso zzso found in zzso However, the zzso core and surrounding zzso sequences may play an additional role in directing cell zzso
