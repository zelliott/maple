In a previous work we characterized a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was zzso by zzso of 157 patients with zzso zzso disease zzso and 9 out of 50 patients with zzso zzso disease zzso 6 of whom had zzso to the gastric zzso cell zzso zzso In the present study we have affinity zzso C2 zzso and demonstrated that they bind to the native zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We have measured zzso to the C2 zzso and a second zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in 30 patients with zzso all of whom have zzso to the gastric zzso having first determined the zzso of zzso to zzso in 98 patients with zzso who do not have zzso to the gastric zzso zzso of patients with zzso have zzso to zzso a zzso of zzso which zzso C2 by 21 zzso acids in the region containing an 11 zzso zzso which is very similar to a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which has recently been shown to be a major component of the gastric zzso In patients having zzso and zzso to the gastric zzso zzso are positive for C2 zzso and zzso for zzso zzso which is suggestive of an zzso shared by zzso and zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that C2 zzso are zzso and comprise activities which bind to the intact zzso and activities binding to an zzso which may be common to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
