A zzso nuclear zzso prepared from chicken zzso cells was used to raise zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed identical zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso in zzso cells and chicken embryonic zzso In a synchronized culture of zzso cells, the zzso of zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso decreased markedly during the progression of S phase, but returned to the normal level at the next zzso zzso When cells were treated with zzso zzso prior to fixation with zzso or cells were fixed in zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso throughout the S zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso recognized a high molecular mass nuclear zzso zzso of approximately 550 zzso which was associated with the nuclear zzso zzso was resistant to extraction with zzso M zzso from the zzso at the zzso boundary but became zzso by the end of S zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing a partial sequence for zzso was isolated by zzso as a double positive clone with zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso sequence of zzso shows no zzso with any molecules in the zzso and protein sequence databases, and contains different zzso regions for zzso and zzso zzso A possibility of zzso association of zzso with nuclear zzso during the progression of S phase is zzso
