zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso in the zzso resting and the zzso CO states have been solved at zzso A zzso These structures provide significant new insights into how NO is reduced in biological zzso The zzso zzso pocket is open to zzso implicating this region as a possible zzso binding zzso In combination with zzso results, a zzso network from the water zzso adjacent to the iron zzso to the protein surface of the zzso pocket through the zzso group of zzso zzso and the zzso group of zzso zzso can be assigned to a zzso for zzso delivery during the NO reduction zzso
