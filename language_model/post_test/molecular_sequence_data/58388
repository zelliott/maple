zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in human breast cancer pathology and in zzso zzso The crystal structure of its zzso zzso domain has been solved by molecular replacement and refined to an zzso of zzso using data to zzso A zzso This structure reveals a zzso zzso The chain is folded into a zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso with the four zzso zzso arranged around a zzso zzso This central tunnel tube zzso four zzso assigned as two calcium and two zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso has a similar structure to the equivalent domain of zzso A and zzso zzso 1; however, its detailed structure and surface charge pattern has a somewhat greater similarity to the latter, in agreement with the zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso It is proposed that several small structural differences may act together to zzso the characteristic binding and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso probably in zzso with a fitting zzso zzso
