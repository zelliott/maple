zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is thought to regulate zzso zzso zzso It can be zzso both in zzso and in zzso at multiple sites by the zzso zzso zzso and one or more of these sites is zzso to zzso zzso zzso One of the regions which is multiply zzso by zzso in zzso is the zzso zzso binding zzso Using a partially zzso zzso expressed zzso protein that includes the zzso binding domain zzso zzso we show that zzso binds to this zzso in a specific and zzso manner that is both zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso of this zzso by zzso results in a loss of zzso binding zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain can alter its ability to bind zzso
