zzso zzso are zzso zzso binding proteins that bind to the pointed end of zzso filaments and zzso thin filament zzso They bind to the N zzso of both zzso zzso (with the N zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (with the N zzso zzso by zzso zzso In this present study, circular zzso was used to study the interaction of two designed zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing the N zzso of a long or a short zzso respectively, with protein fragments containing zzso 1 to 130 of zzso or skeletal muscle zzso The binding of either zzso causes similar zzso changes in both zzso fragments promoting increases in both zzso and zzso although they differ in binding zzso The circular zzso changes in the zzso upon binding and modeling of the zzso sequences suggest that the interface between TM and zzso includes a three- or zzso coiled zzso An intact coiled zzso at the N zzso of the zzso is essential for zzso zzso as modifications that disrupt the zzso zzso such as removal of the zzso zzso group from zzso or zzso muscle zzso or introduction of a zzso that causes zzso zzso zzso into zzso destroyed zzso zzso
