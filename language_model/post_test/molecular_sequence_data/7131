zzso zzso a selective zzso of gut and brown zzso tissue beta zzso zzso 3 zzso has been reported to have zzso activity in zzso by indicating brain beta zzso as the sites of this zzso zzso zzso and its acid zzso zzso zzso as opposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels in rat frontal zzso zzso zzso differently from zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso range antagonized zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase of zzso zzso levels induced by zzso zzso was blocked selectively by beta zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by beta zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis did not reveal beta zzso zzso and no specific beta zzso binding sites were detected by zzso zzso in rat frontal zzso When zzso of the beta zzso zzso binding and zzso levels had been induced in frontal zzso by chronic administration of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso production less zzso Our findings indicate that beta zzso are absent in the adult rat frontal cortex, and that various beta zzso zzso differently affect the frontal zzso beta zzso indicating that zzso zzso may exert its putative zzso effect acting on the frontal zzso beta zzso
