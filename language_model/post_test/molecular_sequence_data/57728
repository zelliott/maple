We have used ultraviolet melting techniques to study the effect on stability of incorporating the zzso analogue zzso zzso into the duplex zzso Our results demonstrate that the successive replacement of zzso by zzso increasingly zzso the zzso The zzso effect of this analogue is considerably enhanced as the pH is lowered and the results are consistent with zzso of zzso (probably at zzso contributing to duplex zzso Surprisingly, the incorporation of zzso does not significantly affect the binding of zzso
