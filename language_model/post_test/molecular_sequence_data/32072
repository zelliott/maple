Five mimic zzso of zzso zzso disease virus zzso have been identified from a zzso zzso zzso library by 5 zzso zzso Based on the sequences of the five zzso multiple zzso gene zzso was constructed by the five zzso being zzso arranged and linked with zzso zzso The expression zzso zzso was constructed and successfully expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso was called zzso The results from zzso analysis showed that the proportion of zzso was zzso of the total bacterial proteins and the molecular weight of zzso was zzso By use of parallel zzso test with corresponding zzso and zzso zzso the zzso specificity and zzso of zzso against zzso have been zzso zzso were zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso g per zzso twice with 7 days zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso measured by indirect zzso were up to zzso at the 7th day after first zzso and zzso at the 14th day after the second zzso To determine the protective ability of zzso to the challenge of zzso chickens were injected zzso with zzso in zzso twice with 7 days zzso zzso per zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was up to zzso at the zzso day after the second zzso After challenge with zzso of virulent zzso zzso strain, all the chicken in zzso group were survived in contrast to the mortality of zzso in zzso control group, suggesting that zzso had a potent ability to generate protective immune response and it implied that the constructed gene zzso is a prospective candidate for the development of zzso zzso zzso
