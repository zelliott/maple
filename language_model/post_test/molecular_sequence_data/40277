zzso zzso zzso is essential for bacterial survival and adaptation to different zzso The regulation of fatty acid zzso is therefore crucial for maintaining the correct composition and zzso properties of cell zzso This regulation implicates a zzso control of key zzso and a zzso regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso In zzso zzso we found that control of zzso zzso is accomplished, at least in part, through the zzso regulation of fatty acid zzso zzso A novel zzso factor, zzso zzso controls expression of zzso zzso and lies immediately upstream of zzso in a cluster of genes that is highly zzso within zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso strain, with severe growth defects and a delay in the timing of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes was zzso in the zzso zzso indicating a role for this zzso factor as an zzso zzso the zzso showed a significant drop in fatty acid zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to a DNA sequence containing zzso promoter region, both in zzso and in zzso These data provide the first example of positive regulation of genes zzso core proteins of saturated fatty acid zzso zzso
