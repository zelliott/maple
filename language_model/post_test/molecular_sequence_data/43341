The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso class I integral membrane zzso with an zzso zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso In the zzso domain, two zzso zzso joined by a flexible turn containing two zzso sites have been zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso molecules by inducing their specific degradation in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 52 and 56, present within the zzso domain of the zzso zzso has been shown to be essential to this zzso zzso However, the contribution of these two zzso sites in the mechanism of zzso degradation remains zzso Interestingly, a specific interaction between zzso and zzso was recently demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was shown to be necessary but not sufficient to mediate zzso degradation, indicating that interaction between zzso and zzso represents an early step critical in triggering a process leading to zzso zzso To delineate the zzso and/or structural zzso involved in this zzso interaction and in the zzso zzso degradation, we performed a zzso analysis of the zzso domain of zzso and zzso zzso experiments reveal that disruption of the putative zzso structure in the zzso zzso domain of zzso affects the binding to zzso suggesting that this structure may act as an interface for the zzso interaction that mediates zzso zzso zzso proteins containing zzso in either or both of the zzso sites zzso zzso zzso were inactive in regard to zzso degradation yet retained the capacity to interact with the zzso domain of zzso In an attempt to define the minimal region responsible for this interaction, we tested a panel of zzso which were designed to affect the integrity of the putative zzso present in the zzso domain of zzso Our results indicate that although both zzso zzso are required for degradation of zzso only zzso I, located in the zzso zzso region of zzso is involved in the interaction between zzso and zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso structures in the zzso zzso and zzso proteins are involved in binding and degradation of zzso zzso
