zzso zzso is a regulated process, which involves zzso zzso zzso zzso acidity may be regulated zzso and the zzso zzso has previously been shown to become zzso on zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso of T zzso Increased zzso is believed to be zzso by regulating the overall zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso have earlier been reported to interact with several zzso zzso We have now studied the involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We have investigated the distribution of zzso zzso between zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of T cell zzso zzso A significant amount of zzso zzso zzso was observed to fraction along with the zzso while the majority of the cell surface zzso molecules remained in the soluble zzso zzso candidates for this altered zzso binding of zzso were shown to be zzso and zzso which were observed to bind to zzso zzso peptides and zzso with zzso The importance of the zzso zzso domain in the regulation of the zzso zzso was further strengthened by zzso of zzso zzso T cell zzso with a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso portion of the zzso These results indicate that the induced zzso zzso and the altered zzso binding of the zzso zzso complex may contribute to the increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso
