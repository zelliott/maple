The zzso high mobility group protein 1 zzso is a very abundant and zzso protein that is structured into two zzso box zzso plus a highly zzso zzso zzso From the ability to bind DNA zzso and to interact with various zzso several functions in zzso processes have been assigned to zzso Nevertheless, its functional role remains the subject of zzso Using a zzso display approach we have shown that zzso can recognize several zzso zzso A computer search of the protein data bases found zzso zzso with proteins already known to interact with zzso like zzso and have allowed us to identify new potential zzso Among them, zzso zzso like the zzso nuclear zzso K zzso zzso zzso like zzso binding protein 2 zzso and zzso like the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso gene proteins 1 zzso and 5 zzso can be zzso A detailed analysis of the interaction of zzso with zzso confirmed that the binding region contained the sequence zzso to one of the peptides zzso Our results have led us to propose that zzso may play a central role in the stabilization and/or assembly of several zzso complexes through zzso zzso
