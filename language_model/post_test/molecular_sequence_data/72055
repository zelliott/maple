zzso are responsible for significant human mortality and disease worldwide, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their entry into host cells remain poorly zzso We have solved the crystal structure of a zzso of the zzso zzso virus 5 fusion protein zzso zzso revealing a 96 A long coiled zzso surrounded by three zzso zzso This structure places the fusion and zzso anchor of zzso F in close proximity with a large intervening domain at the opposite end of the coiled zzso Six zzso zzso potentially part of the fusion zzso form a segment of the central coiled zzso suggesting that this structure extends into the zzso zzso zzso of zzso F indicate that putative flexible zzso between the coiled zzso and the viral membrane are zzso for zzso The lack of flexible zzso may couple a final zzso change in the F protein directly to the fusion of two zzso
