The zzso neural zzso zzso gene family, whose members are implicated in zzso is part of the zzso repeat zzso To date, zzso genes have been identified only in zzso although other zzso zzso genes are prevalent throughout zzso The lack of elaborate molecular zzso analysis with exhaustive zzso sampling has obscured the possible link of the establishment of this gene family with zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso in diverse zzso by means of database mining and zzso chain reaction zzso Our analysis revealed that the zzso zzso was lost in the zzso zzso lineage through zzso deletion and that the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso occurred early in zzso zzso Including our original data on the zzso and the zzso our comparison revealed high conservation of the zzso expression pattern of zzso and zzso of expression zzso between zzso zzso and zzso Compared with many other gene families including zzso key regulators, the zzso gene family is unique in that conventional molecular zzso zzso could identify no obvious zzso zzso This suggests a composite nature of the zzso gene repertoire, consisting not only of de zzso genes introduced at the zzso origin but also of long-standing genes with no apparent zzso zzso Some of the latter, including the zzso gene family, may be too rapidly evolving to provide sufficient zzso signals marking zzso to their zzso zzso Such gene families that experienced zzso evolution likely remain to be explored and might also have contributed to zzso evolution of zzso
