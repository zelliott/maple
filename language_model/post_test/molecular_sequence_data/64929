The zzso division proteins zzso are zzso by a small nuclear gene family in land zzso Although it has been shown for some of the gene products that they are imported into zzso and function in zzso division, the evolution and function of this gene family and their products remain to be zzso Here we present two new zzso genes from the moss zzso zzso and compare the zzso structure of members of the two plant zzso gene zzso zzso of sequence features and zzso analyses confirm the presence of two clusters of zzso in land plants and demonstrate that these genes were duplicated before the divergence of zzso zzso and seed zzso
