A novel 120 zzso zzso protein zzso was found in zzso zzso It was distributed throughout the zzso mainly in the zzso membrane and zzso areas, enriched in zzso The full-length zzso of zzso consisted of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso giving a zzso zzso protein with a theoretical zzso value of zzso It had a novel domain organization zzso the N zzso zzso zzso contained 1 zzso zzso domain, followed by only 1 region that was zzso to the zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso and a central region zzso zzso exhibiting a very high probability of zzso formation, probably engaged in the observed protein zzso A zzso tree constructed for zzso zzso from 25 various proteins revealed that the zzso domain of zzso was most related to that of the hypothetical mouse zzso zzso whereas not much relationship to either zzso or the zzso factor zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso
