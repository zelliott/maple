We have previously described a series of zzso B cell lines obtained as spontaneous outgrowth cultures from mouse zzso cells zzso zzso In this study, we report the variable region sequences zzso by independent cell lines derived from three mouse zzso zzso V region zzso and zzso diversification were essentially identical in all three cell zzso These zzso zzso 1 light zzso zzso zzso and, a novel zzso gene zzso The zzso was highly zzso to zzso a rare zzso family previously found in a group of zzso B zzso zzso to zzso mouse red blood zzso The selective expression of this unusual zzso species implies the action of distinctive molecular or zzso processes in the outgrowth of zzso cell zzso zzso of these factors may be relevant to understanding the peculiar biology of zzso B cells in zzso We have also evaluated zzso zzso clones to determine whether this zzso is accompanied by variable region zzso zzso However, no evidence for zzso zzso was observed in these induced zzso This may indicate that these two processes are independently zzso despite their common zzso in zzso
