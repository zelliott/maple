The formation of zzso zzso zzso chains is zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso family zzso zzso screening for zzso affecting zzso signaling pathways in zzso has identified three zzso zzso zzso sister of zzso zzso and brother of zzso zzso which zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso So far, in zzso zzso activities have been demonstrated only for zzso which harbors both zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities responsible for the chain initiation and zzso of zzso and no zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrated that zzso and zzso had zzso and zzso activities required for the zzso of repeating zzso units of the HS zzso and the zzso of zzso with zzso markedly zzso both zzso activities when compared with the expression of zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of HS was demonstrated on a linkage region analogue as an zzso zzso by zzso and an zzso complex composed of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to human, zzso exhibited no zzso activity, indicating that zzso which is an zzso gene and possesses zzso activity required for the initiation of zzso is indispensable for the zzso of HS chains in zzso Thus, all three zzso members in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for the zzso of full-length HS in zzso
