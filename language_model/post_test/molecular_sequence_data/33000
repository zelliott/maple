DNA zzso is the only zzso that can introduce negative zzso into the DNA at the cost of zzso zzso Some but not all the steps of the zzso reaction are understood clearly for both zzso zzso and DNA zzso This study is an attempt to understand whether the B zzso of DNA zzso binds to DNA directly, which may be central to the stimulation of its zzso activity essential for zzso zzso We have dissected the zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso to identify a zzso region in the zzso domain that is responsible for its intrinsic DNA binding activity, zzso zzso activity, and DNA zzso We find that DNA has to enter through the zzso clamp of zzso to gain access to the DNA binding zzso Furthermore, the rate of zzso zzso of zzso increases significantly with increasing DNA zzso suggesting a possible communication between the zzso domain and the DNA binding region that can account for its optimal zzso zzso These results not only highlight the mechanism of zzso action in the deadly human zzso zzso zzso but also provide meaningful insights into the current zzso model of DNA transport by zzso during the zzso zzso
