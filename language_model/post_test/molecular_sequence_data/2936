zzso sequence zzso has two coding zzso zzso and zzso which are essential for its zzso Here, we show that a zzso event in the zzso direction from the 3' end region of the zzso frame to an open reading frame zzso zzso extending from the zzso end of the zzso frame, is involved in production of the zzso fusion protein that has zzso zzso zzso The zzso event is likely to have occurred at the sequence zzso where the zzso frame zzso the zzso zzso Interestingly, this sequence is also present in one of the two sequences identified in zzso as zzso signals for production of zzso zzso from the overlapping genes zzso or zzso
