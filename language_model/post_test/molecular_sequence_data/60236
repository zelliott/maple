zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing two distinct zzso zzso zzso are zzso and activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso A zzso putative zzso alpha zzso is present in the zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso resulted in zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso both zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso by the zzso above that of wild type zzso The enhanced zzso zzso was attributed to zzso of the zzso because a zzso dead zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso even in conjunction with Delta alpha and zzso zzso activity of the zzso appears to enhance zzso activity even in the absence of zzso zzso because zzso zzso of zzso zzso by Delta alpha and zzso was approximately zzso above that of zzso A zzso zzso motif zzso detected a zzso protein zzso that was zzso upon zzso growth factor or insulin zzso zzso expression of Delta alpha or zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso of zzso compared with that of zzso presenting the possibility that zzso is a novel zzso zzso Thus, it is clear that the zzso regulates zzso activity in zzso as well as in zzso
