A zzso chain reaction zzso approach was used to assess the occurrence and diversity of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso environmental zzso coli zzso For this purpose, two different sets of zzso were designed for the specific amplification of approximately zzso fragments from the zzso zzso These zzso were used to screen a collection of 25 environmental zzso strains isolated from different geographical regions of India, as well as zzso The zzso results showed that 17 out of the 25 environmental zzso zzso contained a gene related to the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the protein sequences deduced from the zzso indicated a prevalence of zzso genes in the isolated zzso A significant divergence in the DNA sequence was found in the zzso genes among zzso environmental zzso coli strains from this study, and zzso resistance, a genetic character, arose from a common ancestral zzso
