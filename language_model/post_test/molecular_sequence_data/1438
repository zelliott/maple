More than 1000 group I zzso have been identified in zzso zzso Little is known, however, of the zzso and secondary structure evolution of these zzso Here, we use a combination of comparative and zzso methods to address the evolution and zzso of a vertically inherited group I zzso found at position zzso in the zzso small zzso zzso zzso The ancestral state of the zzso zzso contains a highly zzso core and an extended zzso domain typical of zzso zzso In contrast, the more derived zzso have lost most of zzso and have an accelerated divergence rate within the core region with three functionally important zzso that zzso separate them from the ancestral zzso Of 14 zzso group I zzso that were tested for zzso five, all of the ancestral type, were able to zzso and produced zzso zzso circles in zzso The more derived zzso zzso did not zzso and potentially rely on zzso factors to facilitate zzso In zzso we demonstrate one possible fate of vertically inherited group I zzso the loss of secondary structure zzso lessened selective constraints in the zzso core, and ultimately, dependence on zzso zzso
