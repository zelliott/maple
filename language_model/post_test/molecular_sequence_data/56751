The cloning and zzso of the zzso DNA zzso as a functional fusion with zzso zzso is zzso The fusion zzso retains full biological activity and has been used to investigate the interaction of zzso and zzso with zzso DNA zzso The fusion zzso has been zzso to zzso in a single step on zzso and is free from zzso zzso zzso The zzso can be zzso with zzso and the level of incorporation of label is enhanced by the presence of a zzso DNA zzso In the presence of a zzso zzso no zzso was observed since zzso transfer occurs zzso The inclusion of a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso DNA zzso (an zzso containing the base zzso in the position of the zzso to which zzso addition zzso which is thought to form a zzso interaction with the zzso zzso of such zzso led to an enhancement of zzso zzso which suggests that, in contrast with results obtained with zzso DNA zzso zzso and Friedman (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not the zzso zzso The implications of the results obtained with this zzso inhibitor are discussed with respect to other zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso that contain the zzso zzso base in place of the zzso target base are zzso These demonstrate that most probably a stable zzso bond is formed between the zzso and this zzso However, the alternative of extremely tight zzso binding cannot be rigorously zzso Furthermore, the results from these experiments indicate that the reaction mechanism proceeds in a manner similar to that of zzso DNA zzso with zzso DNA binding being followed by addition of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso complex leading to zzso zzso zzso appears to inhibit the reaction zzso as a result of either competition with the zzso donor and zzso of a zzso interaction between the zzso and DNA in an zzso zzso complex or through an zzso zzso
