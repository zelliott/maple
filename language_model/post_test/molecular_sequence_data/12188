The solution structure of a zzso zzso specific complex of the zzso domain zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso with a zzso DNA has been solved by zzso The interaction of the zzso zzso with DNA reveals a surprising twist on the general features of zzso zzso zzso Major groove recognition involves the zzso two thirds of the zzso recognition zzso while minor groove recognition occurs via true zzso of the side chain of zzso which extends from the minor to the major zzso This results in a sharp zzso of approximately 60 degrees and a widening of the minor groove over one-half turn of the zzso The orientation of the zzso element of the zzso zzso with respect to the major groove is significantly rotated relative to other zzso zzso These observations establish the zzso family of zzso proteins as a distinct family of zzso zzso
