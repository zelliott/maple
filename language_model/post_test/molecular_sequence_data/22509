To understand the role cellular zzso plays in the zzso of chronic zzso B zzso through analysis of T cell zzso zzso beta chain variable region gene zzso family dominant usage and beta chain zzso determining zzso zzso sequences of peripheral blood zzso cells of the zzso 

zzso zzso families were amplified by inverse zzso chain reaction zzso and the dominant usage of zzso families and zzso repertoire were analyzed by zzso technology for 8 zzso patients during their acute zzso and for 4 healthy blood donors who served as zzso The zzso of the T cells suspected by zzso was further confirmed by zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso repertoire of the 4 healthy blood donors showed a zzso zzso In the 8 zzso patients, however, the zzso expansion of T cells showed different zzso zzso families with each zzso The T cells of the zzso expansion shared different zzso zzso 

The peripheral blood T cells of zzso patients during their acute zzso showed significantly a zzso expansion and their T cell zzso expansion may be zzso by several zzso zzso These results indicate that cellular zzso is involved in the zzso of the liver inflammation process of zzso
