The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso that consists of single zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso shows strongest sequence similarity to members of the zzso family of zzso there are several key structural and regulatory differences that place it on its own amongst zzso zzso In this study we have isolated zzso DNA clones corresponding to the human zzso locus and used these to determine the zzso structure of the zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso consists of 8 zzso whose boundaries are distinct from other zzso zzso family members, again indicating a structural and functional zzso zzso zzso of the primary zzso transcript generates a distinct zzso which encodes a truncated protein consisting of an zzso domain and a novel zzso zzso rich zzso Using an zzso raised to the zzso domain, we have demonstrated that the product of this alternate zzso transcript is expressed in the human breast zzso cell line zzso We have previously reported that expression of a zzso derived zzso zzso in mouse embryonic zzso and human zzso zzso cells supports zzso independent growth, and in the latter zzso the zzso response to zzso growth zzso The protein zzso by the zzso sequence derived from normal human tissue is identical to that zzso by the zzso derived zzso and therefore the altered growth regulation is not associated with zzso within zzso In addition, we have identified a zzso zzso region that has promoter zzso The zzso gene has been assigned to zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso in zzso zzso zzso
