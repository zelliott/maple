The mechanisms regulating zzso zzso stability in differentiated T cells are not zzso We found that early exposure of zzso T cells to zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso This effect of zzso was zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and the dominant binding site was shown within the coding region of zzso zzso Exposure of zzso T cells to zzso had no effects on zzso expression or zzso zzso but triggered zzso binding to zzso zzso Thus, zzso plays a positive role in maintaining zzso zzso stability in zzso T cells via a zzso zzso
