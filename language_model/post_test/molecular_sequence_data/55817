zzso rats have a small deletion at the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso and practically no mast cells were zzso when the zzso were stained with zzso zzso Because zzso blue zzso zzso there is a possibility that immature mast cells that do not contain a sufficient amount of zzso are not zzso by this zzso We examined this possibility by using other markers of mast zzso The zzso content in the skin of zzso rats was zzso that of control normal zzso zzso Because the number of zzso zzso mast cells in the skin of zzso rats was also zzso that of zzso rats, zzso in the skin seemed to be concentrated to zzso zzso mast zzso zzso cells in the skin of zzso rats express zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso was normally expressed at least in the brain of zzso rats despite the small zzso we examined the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the skin and stomach of zzso rats by reverse zzso modification of zzso chain zzso zzso of either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the skin and stomach of zzso rats was estimated to be less than zzso that of zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso zzso and no zzso cells were zzso in the skin of zzso rats by in zzso zzso zzso The present result suggests the absence of immature mast cells in zzso of zzso zzso
