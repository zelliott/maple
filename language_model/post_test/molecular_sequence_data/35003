zzso zzso zzso catalyze the transfer of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso For zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of one zzso and tail of the second cooperate to prime zzso but how this is accomplished by zzso zzso zzso in the absence of a zzso component is currently zzso Here, we present a crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso bound to a stabilized zzso zzso revealing a similar mechanism in zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso element interact directly with zzso zzso surface, improving the zzso efficiency of zzso transfer by zzso zzso interactions outside the zzso zzso domain are crucial for zzso zzso transfer in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose that an additional zzso zzso element may be a common zzso zzso zzso
