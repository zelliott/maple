A suite of crystal structures is reported for a cellular zzso cap zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso and the cap zzso zzso of zzso complexes suggests an zzso mechanism of zzso transfer, albeit without direct contacts between the zzso and either the zzso atom of zzso (the attacking zzso the zzso carbon of zzso or the sulfur of zzso (the leaving zzso The structures indicate that zzso of cap zzso zzso is accomplished by zzso proximity and orientation of the zzso assisted by a favorable zzso zzso The zzso structures, together with new zzso data, fully account for the zzso specificity of the cap zzso zzso reaction, an essential and defining step of zzso zzso zzso
