A novel regulatory mechanism for control of the ubiquitous zzso zzso complex zzso a key zzso of the zzso acid cycle, was discovered in the zzso zzso zzso a close relative of important human pathogens like zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the finding that a zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso protein zzso G zzso was impaired in zzso zzso zzso comparisons led to the identification of zzso as a putative zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a zzso domain and a zzso of zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the delta zzso zzso could be abolished by the additional deletion of zzso whereas transformation of a delta zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to the specific zzso of zzso the E1 zzso of zzso Because zzso is essential for zzso zzso we assumed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso was shown to strongly inhibit zzso activity with a Ki value of zzso zzso The regulatory mechanism described offers a molecular clue for the reduced zzso activity that is essential for the industrial production of zzso million zzso of zzso with zzso zzso Moreover, because this signaling cascade is likely to operate also in zzso our results suggest that the attenuated zzso of zzso lacking zzso might be caused by a disturbed zzso acid zzso
