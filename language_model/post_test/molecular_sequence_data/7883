A zzso factor with high affinity and specificity for the zzso sequences in the zzso and zzso genes has been zzso The factor has the highest affinity for the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso has relatively high affinity for other zzso sequences in the zzso and zzso zzso but has no apparent affinity for similar DNA sequences coding for zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso The factor has been named zzso sequence zzso factor zzso zzso has a nuclear zzso and is composed of three zzso of about 60, 70, and 95 zzso zzso The highest levels were observed in rat zzso zzso and zzso and were generally higher in late zzso compared to newborn or adult zzso zzso activity was also recorded in human zzso tumor cell zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of reporter genes in artificial gene zzso where a zzso DNA zzso had been inserted between the zzso initiation site and the coding region of the reporter zzso These observations suggest that the zzso sequences in the zzso and zzso genes also have regulatory functions realized through interaction with a specific zzso zzso
