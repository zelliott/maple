zzso the properties of proteins through de zzso design or redesign of existing proteins has been a longstanding goal in protein zzso Over the past two decades, zzso zzso has been a powerful tool to probe the role of certain zzso and to fine-tune the activity of zzso A limitation of this approach has been the accessibility of only a restricted number of functional groups through the 20 zzso acids in the genetic zzso The more recent technique of expressed protein zzso zzso provides an alternative route that allows efficient incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso We report here the preparation and zzso characterization of an zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso to the blue copper center has been replaced by zzso with zzso zzso This reports marks the first time that zzso is artificially incorporated into the active site of a zzso The zzso displays a significantly increased zzso (from 56 to 104 zzso and zzso CT band (from 625 to zzso zzso while maintaining the general type 1 copper zzso including similarity in reduction zzso This study illustrates that zzso substitution using zzso can fine-tune the structural and functional properties of a zzso site without loss of most of its zzso Further zzso and X-ray zzso studies of this and other zzso zzso will provide new insights into the zzso of the structure and function of zzso
