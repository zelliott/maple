zzso the function of individual zzso zzso species in mice would require the production of hundreds of zzso zzso To accelerate analysis of zzso biology in zzso we combined zzso zzso virus zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit specific zzso zzso injection of zzso expressing zzso or zzso zzso depleted the corresponding zzso and increased its zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso but not zzso zzso reduced serum cholesterol by zzso for 25 weeks in zzso zzso zzso sequencing of liver zzso from the treated mice confirmed that the targeted zzso were depleted and revealed that zzso induced zzso tailing and trimming in zzso zzso zzso zzso thus provides a simple way to study zzso function in adult zzso and a potential therapy for zzso and other diseases caused by zzso zzso
