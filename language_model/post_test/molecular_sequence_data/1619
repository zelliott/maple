zzso are peptides isolated from zzso zzso zzso which exert their toxic action by zzso zzso zzso They contain a characteristic triple stranded zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso named zzso encompassing most of these sequences was zzso using zzso and characterized zzso structurally and zzso zzso has two zzso bridges, formed zzso using dual zzso zzso zzso patterns, zzso profiles and zzso proved the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated the presence of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, comparable to values observed in the native zzso An zzso effect on zzso zzso was displayed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although not reaching the affinity level of the parent native toxin zzso zzso zzso It is confirmed that the principal binding region of zzso to zzso resides within loop zzso
