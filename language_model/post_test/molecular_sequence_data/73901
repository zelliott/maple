zzso is the protein which has an zzso function in cell growth, and its gene is suggested to be one of putative tumor zzso zzso In this report, we described a partial cloning of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and rabbit liver zzso by zzso and their zzso zzso The sequences of these zzso products were compared with each other as well as those reported for human and zzso The zzso in this region of zzso zzso was approximately zzso and the zzso acid sequence of each zzso product shared more than zzso zzso zzso it is concluded that all the zzso products are a part of zzso zzso of each zzso
