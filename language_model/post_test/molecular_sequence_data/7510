A zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a zzso library prepared from zzso cell clusters of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained an open reading frame that zzso a protein of 181 zzso acid zzso with significant zzso to the zzso factors zzso of animals and zzso The zzso transcripts were detected at a nearly constant level during zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed as a fusion protein in zzso coli and was shown to have zzso zzso zzso This binding was completely prevented by a zzso zzso excess of zzso zzso or zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on the zzso The binding of zzso gamma S to the zzso zzso protein was detected only in the presence of zzso levels of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence and the zzso characteristics of the zzso protein suggest that the zzso zzso encodes an zzso of carrot rather than a protein that only resembles such a factor, zzso zzso protein zzso
