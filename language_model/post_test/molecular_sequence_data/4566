Human zzso encodes a novel protein zzso zzso capable of strongly zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression is tightly regulated at various levels during different stages of the cell cycle in lung zzso The zzso zzso activity is relatively low during zzso zzso and zzso and zzso during late S and zzso stages of the cell zzso zzso human zzso expressed through the zzso zzso system is capable of zzso zzso a positive regulator for the zzso zzso Human zzso shares significant sequence zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso polo, both of which are essential for zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts greatly zzso zzso zzso maturation of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso transcripts significantly delay and reduce the rate of zzso zzso When expressed in a zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso human zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso fully zzso the zzso zzso of the budding zzso Taken together, zzso may represent a new protein zzso playing an important role in regulating the onset and/or progression of zzso in zzso zzso
