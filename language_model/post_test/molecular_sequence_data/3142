The zzso zzso zzso involved in diffuse zzso zzso protein derived from zzso clinical zzso coli isolate zzso and the zzso zzso invasion locus zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso coli zzso strain zzso are zzso modified by zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso showed that the modification involved zzso zzso zzso is modified by the zzso activity of the product of the zzso zzso which is located directly upstream of zzso gene zzso The zzso modification of the zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso protein but has not been zzso Based on the sequence similarities between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between the zzso and the zzso proteins we hypothesized that the zzso system and the zzso system zzso by the zzso locus are structurally and functionally zzso Here we show that zzso zzso proteins derived from different zzso strains appear to be highly zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins can substitute for the zzso zzso in introducing the zzso modification to zzso zzso this modification is functional in restoring the adhesive function of zzso zzso a single zzso acid substitution at position zzso completely zzso this activity, and zzso zzso directed at the functionally active zzso recognize a protein resembling modified zzso in zzso zzso In zzso we conclude that, like zzso zzso represents an example of a novel class of zzso specifically transferring zzso zzso onto multiple sites of a protein zzso A potential consensus sequence for the modification site is zzso
