Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder characterized by neural loss and brain zzso associated with plaques containing large amounts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning of the zzso for this zzso from human brain has shown it to be derived by zzso from a much larger precursor called the zzso precursor protein zzso The biological role of the precursor is unknown, but it has been shown to be transcribed in many human zzso in addition to zzso In the present report, we describe the molecular cloning from a human zzso library of a full-length zzso for a zzso closely related to zzso This novel zzso which we have called zzso precursor protein zzso zzso shares overall domain organization with zzso It is zzso zzso acids in length and appears to zzso a signal zzso a large apparent zzso domain including a zzso inhibitor domain, a zzso region, and a short zzso zzso Northern analysis indicates that it occurs in at least two molecular forms and is transcribed in human brain, heart, zzso liver, and zzso in addition to zzso On the basis of its extensive sequence similarity and conservation of domain structure, zzso is the nearest relative of zzso yet identified in an emerging zzso zzso
