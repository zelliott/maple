Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for zzso agricultural systems from the effects of climate zzso Here, we show that levels of zzso an alternatively spliced form of the flowering zzso zzso zzso M, increase at lower temperatures, zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the zzso zzso complex and, thus, allowing the plant to zzso The zzso and zzso zzso show zzso flowering in different temperature zzso Control of zzso zzso complex abundance via zzso and zzso regulation of zzso and zzso regulation of zzso protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to ambient temperature zzso
