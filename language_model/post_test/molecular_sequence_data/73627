In the progeny of the zzso addition line of common zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso of zzso zzso deletion zzso carrying the break point within the zzso organizing region of zzso zzso zzso Attempts were made to amplify the break points by zzso using zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In one deletion line, specific amplification of DNA fragments including the zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats, and their junction zzso At the junction of zzso and zzso gene there was a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sequences were initiated from the sequence zzso in the zzso Between the zzso a small sequence was also zzso This novel DNA sequence at the break point indicates that the zzso zzso took place after the first zzso breakage by the zzso zzso
