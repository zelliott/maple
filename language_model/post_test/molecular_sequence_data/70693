We have reported the zzso cloning of a modified zzso zzso zzso designated zzso oxidized LDL zzso zzso which is zzso to be involved in zzso dysfunction and the zzso of zzso Here, we determined the organization of the human zzso zzso including the zzso zzso The zzso region contained several potential zzso zzso such as zzso binding element, zzso binding element, zzso zzso element and zzso zzso which may mediate the zzso and zzso expression of zzso The major zzso site was found to be located 29 zzso downstream of the zzso box and 61 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso The minor initiation site was found to be 5 zzso downstream from the major zzso Most of the promoter activity of the zzso gene was ascribed to the region zzso to zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso The coding sequence was divided into 6 zzso by 5 zzso The first 3 zzso corresponded to the different functional zzso of the protein zzso zzso and neck zzso and the residual 3 zzso zzso the zzso domain similar to the case of other zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was a zzso gene and assigned to the zzso region of zzso zzso Since the locus for a familial hypertension has been mapped to the overlapping region, zzso might be the gene responsible for the zzso
