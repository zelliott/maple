The level of DNA damage in the total zzso of zzso from patients receiving zzso therapy has been previously correlated with therapeutic zzso Based on the fact that zzso damage in transcribed genes has been well correlated with sensitivity to a number of DNA damaging agents, the correlations with therapeutic response might be improved if the level of DNA damage in specific genes was zzso We previously established a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso in specific zzso The major advantages of this zzso include its potential to zzso DNA zzso produced by any DNA damaging agent, and to measure it in minute samples of zzso This zzso has been further improved to realize this zzso Specifically, cells were damaged with zzso a related analogue zzso and ultraviolet light, and zzso was performed on the DNA from 1000 cells after direct zzso with no zzso Human zzso cells were used to compare the efficacy of the various agents to damage the zzso zzso This was then zzso to damage in the total zzso and compared to the zzso for each zzso At a dose that killed 50% of the cells, zzso zzso and ultraviolet light produced zzso zzso and zzso zzso per cell, demonstrating that zzso zzso were the most effective at killing zzso zzso cells were obtained from freshly isolated blood from five zzso These cells were damaged with the three agents, and zzso of the zzso gene was zzso No significant difference between the individuals was observed in the level of DNA damage produced by any of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
