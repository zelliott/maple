The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso C from zzso coli, has been determined to a resolution of zzso zzso A zzso zzso used in the X-ray analysis is a competitive inhibitor and places the active site of zzso in a region which includes atoms from three of the four zzso The zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso and is comprised of three zzso The central domain, zzso is a unique zzso zzso The association of the zzso zzso results in a zzso which has a core of 20 zzso The other two zzso D1 and zzso cap the zzso bundle on opposite ends giving both the single zzso and the zzso a zzso zzso zzso C has sequence zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
