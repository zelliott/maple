zzso coding for bovine zzso zzso beta zzso zzso were cloned from bovine zzso cells using a combination of several zzso zzso The cloned full-length zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids zzso a protein with high zzso to the zzso sequences from other zzso A second zzso nearly totally lacking the zzso binding domain was cloned that is expressed to relatively high levels in zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso is zzso in corpus zzso and zzso during the zzso phase of the female zzso In addition, in zzso cells several zzso zzso carrying major internal deletions were detected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies expressing the two major bovine zzso zzso together with an zzso reporter construct show zzso zzso by the full-length zzso whereas the zzso lacking the zzso binding domain did not show any zzso
