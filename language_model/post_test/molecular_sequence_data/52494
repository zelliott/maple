A simple procedure is described for preparing zzso a zzso zzso that lacks the fatty acid zzso starting from zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in zzso in the absence of zzso The yield of zzso under optimal conditions (6 zzso 90 degrees C, zzso N zzso 1 zzso zzso was zzso The chemical structure of zzso was determined by zzso and zzso zzso thus proving that the zzso groups of zzso and zzso acid units were not affected during the zzso zzso
