A zzso chain reaction zzso method for direct detection of zzso zzso in zzso eggs is zzso The method does not require zzso zzso zzso rapid DNA isolation, and a zzso zzso system targeting the zzso gene enabled detection of the zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso product of 283 base pairs was formed from all 21 zzso including 43 zzso strains zzso No zzso product was formed from 56 zzso zzso and other bacterial strains zzso zzso with artificially contaminated eggs showed a detection limit of about zzso zzso units zzso before and about zzso zzso after zzso In analysis of 180 single eggs from 4 flocks and 36 pools of 5 eggs each from another 4 flocks from the same producer, zzso zzso were detected in 5 of 90 eggs from 2 different zzso zzso of zzso zzso in eggs yielded positive results for 2 additional and the 2 zzso zzso In contrast, classical selective culture detected zzso zzso in only 1 of 100 eggs in one flock when 100 eggs from each flock were zzso
