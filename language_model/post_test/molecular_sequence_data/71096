zzso zzso 5 zzso unlike other zzso is active only in zzso cells where its zzso zzso zzso is zzso However, it zzso zzso in zzso motifs like other zzso The tail portion of zzso contains more than 50 zzso repeats, and zzso has been shown to zzso zzso specifically only in zzso zzso indicating highly specific interactions in zzso zzso zzso have been shown to have a high preference for a basic zzso zzso or zzso as the zzso zzso zzso being the location in the primary sequence of a zzso zzso or zzso Because of the lack of a crystal structure of a zzso complex, the structural basis for this specific interaction is zzso We have used zzso zzso zzso to zzso and molecular modeling techniques to probe the recognition interactions for zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso in the active site of zzso The experimental data and computer simulations suggest that zzso and zzso are key zzso that interact with the zzso at positions zzso and/or zzso of the zzso
