The zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from barley zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and of a barley zzso were determined and the barley sequences were used to design zzso zzso for the zzso chain zzso A specific zzso zzso zzso zzso specifying the zzso one-third of the mature barley zzso was zzso cloned and zzso The zzso of plant zzso is highly zzso and zzso to the zzso of the heavy zzso of zzso coli zzso Based on sequence zzso we tentatively identified the zzso region of zzso as the zzso domain, which is related to the corresponding domain of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso raised against the barley zzso were used to zzso four zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso zzso protein in leaves, while the fourth zzso zzso had a small amount of zzso zzso zzso to Northern blots of total leaf zzso revealed that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were indistinguishable from the parental line zzso zzso having normal amounts of a zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso and zzso zzso each contained two distinct zzso zzso species, one of which was larger than zzso zzso the other zzso Using a set of zzso zzso addition lines we have assigned the zzso structural locus to the short arm of zzso zzso
