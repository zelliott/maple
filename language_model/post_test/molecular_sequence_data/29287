The structure of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the potent inhibitor zzso has been determined to a resolution of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor is present in the active site, principally as zzso but with evidence of additional zzso zzso at either end, and representing a different binding mode to that observed in the structural zzso zzso acid zzso The analysis reveals the zzso interactions involved in zzso of the zzso activity by zzso and identifies a water zzso observed in the native zzso zzso structure which, once activated by zzso may zzso the active zzso Rather than reflecting the active zzso previously observed for zzso zzso the inhibited zzso zzso resembles that of the inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso The provision of a high-resolution structure of both active and inactive forms of zzso from a single zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso of zzso molecules in the active site provides insight into the binding of zzso and the specific interactions necessary for three different activities, zzso zzso and zzso within a single active zzso The sequence similarity of zzso and human zzso allows us to correlate structure with clinical zzso
