The zzso coli regulatory protein zzso controls the expression of eight zzso units that zzso proteins involved in the zzso and transport of aromatic zzso zzso It is a zzso of 57 600 zzso molecular weight and has a binding site for zzso and weak zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso binds zzso which zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso to a zzso This report examines the interaction of zzso with a 42 zzso DNA zzso containing a centrally located binding site for zzso zzso zzso Replacement of a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso at positions 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 22, and 26 from one end of the zzso enables labeling with zzso and successive placement of the label along the major groove of the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was followed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso caused significant changes in the fluorescent properties of the labels attached to positions 13, 15, and 26, suggesting the involvement of these bases in the binding of the zzso Except for the position 15 zzso binding of the zzso zzso caused little change in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to follow the binding zzso The zzso of the position 15 zzso increased zzso on binding zzso suggesting that the zzso was in close contact with the zzso For all zzso the addition of zzso at the end of the zzso with zzso increased the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso form of zzso could bind the zzso Two zzso correlation times were found for the labeled zzso one reflecting the motion of the probe at its point of attachment to the DNA zzso zzso the other reflecting the global tumbling of the labeled zzso zzso zzso On binding zzso changes in the correlation times and their associated zzso and changes in the range of angular motion of the probe depended on the position of the zzso Evidence is presented that the binding of the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso affects regions that flank the binding zzso The results support the hypothesis that the binding of the zzso zzso is responsible for interaction between tandem zzso boxes in the zzso zzso
