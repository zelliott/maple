The zzso zzso zzso channel zzso is an important component of the zzso zzso in many zzso The identification of three zzso of zzso zzso beta and zzso as well as results from a number of functional and zzso studies, suggests that functional zzso channels are composed of a complex of zzso To learn about possible interactions of the channel with other zzso we studied the zzso of rat and human zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso of both rat and human zzso expressed as zzso zzso fusion zzso bound to zzso zzso in zzso A 116 zzso protein from a human lung zzso cell line zzso was specifically bound by the human zzso zzso fusion protein and by a shorter zzso acid zzso zzso derived from the larger fusion zzso The 116 zzso protein was not zzso and was not zzso on zzso or by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein which was also bound by the human zzso zzso fusion protein was a zzso for zzso by zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso tail of zzso may interact with other proteins that control its function, regulation or zzso
