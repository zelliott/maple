The zzso genes coding for zzso growth factor II zzso and its specific zzso zzso are zzso zzso with exclusive expression from the paternal zzso or maternal zzso gene zzso We have demonstrated that the human zzso gene is zzso like its zzso zzso To examine whether the human zzso is also zzso we used CA repeat zzso of the zzso sequence to distinguish expression from each zzso Unlike the zzso most subjects equally expressed both gene zzso However, two out of 14 zzso fetuses showed exclusive expression from the maternal gene zzso We conclude that the human zzso gene is zzso zzso like its zzso zzso but only in a minority of zzso This is the first direct demonstration of zzso as a zzso zzso a property that had been observed in zzso zzso and predicted from the behavior of certain human zzso
