Human zzso studies in African Americans have shown a strong correlation between zzso in the zzso gene and chronic kidney disease zzso To gain further insight into the zzso of zzso kidney diseases, the determination of circulating levels of both wild type as well as zzso zzso could be of significant zzso To date, zzso that discriminate between all three zzso zzso forms zzso type, zzso and zzso are not zzso We aimed to develop a rapid method for detecting and zzso zzso zzso and total levels in zzso 

zzso liquid zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso in zzso monitoring acquisition mode was used to zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that it is feasible to detect and zzso zzso zzso zzso type, zzso and zzso and total zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso determined by zzso agreed perfectly with the traditional method DNA sequencing for 74 human zzso The method exhibited at least three orders of zzso with a lower limit of zzso of 10 zzso Moreover, the method can readily be zzso for the zzso of a panel of protein markers in a single zzso 

The method reported zzso zzso the need to perform DNA zzso of zzso zzso which is of significant value in cases where stored samples are zzso for DNA zzso More importantly, the method could potentially be of use in the early identification of individuals at risk of developing zzso and for the zzso of patients for treatment with future zzso zzso
