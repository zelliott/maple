The Luc gene from the zzso zzso zzso has been isolated by cloning it in zzso zzso zzso primer and zzso zzso and the zzso gene isolated from zzso zzso using the zzso chain zzso A method has been established using zzso zzso zzso for zzso and translating zzso genes in zzso It should now be possible to engineer these genes to measure zzso zzso and the zzso modification of proteins in single, live cells, providing unique insights into the molecular basis of zzso
