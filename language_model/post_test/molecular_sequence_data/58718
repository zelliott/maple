To investigate the zzso initiation mechanism of the gene zzso zzso zzso one of the major zzso zzso to promote the zzso transition, we cloned the zzso portion of rat zzso D3 gene and analyzed the promoter zzso The major zzso start point of the gene was identified by the primer extension experiment to be zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso and its promoter region was found to have no zzso zzso zzso The DNA mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso analysis using nuclear extracts from zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso have clearly revealed that the promoter possesses two binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso One is located between zzso and zzso zzso zzso I) and the other between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso factors by zzso was blocked by simultaneous addition of zzso suggesting that protein synthesis was necessary for the release of these zzso zzso zzso Region I contained putative binding elements for zzso zzso and zzso and Region II contained elements for a zzso and a novel zzso These results suggest that the zzso D3 gene is a zzso gene whose zzso is regulated by multiple zzso zzso factors including an unknown zzso
