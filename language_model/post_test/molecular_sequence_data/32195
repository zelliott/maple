zzso zzso administration of either human zzso hormone zzso or zzso human zzso provides for dramatic increases in bone mass in women with zzso zzso We initiated a program to discover orally zzso small zzso zzso of these zzso A traditional zzso screening approach using zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso failed to provide any lead zzso zzso we designed a new screen for this zzso that used a modified zzso zzso of zzso as a probe for small zzso binding to the zzso region of the zzso driven by the assumption that the pharmacological properties zzso of compounds that bound to this putative signaling domain of the zzso could be altered by chemical zzso We developed zzso a 14 zzso acid zzso that acts as a potent zzso of the zzso and characterized its activity in ex zzso and in zzso zzso of bone zzso In addition, we studied its ability to initiate gene zzso by using zzso zzso Together, these experiments indicated that the highly modified 14 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso similar biological responses to those produced by zzso albeit with lower potency relative to the parent zzso Encouraged by these data, we performed a screen of a small compound collection by using zzso as the zzso These studies led to the identification of the zzso zzso a previously zzso small zzso zzso for the zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso was rationalized by using a zzso zzso zzso
