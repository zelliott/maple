A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clone was isolated from a zzso zzso adult zzso zzso The clone encodes a zzso zzso 197 zzso acids with a zzso Mr zzso zzso It has the 2 classical zzso zzso from the typical zzso zzso and its primary zzso acid sequence shows higher identity with 2 zzso zzso zzso Northern and Southern zzso zzso exhibit an zzso with a size of zzso zzso zzso by 1 zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso is a zzso composed by zzso of zzso zzso that presented activity with hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso zzso It presented the zzso mechanism for a typical zzso because the zzso oxidized form is reduced to a zzso form by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso and was converted to a zzso oxidized form by zzso Western zzso studies using zzso against zzso revealed that the protein is expressed during the entire zzso zzso life cycle, as in other zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso is localized on the zzso and in zzso and muscle cells of zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso can tolerate zzso levels of zzso zzso for zzso zzso
