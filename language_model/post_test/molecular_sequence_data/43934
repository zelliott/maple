The zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso are among the most abundant zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso Both molecules are zzso zzso Each zzso chain is comprised of an zzso domain and a rod zzso The rod domain of the zzso factor consists of six zzso repetitive segments with high internal zzso We have now determined the three-dimensional structure of segment 4 of the rod domain of the zzso factor from zzso zzso using zzso zzso The segment consists of seven zzso arranged in an zzso zzso zzso This is completely different from the zzso rod domain which consists of four zzso zzso zzso The zzso factor is the first example of an zzso found in an zzso zzso Two highly zzso zzso proteins from human with similar sequences to the zzso factor, zzso and a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso share zzso zzso that form the core of the zzso factor repetitive segment zzso Thus, the segment 4 structure should be common to this zzso of the zzso zzso The structure of segment 4 together with previously published electron zzso data, provide an explanation for the zzso of the whole zzso factor zzso
