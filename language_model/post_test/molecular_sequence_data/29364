The zzso start site of zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso One signal corresponding to a single promoter has been found, whereas three major signals were observed for the zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated that zzso has just one promoter that zzso with the zzso promoter, with the other two signals observed by zzso probably being the consequence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso from the aforementioned promoters is regulated by zzso We show that bacterial growth phase affects expression of these promoters as zzso zzso expression was higher at the exponential growth phase and declined afterwards, whereas zzso expression was triggered at the onset of the stationary growth zzso A model for the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso which includes an analysis of the interplay between both zzso is zzso
