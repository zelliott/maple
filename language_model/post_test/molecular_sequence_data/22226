zzso peptides have been found throughout living nature, yet zzso sequences may still lie hidden within a wide variety of zzso A rational strategy was developed to select interesting zzso based on the presumed common features of zzso zzso and to release these from accessible and safe zzso In zzso zzso simulations of bovine zzso zzso with selected zzso predicted the liberation of peptides that encompasses a zzso zzso zzso Three predicted peptides were zzso and tested for their biological activity, demonstrating that one single zzso was sufficient to obtain an zzso zzso The proof of principle demonstrated that a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso possessed strong zzso zzso Moreover, zzso crude digest had improved activity over native zzso zzso selective zzso of zzso increases its zzso activity by release of zzso zzso
