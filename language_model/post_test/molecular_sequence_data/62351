The zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso This gene has five zzso and it encodes a protein consisting of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso was shown to have high zzso with zzso from other zzso In addition to removal of a putative zzso signal sequence and a zzso zzso maturation of the translation product of zzso was shown to involve zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso under the zzso zzso zzso Extremely low production was obtained with the expression construct containing zzso zzso with its own signal and zzso zzso The activity levels were significantly improved by replacing these sequences with the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The role of the zzso extension in zzso production in zzso zzso was also zzso zzso production was increased zzso with the modified zzso that had a stop zzso after the native processing site at the C zzso
