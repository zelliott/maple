We have used the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as a probe and cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso 265 gene zzso an zzso pH zzso acid zzso zzso from a zzso zzso The identity of the zzso zzso gene was confirmed and its zzso zzso sequence verified by comparing its deduced zzso acid zzso sequence to that of zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences of the An and zzso genes suggested that errors were made in the previously reported An zzso zzso Several regions of the An zzso were zzso and the mistakes zzso With its zzso sequence corrected, the An zzso is nearly identical to the cloned zzso gene zzso zzso and in zzso agreement in the coding zzso Both genes have three zzso zzso and when zzso both zzso sequences code for a zzso of zzso zzso There is now evidence that the two cloned genes are zzso and code for acid zzso that are zzso zzso
