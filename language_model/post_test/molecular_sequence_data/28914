Most zzso cycle zzso bacteria lack zzso zzso and convert zzso zzso A zzso to zzso via a novel zzso thought to involve zzso and zzso as zzso In this study we have used a zzso analysis approach followed by zzso to test a number of genes for involvement in this novel zzso We show that zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso are involved in zzso zzso We also monitored the fate of zzso carbon originating from zzso zzso or zzso in zzso defective in zzso zzso and identified new potential zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A new scheme for the zzso is proposed based on these zzso
