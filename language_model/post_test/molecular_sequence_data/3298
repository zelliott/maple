The present paper reports the characterization of zzso zzso zzso sequences in the human zzso by using three complementary zzso zzso we identified zzso clones containing zzso by zzso screening of human DNA databases by using the entire sequence of a characterized zzso clone zzso as a zzso The zzso structure and integration sites of the zzso elements were zzso zzso new integration sites of zzso elements were revealed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso products identified a zzso that shows low identity zzso to the original clone zzso and slightly higher identity zzso to a closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we performed FISH zzso which revealed sites of integration of zzso not previously identified at the zzso zzso A preliminary analysis of genes mapping in the same bands as zzso integration sites was zzso several zzso relevant to zzso and/or pathological processes were zzso Our findings may provide clues to identify zzso integration sites adjacent to genes with important biological zzso
