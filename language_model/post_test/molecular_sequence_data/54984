The sieve element zzso zzso gene family originally was zzso to genes zzso structural components of zzso which are specialized zzso zzso proteins found solely in the zzso More recently, zzso genes discovered in various zzso plants were proposed to zzso the common zzso proteins zzso that plug sieve plates after zzso We carried out a comprehensive characterization of two tobacco zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso genes controlled by the zzso promoters were expressed specifically in immature sieve zzso and zzso fusion proteins formed zzso zzso in intact sieve elements as well as sieve plate plugs after zzso zzso proteins with and without fluorescent protein tags formed zzso similar in structure to native zzso bodies when zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the analysis of these protein complexes by electron zzso revealed zzso features resembling those of native zzso zzso interference lines were essentially devoid of zzso structures and lost zzso more rapidly after injury than control plants, thus confirming the role of zzso in sieve tube zzso We therefore provide direct evidence that zzso genes in tobacco zzso zzso zzso that affect zzso We also found that peptides recently identified in zzso zzso zzso plugs from squash zzso zzso represent zzso members of the zzso zzso Our results therefore suggest a common evolutionary origin for zzso found in the sieve elements of all zzso plants and demonstrate the exceptional status of zzso zzso in zzso
