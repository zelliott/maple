A zzso zzso a novel zinc finger protein has been isolated from a mouse zzso leukemia line on the basis of its expression of a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The putative gene was mapped on mouse zzso 1, closely linked to zzso but not linked to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is therefore named zzso zzso zzso clone zzso The putative zzso zzso by the zzso consists of 388 zzso acids with a zinc finger motif and three copies of nuclear zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso fusion protein reacted with a protein of 45 zzso on Western blots and by zzso zzso indicated that zzso was present predominantly in the zzso The zzso zzso was not detected in brain, zzso bone zzso liver, heart, and zzso Low levels of zzso zzso were detected in kidney and zzso However, the zzso gene was expressed at very high levels in immature zzso in zzso The zzso zzso is present at high levels in early zzso and zzso in fetal liver and fetal zzso A number of zzso and zzso zzso lines expressed zzso at high levels, although it was not zzso in bone zzso and zzso During zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and in acute T leukemia zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso from a zzso zzso though not zzso transformed in zzso had increased ability to form tumors in zzso zzso zzso zzso may function as a novel zzso zzso to regulate cell zzso
