zzso zzso proteins are believed to play an integral role in zzso transport through their interaction with zzso Different zzso proteins have been shown to interact with zzso via different mechanisms, leading to the conclusion that their function has zzso To further explore this notion, in this study, we have examined the molecular interactions between zzso and its zzso zzso as these molecules are zzso expressed in zzso and likely regulate a universal plasma membrane trafficking zzso Thus, zzso binds to zzso zzso and the zzso 29 zzso acids of zzso are necessary for this zzso We identified key zzso in zzso and zzso that determine the zzso interaction and that are consistent with the zzso binding mode of zzso proteins zzso and zzso In addition, zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso complex compared to assembly with zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso interacts with its zzso zzso in a manner that resembles the zzso proteins zzso and zzso rather than the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso The zzso interactions described here imply that zzso could play a positive regulatory role in zzso zzso
