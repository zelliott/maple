zzso zzso zzso are characterized by a zzso linkage at the zzso of the zzso zzso In humans this type of zzso species occurs mainly in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso an estimated zzso of total zzso The zzso linkage is zzso by replacement of the zzso chain in zzso by a zzso alcohol that donates the oxygen for the zzso zzso Both the zzso that forms zzso zzso (see Chapter II of this zzso and the one that introduces the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are located in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso errors of zzso caused by defects in zzso zzso has clearly delineated the indispensable role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The most characteristic zzso of zzso zzso synthesis is zzso zzso Its discovery and some of its properties, including zzso studies, have been discussed in recent zzso This review zzso these findings and focuses on the new insights into the structure and properties of the zzso that have recently been obtained resulting from the zzso and subsequent cloning and expression of the zzso zzso this zzso zzso
