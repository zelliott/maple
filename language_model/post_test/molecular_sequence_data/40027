To identify a novel zzso in zzso and to detect the zzso zzso zzso distribution in Chinese zzso 

zzso and sequencing were conducted to identify zzso zzso in the variable region of zzso and zzso were applied in detecting the zzso zzso in 166 Chinese zzso 

A novel zzso sequence was found in the second zzso of zzso which was composed of 15 base pairs zzso zzso zzso The repeat times ranged from 3 to zzso There were three common zzso containing three repeats zzso four repeats zzso and five repeats zzso respectively, which produced three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The frequency of zzso zzso c zzso were zzso zzso zzso respectively in Chinese zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso information content zzso was zzso The screened result of zzso was consistent with that of zzso 

A novel highly zzso zzso in zzso exists in Chinese zzso zzso is the most efficient technique for screening zzso zzso
