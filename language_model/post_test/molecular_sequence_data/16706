Studies investigating the mechanisms that govern the expression of the human zzso II zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso gene have progressed slowly due to the lack of human cell lines that express the zzso Recently, however, an immortalized human zzso cell line zzso was demonstrated to respond to zzso zzso zzso we zzso this cell line to characterize the zzso expressed on the cell surface and to investigate the mechanisms by which the zzso gene is regulated in these zzso zzso cells were shown to express functional high affinity zzso having a zzso value of zzso zzso protein and a zzso value of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso production was zzso via the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter localized a major zzso regulatory sequence within the zzso to zzso zzso region, relative to the zzso start site, in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso factors, zzso and zzso interact with this region of the zzso promoter in zzso and in zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso cells express functional zzso and that zzso level expression of this gene is zzso in part, by zzso and zzso in this cell zzso
