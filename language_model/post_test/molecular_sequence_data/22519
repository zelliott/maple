One or more zzso factors with zzso activities in the locust pathogen zzso zzso zzso culture zzso were found to cause the death of zzso zzso A novel zzso protein was zzso to zzso It was a zzso of 61 zzso The zzso protein showed a strong zzso effect with a median lethal dosage of zzso zzso zzso and contained a high level of zzso activity (101 U zzso zzso activity was significantly decreased when the protein was zzso with zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso and it was restored when the treated protein was incubated with zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso protein showed sequence similarity with zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results suggested that the factor primarily responsible for zzso activity toward zzso was a zzso zzso zzso
