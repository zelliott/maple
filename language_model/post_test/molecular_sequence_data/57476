The members of the human beta zzso gene family are flanked by strong zzso I hypersensitive zzso The collection of sites zzso to the zzso zzso gene is able to zzso high levels of expression of linked zzso zzso but a function has not been assigned to the site 3' to the beta zzso gene zzso Our analysis of this zzso I super hypersensitive site shows that the region is composed of multiple zzso I zzso By examination of the DNA zzso we have determined that the region is very zzso and contains zzso II recognition zzso as well as several consensus binding motifs for zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicate that the region can interact in zzso with zzso and zzso and functional studies show that the region serves as a scaffold attachment region in both zzso and zzso cell zzso Whereas many of the physical features of zzso are shared by zzso (a component of the zzso locus control zzso transient expression studies show that 3' zzso does not share the zzso zzso activity exhibited by zzso
