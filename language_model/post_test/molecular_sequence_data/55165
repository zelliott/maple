A novel zzso zzso strain, designated as zzso zzso was isolated from a deep sea zzso sample collected from Northern South China Sea at a depth of zzso zzso This isolate requires sea water or a zzso medium for zzso zzso searches based on the almost full length of the zzso zzso gene zzso showed that strain zzso zzso had the highest similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trees reconstructed on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso zzso formed a distinct lineage with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso % zzso Further analysis of the zzso zzso data, including zzso zzso and zzso properties, showed that strain zzso zzso could be readily distinguished from the most closely related members of the zzso zzso Thus, based on the zzso zzso data, a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
