A differential zzso display approach was used to study the gene expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the late blight pathogen zzso zzso Four zzso amplified zzso were selected and zzso The clone zzso showed a zzso transcript highly expressed in zzso A zzso search revealed an almost full sequence zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a twofold zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in Z compared with that of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The high level of zzso zzso in Z might reflect an increased number of gene copies, an increased zzso zzso rate, or zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso is twofold higher in Z and zzso than in zzso This relatively elevated zzso zzso could explain the high level of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso the zzso zzso content, but the level of zzso zzso drops to 50% that of zzso The data are consistent with a very active zzso protein synthesis during zzso phase, followed by a rapid zzso of zzso activity during zzso zzso
