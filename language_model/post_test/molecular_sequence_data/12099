By two-dimensional zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso from zzso zzso we identified 27 distinct spots and analyzed all of them by protein sequence zzso We demonstrated that protein zzso zzso is zzso by the open reading frame zzso and has sequence similarities to the zzso zzso protein zzso The proteins zzso and zzso were identified as spots zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized by zzso sequence zzso The spot zzso was recognized as an individual protein and also characterized by sequence zzso Furthermore, the complete primary sequence of zzso is reported, showing similarity only to zzso zzso zzso The sequence data of a further basic protein shows a high degree of similarity to zzso protein zzso therefore, it was designated zzso zzso different results compared to published sequence data were obtained for the protein zzso and zzso The putative zzso protein zzso could not be localized in the two-dimensional pattern of the total zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso it seems to be unlikely that this protein is a real constituent of the zzso zzso zzso
