zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso peptides from organisms separated extremely early in their evolutionary zzso The peptides intrigued us, however, with indications of some functional zzso We thus wanted to derive and compare predictions for their as yet unknown three-dimensional structures as a guide for and to be tested by further zzso 

zzso models were generated by use of a genetic zzso that selects according to basic protein structure principles exploiting available information such as the primary structures, secondary structure predictions and positions of zzso zzso zzso differences aside, the structural motif of an zzso zzso bundle with adjacent connections and zzso zzso is predicted for both types of zzso It combines the feature of zzso zzso with a zzso compact structure known from the zzso zzso and small zzso 

The models presented here strengthen the notion that zzso and zzso are particular among zzso and zzso zzso and share a similar function and structural zzso They also allow experimental testing and a better comparison of the two proteins in view of the predicted similarities and differences of their respective zzso
