zzso zzso of the related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso library of zzso zzso were examined for the presence of the zzso spliced leader zzso found at the zzso ends of 10 to zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso As in zzso zzso genes for the zzso zzso are linked to the repetitive zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but unlike zzso zzso they are in the same orientation as the zzso zzso genes within the repeat zzso In zzso zzso the zzso sequence is also zzso at more than 30 additional zzso locations and occurs at interior sites within many zzso zzso zzso of four different zzso of zzso zzso each containing an internal copy of the zzso within a zzso zzso and one corresponding zzso DNA clone indicate that this sequence is not trans spliced onto these zzso but is zzso within the zzso The zzso of two of these zzso appear to be zzso zzso since they occur in adult zzso zzso but were not detected in the zzso zzso stage zzso In contrast, zzso zzso are present at all zzso zzso and at least one zzso zzso species contains a zzso zzso zzso The internal locations of the zzso in various transcripts and its perfect sequence conservation among zzso and zzso zzso argues that it serves specific, and perhaps zzso functions for these zzso
