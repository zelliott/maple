zzso acid, a highly toxic zzso of zzso is zzso by a limited number of bacterial species utilizing an zzso reaction which yields zzso and zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso A zzso an zzso which transfers a zzso A zzso to activate zzso acid, was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed a single open reading frame of zzso zzso capable of zzso a zzso zzso A presumed promoter region and a zzso termination sequence suggest that this gene is part of a zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the open reading frame, when zzso in zzso coli, produced a product exhibiting zzso activity similar to the zzso native zzso With this, the two genes necessary for bacterial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have now been zzso zzso and zzso
