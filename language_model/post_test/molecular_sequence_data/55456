zzso properties of tight junctions are determined by the zzso protein zzso Many zzso seal this barrier, but others form zzso zzso Among these, no zzso with general and clear-cut zzso selectivity have yet been zzso while for zzso and zzso only circumstantial or small zzso zzso have been zzso A zzso with unknown function and tissue distribution is zzso We characterized zzso by zzso and zzso in two zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell layers caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and switched these cells from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso the finding of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso selectivity critically depends on a positive charge at position zzso zzso expression was found in two zzso marginal in brain but abundant in zzso where expression was intense in zzso zzso and gradually decreased towards zzso zzso As zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso which exhibit substantial, though zzso not zzso zzso zzso zzso we suggest that zzso has a unique zzso function in this zzso In conclusion, zzso forms channels within tight junctions with distinct zzso zzso
