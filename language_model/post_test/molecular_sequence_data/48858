A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from an zzso coastal zzso field in zzso The isolate is zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso gene sequences zzso strain zzso in a novel zzso clone cluster of the zzso zzso The isolate grows by zzso zzso and zzso under zzso conditions, which is the first report of these abilities in the zzso zzso The zzso is capable of growth with zzso zzso iron and nitrate as a possible electron zzso has a wide range of growth temperatures, and zzso higher zzso zzso for growth compared to the other zzso in the zzso Using zzso and zzso data, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed as the type strain of a novel species in a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, as strain zzso apparently constitutes a new class of the zzso zzso with other related zzso clone zzso we propose zzso zzso zzso and the subordinate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
