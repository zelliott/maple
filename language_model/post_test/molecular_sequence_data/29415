zzso samples of barley zzso zzso sieve tube sap have been obtained by severing the zzso zzso of feeding zzso and collecting the zzso zzso zzso were designed to direct the amplification of a series of specific zzso zzso barley proteins selected because of their significance in sieve tube zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso and the zzso zzso were detected in sieve tube zzso These zzso species appear to be present at very low zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso The results strongly suggest that some zzso species are imported into sieve zzso which are zzso from zzso companion zzso
