zzso virus 40 large zzso zzso transformation is thought to be zzso at least in part, by binding to and modulating the function of certain cellular zzso including the zzso tumor zzso gene product, zzso zzso can disrupt the zzso complexes formed by zzso with the zzso zzso factor zzso and this mechanism has been suggested to be important for zzso zzso zzso 102 to 114 of zzso (including the zzso zzso are required for binding to zzso zzso within this zzso motif abolish the ability of zzso to bind to zzso as well as to transform certain cell zzso zzso can also bind to at least two other cellular zzso zzso and zzso that are related to zzso by sequence zzso and share the ability to bind zzso However, whether zzso and zzso are also targets in zzso transformation is less zzso To assess the relative contribution of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to transformation by zzso zzso were prepared from zzso derived from zzso of mice zzso for an zzso knockout zzso The ability of zzso to transform zzso zzso for either zzso or knockout zzso zzso was zzso It is demonstrated that the integrity of the zzso motif provides a growth advantage in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso could bind to zzso and zzso and disrupt zzso and zzso binding zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso participate in zzso transformation and that they may behave as tumor zzso
