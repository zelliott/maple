An zzso strain zzso that was isolated from a farmland on the zzso campus of Zhejiang University was capable of zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was identified as a member of zzso Its zzso activity against zzso was measured using the zzso plate sensitivity method in pure culture and evaluated by the zzso ratio of zzso in zzso The zzso activity of strain zzso against zzso following exposure to low zzso of zzso was greater than the zzso activity following exposure to high zzso of zzso both in liquid culture and in zzso A stronger zzso was also seen following a 24 h zzso in the presence of zzso in liquid zzso The growth of zzso in soil was zzso at low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dry zzso but inhibited when cultured in high zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso dry zzso A higher zzso ratio of strain zzso against zzso which was over zzso after soil incubation for 2 weeks, was observed following exposure to low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dry zzso
