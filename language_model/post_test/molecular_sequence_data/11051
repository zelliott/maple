We have investigated the ability of a zzso protein zzso derived from zzso zzso toxin A zzso domain, to protect against toxin A zzso intoxication in zzso and in zzso zzso was zzso expressed and zzso by zzso affinity zzso and demonstrated identical binding properties to zzso zzso experiments and in zzso zzso zzso using mouse zzso cells zzso showed that specific binding of zzso to zzso cells through its zzso domain is essential for producing zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso was inhibited by zzso and a zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso B did not bind to zzso cells and was consequently inactive in zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso and a zzso zzso supported earlier findings that a terminal zzso is part of the bound zzso but excluded zzso as a zzso for zzso Mice zzso with zzso were protected against a zzso lethal dose of zzso Thus, zzso appeared to be a suitable candidate to develop an alternative therapeutic agent, which is able to zzso zzso zzso binding and might act as a zzso
