We report the organization of a zzso zzso gene zzso composed by an zzso zzso into which a zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family, but does not zzso to any other zzso zzso described to zzso zzso albeit zzso is the most complete zzso zzso terminal zzso element described in zzso zzso zzso It is zzso zzso long, with two almost identical zzso zzso zzso in the same orientation, and flanked by direct repeats of a 5 zzso host zzso This element presents other features, characteristic of zzso and zzso including zzso repeats, a primer binding site, and a zzso zzso It has a single open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso potentially zzso for a gag protein and parts of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is most likely related to the zzso type family, but with no significant similarity to any previously described plant zzso or inserted element, nor to any zzso element described to zzso zzso element has been found in zzso at the same location in different zzso zzso zzso but not in some other analyzed zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso in zzso is specific to zzso zzso and has occurred after the zzso zzso zzso but prior to zzso zzso zzso related to zzso were revealed in multiple copies in the zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, in other analyzed zzso zzso The zzso observed zzso us to question the role played by zzso in the evolution of the zzso zzso
