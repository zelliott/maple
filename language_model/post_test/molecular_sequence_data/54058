The most peculiar zzso property of zzso zzso zzso as well as of other genes served by zzso zzso III, is their complete dependence on the zzso interaction platform provided by zzso factor zzso zzso for the productive assembly of the zzso initiation factor zzso The sole exception, in zzso is the zzso zzso zzso which is able to exploit a zzso element, 30 zzso upstream of the zzso start site, for the zzso assembly of zzso To find out whether this zzso core promoter organization and autonomous zzso assembly capacity are unique features of the zzso gene or also apply to other genes transcribed by zzso zzso III, we scanned the zzso regions (up to position zzso of the entire zzso gene set of zzso zzso searching for zzso zzso zzso Four zzso genes harboring such a sequence motif around position zzso were identified and found to be transcribed in zzso by a minimal system only composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this system, start site selection is not at all affected by the absence of zzso which, when added, significantly stimulates zzso by determining an increase in the number, rather than in the efficiency of zzso of productive initiation zzso A specific zzso element interaction is absolutely required for zzso transcription, but the nearby sequence context also contributes to the efficiency of autonomous zzso zzso The existence of a zzso assembly zzso leading to the faithful zzso of natural zzso zzso genes in the absence of zzso provides novel insights into the functional flexibility of the zzso zzso gene zzso machinery and on its evolution from an ancestral zzso zzso III system relying on upstream, zzso centered control zzso
