A DNA zzso zzso specifically zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to investigate the location of zzso region 4 in different complexes at the zzso promoter and the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The positions of DNA zzso by the zzso are not affected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso at the zzso promoter by the zzso zzso zzso protein does not involve major zzso changes in or repositioning of zzso region zzso
