An analysis of the zzso tolerance of 354 zzso zzso zzso showed that some zzso were more tolerant to salt shock than the reference accession, zzso when transferred from 0 to 225 zzso zzso In addition, several zzso including zzso showed marked acquired salt tolerance after exposure to moderate salt zzso It is likely therefore that zzso plants have at least two types of zzso salt shock tolerance and acquired salt zzso To evaluate a role of well-known salt shock tolerant gene zzso in acquired salt zzso we isolated a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed severe growth zzso under salt shock stress zzso to a single base deletion in the zzso gene and was even more salt sensitive than zzso Nevertheless, it was able to survive after zzso on 100 zzso zzso for 7 d followed by 750 zzso zzso for 20 zzso whereas zzso became zzso under the same zzso We propose that genes for salt zzso ability are different from genes for salt shock tolerance and play an important role in the acquisition of salt or zzso zzso
