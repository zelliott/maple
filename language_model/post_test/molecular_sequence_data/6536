The coexistence of two zzso distinct zzso species within a single cell, a condition not previously known in any zzso is demonstrated in the zzso of a Mid-Atlantic Ridge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Large and small zzso zzso within the zzso zzso are shown to be separate bacterial species by molecular zzso analysis and fluorescent in zzso zzso The two zzso species are affiliated with zzso and zzso zzso previously found in zzso associations with closely related zzso from zzso zzso vents and hydrocarbon zzso
