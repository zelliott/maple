A zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso catalyzing conversion of zzso zzso to corresponding zzso zzso was cloned from secondary zzso of zzso zzso The cloned zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso played crucial role in expression and activity of zzso such that, at zzso and at 2 zzso zzso the zzso was zzso expressed as active zzso in soluble zzso The expressed protein was zzso zzso to zzso on zzso zzso column with specific activity of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited lowest zzso with zzso alcohol zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso exhibited high zzso zzso with zzso zzso 20 zzso and zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso The in zzso analysis of zzso protein exhibited four characteristic consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso structural zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso structure, generated using zzso zzso exhibited a zzso structure with zzso out structural zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso binding zzso formed a pocket protected by two major zzso The zzso zzso sequence zzso and 3-D model, all supported that the cloned zzso belongs to alcohol zzso family of zzso
