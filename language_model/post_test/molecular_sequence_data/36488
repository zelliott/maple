The chronic regulation of zzso is zzso principally by zzso regulation of the genes zzso the various zzso zzso The cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso is rate limiting and zzso regulated in a zzso zzso Human zzso zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso through increased zzso zzso and zzso and zzso increase the abundance of human zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso cells with 24 zzso constructions to examine the zzso and zzso induced zzso of the human zzso gene in these zzso A reporter construction containing only bases zzso to zzso of the human zzso gene was expressed in zzso zzso This zzso expression was increased by four zzso especially by a powerful element between zzso to zzso Adding DNA sequences to zzso suppressed the zzso expression seen with the zzso construction, indicating that a zzso element lies between zzso and zzso Thus, zzso expression of the human zzso gene in zzso cells is zzso by the interplay of several separate zzso DNA zzso zzso induction was zzso by sequences between zzso and zzso The mechanism for zzso induction appears to be zzso as this induction is rapid and is not blocked by zzso protein synthesis with zzso zzso mobility shift experiments identified six specific zzso zzso Five of these complexes correlate closely with the zzso zzso activities identified by the reporter zzso The powerful zzso element, the zzso element, and the zzso element differ from those identified by similar experiments in mouse adrenal zzso cells, suggesting that the human zzso gene is regulated by the zzso use of different regulatory zzso
