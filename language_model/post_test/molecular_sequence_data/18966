The present study aims to investigate small zzso interactions with putative disease response genes in the model grass species zzso zzso The zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso salicylic acid treatment were used to induce the disease response in zzso Initially, 121 different putative disease response genes were identified using zzso and zzso based zzso zzso prediction was used to identify 33 candidate new zzso coding zzso of which 9 were verified by analysis of small zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso target sites were identified in the disease response zzso and a subset of which were screened for expression and possible zzso interactions in 5 different zzso lines infected with zzso An zzso family zzso zzso was zzso among the lines, forming two major zzso one of which has its zzso target sites deleted, resulting in altered gene expression during zzso There were zzso zzso involved in regulation of this zzso indicating a role of small zzso in the zzso zzso disease zzso
