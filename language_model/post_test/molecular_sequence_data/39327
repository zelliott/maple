The abundance and the conservation of the repeated element zzso genes in zzso zzso suggest that this gene family plays an important role in viral zzso In the zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso named zzso 10 rep genes were identified to zzso In this work, we report a relative quantitative zzso study of these zzso rep genes in several zzso of the zzso host zzso zzso as well as in the zzso zzso zzso 

The data obtained in this work indicate that, in the early zzso of infection (24 hours), zzso rep genes each display different levels of transcripts in zzso 2nd zzso or zzso last zzso zzso zzso zzso Only one, zzso is significantly transcribed in female zzso zzso levels of the zzso rep genes were found as not correlated to their copy number in zzso zzso Our results also show that zzso rep genes display different tissue zzso and that they are primarily transcribed in zzso zzso fat body and zzso zzso 

This work is the first quantitative analysis of zzso of the zzso rep gene family, and the first investigation on a correlation between transcript levels and gene copy numbers in zzso Our data indicate that, despite similar gene copy numbers, not all the members of this gene family are significantly transcribed 24 hours after infection in zzso zzso Additionally, our data show that, as opposed to other described zzso zzso rep genes are little transcribed in zzso thus suggesting that they are not directly associated with the disruption of the immune response but rather involved in other zzso zzso of the infected zzso zzso
