zzso a zzso zzso in patients with systemic lupus zzso was one of the first cellular proteins identified to interact with viral internal zzso entry site zzso elements and stimulate zzso zzso and zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso Previous results from our laboratory have shown that a small, zzso zzso zzso could selectively inhibit zzso and zzso zzso translation by zzso the La zzso Here we have identified an zzso sequence from the zzso zzso zzso which is required for efficient interaction of La with zzso and viral zzso untranslated region zzso zzso A synthetic zzso (called zzso for La zzso corresponding to this sequence zzso acids 11 to zzso of La was found to efficiently inhibit viral zzso translation in zzso The zzso efficiently enters zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso translation programmed by a zzso zzso in zzso The zzso does not bind zzso directly but appears to block La binding to zzso and zzso zzso Competition zzso zzso and translation rescue experiments suggested that zzso zzso zzso translation by interacting with proteins rather than zzso zzso of zzso demonstrates that single zzso acid changes in a highly zzso sequence within zzso are sufficient to eliminate the zzso activity of zzso When one of these zzso zzso is introduced into full-length zzso the zzso protein is severely defective in interacting with the zzso zzso element and consequently unable to stimulate zzso zzso However, the La protein with a zzso of the next zzso zzso zzso could still interact with zzso zzso and stimulate viral zzso translation zzso These results underscore the importance of the La zzso zzso acids in zzso binding and viral zzso zzso The possible role of the zzso sequence in zzso binding and stimulation of viral zzso translation is zzso
