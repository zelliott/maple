zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that generates zzso zzso for zzso DNA replication and processes precursor zzso zzso P is a ubiquitous zzso that zzso precursor zzso transcripts to produce their mature zzso zzso We found extensive sequence zzso of zzso zzso and specificity zzso between their zzso zzso in many zzso In zzso zzso the internal loop of zzso zzso is zzso zzso between zzso and P zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is identical to that of P zzso zzso zzso can be widely spread over the whole zzso of zzso zzso and P zzso such as those from zzso zzso These zzso zzso between the zzso and P zzso strongly support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso is derived from the P zzso zzso in early zzso zzso
