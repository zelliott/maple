Three compounds of the pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso associated protein C zzso spread at the zzso interface of a zzso trough as a model system to mimic the properties of natural zzso Fluorescence zzso images of the film formed at the interface were obtained during zzso using a zzso dye bound zzso either to zzso or to zzso The images were zzso using statistical methods in respect to relative areas and relative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In the early stage of zzso film pressure rose slightly and was accompanied by a phase separation which could be recognized in the images by the formation of bright and dark zzso On further zzso after a steep increase of film pressure, a plateau region of constant film pressure started zzso During zzso in the plateau region, zzso intensity of the bright domain formed in the early stage of zzso zzso The increasing zzso intensity, the zzso intensity distribution of the bright domain, and the small mean molecular area of the film in the plateau region gave rise to the assumption that zzso structures were formed in the late stage of zzso The formation of the zzso structures was fully zzso in repeated zzso cycles including the plateau region of the phase zzso The ability of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso structures during zzso may be relevant to stability in lungs during expiration and zzso
