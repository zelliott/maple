The ultimate goal of zzso zzso research is to develop new patient therapies that use the advantages offered by human zzso zzso The establishment of a zzso method for obtaining valuable candidate zzso zzso must be accelerated to achieve this zzso In this study, based on our concept that we can find zzso light chains with a high probability of success if they include a zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso on a variable region of the zzso structure, we amplified and cloned zzso zzso human zzso light chains from zzso genes of zzso II by zzso zzso using two primer sets designed for this zzso Seven DNA fragments zzso light chains in 17 clones were derived from zzso gene zzso 6 DNA fragments from zzso 2 DNA fragments from zzso and a clone DNA zzso from A5 and zzso All light chains expressed in zzso coli and highly zzso under zzso conditions exhibited zzso activity against synthetic zzso Some of the light chains exhibited unique features that suppressed the infectious activity of the rabies zzso Furthermore, the survival rate of mice in which a lethal level of the rabies virus was zzso directly into the brain with light chain 18 was significantly zzso In the case of humans, these results demonstrate that zzso selection of light chains possessing zzso functions and specificity for a target zzso can be attained from a zzso DNA library amplified from zzso genes belonging to zzso zzso
