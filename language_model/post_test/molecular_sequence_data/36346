The target zzso recognized by zzso zzso T zzso zzso specific for a zzso zzso on zzso tumor zzso was identified as the product of a normal cellular gene encompassing a point zzso Using synthetic zzso the zzso recognized by these zzso was narrowed down to be contained within the zzso zzso incorporating the point zzso The zzso zzso motif for zzso molecules allowed us to predict the zzso naturally presented by the tumor cells to be the zzso zzso Isolation of the natural zzso zzso from zzso tumor cells and zzso comparison with the synthetic zzso confirmed the zzso This natural zzso is represented by approximately 100 copies per tumor zzso
