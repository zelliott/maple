zzso at the zzso locus has been implicated in a number of disease association zzso The zzso locus consists of three regions of zzso repeats separated by an imperfect repeat of two zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by the number of repeats in the first zzso repeat region, and until now the second repeat region had been thought to be zzso We report the existence of zzso present within the zzso zzso zzso detected using induced zzso generator zzso zzso These zzso cannot be detected using conventional typing strategies as they represent altered distribution of the zzso repeats or sequence variation within the zzso The zzso affect the zzso of the conventional zzso and d4 zzso leading to significantly altered zzso zzso Some studies have associated the zzso and d4 zzso with disease zzso We zzso one such study cohort using zzso technology and demonstrated a high proportion of incorrectly assigned zzso zzso
