The analysis of experimental data of exponential type plays a central role in many zzso zzso We introduce a novel zzso zzso to analyze the association phase and zzso phase of surface zzso resonance zzso It is shown that this zzso can determine kinetic zzso with a high level of accuracy in the presence of significant levels of zzso This zzso should provide a valuable alternative to existing data analysis zzso
