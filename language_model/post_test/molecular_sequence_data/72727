The DNA sequences targeted by a complete zzso series of aromatic zzso have been determined at zzso resolution via protection from cutting by the zzso zzso I, zzso II and zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso bind selectively to zzso sequences composed of at least four consecutive zzso base zzso In contrast, the binding to DNA of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is poorly zzso zzso composed of only three consecutive zzso base pairs do not afford a potential binding site for zzso or the longer zzso and none of the drugs tolerate the presence of a zzso base pair within the binding zzso zzso with DNA molecules containing zzso in place of zzso and zzso in place of zzso reveal that the lack of binding of zzso to zzso sites is attributable to an zzso effect of the zzso zzso group of zzso The present data support the view that the local zzso of the double zzso (in particular the zzso of the minor zzso plays a dominant role in the binding reaction and that the capacity of zzso to recognize zzso sequences selectively varies considerably depending on the length of the zzso zzso The evidence indicates that binding to zzso in DNA must play a role in the biological activity of these zzso but there is no simple correlation between binding and pharmacological zzso
