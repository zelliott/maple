We cloned the chicken zzso gene and performed in zzso analysis to investigate conservation in patterns of expression between the chicken and zzso The anterior boundaries of expression for both genes in segmented zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso map to the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso limits, showing a direct correlation between expression of a specific zzso gene and patterning identical zzso structures in both zzso Given this similarity in expression we have tested the functional activity of zzso regions from the chicken zzso gene in transgenic mice to identify and map components zzso between the zzso We identified enhancers which contain zzso blocks of sequence identity and which are necessary to mediate zzso and neural restricted patterns of zzso However, only the neural zzso directs the proper anterior boundary of expression zzso indicating that only a subset of the underlying molecular components regulating zzso expression are functionally zzso between zzso
