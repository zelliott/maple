The zzso protein complex and several zzso zzso bind directly or indirectly to a common sequence element that is similar to the consensus binding site for zzso cell zzso protein 1 zzso This element is present in a negative regulatory sequence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso leukemia zzso and in a region of the human zzso virus zzso long terminal repeat partially characterized as a negative regulatory zzso The protein level and binding activity of zzso and zzso zzso increase rapidly after calcium zzso treatment of a zzso human zzso cell line, zzso These data suggest that several proteins may associate with the zzso binding zzso Moreover, temporally regulated control of the level of each protein could represent a mechanism for zzso of these putative zzso of gene zzso
