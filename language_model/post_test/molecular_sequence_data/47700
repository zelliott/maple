zzso receptors zzso are required zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone is zzso zzso However, when zzso is combined with an inward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity is zzso We report the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso a novel zzso gene that is highly related to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso coding sequence contains structural features characteristic of the ABC zzso family and, in addition, harbors zzso zzso of a distinctive sequence that does not share zzso with any known zzso When zzso alone is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity zzso During zzso zzso the zzso gene is specifically expressed in the developing zzso system and zzso zzso Studies of the zzso zzso support that only a single zzso gene is zzso Our data reveal conservation of zzso zzso channels in zzso and suggest that zzso may play an important role during zzso zzso The lack of gene zzso in the zzso system provides a unique opportunity for functional studies of zzso using a genetic zzso
