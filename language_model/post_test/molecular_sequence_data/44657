zzso intrinsic proteins zzso have been implicated in the process of cell zzso such as occurs in the developing cotton zzso We have isolated a zzso clone zzso zzso in zzso from a cotton zzso zzso zzso library which zzso encodes a protein of 248 zzso (Mr zzso with zzso identity to zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence included two zzso sequences associated with major intrinsic proteins zzso at zzso 78 to 85, zzso zzso at 197 to zzso and a zzso zzso at 116 which is reported to bind mercury in zzso zzso The zzso chain reaction was used to generate partial zzso clones of the cotton zzso In comparison to other zzso zzso zzso the number zzso and position of the zzso were zzso in zzso Comparing the zzso sequences from cotton revealed two zzso which were consistently distinguished by a zzso restriction site zzso This zzso was used to demonstrate that zzso zzso were specific to either the A or D zzso of zzso When zzso DNA fragments were amplified from zzso of fiber 14 days after zzso the A and D were found, indicating the presence of zzso transcripts in these zzso zzso
