Studies of zzso infection have shown lower rates of sexual and zzso transmission and a prolonged incubation period to AIDS as compared to zzso To evaluate the role of genetic variation in zzso zzso we studied zzso zzso in the zzso loop of the zzso envelope gene over time in five zzso zzso zzso sequences derived from zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an average sequence zzso within a sample of zzso zzso This was significantly lower than the zzso sequence zzso observed in zzso which can be as high as zzso In zzso healthy patients the average zzso zzso zzso rate was zzso compared to zzso in patients with clinical zzso The lower rate of zzso between zzso and zzso is compatible with differences in transmission and zzso of these two related zzso
