The zzso gene is part of the zzso zzso gene 200 cluster on zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso protein whose zzso is growth zzso and which can bind and inhibit the activity of numerous zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We report here the zzso structure of zzso and the discovery of zzso and zzso close zzso of zzso (whose designation we now change to zzso zzso zzso and c were zzso to zzso 1 bands zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso which is zzso and differs from zzso in only 7 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso in which zzso zzso is zzso zzso is apparently an zzso zzso In zzso embryonic zzso zzso from 129 mice, the level of zzso zzso is approximately half that of zzso zzso We knocked out the zzso gene from 129 zzso The expression of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso persisted in the knockout mice and their zzso at the same level as in zzso zzso However, in zzso from the knockout mice, the zzso and zzso levels of zzso were approximately as high as the zzso and the zzso levels of zzso plus zzso respectively, in zzso from zzso zzso These findings suggest dosage compensation at the zzso zzso This might account for the apparent lack of zzso of the knockout zzso
