zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso play a central role in zzso zzso synaptic transmission and are the target sites for the increasingly important group of zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (four zzso and two zzso have been cloned previously from the model insect species zzso zzso Despite extensive efforts, it has not been possible to generate functional zzso zzso by zzso expression of any combination of these six zzso It has, however, been possible to express functional hybrid receptors when zzso alpha zzso are zzso with zzso beta zzso This has led to the assumption that successful zzso expression might require zzso as yet, zzso zzso insect zzso zzso of the recently completed zzso zzso sequence data has identified a novel putative zzso zzso zzso Here we report the molecular zzso zzso expression and characterization of this putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons with other zzso zzso channel zzso sequences support its zzso as a zzso zzso but show it to be a zzso related member of this neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso Evidence that the zzso zzso is able to zzso with other zzso zzso zzso and contribute to zzso zzso has been obtained by both zzso binding and zzso studies in zzso zzso zzso zzso
