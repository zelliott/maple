We determined 46 spontaneous zzso occurring in the zzso zzso zzso protein gene zzso on the zzso DNA of zzso coli by the use of zzso zzso Of 24 base zzso 17 were zzso and 7 transitions including all types of base zzso The frequency of the changes of zzso base pairs was similar to that of zzso pairs, suggesting that zzso pair is also a target for base zzso zzso including zzso and four zzso zzso occurred at the sites of a run of identical zzso zzso extending 18 and zzso bases occurred at the sites where the deleted sequences were flanked by short repeated sequences at the zzso The insertions of zzso element or its zzso sequence were detected in two and six zzso zzso The zzso system of the zzso used here is available for the determination of the zzso spectrum of base zzso
