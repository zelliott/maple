The expression site zzso zzso of zzso zzso are a valuable model for zzso exclusion and zzso regulation in a highly divergent zzso zzso exist to facilitate the expression and switching of the zzso surface zzso zzso that are central to zzso zzso and zzso A collection of other potential zzso zzso known as zzso zzso are zzso from the single upstream zzso zzso may be involved in regulating the zzso state of the zzso as well as contributing additional surface proteins and zzso We have previously shown that a putative regulatory zzso zzso accumulates within the zzso although zzso of the protein is zzso Here we identify zzso a zzso zzso protein that falls into the zzso family of regulators of zzso zzso Our experiments show that, as in other zzso family zzso the most zzso repeats of zzso mediate its interaction with zzso zzso is essential for cell zzso and preliminary results suggest that its zzso seriously affects zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most evolutionary divergent zzso in which a zzso family protein has been identified, and our initial experiments suggest that this protein may also regulate zzso stability in zzso
