Major zzso complex zzso class I molecules present zzso peptides to zzso T zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso pathogens helps in designing better vaccines to control economically important human and animal zzso In this study, candidate zzso that are potentially available for presentation to the zzso via five bovine zzso class I molecules have been zzso This was accomplished by using the computer programs zzso and zzso of zzso package and applying the information on zzso patterns of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso class I zzso zzso motifs on 23 bovine zzso zzso proteins available on protein sequence zzso Several candidate peptides were found for each of the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas no zzso was found for zzso Majority of the candidate peptides were from the viral zzso The contribution of such studies towards the identification of zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso pathogens is zzso
