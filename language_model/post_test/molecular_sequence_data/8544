A three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is modeled using the structure of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso Both sequences share only zzso of identical zzso zzso for zzso modeling are defined from the structurally zzso regions predicted by multiple alignment of a set of related protein sequences with low zzso The model of the zzso zzso shows, as for the zzso zzso an zzso structure, with a zzso domain and a zzso binding zzso It points out the zzso zzso zzso and supports the hypothetical zzso zzso It also suggests that the other zzso involved in the active site are zzso possibly involved in the binding of the zzso group of the zzso and zzso a candidate for stabilizing the zzso group of the zzso
