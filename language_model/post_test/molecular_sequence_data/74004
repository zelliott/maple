The zzso reduction of zzso groups is of interest for the production of various zzso compounds such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Such products have high economic value and are most interesting as zzso for food and feed or as building blocks for organic zzso zzso reactions or zzso with whole cells zzso or zzso for this purpose are zzso Although zzso with whole cells are advantageous with respect to saving expensive isolation of the desired zzso the products often lack high zzso excess and the process results in low zzso For the synthesis of zzso zzso only zzso zzso with commercially available alcohol zzso have been described zzso However, most of these zzso are of limited use for technical applications because they lack zzso zzso stability zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, all zzso so far described are forming zzso Quite recently, we found and characterized several new bacterial alcohol zzso which are suited for the preparation of zzso alcohols as well as for zzso zzso in technical zzso zzso of all these novel zzso the zzso zzso were found in strains of the zzso zzso Meanwhile, these new zzso were characterized zzso zzso data zzso acid zzso bound zzso confirm that these zzso are novel zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso accept a broad variety of zzso and zzso as zzso The zzso of alcohol zzso for zzso zzso as an example for the technical use of zzso zzso is demonstrated and discussed in this zzso In particular zzso zzso coupled with the zzso zzso by zzso zzso proved to be economically feasible for the production of fine zzso
