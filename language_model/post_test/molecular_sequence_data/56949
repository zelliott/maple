zzso stimulation of T cells in zzso has been employed in the analysis of the T cell zzso zzso zzso repertoire and as a method of generating T cell lines and zzso It has been suspected for some time that zzso stimulation may bias the zzso We have addressed this problem employing a zzso technique utilizing the zzso chain reaction zzso and flow zzso Using this zzso method and a panel of zzso to 22 V beta subgroups, the V beta repertoire of both zzso and zzso zzso peripheral T cells from eight healthy individuals was zzso The samples were also zzso by flow zzso using zzso beta 2, V beta 5 and V beta 8 zzso A significant increase in the expression of V beta 6, V beta zzso and V beta zzso was found in all eight samples of zzso T cells compared with zzso T cells using the zzso zzso In contrast, no differences were found between zzso and zzso T cells by flow zzso These results question the zzso of using zzso T cells to investigate zzso gene zzso
