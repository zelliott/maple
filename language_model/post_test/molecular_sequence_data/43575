zzso was used with zzso zzso based on zzso zzso acid sequences in zzso zzso zzso to isolate zzso clones for these zzso from young seeds of pea zzso zzso and developing zzso of French bean zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained from pea and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso Their identities were confirmed by demonstrating that fusion proteins expressed in zzso coli exhibited zzso zzso activity, converting zzso to zzso The zzso in this three-step reaction, zzso and zzso were also identified as zzso The expression proteins from three of the clones zzso zzso and zzso were also shown to convert zzso to zzso as effectively as they did zzso On the basis of transcript levels measured by northern zzso analysis, the pea zzso zzso gene is most highly expressed in young leaves, fully expanded zzso very young seeds (until 4 days after zzso and expanding pods (from 3 days after zzso at least until day zzso zzso in pods from zzso zzso zzso is higher than in those from zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso to induce zzso zzso severely reduced the amount of zzso zzso zzso whereas treatment with zzso although inducing zzso did not reduce the levels of these zzso Plant zzso above an zzso zzso resulted in very high levels of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The three zzso zzso genes from French bean showed very different patterns of expression: zzso zzso was expressed in the roots, young leaves, and developing seeds, but most highly in immature zzso while zzso has a similar expression pattern to zzso with transcripts found only in young seeds and young leaves, where it was particularly zzso zzso corresponding to zzso were detected in developing seeds, and just traces in the young zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the bean zzso zzso are each zzso by zzso zzso whereas one more zzso zzso to zzso could also exist in zzso
