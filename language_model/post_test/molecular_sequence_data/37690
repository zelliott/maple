Currently, only one zzso marker is available for genetic studies in the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the generation of zzso markers that zzso resistance to zzso acid zzso in zzso species by zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was obtained by screening of a zzso library for zzso to a zzso zzso The complete zzso DNA sequence surrounding and including the zzso gene was zzso As expected, zzso zzso zzso is zzso related to other zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned into a zzso coli shuttle zzso and zzso with zzso Nine independent zzso clones were isolated after transformation of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Seven of these clones carry multiple changes from the zzso zzso Most zzso that zzso zzso were shown to alter zzso acid zzso near the zzso consensus sequence of class I zzso zzso One particular zzso zzso was present in all but one of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso acid for zzso zzso transformed with a zzso carrying this single zzso is 70 zzso of medium (for the wild type, the zzso is 12 zzso The highest zzso zzso zzso were observed with two triple zzso zzso and zzso zzso shuttle zzso and zzso zzso that zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso are zzso Finally, the implications of the specific zzso we isolated with respect to binding of zzso acid by zzso are zzso
