The ability to rapidly and efficiently identify zzso agents of dangerous human and animal diseases is a prerequisite to diagnosis, prophylaxis and zzso Such identification systems can be developed based on DNA markers enabling differentiation between various bacterial zzso One source of these markers is genetic zzso An efficient method for detecting the most stable zzso without knowledge of zzso sequences is zzso zzso In this work we report an approach to typing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that cause zzso and zzso zzso zzso is based on zzso of bacterial zzso with a DNA array of zzso markers obtained using zzso zzso The array comprised 55 DNA fragments which distinguished the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was used to test 28 zzso labeled zzso zzso strains and 8 zzso zzso zzso Each strain was characterized by a specific zzso pattern, and the results were analyzed using cluster zzso 18 patterns specific to zzso zzso and 6 patterns specific to zzso zzso were found to be zzso The data allowed us to differentiate most studied zzso zzso zzso from one another and from zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that DNA markers obtained by zzso zzso can be potentially useful for molecular typing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as for their molecular zzso The method reported can be easily adapted for use both with DNA zzso and DNA zzso with fluorescent zzso
