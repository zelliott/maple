Recently, we isolated the zzso zzso which encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso member, from a bacterial artificial zzso library clone by zzso amplification with zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) Blood 98, zzso In this study, we analyzed two more clones from the library to isolate genes zzso other zzso zzso zzso which encodes the shortest member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso so far, has been identified in both clones and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso encodes a zzso acid protein that has a molecular mass of approximately 51 zzso and that contains a putative zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso zzso among zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso zzso and zzso identical to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is expressed not only in zzso in response to zzso zzso but also in zzso brain, heart, liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso may play essential roles in each of these zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso has functional zzso activity and that the zzso sequence of zzso has a functional zzso domain as shown in zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso analysis revealed that zzso is zzso indicating that it is zzso through zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso was expressed at a lower zzso This suggests that zzso functions downstream of zzso zzso in the zzso signaling zzso
