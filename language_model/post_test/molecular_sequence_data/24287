In the mature zzso systems of most organisms that possess a sense of zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and central zzso occur in specialized zzso structures called zzso The development of zzso zzso has been studied particularly heavily in the zzso lobe of the zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we address the development of zzso within the zzso lobe of zzso zzso by reporting on the zzso of zzso a ubiquitous synaptic zzso zzso throughout zzso A zzso clone coding for zzso zzso zzso was characterized and found to zzso a protein that shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with human zzso zzso Conservation was especially high in the C2 zzso near the zzso and very low near the zzso A zzso zzso zzso was raised against the unique zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso was raised against the highly zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In Western zzso zzso both zzso labeled a 60 zzso zzso which very likely zzso to zzso On zzso both zzso labeled known synaptic zzso in zzso zzso and yielded similar labeling patterns in the developing zzso zzso In addition, zzso detected zzso protein in three other insect species zzso Analysis of zzso labeling at the light microscopic level during development of the zzso lobe of zzso zzso confirmed and extended previous electron microscopic zzso Additional zzso in the coarse zzso and a refinement of synaptic zzso in the zzso during the last one-third of zzso development were zzso
