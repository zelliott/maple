zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso expressed on zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso domain displays a variable number of tandem repeats zzso zzso The zzso consists of 16 zzso repeats zzso A zzso and zzso with 15 (B zzso and 14 zzso zzso repeats that are assumed to be associated with reduced risk of vascular zzso We investigated the zzso of these natural zzso to zzso in native human zzso Healthy volunteers were zzso and the zzso of zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied under zzso and zzso flow zzso zzso zzso zzso attached significantly weaker to zzso at elevated zzso rates from 24 up to 64 zzso than zzso and zzso zzso No difference in zzso rate was found under zzso conditions and zzso stress below 24 zzso but zzso zzso rolled significantly faster than zzso zzso at zzso stress zzso 12 zzso There was no difference in the adhesive capacity between zzso an zzso zzso These data support the view that the role of the zzso is to extend the zzso binding domain far above the cell surface to support stable zzso zzso and zzso
