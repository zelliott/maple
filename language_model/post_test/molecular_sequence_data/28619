We have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso which interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso the most abundant plasma membrane zzso zzso in the zzso zzso has a zzso location when expressed alone in zzso cells, but zzso to zzso with zzso at the plasma membrane when zzso is zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cortex, zzso and zzso and also in zzso outside the zzso zzso is found with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and retinal zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso For zzso expressed in zzso cells, zzso of zzso did not affect the zzso zzso or zzso for zzso Since zzso is known to activate zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso we propose that zzso is a scaffolding protein allowing zzso to regulate zzso signaling or interact with the zzso
