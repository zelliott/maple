In order to define the cellular specificity of the zzso zzso protein zzso promoter in the zzso we linked the human zzso promoter to the zzso zzso gene and made five lines of transgenic zzso In three of the five transgenic mouse lines, zzso showed positive zzso upon incubation with zzso zzso Mice from one line zzso showed positive zzso zzso throughout the zzso except for the most peripheral zzso Interestingly, the zzso was zzso throughout the zzso Heavily stained regions were zzso with lightly stained zzso Mice in two other lines showed highly mosaic zzso zzso zzso zzso examination demonstrated that zzso was confined to zzso cells in all three expressing zzso Furthermore, electron zzso showed that the promoter is active in both rod and cone zzso Our results demonstrate that the human zzso promoter can be used to obtain zzso gene expression in transgenic zzso
