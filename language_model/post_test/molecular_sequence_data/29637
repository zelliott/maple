zzso zzso has been previously shown to produce a zzso zzso able to catalyze efficiently the zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso that zzso zzso transfer reactions such as zzso in the presence of suitable zzso other than water, even in zzso media with high zzso zzso water zzso zzso The present work describes the cloning and the zzso of the gene coding for this zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The deduced zzso protein sequences contained the consensus motif zzso which is zzso among zzso zzso Only one of the two deduced proteins zzso contained zzso sequences obtained from the zzso zzso zzso investigations showed that zzso has similarities principally with 11 zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso A from zzso zzso zzso but not with the other zzso zzso so zzso Both zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso but only zzso coded for an active zzso The zzso specificity and the zzso behavior of zzso zzso zzso with or without a zzso zzso tag, were not changed compared to those of the native zzso
