A gene from zzso zzso whose product exhibits primary sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso family of zzso and which is required for effective zzso zzso growth, was zzso Because this gene is located downstream from zzso in an arrangement similar to the relative organization of the zzso and zzso zzso it was designated zzso A zzso strain having an zzso zzso in zzso has zzso less zzso zzso activity and exhibits a greatly diminished level of zzso label incorporation into the zzso zzso when compared to the wild zzso These results indicate that zzso has a role in the maturation of the zzso zzso with a specific role in the formation of the zzso zzso and/or its zzso into zzso
