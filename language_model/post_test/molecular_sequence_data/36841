A theoretical approach is employed to study the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso reaction by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso change in a loop involved in protecting the active site from zzso is examined by use of X-ray data and molecular dynamics zzso A mixed zzso and molecular mechanics potential is used to determine the energy surface along the reaction zzso The calculations address the role of the zzso in lowering the barrier to reaction and provide a decomposition into specific zzso zzso To obtain a clearer understanding of the electronic effects, the polarization of the zzso zzso group by the active site zzso is examined and compared with zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso
