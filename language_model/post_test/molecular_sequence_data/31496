A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and short zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from the zzso gut of zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 37 zzso at pH zzso and with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso showed zzso similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating its zzso with the zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso and summed feature 2 zzso zzso zzso The respiratory zzso were zzso zzso zzso and a minor amount of zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso one unknown zzso and five unknown polar zzso The zzso pattern contained predominantly zzso and relatively high amounts of zzso The zzso zzso could only be detected in trace zzso The zzso content of zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso the novel species zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
