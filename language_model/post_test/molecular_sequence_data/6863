To investigate the prevalence of zzso zzso in the saliva of patients infected with this zzso 

A novel zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was developed to detect H zzso in saliva and gastric biopsy specimens from patients undergoing zzso 

Our zzso zzso amplified a zzso base pair zzso of DNA from all 21 zzso derived from H zzso clinical zzso but did not amplify DNA from 23 zzso zzso zzso Sixty three frozen gastric biopsy and 56 saliva specimens were zzso H zzso specific DNA was detected by zzso in all 39 culture positive biopsy specimens and was also identified from another seven biopsy specimens which were negative by culture but positive by zzso H zzso specific DNA was identified by zzso in saliva specimens from 30 zzso of 40 patients with H zzso infection demonstrated by culture or zzso examination, or both, and in three patients without H zzso infection in the zzso 

The results indicate that the oral cavity zzso H zzso and may be the source of infection and zzso
