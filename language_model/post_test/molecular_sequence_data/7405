Cell proliferation requires zzso and zzso factors to monitor zzso progression and control DNA zzso The small zzso has a high rate of proliferation and a very low zzso of cancer, suggestive of efficient mechanisms for control of the cell cycle and assuring zzso of DNA zzso We have isolated a zzso from a rat zzso library which zzso to a zzso zzso specific for zzso cells, the zzso cell compartment of the zzso Its zzso sequence indicates that it is a new member of a family of replication proteins found in zzso zzso zzso mouse and zzso Its transcripts were markedly increased in fetal rat zzso and liver, decreased in long-term zzso and zzso tissue culture cells zzso cells, a cell line derived from rat zzso zzso increased with serum zzso as cells resumed zzso and appeared to be species zzso Isolation and functional characterization of small zzso zzso replication factors should help explain this zzso low zzso of zzso
