We previously reported on the zzso of a serum zzso factor, referred to as zzso from zzso zzso that is thought to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso from rat zzso and determined its primary structure by zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein is presumed to be zzso as a zzso of 268 zzso acids with a signal zzso of 16 zzso acids and an zzso zzso of 13 zzso zzso and is, with the exception of a central region, almost identical to the reported rat pancreatic zzso IV zzso The zzso gene is selectively expressed in the zzso as judged by Northern zzso zzso After expression in zzso cells, zzso zzso was found in the culture zzso and it inhibited the zzso zzso zzso release from cultured fetal long zzso zzso site zzso were zzso in a zzso system, and zzso zzso also decreased the serum calcium level of zzso These data zzso zzso a zzso closely related to zzso IV, in the regulation of blood calcium zzso
