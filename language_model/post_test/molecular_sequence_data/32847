zzso zzso peptides are considered as the agents of choice for diagnostic imaging and therapy of zzso because their receptors are zzso in various human cancer zzso It has been recently indicated that there is a putative role of zzso in breast zzso The expression of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in breast tissue shows zzso occurrence of the zzso zzso zzso in tumors, whereas zzso receptors are found in zzso zzso To investigate the usefulness of zzso zzso for tumor diagnosis and therapy, we investigated the zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso in human blood zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso Prior to the zzso of peptides from the zzso they were labeled with zzso zzso either at the zzso or at the side chain of zzso For the zzso stability study, the zzso of peptides was monitored by zzso and the zzso products were identified by zzso mass zzso The data showed that full-length zzso zzso zzso which show high binding affinity to zzso receptors are zzso more stable than centrally truncated zzso which show high binding affinity to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides were found to be zzso more resistant than their counterparts containing the zzso label at zzso side zzso
