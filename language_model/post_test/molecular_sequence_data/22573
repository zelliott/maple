The full lengths of three zzso segments of Iranian wheat stripe virus zzso were amplified by reverse zzso zzso followed by zzso chain reaction zzso using a primer complementary to zzso zzso terminal zzso The segments were zzso and found to comprise zzso zzso and 1831 zzso zzso The gene organization of these segments is similar to that of other known zzso each displaying an zzso coding zzso zzso zzso however, are different from those of other viruses with respect to the number of zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence for each zzso Depending on the segment, the first zzso zzso at the zzso end and the first 16 zzso at the 3' end are highly zzso among zzso and rice zzso zzso virus zzso rice stripe virus zzso and zzso stripe virus zzso In addition, the first 15-18 zzso at the zzso end are complementary to the first zzso zzso at the 3' zzso zzso analyses showed close similarity and a common zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus zzso These findings confirm the position of zzso as a distinct species in the zzso zzso
