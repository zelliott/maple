zzso replication is the central event in the bacterial cell zzso Identification of replication origins zzso is necessary for almost all newly zzso bacterial zzso Given the increasing pace of zzso sequencing, the current available software for predicting zzso however, still leaves much to be zzso zzso the increasing availability of zzso sequences calls for improved software to identify zzso in newly zzso and zzso bacterial zzso 

We have developed zzso an online system for finding zzso in bacterial zzso based on an integrated method zzso the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the zzso method, distribution of zzso boxes, and the occurrence of genes frequently close to zzso The program can also deal with zzso zzso sequences by zzso the zzso program zzso zzso zzso of the predicted results is exported to an zzso report, which offers convenient views on the results in both zzso and tabular zzso 

A zzso system to predict replication origins of bacterial zzso has been presented zzso Based on this system, zzso regions have been predicted for the bacterial zzso available in zzso zzso It is hoped that zzso will become a useful tool for the identification and analysis of zzso in both bacterial and zzso zzso
