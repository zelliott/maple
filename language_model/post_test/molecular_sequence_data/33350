The assembly of DNA zzso libraries is particularly relevant within zzso natural communities for which accurate species identifications will enable detailed ecological forensic zzso In addition, zzso molecular zzso derived from these DNA zzso sequences have the potential to improve investigations of the mechanisms underlying community assembly and functional trait zzso To date, no studies have effectively applied DNA zzso zzso zzso in this zzso In this report, we demonstrate that a zzso DNA zzso when applied to 296 species of woody trees, zzso and palms found within the zzso Forest zzso zzso on zzso Colorado Island zzso zzso resulted in zzso correct zzso These DNA zzso sequences are also used to reconstruct a robust community zzso employing a zzso method for 281 of the 296 plant species in the zzso The zzso zzso data were sufficient to reliably reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the plant zzso in the plot that are zzso with the broadly accepted zzso of flowering plants zzso zzso Earlier work on the zzso structure of the zzso forest dynamics plot employing less resolved zzso reveals significant differences in evolutionary and ecological zzso compared with our data and suggests that unresolved community zzso may have increased type I and type II zzso These results illustrate how highly resolved zzso based on DNA zzso sequence data will enhance research focused on the interface between community ecology and zzso
