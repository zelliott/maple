DNA zzso formation has potential applications in gene mapping and as the basis of zzso zzso however, the methods for zzso of zzso formation are zzso especially for zzso zzso We present a novel method for detection and zzso of zzso formation by zzso zzso The zzso is zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After incubation with the target DNA, exposure to light labels the target with zzso The labeled target can be zzso by a zzso zzso A zzso zzso previously reported to form a zzso triplex with the upstream region of the zzso gene was studied and found to bind to its target with zzso of approximately 100 zzso at 37 degrees C, 10 zzso zzso pH zzso consistent with previous zzso This new technique can be used under a variety of conditions and in kinetic experiments and may be zzso to use in living zzso
