To identify zzso zzso genes important in the establishment of a persistent infection, we previously used zzso zzso to identify zzso with reduced zzso numbers in the brains of zzso One of the zzso zzso has an zzso within a predicted six zzso domain zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso thus we named it zzso zzso protein 1 zzso Although the zzso zzso was found be reduced in its ability to form brain zzso it is defective during acute zzso zzso of zzso expressed from its zzso promoter restored the acute zzso of the zzso zzso to parental zzso The zzso zzso does not have a growth zzso in standard tissue culture zzso however, we found a significant zzso in host cell penetration after zzso zzso Overall, zzso may function during acute infection by enhancing the zzso ability to invade after zzso zzso
