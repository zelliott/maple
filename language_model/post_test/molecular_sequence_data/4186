A gene that encodes an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso Based on several zzso regions of other zzso acid zzso zzso were designed to amplify a probe that was used to isolate the zzso gene from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso was an zzso zzso which zzso a zzso of zzso zzso including a zzso at the zzso region formed by one putative signal zzso a second zzso which could be zzso to activate the zzso and the active zzso of calculated zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern experiments indicated that zzso gene was pH zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and induced by organic nitrogen zzso The promoter possessed potential zzso zzso and zzso sites for zzso pH and zzso regulation respectively, but lacked potential zzso sites for carbon zzso zzso and zzso indicated that zzso was a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cultivated in zzso zzso medium zzso zzso and had a fourfold increase in zzso activity compared to the zzso while zzso that zzso the zzso gene zzso and zzso had an additional zzso increase in zzso activity compared to zzso single zzso zzso of both genes in zzso medium did not result in higher levels of zzso and/or zzso zzso These results indicated that both zzso and zzso undergo zzso in zzso medium but zzso is not responsible for zzso zzso
