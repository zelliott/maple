zzso zzso in zzso zzso is an zzso process, triggered by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The environmental concentration of zzso is monitored by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which is part of a zzso signal zzso zzso Upon interaction with zzso zzso zzso the zzso response regulator zzso This regulator subsequently activates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso All members of this zzso have an unusual zzso membrane domain that previously has been shown to contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso an in zzso reporter zzso the present work investigated the zzso functionality of various zzso zzso membrane zzso The results indicated that important zzso for zzso function locate to the most zzso zzso loop of the membrane zzso In addition, this region appears to be involved in the zzso zzso interaction of zzso another member of the zzso zzso
