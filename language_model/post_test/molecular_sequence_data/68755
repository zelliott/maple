In a previous communication, we have shown that two protein zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso act as novel zzso of zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Here we describe that both genes possess intrinsic zzso activity as judged by in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso and that zzso zzso is an in zzso zzso for zzso To compare the biological activity of zzso and zzso to that of other known zzso we expressed the budding zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in either a zzso or zzso genetic background and established that, in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso complement the zzso zzso opposing the zzso zzso
