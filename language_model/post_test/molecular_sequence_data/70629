zzso zzso zzso is a member of the steroid zzso zzso that may require zzso for proper or zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screening followed by zzso cell zzso we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which consists of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of 54 zzso We demonstrated that zzso might function as a preferential zzso for zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso zzso Interestingly, our data also showed that zzso could significantly enhance the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not wild type zzso or another zzso zzso zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso These results imply that both zzso and the positions of the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso might contribute to the specificity of zzso zzso Our findings further demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso can serve as a dominant negative inhibitor and zzso full-length zzso can reverse this zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with other zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso showed additive stimulation of zzso zzso which indicates that these zzso may function individually as zzso zzso to induce zzso target gene zzso Through our findings, we have identified and characterized a novel zzso zzso zzso which may play an important role in the zzso signaling zzso in human zzso
