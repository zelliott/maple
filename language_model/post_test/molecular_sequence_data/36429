zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso agent of zzso zzso were isolated and zzso by DNA sequence zzso This procedure yielded zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The genes were located on the physical map of the zzso zzso linear zzso Also mapped were the genes zzso and zzso while zzso was mapped using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be in tandem and were zzso along with zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso was located close to the left hand zzso of the zzso Because zzso zzso and zzso are normally located within 50 zzso of the origin of replication zzso we propose two possible sites for zzso in the zzso zzso linear zzso
