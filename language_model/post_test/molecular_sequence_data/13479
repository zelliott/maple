To study factors involved in regulation of zzso of zzso we constructed defective interfering zzso zzso containing zzso zzso promoters at multiple zzso Analysis of the amounts of zzso zzso zzso produced by these zzso resulted in the following zzso zzso a downstream promoter zzso an upstream zzso zzso an upstream promoter has little or no effect on the activity of a downstream zzso Our data suggest that zzso of upstream promoter activities by downstream promoter sequences plays an important role in regulating the amounts of zzso zzso produced by zzso Our observations are in accordance with the models proposed by zzso et zzso and zzso and zzso
