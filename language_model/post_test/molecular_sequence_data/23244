In zzso selection of specific zzso zzso against zzso from a random zzso zzso 

A zzso library with 40 zzso zzso positions was applied to select for specific zzso to zzso zzso linked to zzso by using a standard in zzso selection zzso 

The specific enriched zzso zzso for zzso increased step by step from initial round to 11th round after which a plateau of the zzso quantity was observed between 11th and 13th zzso The enriched zzso from last round were reverse zzso zzso amplified and cloned into zzso coli zzso b competent zzso Sixty colonies were zzso from which 38 sequences were aligned and classified into 3 families and 5 zzso and no zzso sequences were found among zzso Eight representative clones from the groups were selected for further binding experiments comparing with original pool zzso Four clone zzso were identified with relatively high affinity to zzso of which zzso clone zzso could combine with zzso as lower as zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso molecules that bind specifically to zzso have been isolated from a population of random sequence zzso zzso which might provide a new way for future application in environmental monitoring of zzso
