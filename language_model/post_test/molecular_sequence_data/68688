An unstable expansion of the zzso repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the zzso protein zzso zzso gene is the zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso To examine zzso stability of the zzso we studied tissue zzso of the repeat zzso In five zzso patients, the restriction zzso containing the repeat region was substantially larger in skeletal muscle than in peripheral blood zzso zzso In addition, one normal subject showed a size zzso in one of the normal zzso by one repeat on the zzso chain reaction zzso In most zzso patients, the repeat size of native zzso differed from the transformed zzso cells after zzso In contrast, various zzso from a zzso zzso patient showed a similar size of the expanded zzso including the transformed zzso zzso We conclude that zzso instability of the zzso repeat may cause substantial tissue zzso of the zzso repeat size in zzso zzso providing a potential mechanism for the variable zzso
