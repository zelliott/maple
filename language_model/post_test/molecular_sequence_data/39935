A zzso DNA zzso I from a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was characterized in this zzso The zzso was zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The expressed 110 zzso fusion protein of zzso was stable at 70 degrees C for 1 zzso Compared with DNA zzso I of zzso coli zzso the relative zzso activity of this zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees C using fluorescent quantitative zzso It showed higher zzso activity than zzso coli zzso at higher temperature, with a relative activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 70 degrees zzso The zzso sequence analysis and the protein structure prediction indicated that this protein had a high similarly to other zzso from zzso zzso This information is of importance for future study for evolution of the zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
