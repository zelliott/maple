The long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso expressed in zzso cells, was shown in zzso zzso studies to be associated with both membrane and zzso zzso with zzso analyses identifying zzso as associated both with zzso at the cell margin and also at a distinct zzso zzso zzso of the first nine zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso its ability to interact with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced, but did not zzso membrane zzso and zzso disrupted the focus of zzso zzso within zzso at the cell zzso This deleted region contained a Class I zzso binding motif of similar sequence to those identified by screening a zzso display library with the zzso zzso zzso to remove the zzso zzso zzso region caused a further reduction in membrane association and zzso zzso at the cell zzso Progressive zzso to delete the zzso long zzso common region and then the long zzso zzso did not cause any further change in membrane association or zzso zzso However, deletion up to the zzso form zzso junction generated an entirely soluble zzso zzso zzso We propose that multiple sites in the zzso zzso portion of zzso have the potential to associate with zzso structures and thus define its zzso zzso At least two such sites lie within the zzso zzso zzso region and these appear to be primarily responsible for targeting zzso to, and zzso it zzso the cell zzso one is an zzso binding motif able to interact with zzso zzso and the other lies within the zzso portion of the zzso unique zzso A third membrane association region is located within the zzso portion of zzso and appears to be primarily responsible for targeting to the zzso zzso Progressive zzso zzso to delete defined regions of zzso identified activity changes occurring upon deletion of the zzso binding site region and then upon deletion of the membrane association site region located within zzso This suggests that certain of these anchor sites may not only determine zzso targeting but may also zzso regulatory effects on zzso zzso
