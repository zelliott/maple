zzso new insertions of repetitive sequences may contribute to zzso evolution by altering the function of zzso zzso One example is the zzso zzso which forms the zzso coding zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso into the zzso locus has occurred after divergence of humans and zzso The zzso element was inserted into a zzso element present in all monkeys and apes zzso zzso features point toward an integration event that was zzso by the zzso protein machinery acting in zzso Thus, our findings add evidence to the hypothesis that zzso events are a driving force in zzso evolution and that the presence or absence of specific zzso are one distinguishing feature that separates humans from zzso
