In earlier work we have shown that zzso templates containing isolated A, T or G zzso and short zzso sequences can be copied effectively using zzso as zzso We now show that isolated A or T zzso within an zzso sequence are a complete block to copying and that an isolated C zzso is copied zzso zzso is possible only if there are two complementary zzso each of which acts as a template to facilitate the synthesis of the zzso We emphasize the severity of the problems that need to be overcome to make possible zzso replication in homogeneous zzso zzso We conclude that an efficient catalyst was involved in the origin of zzso zzso
