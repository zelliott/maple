zzso channels are thought to be structurally similar to zzso channels, but show much lower selectivity for zzso The approximately zzso A selectivity filter of zzso channels is formed by the zzso sequence zzso with X usually zzso and is held stable by key zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso sequence of zzso channels zzso the zzso sequence zzso suggest these zzso could account for differences in selectivity between these channel zzso Despite being zzso zzso zzso channels did not produce zzso Since zzso in the second position is highly zzso in zzso channels, we also studied zzso zzso Based on zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso channels zzso were less selective than zzso rabbit zzso zzso indicating that the zzso sequence is insufficient to zzso zzso selectivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso channels had an increased zzso to large organic zzso than zzso zzso channels, as well as increased zzso zzso zzso and altered channel zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso channels have larger pores than zzso channels and replacement of the zzso at position zzso with zzso further increases pore zzso Furthermore, selected zzso in other regions linked previously to pore stability in zzso channels zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also unable to zzso zzso selectivity to zzso zzso zzso Our findings establish the presence of the zzso zzso sequence does not zzso zzso selectivity to rabbit zzso channels, and suggests that differences in selectivity of zzso versus zzso channels originate from differences outside the zzso zzso
