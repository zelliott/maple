Two different zzso zzso were isolated and zzso from zzso zzso zzso to apparent zzso using ammonium zzso zzso followed by zzso exchange zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Both of the zzso zzso are zzso protein with molecular weight of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The optimal activities of the zzso were at 45 and 50 degrees C and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increase zzso of both zzso zzso I and zzso The zzso zzso I showed no metal zzso dependence for its activity since zzso up to 10 zzso has no effect on the zzso zzso However zzso zzso II showed slight zzso by zzso at the same zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso effect on both zzso zzso
