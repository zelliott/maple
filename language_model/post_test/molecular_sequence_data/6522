The zzso zzso system and zzso protein zzso analysis were used to demonstrate zzso of human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso A zzso inactive zzso of zzso with a single zzso acid substitution zzso was found to zzso in zzso and a zzso with a deletion of the zzso domain of zzso retained the ability to zzso In contrast, deletion of the two zzso motifs in the zzso regulatory domain of zzso abolished zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso domain required the presence of zzso These results suggest that the binding of zzso by zzso is necessary for zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso originally identified on the basis of its ability to bind the zzso region zzso of human zzso virus zzso also zzso with itself and with zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that complexes consisting of different combinations of zzso proteins may exist in zzso Such complexes could mediate differential effects on gene expression and control of cell zzso
