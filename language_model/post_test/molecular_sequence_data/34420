An zzso zzso zzso was directly obtained from the zzso DNA of goat rumen zzso The zzso full-length gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso without putative signal zzso zzso zzso shared the highest identity zzso to a putative zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was closely related with microbial zzso of gastrointestinal zzso A comparison of the zzso motifs shared with zzso proteins revealed that zzso could be grouped into the zzso family and was further classified into the zzso of zzso zzso The gene zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited highest zzso efficiency towards zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and had no activity towards zzso zzso with zzso chains longer than zzso The zzso exhibited optimal activity at around zzso and pH zzso was stable at pH ranging from zzso to zzso and was slightly activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These properties suggest that zzso has great potential for basic research and industrial zzso To our knowledge, this is the first zzso obtained from rumen zzso
