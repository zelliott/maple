zzso virus belongs to the zzso viral family and constitutes an important zzso The viral zzso is an ideal target for inhibitor design, since this zzso is essential for the survival, proliferation and transmission of the zzso 

zzso a zzso approach, the zzso model of the zzso virus zzso structure has been zzso using conventional zzso zzso techniques and the known zzso of the Murray Valley zzso virus zzso of the same viral family, as zzso The model was then subjected to extended molecular dynamics simulations in a periodic box, filled with explicit water molecules for 10 zzso The reliability of the model was confirmed by obtaining acceptable scores from a variety of in zzso scoring tools, including zzso and zzso 

zzso The zzso model of the zzso virus zzso exhibits in zzso all known structural characteristics of the zzso viral family zzso zzso and could provide the platform for further de zzso zzso design of novel zzso zzso
