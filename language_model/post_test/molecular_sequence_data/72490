In order to understand the mechanisms involved in tooth development it is important to define the timing for zzso gene zzso A consequence of zzso cell differentiation is the sequential expression of zzso genes whose products form the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been characterized as consisting of two major classes of zzso zzso and zzso proteins such as zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso functions for the zzso zzso proteins are as zzso for zzso crystal formation while zzso control the crystal size, growth and zzso While the zzso have been well zzso detailed knowledge for zzso zzso proteins has been zzso In the present study, we designed experiments to characterize one of the zzso zzso proteins from mouse zzso zzso and to determine the timing of expression of this protein during zzso tooth zzso Our results showed the initial detection of zzso transcripts within zzso inner zzso zzso cells at very early stages of tooth development (13 days of embryonic development equivalent to the bud stage of tooth zzso These data provide direct evidence that zzso previous zzso that zzso proteins were zzso by zzso zzso fully differentiated zzso zzso In addition, zzso was found to be zzso also by dental zzso zzso cells suggesting that this protein is not zzso These data taken together open the possibility that the zzso present in the zzso junction could be zzso by both, zzso cells and zzso zzso It might also suggest a possible different role for zzso than zzso of zzso zzso
