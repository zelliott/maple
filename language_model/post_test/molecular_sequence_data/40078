zzso zzso is an emerging zzso pathogen of increasing importance and zzso but our ability to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso zzso disease has been limited because of a lack of tools for its genetic zzso We have now developed a zzso method for the targeted zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The approach relies on the observation that an zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso is unstable in zzso zzso and can be used as a form of conditional lethal zzso to deliver gene zzso to the zzso We have used this methodology to zzso zzso two putative response regulator zzso zzso and zzso which zzso proteins with similarity to the toxin gene regulator, zzso from zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso protein positively regulated four zzso including a putative zzso zzso The zzso protein was also zzso and shown to bind specifically to sites that contained two consensus zzso boxes located just upstream of the putative promoters of these zzso The development of this methodology will significantly enhance our ability to use molecular approaches to develop a greater understanding of the ability of zzso zzso to cause zzso
