The zzso of the zzso A zzso prosthetic group of zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso zzso proceeds via the initial formation of the precursor zzso and subsequent transfer to zzso zzso with removal of zzso In zzso coli, the two steps are zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, and the corresponding genes are part of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso of zzso pneumoniae, zzso is zzso A search for zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of a second zzso region involved in zzso zzso which comprised the zzso genes and the divergent zzso zzso The zzso gene was confirmed to zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso was shown to zzso a zzso carrier, the third one identified in this zzso The zzso genes were found to zzso a zzso system consisting of the sensor zzso zzso and the response regulator zzso zzso both proteins showed zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso system, which is essential for the induction of the zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was able to grow zzso with zzso indicating that zzso is not essential for expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis was induced to a zzso level under zzso conditions, independent of zzso zzso and zzso and to zzso levels during zzso growth with zzso as the sole carbon zzso Similar to the other zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis was apparently subject to zzso zzso
