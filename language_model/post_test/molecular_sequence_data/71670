A zzso region at the 3' zzso of the salmon zzso disease virus zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences show that zzso shares considerable organizational and sequence identity to members of the zzso zzso within the family zzso The zzso structural proteins zzso by the zzso region contain a number of unique features when compared to other zzso zzso Based on zzso site zzso the predicted sizes of the zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso and E1 zzso zzso are larger than those of other zzso while the predicted size of the zzso zzso protein is zzso K (32 zzso in zzso The zzso and E1 proteins each carry one putative zzso zzso site, with the site in E1 being found at a unique zzso From zzso acid sequence comparisons of the zzso structural region with zzso zzso overall zzso is uniform, ranging from 32 to zzso While zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso junction region shows that zzso is similar to other zzso analysis of the zzso region reveals that zzso shows divergence in this zzso
