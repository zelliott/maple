zzso liver zzso protein zzso is a zzso specific for zzso and zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis with a zzso zzso zzso zzso which we isolated previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 101, zzso revealed that zzso was zzso by two species of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso long, zzso Analysis of a newly isolated zzso clone of zzso zzso long showed that the sequence of the open reading frame of the zzso zzso zzso was completely identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso contained two zzso copies of the previously described zzso zzso zzso which is a repetitive element of the rat zzso zzso zzso Bloom, zzso zzso zzso Lerner, zzso & Sutcliffe, zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 81, zzso Southern zzso analysis of rat zzso DNA zzso with restriction zzso suggested that each zzso species arises from one zzso with the differences in size most easily being accounted for by differential zzso of the zzso sites of one zzso
