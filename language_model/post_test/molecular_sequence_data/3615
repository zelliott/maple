The zzso zzso zzso by zzso virus strain T is the acutely transforming member of the zzso family of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso exists as zzso or zzso with the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso To examine the contribution of these complexes to zzso zzso zzso were introduced into the zzso interface of zzso to generate zzso zzso with selective zzso zzso Nine zzso are described in this study that are defective in zzso and/or zzso formation with specific zzso family zzso zzso expressing zzso that failed to zzso but were able to form zzso complexes were unable to transform zzso zzso in zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso with zzso expressed zzso proteins is not in itself sufficient for zzso In addition, two partially transforming zzso were identified that exhibited an impaired ability to form zzso zzso analysis of the zzso DNA from cells transformed by these zzso revealed the presence of multiple secondary zzso in sequences responsible for zzso and DNA zzso Two of these zzso either enhanced or restored the ability of these proteins to bind DNA as a zzso zzso expressing these proteins transformed cells at levels comparable to or slightly less than zzso suggesting that a threshold level of DNA binding by zzso zzso is required for zzso
