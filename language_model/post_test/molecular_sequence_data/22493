We took advantage of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to isolate a collection of spontaneous, zzso zzso zzso zzso that expressed the zzso zzso genes zzso All of the zzso zzso were in zzso but, unexpectedly, many were predicted to be zzso zzso zzso this zzso a constructed zzso deletion zzso also resulted in zzso expression of the van zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulated zzso function in the absence of zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso zzso triple zzso which should not be able zzso zzso zzso failed to express the van zzso whereas a zzso zzso double zzso showed zzso regulated induction of the van zzso These results suggest that in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acts as a zzso to suppress the levels of zzso approximately zzso On exposure to zzso zzso activity switches from a zzso to a zzso and zzso resistance is zzso In zzso zzso the van genes are induced by both zzso and the zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso (the zzso zzso resistance is induced by zzso but not by zzso We exploited this distinction to replace the zzso zzso zzso genes with the zzso genes from zzso zzso The resulting strain acquired the zzso profile of zzso zzso providing circumstantial evidence that the zzso zzso zzso is the drug itself, and not an intermediate in cell wall zzso that accumulates as result of drug zzso zzso with this zzso we found that zzso zzso of the late steps in cell wall zzso such as zzso A, zzso and zzso were not zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system, in contrast to results obtained in zzso zzso zzso
