zzso and zzso are known to be expressed in the growth plate during zzso bone zzso Here we addressed the functional role of zzso as distinct from zzso by using two models of zzso bone zzso fracture healing that proceeds by an zzso process and zzso zzso that proceeds by only an zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso up regulated during fracture zzso In contrast, only zzso showed increased expression after zzso zzso During fracture healing, zzso was expressed earlier than zzso was concurrent with the period of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso expression a protein associated with zzso and permanent zzso zzso analysis showed zzso protein was also expressed by zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso was expressed later during zzso zzso and primary bone zzso The functional activities of zzso during zzso differentiation were assessed by examining its regulatory actions on zzso gene zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso promoter activity were enhanced in response to the zzso of either zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cell line, while zzso knocked down of each zzso protein showed that only zzso knock down specifically suppressed zzso zzso expression and promoter zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso interactions were selective to sites within the zzso promoter and were only observed during early periods of zzso before zzso Our studies suggest that zzso positively regulates zzso expression and suggest that its function is more limited to cartilage development than to zzso In zzso these data further suggest that the various members of the zzso zzso factors are involved in the coordination of zzso development, zzso and zzso during zzso bone zzso
