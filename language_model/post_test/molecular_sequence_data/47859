zzso relationships were investigated in the mushroom zzso zzso based on sequence data from the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso species of zzso and 19 additional species from the families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso A total of zzso sites was zzso across seven divergent zzso and intervening zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso characters was zzso zzso percent of the average divergence between zzso was located within the divergent zzso with zzso zzso and zzso being most divergent and zzso D7 and zzso the least zzso An empirical test of zzso signal among divergent zzso also showed that zzso zzso and D3 had the lowest levels of zzso Two equally most zzso trees were resolved using Wagner zzso A zzso weighted analysis produced 12 equally most zzso trees similar to those generated by Wagner zzso zzso analyses employing zzso constraints suggest that none of the major zzso systems proposed for zzso zzso is able to completely reflect zzso relationships in zzso A strict consensus integration of the two Wagner trees demonstrates the problematic nature of choosing zzso within zzso zzso The zzso zzso is found to be zzso and is separated into three distinct zzso Most zzso zzso belong to the first two zzso which together form a larger zzso group with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A third zzso contains members of zzso section zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This third zzso is separated from the other species of zzso by members of the families zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso
