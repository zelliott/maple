zzso is a novel member of the Sox gene family of zzso zzso This gene is a member of the zzso B, which includes zzso zzso and zzso Although all of these genes are predominantly expressed in the nervous system, only zzso expression is zzso restricted within the zzso zzso stripes are seen in the spinal zzso and a more complex pattern is seen in the zzso The timing and position in which zzso stripes of expression appear provides further insight into zzso patterning of the zzso The expression of zzso and other genes (such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso may play a part in defining the zzso fate of cells along the zzso zzso
