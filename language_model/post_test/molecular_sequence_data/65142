The ability of zzso to inhibit zzso in both normal and zzso zzso cells has been well zzso However, the underlying mechanisms are understood zzso Here we demonstrated that zzso zzso factor zzso zzso death of zzso cells was blocked by a synthetic zzso zzso zzso treatment also resulted in a reduction in zzso activity of zzso in these zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso cells with zzso led to a decrease in the intact zzso protein zzso zzso and an increase in a faster zzso protein band zzso zzso zzso appearance of the zzso protein was diminished specifically by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins demonstrated that the zzso species is a zzso protein product that lacks about 120 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the basic zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso region, as suggested by mass zzso zzso both the zzso zzso of the zzso product and decrease in cell death induced by zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is a potential zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression of the first zzso zzso acids of zzso produced an zzso effect on zzso activity of the intact zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso induce increased activity of an zzso zzso zzso which in turn zzso zzso This provides a mechanism by which zzso protect prostate cancer cells from the killing effect of zzso
