T cells recognizing self or microbial zzso may trigger or reactivate zzso zzso Monitoring the frequency of specific T cell zzso to assess a possible link with the course of disease has been a difficult task with currently available zzso Our goal was to track individual candidate zzso T cell zzso selected on the basis of previous extensive studies from patients with zzso disorders of the zzso including multiple zzso zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso We developed and applied a highly specific and sensitive technique to track single zzso and zzso T cell clones through the detection and zzso of T cell zzso zzso alpha or beta chain zzso region 3 transcripts by real-time reverse zzso zzso We examined the frequency of the candidate zzso T cell clones in the peripheral blood and zzso during the course of neurological zzso Using this approach, we detected variations of zzso zzso that appeared to be related to clinical course, significant enrichment in the zzso or zzso By zzso zzso tracking with direct zzso of zzso zzso we showed that a single T cell clone contributed substantially to the overall recognition of the viral zzso complex in a patient with zzso T cell zzso tracking is a powerful new technology enabling further zzso of the dynamics of expansion of zzso or zzso T cells that mediate pathological or protective immune responses in neurological zzso
