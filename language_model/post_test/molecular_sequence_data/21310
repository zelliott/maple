Stem cell factor zzso is a zzso growth factor that exerts its activity by zzso through the zzso zzso zzso known as Kit or zzso zzso zzso is crucial for the survival, proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells of zzso zzso Furthermore, since zzso zzso cells express the Kit zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso progression zzso However, the mechanisms of this zzso effect remain zzso Recent evidence shows that zzso triggers zzso of the zzso alpha zzso of zzso factor 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso complex that plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen zzso However, it is unknown how zzso impacts on zzso zzso in human zzso zzso and mast zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells but not in zzso mast zzso We demonstrated that zzso cells have a more robust zzso zzso zzso system compared to zzso cells and are therefore protected against the actions of zzso generated in an zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion led to a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and to near zzso of it in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso is controlled via zzso zzso zzso and to a certain extent by zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time an important zzso of zzso pathways associated with zzso zzso important stage of the zzso zzso cell life zzso
