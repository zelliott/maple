Gross zzso zzso involving deletions in the zzso gene have recently been found to account for approximately zzso of unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso in both French and Italian zzso Using zzso and walking quantitative zzso six novel zzso (three simple zzso two complex deletions with short insertions of 3-6 zzso and a complex deletion with a 182 zzso zzso downstream zzso were characterized by screening zzso unidentified zzso zzso from 10 different zzso These zzso increase the total number of fully characterized large zzso zzso zzso involving deletions to zzso zzso analysis of the 42 associated zzso indicated that all 21 events were caused by zzso zzso Whole gene complexity analysis revealed a significant correlation between regions of low sequence complexity and the locations of the deletion zzso Known zzso motifs were noted in the vicinity of the zzso A total of 11 simple deletions were potentially zzso in terms of the classical model of replication zzso However, the complex deletions appear to have arisen via multiple zzso three of the five complex deletions with short insertions and both examples of large zzso insertions zzso and 182 zzso zzso can be explained by either a model of serial replication zzso in zzso zzso or zzso in trans zzso Finally, the nature and distribution of large zzso zzso in the zzso gene were compared and contrasted with those of two other zzso zzso and zzso with a view to gaining a broader understanding of DNA sequence context in zzso the diverse underlying zzso zzso
