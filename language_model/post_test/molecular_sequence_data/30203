zzso zzso zzso have been constructed that fuse the zzso coli zzso reporter gene zzso or zzso with a target zzso These have been used to monitor expression of zzso zzso symbiotic genes within alfalfa zzso zzso in all 11 nod genes studied show the same pattern of expression: first on the root surface, then throughout the developing zzso then mainly in the zzso zzso falling off progressively through the central region, and then zzso In contrast, zzso in all five zzso genes zzso all four fix zzso and zzso show a second, different zzso expression beginning later, first throughout the zzso except for the zzso strongest just behind the zzso and falling off progressively through the central zzso Novel features revealed by these studies include nod expression in the zzso regulated in zzso expression of control genes zzso and zzso disappearance of nod expression late in zzso and properties of zzso
