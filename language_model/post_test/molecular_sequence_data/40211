Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is a member of the human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso members include zzso or zzso zzso and zzso that are involved in signaling zzso for cell growth and zzso It is well established that zzso zzso has important implications in zzso zzso of signaling pathways and zzso of zzso is known to occur in cancer cells, indicating a role of zzso in zzso zzso blocking zzso signaling has potential therapeutic zzso We have designed several zzso to inhibit zzso signaling for cell zzso One of the compounds zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity with zzso values in the zzso range in breast cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso labeled zzso to zzso protein was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso binds to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was studied by zzso and molecular dynamics zzso Based on these results a model was proposed for zzso zzso and possible blocking by zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso
