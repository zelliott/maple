Based on sequence zzso with the recently cloned human zzso zzso we identified a novel zzso which consisted of zzso zzso acids with a type II zzso protein zzso The zzso acid sequence displayed zzso identity to that of human zzso zzso The expression of a soluble form of the protein in zzso cells produced an active zzso which transferred zzso zzso from zzso not only to a zzso zzso representing growing zzso chains zzso zzso II zzso but also to zzso a synthetic zzso for zzso zzso I that transfers the first zzso to the core zzso in the protein linkage region of zzso zzso zzso the zzso is involved in the zzso initiation and zzso of zzso zzso and is the key zzso responsible for the selective chain assembly of zzso zzso on the linkage region zzso common to various zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The coding region of this zzso was divided into seven discrete zzso and localized to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso gene exhibited a ubiquitous but markedly differential expression in human zzso and that the expression pattern was similar to that of zzso zzso Thus, more than two distinct zzso forming the novel gene family are required for chain initiation and zzso in zzso zzso as in the zzso of zzso zzso
