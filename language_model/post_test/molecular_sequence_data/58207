We report the sequence of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso contains a single open reading frame, which encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 88 zzso We propose that this protein is the zzso zzso precursor observed in infected zzso The deduced protein sequence does not contain zzso zzso acid patterns reported for the zzso proteins of zzso or zzso consistent with the zzso of zzso as a new family of zzso zzso designated zzso
