zzso bound and soluble forms of a zzso folate binding protein have been found in zzso zzso serum, milk, and in several cell zzso The two forms have similar binding characteristics for zzso are zzso zzso and based upon limited zzso acid sequence data, are nearly zzso Based upon zzso experiments, a zzso relationship has been zzso The membrane form has been shown to mediate the transport of folate in cells grown in zzso zzso of zzso A function for the soluble form has not yet been zzso We constructed a zzso library from a human zzso cell line, zzso which expresses the membrane form zzso The library was screened and a near full-length zzso for the folate zzso was zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso inserted in an expression zzso resulted in marked zzso of a zzso folate zzso as assessed by direct binding of zzso folate and by indirect zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is not consistent with a typical membrane spanning domain but rather with a signal for zzso via a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with a zzso zzso C strongly supports this zzso
