A zzso zzso zzso by the nuclear gene zzso was identified as a novel zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene product is a bona fide zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex, because zzso it zzso with the other zzso zzso zzso in the early stages of the zzso zzso zzso it is deficient in zzso zzso zzso accumulating little of the complex, and zzso it zzso with zzso zzso which zzso between stacked and zzso membrane regions upon state zzso zzso analysis and zzso characterization of zzso V shows that it has a one zzso zzso zzso with two large zzso zzso extending on the zzso and zzso side of the zzso zzso with a zzso location of the N zzso zzso V is zzso zzso upon state transition, a unique feature that, together with its zzso organization, points to the possible role of zzso V in signal zzso during zzso short term and long term adaptation of the zzso apparatus in zzso
