Evolution probably invented the zzso domain in a zzso close relative of zzso zzso Expansion from single genes to the small family of zzso zzso of zzso zzso may have started with a very ancient duplication, before the rounds of zzso zzso In land zzso and fish, this family consists of the descendants of five genes of their zzso zzso common zzso zzso this common ancestry depends on the genes possessing zzso sets of zzso zzso as the relationships are not recognizable from zzso zzso One of these genes has given rise both to a group of fish zzso and to a zzso zzso group of zzso of birds and zzso The resulting zzso may prove useful in relation to the zzso of model organisms, such as the zzso and for identifying important zzso sequence zzso exemplified here by a zzso sequence in the zzso region of transcripts from the zzso zzso
