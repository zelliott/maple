zzso dynamics zzso simulations on zzso systems were carried out in order to establish a simulation protocol able to represent zzso solution zzso under zzso zzso Atomic charges suitable for zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso and zzso water models were zzso Also zzso was simulated with zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso The results of the performed MD simulations are in agreement with the available experimental data, suggesting that this approach can be applied for the study of zzso interactions with its target proteins and thus play a role in the development of new zzso zzso
