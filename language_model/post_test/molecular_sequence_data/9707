The zzso zzso encodes an activated zzso zzso that causes human chronic zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso however, is complex and not well zzso One of the important contributions of zzso to transformation is believed to be zzso or zzso of zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We reasoned that if zzso was zzso through other mechanisms, zzso of the zzso zzso activity should also result, and the activated zzso may also be zzso zzso is known to activate its zzso by causing zzso and therefore a synthetic zzso was created by linking the zzso and zzso zzso of the EPO zzso with zzso This zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso cells and, in the absence of EPO, had no zzso biological effect on the zzso EPO, however, induced a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of several cellular zzso The major target proteins have been identified, and are very similar to the known zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and several proteins in the zzso EPO treatment also resulted in biological effects that were remarkably similar to those of zzso including improved zzso altered zzso function, and a weak zzso zzso The biological effects were in part zzso in that low EPO zzso enhanced viability but did not cause zzso At high EPO doses, zzso zzso was zzso and a zzso effect was also zzso In nude mice, zzso cells expressing this zzso zzso did not cause zzso disease without administration of zzso doses of zzso If EPO was given zzso 5 days a week, however, a zzso lethal leukemia zzso This zzso zzso mimics some of the biological effects of zzso and analysis of zzso zzso in this system will be useful to dissect the signaling pathways that cause zzso
