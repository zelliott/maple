zzso visual signaling is one of the fastest zzso zzso zzso because zzso and zzso proteins are organized into a zzso complex zzso Assembly of the complex is orchestrated by zzso no zzso D zzso which zzso the transient zzso potential zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso and eye protein zzso C zzso for more efficient signal zzso zzso is critical for zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso is regulated by the interaction between zzso and zzso because zzso of this interaction in zzso results in slow zzso similar to that of zzso lacking zzso To zzso the mechanisms zzso zzso zzso zzso here we demonstrate that zzso via zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso We reveal that zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso and, importantly, in the fly eye, as shown by mass zzso Furthermore, transgenic expression of modified zzso bearing an Ala substitution leads to slow zzso of the visual response similar to that of zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso complex plays an essential role in termination of the light response by promoting efficient zzso at zzso of zzso for fast zzso of the visual zzso
