To investigate the zzso characteristics of B cells in the zzso zzso of zzso arthritis zzso zzso 

The zzso of B cells at separate sites of the zzso membrane and other zzso from zzso patients were investigated by a reverse zzso chain reaction with a zzso framework 3 consensus primer and a subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Several dominant bands were observed in all zzso membrane samples and some of the zzso bands were common among the 2 or 3 separate regions of each zzso zzso The persistent existence of zzso B cells was observed in zzso zzso fluid zzso 

zzso B cells are zzso and zzso mechanisms may play a role in the generation of zzso B cells in zzso zzso The stable presence of B cell clones in zzso fluid suggests the involvement of these clones in the perpetuation of the chronic inflammation in zzso
