zzso of the cell death program involves physical interactions between different members of the zzso family that either promote or suppress zzso The zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso and binds zzso family members including zzso and zzso We have identified a domain in zzso that is both necessary and sufficient for zzso activity and binding to zzso zzso similar to this domain were identified in zzso and zzso two other proteins that promote zzso and interact with zzso and were likewise critical for their capacity to kill cells and bind zzso Thus, the domain is of central importance in zzso the function of multiple cell zzso proteins that interact with zzso family zzso
