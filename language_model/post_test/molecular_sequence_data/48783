zzso zzso plants can distinguish the damage caused by zzso feeding from other types of damage by zzso zzso zzso such as the fatty zzso acid zzso zzso in oral zzso zzso of zzso zzso larvae, which are introduced into wounds during zzso However, the zzso of zzso signals into downstream plant defense responses is still not well zzso We identified a novel zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and show that it is an indispensable part of the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso plants silenced in the expression of zzso by zzso interference zzso were unable to amplify their defenses beyond zzso zzso levels in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae performed zzso better when reared on zzso plants, which released less volatile organic compounds zzso zzso and had strongly reduced levels of several direct defense zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after real and/or simulated zzso zzso In parallel to impaired zzso signaling and zzso zzso plants were more drought sensitive and showed reduced levels of zzso acid zzso in the leaves, suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Because treatment of zzso plants with zzso results in both the zzso of significantly more zzso zzso and the complete restoration of normal zzso levels of zzso defense zzso we conclude that zzso acts as a natural zzso of zzso zzso after zzso attack, which, in turn, activates the full defense profile and resistance against zzso
