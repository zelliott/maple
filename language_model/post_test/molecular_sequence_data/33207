zzso Based on its characteristic oral apparatus, the zzso zzso zzso has long been recognized as a zzso zzso composed of the orders zzso and zzso Following the application of molecular methods, the zzso of zzso has recently been zzso We investigated the zzso relationships of the zzso zzso based on four further complete small zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In all zzso trees, the zzso never clustered with the zzso but instead formed a zzso zzso related to the zzso By contrast, the zzso formed a sister zzso with the zzso at a terminal position within the zzso We therefore formally separate the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and establish a new zzso zzso zzso 1933, which contains the order zzso zzso zzso We argue that the oral apparatus in the zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso probably due to zzso evolution driven by their similar zzso and feeding zzso zzso the zzso are distinguished from all other zzso by the presence of the adhesive disc, this character being a zzso for the zzso
