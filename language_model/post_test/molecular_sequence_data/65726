Despite their zzso description, not all members of the order zzso are capable of zzso reduced sulfur species, which, in addition to iron zzso is a desirable trait of zzso zzso However, the complete zzso sequence of the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 2,300 open reading frames zzso provides insights into biologically zzso metal zzso zzso Comparative zzso was used to identify pathways and proteins involved zzso or zzso with zzso As expected, the zzso zzso zzso contains genes related to zzso carbon zzso metal zzso and zzso Also, terminal zzso cluster organization indicates the presence of hybrid zzso zzso zzso Comparisons with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso encodes at least one putative zzso involved in iron zzso and a putative zzso zzso implicated in sulfur zzso The fox gene zzso involved in iron zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso These zzso and zzso components are missing from zzso of zzso members of the zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response analysis showed that 88 zzso were zzso twofold or more in zzso zzso upon addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso these included genes for components of terminal zzso clusters predicted to be involved with iron zzso as well as genes predicted to be involved with sulfur zzso Many hypothetical proteins were also zzso zzso indicating that aspects of the iron and sulfur metabolism of zzso zzso remain to be identified and zzso
