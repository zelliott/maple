Tomato mosaic virus zzso has a regulatory gene zzso a movement protein zzso that is involved in the zzso movement of viral zzso through zzso To identify the host cell factors interacting with zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso probe to isolate zzso clones from a zzso expression library of zzso zzso by a zzso screening zzso One of the zzso clones zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso novel protein zzso zzso We isolated a full-length zzso by zzso The putative gene product was designated zzso and shared 33 and zzso zzso acid identity with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analyses using zzso proteins showed that zzso also zzso with a different zzso derived from zzso mosaic zzso zzso had zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tobacco zzso zzso 2 resulted in a marked increase in the zzso of zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso of zzso
