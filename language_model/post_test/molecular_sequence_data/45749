zzso monkey is one of the zzso species currently used as an animal model for experimental surgery and medicine, in particular, to experiment new drugs or therapy protocols designed for the prevention of zzso zzso In this field, it is of utmost importance to select zzso zzso zzso One way to ensure zzso between donor and recipient is to check their major zzso complex zzso zzso at the zzso playing a zzso role in zzso We report in this paper on the zzso monkey zzso zzso evidenced by sequencing of amplified zzso 2 separated either by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso or by zzso By the study of zzso unrelated animals from two populations zzso and The zzso we characterized 50 zzso 2 sequences among which 28 were identical to sequences already reported in zzso zzso or other zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso By cloning and sequencing zzso zzso we revealed two additional zzso zzso Out of the 20 zzso that we defined here, only two were found in both zzso The functional impact of DR zzso was studied in zzso by mixed zzso zzso
