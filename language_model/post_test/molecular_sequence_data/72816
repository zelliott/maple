We present the zzso sequence of the guinea pig zzso precursor protein zzso the complete coding sequence of 770 zzso zzso By alternative zzso of three zzso transcripts zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids and all forms previously zzso as zzso are also zzso zzso pig zzso precursor protein was shown to exhibit extensive sequence similarity to its human and zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the protein level which implies an evolutionary zzso but yet not fully understood zzso zzso
