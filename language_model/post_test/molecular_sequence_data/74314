zzso zzso is one of the rather few amphibious plants that can normally grow in both water and zzso zzso zzso roots of zzso zzso zzso will grow long, thick, zzso during drought stress, which are assumed to improve performance of the plant by more efficient storage and extraction of water from deep soil zzso In order to isolate zzso clones of zzso genes from zzso zzso roots, the zzso were treated with drought and the differential display technique was zzso By using 18 primer combinations, zzso putative drought zzso gene segments were obtained and one of them was confirmed having been zzso by reverse northern zzso and subsequently cloned and zzso A zzso analysis revealed that it might be a new gene zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the gene was zzso by drought and salt zzso
