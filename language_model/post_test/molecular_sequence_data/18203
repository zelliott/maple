The length homogeneous part of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes of cucumber zzso zzso was characterized by sequencing zzso zzso preceding the zzso zzso coding region of a zzso zzso repeat zzso This part of the zzso is composed of repeated elements and shows a very complex structural zzso Most obvious is a 119 zzso element which is repeated seven zzso A single zzso initiation site zzso was detected by a zzso zzso zzso experiment upstream of these repetitions giving rise to a 2013 zzso zzso external transcribed zzso zzso for zzso zzso mapping showed several zzso termination sites zzso the first one is located 350 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso coding region, the others are found within the zzso of this region accounting for the length zzso of cucumber zzso zzso the zzso is repeated two or three times in the zzso depending on the length of the respective repeat classes and the zzso precursor is zzso in length varying from zzso 8000 to zzso zzso
