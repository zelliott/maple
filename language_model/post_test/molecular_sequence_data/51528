The zzso chain reaction zzso was used with zzso complementary to zzso zzso sequences to amplify the internal transcribed zzso 2 zzso 2) of the zzso repeat units of five zzso zzso one each of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two of zzso zzso In contrast to the situation found in zzso that have been zzso length zzso was evident in each zzso The zzso composition of the amplified bands was confirmed by Southern zzso using an ITS 2 amplified from zzso zzso and cloned zzso from zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso DNA zzso using the same zzso In addition to one dominant zzso for each zzso there were several less frequent fragments of different sizes, and the zzso for each species had a unique zzso pattern for ITS zzso The absence of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso sequences in the zzso genes of these four zzso species was demonstrated by the production of identical zzso patterns with zzso DNA zzso following zzso of zzso DNA with zzso and zzso and by complete zzso with zzso
