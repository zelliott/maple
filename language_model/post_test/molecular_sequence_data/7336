A rapid screening zzso for zzso fetus in bull zzso was developed using the zzso chain reaction zzso and restriction zzso analysis zzso to complement isolation by zzso An zzso primer pair zzso from the zzso region of zzso zzso of zzso fetus was used to amplify a 362 base pair zzso by zzso The zzso zzso which is completed in 10 hours, detected as few as three zzso fetus zzso zzso cells in zzso infected raw bull zzso and in zzso diluted with milk or egg zzso zzso zzso All the strains tested, of both subspecies of zzso zzso were zzso as were some other zzso zzso Restricting the amplified products by zzso differentiated zzso fetus from the other zzso There was no visible product generated by zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso found in the zzso of bulls, or from seven other species of bacteria found in zzso A modification of the zzso zzso using another primer pair zzso and two temperature zzso cycling conditions, increased the probability of detecting zzso fetus zzso zzso zzso amplification followed by zzso could be used to screen bovine zzso rapidly for zzso zzso In most cases, sequencing of zzso zzso generated products would be preferable for distinguishing between the two subspecies of zzso zzso
