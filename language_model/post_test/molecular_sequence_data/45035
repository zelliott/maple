A three-dimensional model of human zzso zzso domain zzso was developed by zzso zzso using the high-resolution human zzso zzso structure as zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were investigated using in zzso zzso zzso zzso of unmodified zzso was located within the zzso zzso with the zzso group involved in hydrogen bonding with zzso zzso was zzso by zzso stacking interactions with zzso The zzso group and zzso oxygen were extensively involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with zzso acids within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso and hydrocarbon zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in predicted zzso energy which reflected the increased binding affinities reported in zzso
