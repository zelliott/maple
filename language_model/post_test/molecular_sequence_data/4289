The zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso on an zzso complex zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and zzso via the zzso zzso However, previous molecular characterization of the zzso zzso zzso was restricted to zzso the gene that encodes the first zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso As deduced from the sequence data, zzso zzso zzso consists of three zzso including an zzso domain, whereas zzso zzso zzso is composed of six zzso and harbors a putative zzso domain at its zzso zzso Each module incorporates one zzso acid into the zzso product and can be further subdivided into zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli five internal zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ranging from 536 to 559 zzso zzso were affinity zzso and found to be active by zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso The detected zzso acid zzso of the investigated zzso zzso the zzso arrangement of the zzso product with the respective module in the corresponding zzso zzso and explain the production of the four known naturally occurring zzso zzso The zzso values of the investigated zzso zzso for their zzso acid zzso were found to be comparable to those published for zzso zzso zzso These findings strongly support the functional zzso of single zzso within zzso zzso zzso Directly downstream of the 3' end of the zzso zzso and probably transcribed in the zzso zzso two tandem ABC zzso which may be involved in zzso resistance against zzso and a putative zzso were zzso
