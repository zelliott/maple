zzso which were selected from a zzso zzso expression library with the immune serum from a zzso zzso zzso were further screened using milk and zzso zzso from mice which had been orally infected with zzso zzso zzso The gene products of several clones reacted strongly with milk zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Three of these clones zzso zzso zzso were shown to zzso a dense zzso protein of 40 zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso with one of the zzso zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso has been obtained by cloning zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso DNA zzso The coding sequence contains no zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence indicates a zzso rich zzso product with an internal zzso region of 19 zzso acids and a potential site of zzso The primary translation product with a theoretical size of zzso Da contains a putative zzso signal sequence of 20 zzso acids but no apparent zzso anchor zzso zzso of the zzso gene and Southern zzso analysis suggested that the zzso gene is single zzso zzso gene is translated in zzso to yield a single zzso species of about zzso zzso
