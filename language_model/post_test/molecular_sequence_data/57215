A zzso zzso was isolated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso banks of budding zzso zzso has a zzso zzso segregation since zzso remains at one pole of the zzso zzso This produces one zzso cell and one zzso cell, each containing a zzso pole body zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and is identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso which is the zzso component of a zzso DNA binding complex zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso to zzso labeled the zzso region in nearly all the cells examined including zzso zzso In some cells with short zzso which may be in zzso zzso was also observed along the zzso The zzso pattern and the zzso of zzso are consistent with zzso being a zzso zzso and provide in zzso evidence for its role in the attachment of zzso to the zzso
