DNA from five zzso of zzso zzso were examined for their zzso by zzso chain zzso Three zzso zzso were isolated from patients with acute zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso products showed that zzso zzso zzso for zzso strains could amplify zzso DNA extracted from zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso strains could amplify zzso DNA extracted from zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis and the zzso of zzso zzso which recognizes the 30 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that only zzso was zzso while the others were zzso The results of the zzso analysis by zzso were in zzso with the zzso zzso It is suggested that there are differences in zzso DNA between zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a highly sensitive and specific method for zzso DNA analysis of zzso zzso
