The first zzso the second zzso of the human zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the modified sequence was subsequently introduced into an zzso shuttle zzso able to replicate in both zzso cells and zzso After replication in zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso DNA was extracted and zzso were screened in zzso coli zzso alpha zzso The vast majority of the zzso induced by zzso zzso were zzso zzso The zzso frequency observed at the second zzso of zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher than the one observed at the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference was confirmed by the results obtained when two adjacent zzso zzso zzso were positioned within zzso zzso The higher zzso frequency observed for the zzso position could be attributed to differential repair zzso variation in zzso zzso These results are in agreement with animal experiments where zzso agents gave rise to zzso on zzso position of zzso zzso
