The first zzso domain of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is functionally important, affecting sensitivity of the zzso to cardiac zzso zzso zzso and being implicated in the transport of zzso This domain is also variable among zzso zzso of the zzso Using zzso we have isolated from seven insect species with contrasting zzso a DNA zzso containing this region, in order to help determine whether zzso expression might be associated with zzso zzso by a gene family, as it is in zzso A single sequence (with one zzso characteristic of zzso was obtained from zzso DNA of each zzso Only the zzso from zzso zzso contained an zzso but at a location different to that found in zzso For all zzso so far zzso the species zzso is the same as the zzso gene zzso (based on the sequences of the first zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso The results strongly indicate a single, zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso is present in zzso
