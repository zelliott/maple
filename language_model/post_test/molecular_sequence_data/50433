The primary structure of the alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso reveals that both proteins contain a zzso zzso motif (where C is zzso A1 and zzso are zzso zzso zzso and X is an zzso zzso zzso the recognition signal for a protein zzso The product, a zzso zzso can be detected by zzso acid analysis and by zzso following conversion to zzso Mass zzso confirms a zzso linked zzso zzso in both zzso zzso mass zzso zzso these modifications at the zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso and zzso sequences of the alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso association of zzso zzso probably zzso by these zzso zzso is zzso
