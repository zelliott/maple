zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of fatal zzso zzso in rainbow zzso A gene zzso an zzso activity, zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso into zzso and expressed in zzso coli and in the zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso gene revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso with coding capacity for a zzso protein with a molecular weight of zzso The first 13 zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso completely match those deduced from DNA sequence starting at zzso zzso This finding indicated that zzso is zzso as a zzso with a zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso intermediate which is further processed into a mature zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso and showed a high sequence similarity to other zzso especially with the mature form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso or zzso from several species of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The gene zzso was zzso zzso and the construct was used to create an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso These first reports of a defined zzso in an zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrate an important role in zzso
