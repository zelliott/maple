Based on analysis by liquid zzso zzso mass zzso we have developed a new method for fast and sensitive zzso of zzso and zzso in wheat zzso Using this procedure the two protein zzso from seven zzso wheat varieties have been zzso by high resolution high performance liquid zzso separation coupled to accurate determination of molecular zzso In this way, the molecular mass of the single components from both zzso and zzso zzso were measured and more than zzso components were detected for each fraction indicating a high zzso Although the zzso profiles were similar, the molecular masses of protein components with similar retention times among the varieties were often zzso The difference ranged from a few mass units corresponding to single zzso acid zzso up to thousands zzso zzso deletion or zzso along the protein zzso Two components representing about a half of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified through the zzso sequence and molecular mass zzso We suggest the use of the high level and the molecular mass of these zzso components as markers to detect traces of wheat in gluten-free food preparations for zzso zzso
