A future possibility for treatment of genetic diseases may be gene therapy using zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso This might require zzso of CB zzso cells prior to zzso gene zzso and ex zzso expansion of zzso To address this possibility, zzso low density zzso depleted zzso cells from fresh or zzso zzso blood were sorted for zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anemia zzso C zzso zzso and cells expanded ex zzso in suspension culture for 7 days with growth zzso The results zzso 1) high recovery of viable cells after zzso 2) high efficiency zzso of zzso cells from zzso cells prior to and after zzso 3) high degree of expansion of zzso cells and immature zzso from zzso cells before and after zzso 4) efficient zzso with stable integration and expression of newly introduced genes in zzso and then sorted zzso cells, as detected prior to and after ex zzso zzso and 5) high efficiency zzso of single isolated zzso cells obtained from zzso zzso zzso This information should be of value for future studies evaluating the use of zzso zzso blood for gene zzso zzso
