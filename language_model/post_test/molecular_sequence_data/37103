The zzso zinc finger zzso of zzso is referred to as the zzso zzso which connects the zzso DNA binding domain with the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated how a green fluorescent protein zzso linked to the zzso zinc finger is located zzso The zzso resonance energy transfer technique and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate the results as zzso zzso In the binding to zzso DNA, the geometry of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zinc finger is similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zinc finger is folded more zzso in the absence of DNA zzso volume zzso zzso and consequently alters the zzso at the zzso domain more extensively zzso zzso upon DNA binding than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results zzso that the zzso zzso zzso moderates various interactions of the adjacent zzso regulation domain with other zzso factors as well as DNA binding and is essential for the function of zzso and/or zzso family zzso
