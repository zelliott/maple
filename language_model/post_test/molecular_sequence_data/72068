The 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli is required for the assembly of zzso zzso which are zzso highly zzso protein complexes anchored to the outer bacterial membrane that mediate zzso of zzso zzso coli strains to host cell zzso Here we identified the contact sites on the surface of the zzso structure of zzso that are responsible for the binding of the 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso chemical shift zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso surface of zzso is formed nearly entirely by the zzso domain, and its extent and shape indicate that zzso binds a folded form of the zzso zzso
