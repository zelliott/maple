The zzso zzso gene zzso is clustered with the genes for the zzso zzso acids zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso It can be transcribed with zzso genes under zzso regulation or independently of zzso synthesis under the control of its own zzso The product of zzso is responsible for zzso sensibility under zzso zzso In the presence of more than 10 zzso zzso the zzso produced by the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is transformed to zzso by zzso and, consequently, is not available for zzso zzso zzso is also involved in zzso formation in the zzso pathway, initiated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The differences in the genetic organization, the zzso and the zzso parameters of these zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggest that this zzso plays a different role in the metabolism in these zzso Thus, the zzso zzso from zzso zzso plays a dual role in the zzso zzso as key regulator of zzso and zzso zzso by controlling the zzso flux by a shift to zzso and zzso as an zzso catalyzing the second step of the zzso zzso
