The formation of clustered DNA damage sites is a unique feature of zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that the repair of zzso within clusters may be compromised, but little is understood about the zzso consequences of such damage zzso Using a zzso method, damaged DNA containing zzso positioned at zzso zzso zzso from zzso on the complementary strand was zzso into zzso zzso coli or into strains lacking the DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be significantly higher for clustered damage sites than for single zzso The loss of zzso gave a large relative increase in zzso frequency and a strain lacking both zzso and zzso showed even higher zzso zzso up to nearly zzso of rescued zzso In these zzso the zzso frequency decreases with increasing spacing of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA carrying clustered damage, following rescue from bacteria, showed that almost all of the zzso are zzso zzso The data suggest that at clustered damage sites, depending on zzso zzso the action of zzso is compromised and zzso processing of zzso by zzso is the most important mechanism for protection against zzso
