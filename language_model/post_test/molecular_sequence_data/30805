We describe the molecular characterization of the zzso gene crumbs, which encodes an integral membrane protein with 30 zzso repeats in the zzso part and exhibits a striking expression zzso The protein is exclusively localized on the zzso zzso of zzso cells and concentrated at the borders between zzso zzso in crumbs lead to severe disruptions in the organization of zzso derived zzso and in some cases to cell death in these zzso The structure and the expression pattern of the protein and the zzso of zzso indicate a function of crumbs during the development of zzso possibly for the establishment and/or maintenance of cell zzso
