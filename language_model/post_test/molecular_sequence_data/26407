zzso DNA clones covering the coding region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso were assembled by zzso amplification from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence consists of zzso zzso and departs from the rat sequence at 21 positions, 20 of which are in the zzso zzso zzso A notable cluster of zzso lies in the region of the long zzso repeat at positions zzso The size zzso of zzso zzso suggested by previous zzso zzso experiments was examined by zzso protection analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso from mouse zzso A zzso zzso long zzso species was found to zzso the zzso and a 3' zzso portion longer than 5 zzso was demonstrated by internal zzso with zzso followed by zzso zzso with a 3' zzso The sensitivity afforded by the use of zzso zzso zzso in solution zzso allowed the demonstration in zzso zzso mice of an zzso zzso that covers the entire coding region, but is present at zzso to zzso lower levels than in normal zzso The detection of significant amounts of zzso zzso zzso earlier suggestions of an zzso protein in zzso mice and indicates, at zzso with other conclusions, that the expression of this zzso zzso is affected at a zzso zzso
