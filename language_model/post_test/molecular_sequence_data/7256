The nuclear gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso codes for a protein which, on the basis of sequence zzso was previously zzso to be a zzso zzso equivalent of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 (1992) zzso The zzso character of the zzso product is now confirmed by zzso with the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso characterized previously as the nuclear zzso of some zzso zzso zzso zzso is found to be a single zzso substitution changing zzso to zzso within the part of zzso corresponding to the zzso region involved in interaction with the zzso zzso This indicates that the mechanism of zzso suppression could be analogous to the suppression due to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso structural gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso leads also to zzso in respiratory growth in the background of the zzso zzso zzso
