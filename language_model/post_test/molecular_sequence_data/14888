A novel cloning zzso to aid in the construction of single copy zzso reporter systems for gene expression studies in zzso zzso zzso coli zzso including zzso is zzso The zzso allows construction of zzso zzso of cloned gene promoters to a short segment of zzso coli zzso A zzso zzso resistance marker flanked by a short zzso segment is positioned zzso to the cloning zzso zzso amplification using opposing zzso complementary to the upstream zzso zzso and the downstream zzso zzso generates a linear template suitable for integration using zzso zzso zzso of linear template derived from the zzso zzso into host strains replaces the entire native zzso promoter and zzso the promoter of interest zzso with the zzso zzso thus simultaneously producing a zzso zzso reporter system and eliminating background zzso zzso Studies comparing zzso expression from a zzso fusion in the zzso open with that on a zzso in zzso coli strain zzso are zzso
