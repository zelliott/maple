To understand the mechanisms that allow the enteric zzso zzso coli to make the transitions between growth and stationary phase and to maintain cell viability during zzso we have looked for zzso defective in zzso survival (a zzso zzso In this paper we describe a conditional zzso coli zzso zzso that grows normally and remains viable during stationary phase but is unable to exit stationary phase and resume zzso growth at high zzso Thus, the zzso gene product is not required for cell survival per zzso but, rather, it is required for starved cells to zzso growth under restrictive zzso Once growth has started, zzso function is no longer zzso zzso cells sense and respond to fresh medium but appear to arrest growth before the first cell zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene product is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with multiple zzso regions and is zzso to the zzso cassette (ABC) family of zzso a large family of transport proteins found in both zzso and zzso zzso An open reading frame, designated zzso was found immediately upstream of zzso and may be in an zzso with zzso The predicted zzso gene product is also zzso to the ABC zzso family and zzso and zzso may function together in a common transport zzso Either zzso or zzso may be the same gene as zzso a gene described previously whose function is needed for the production of functional zzso d zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso cells were found to lack functional zzso d zzso However, the zzso zzso is not simply attributable to the absence of zzso d zzso Thus, the zzso gene product may have an additional role in the zzso
