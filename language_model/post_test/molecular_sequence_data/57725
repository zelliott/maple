The zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso coli process zzso in zzso and DNA repair into mature zzso zzso and zzso zzso branch migration of Holliday zzso while zzso resolves these structures by zzso zzso around the point of strand zzso The overlap between zzso and zzso was investigated using synthetic zzso and zzso zzso is a complex of zzso and zzso with zzso providing the DNA binding zzso and zzso the zzso activity that drives branch zzso Both zzso and zzso form defined complexes with each of the zzso The gel zzso of these complexes suggests that the zzso attracts two zzso of zzso but mainly zzso of zzso zzso of the junction in the presence of zzso requires high levels of zzso zzso is shown to have a much higher specific activity to the extent that very little of this protein would be required to match zzso in zzso Both proteins also zzso a zzso which is consistent with zzso zzso However, zzso shows no ability to unwind more conventional zzso and the suggestion is made that its zzso activity is directed towards specific DNA structures such as zzso
