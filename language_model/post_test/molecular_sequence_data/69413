The expected best zzso zzso for secondary structure prediction from multiple protein sequence alignment have been determined by an analysis of known protein structural zzso The results show substantial variation is possible among zzso protein structures, and that zzso agreement is unlikely between a consensus prediction and one member of a protein structural zzso The study provides the range of agreement to be expected between a perfect secondary structure prediction from a multiple alignment and each protein within the zzso The results of this study overcome the difficulties inherent in the use of zzso accuracy for assessing the quality of consensus secondary structure zzso The zzso of recent consensus predictions for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fall within the expected range for a perfect zzso
