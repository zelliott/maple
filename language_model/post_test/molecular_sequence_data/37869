zzso is the nuclear import zzso that recognizes cargo proteins which contain classical zzso and zzso nuclear zzso sequences zzso and zzso their transport into the zzso To determine the structural basis of the recognition of the two classes of zzso by zzso zzso we zzso an zzso truncated mouse zzso protein with peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso from the zzso virus 40 zzso large zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso We show that the zzso zzso large zzso zzso binds to two binding sites on the zzso similar to what was observed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex shows, for the first time, the mode of binding of zzso zzso to the zzso The two basic clusters in the zzso occupy the two binding sites used by the zzso zzso while the sequence linking the two basic clusters is poorly ordered, consistent with its tolerance to zzso The structures explain the structural basis for binding of diverse zzso to the sole zzso zzso
