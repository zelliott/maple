Animal models for zzso virus zzso are restricted to some species of zzso monkeys which develop zzso zzso zzso or benign zzso diseases after virus zzso Similar pathological features were induced in rabbits by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study 17 of 32 rabbits infected with varying amounts of zzso produced from zzso cells developed zzso zzso In 13 rabbits high-grade zzso zzso were zzso 4 rabbits revealed the zzso feature of zzso zzso These zzso were shown to be associated with zzso by zzso and by the expression of zzso zzso zzso in 14 and 10 cases, zzso The zzso in the zzso gene region between DNA from zzso and zzso and from zzso and the zzso tissue was found to be zzso and zzso zzso All the infected animals produced zzso to zzso corresponding to early and late zzso zzso By studying the zzso expression in zzso cells zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso and zzso and in the zzso cycle zzso zzso were zzso Our findings suggested that zzso caused a symptomatic infection in rabbits with pathological features that fit the conditions of an animal model suitable for testing zzso drugs and vaccines against zzso
