The objective of this study was to analyze the zzso composition of bacterial community in the soil of an zzso zzso zzso using a zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso genes were amplified directly from soil DNA with universally zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso The clone library was screened by restriction zzso length zzso zzso and representative zzso gene sequences were zzso A total of 115 bacterial sequence types were found in 190 analyzed zzso zzso sequence analyses revealed novel zzso zzso gene sequence types and a high diversity of putative bacterial zzso Members of these bacteria included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, zzso and candidate divisions (including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thirty-five clones were affiliated with bacteria that were related to zzso zzso iron or zzso zzso The comparison of the present data with the data obtained previously from caves based on zzso zzso gene analysis revealed similarities in the bacterial community zzso especially in the high abundance of zzso and zzso Furthermore, this study provided the novel evidence for presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
