The zzso fiber of zzso type 2 zzso mediates the first stage of zzso attachment, and the zzso head region of the fiber has been implicated as the zzso zzso To locate regions on the primary zzso sequence of the fiber which may be involved in zzso interaction, zzso zzso mapping was performed using zzso zzso zzso prepared against both native zzso fiber and zzso head protein expressed in zzso coli and zzso 18 zzso zzso prepared against zzso zzso head protein expressed in zzso The approach using zzso zzso revealed eight zzso on the primary sequence of the head which contain one or more continuous zzso At least two of these regions were also recognized by zzso zzso reacting against both zzso and zzso fiber head zzso The majority of zzso zzso which did not recognize zzso zzso peptides in zzso were also zzso against the zzso form of protein in Western zzso suggesting that their recognition of zzso is due to the existence of as yet undefined zzso zzso or to zzso in zzso zzso Our results zzso well with the recently published X-ray zzso model of zzso fiber head zzso zzso zzso Henry, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso since most zzso zzso containing linear zzso mapped to the outer zzso or uppermost zzso in this zzso Four of five zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso only and none recognized linear zzso This might suggest that the zzso form of fiber is necessary for making contact with the zzso and that zzso zzso on the head domain may be involved in zzso zzso
