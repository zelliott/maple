zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso with overlapping but distinct biological zzso Their receptors share two zzso (the zzso beta and zzso zzso that are essential for signal zzso The zzso zzso requires an additional zzso alpha zzso for high affinity zzso zzso Recently, a zzso zzso alpha zzso was identified, zzso and shown to be structurally related to zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso alpha alone bound zzso with a zzso higher affinity than that seen with zzso alpha and zzso We now extend these studies into the human system with the isolation of three zzso spliced human zzso alpha zzso that are all capable of high affinity binding of zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso like that of zzso zzso is zzso for zzso zzso suggesting that the primary role of the alpha chains is to zzso high affinity zzso At high zzso zzso like zzso is able to signal through a complex of zzso beta and zzso in the absence of the alpha zzso Furthermore, the zzso and zzso genes have a similar zzso organization and are closely linked in both human and zzso zzso However, the distribution of expression of the zzso alpha is much wider than that of the zzso zzso suggesting a broader range of cellular targets for zzso
