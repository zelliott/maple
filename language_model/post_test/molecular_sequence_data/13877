zzso zzso a group of protein families that exhibit about 50% sequence identity among each other and to conventional zzso have been found in a variety of zzso zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso genes for one conventional zzso zzso and for three zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso which we recently discovered, is an essential gene coding for a zzso of 489 zzso acids zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso Besides its zzso to conventional zzso zzso possesses a domain exhibiting weak similarity to the zzso protein zzso as well as a potential nuclear zzso zzso An zzso prepared against a specific segment of the zzso gene product recognizes a zzso band of approximately 55 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with this zzso revealed that zzso is located in the zzso Nuclear zzso was observed in all cells regardless of the stage of the cell zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso showed that zzso is indeed highly enriched in the nuclear zzso We suggest that zzso is an essential constituent of zzso zzso
