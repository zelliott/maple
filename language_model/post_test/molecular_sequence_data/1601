zzso of zzso by zzso zzso unique changes in zzso which contribute to the zzso of zzso disease in zzso zzso zzso The host genetic pathways altered by zzso infection that are responsible for these zzso changes are largely zzso For identifying such zzso zzso difference analysis was performed comparing zzso from zzso transgenic zzso with zzso zzso In this way, a gene named zzso zzso was zzso a zzso protein of the zzso zzso that is highly zzso in zzso transgenic zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were recently shown to guide zzso terminals to specific zzso in developing zzso Their presence and role in other zzso including the zzso has not been zzso The current study demonstrates zzso expression of both zzso and zzso and a tight spatial and zzso regulation of these genes in zzso During zzso sidekick expression was observed first in zzso bud and zzso zzso zzso in a pattern similar to other genes known to play important roles in branching zzso In adult zzso zzso zzso sidekick proteins were seen in zzso at low levels, and expression of zzso was greatly zzso in diseased zzso transgenic mouse zzso In a human zzso kidney zzso sidekick expression was increased in zzso in a pattern consistent with the mouse zzso It is proposed that the zzso of zzso protein may play an important role in zzso zzso
