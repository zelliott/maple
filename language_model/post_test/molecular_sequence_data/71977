The zzso virus zzso zzso can persist in dividing human B cells as zzso circular zzso zzso zzso replicate in zzso with host cell DNA and are maintained at a relatively constant copy number for a long zzso Only two viral zzso the replication origin zzso and the zzso zzso are required for the persistence of viral zzso during zzso zzso activates zzso during the S phase and may also contribute to the partition and/or retention of viral zzso during zzso Indeed, zzso has been shown to interact with zzso zzso Moreover, viral zzso are zzso associated with zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may facilitate the zzso of viral zzso on cellular zzso thus ensuring proper partition and zzso In the present paper, we have investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and various derivatives of zzso zzso fused to a zzso of the green fluorescent zzso The results show that binding to zzso zzso is a common property of zzso and zzso zzso Further studies indicated that at least three independent zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso binding to zzso zzso In agreement with the zzso model, two of these zzso mapped to a region that has been previously demonstrated to be required for the long-term persistence of zzso zzso
