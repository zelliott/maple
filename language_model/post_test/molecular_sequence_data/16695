A targeted zzso approach was used to construct a zzso array of potential zzso genes for investigating zzso interactions in pine trees zzso zzso This zzso containing a zzso set of 311 zzso was assembled by combining smaller sets of zzso generated by differential display or suppression zzso zzso using a variety of pathogen treatments and zzso The array was zzso to identify host genes regulated by zzso zzso a zzso fungus that zzso pitch zzso disease on pine zzso A set of 29 zzso were induced during the disease zzso zzso zzso on the array that were derived from experiments with zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso were zzso by zzso the results imply distinct genetic responses in pine to diseases zzso by zzso and zzso This zzso collection expands the zzso zzso for understanding interactions between zzso and their microbial associates in forest zzso
