To consider the evolutionary origin of the zzso habit in the blowfly zzso Lucilia zzso zzso analyses of zzso DNA sequence data were performed for 10 species, including all the common Lucilia agents of zzso collected from Africa, zzso North America and zzso zzso genetic distance and zzso analyses are used to consider zzso and zzso relationships within the zzso with reference to previous zzso zzso The results support the hypothesis of independent multiple evolution of the zzso habit in Lucilia zzso Lucilia zzso and the Lucilia zzso zzso group and suggest that it has zzso in relatively recent history along with the zzso and zzso of zzso The geographic differences in zzso importance of various species of Lucilia also suggest that there is a strong zzso influence determining which species has zzso Lucilia zzso has become the zzso zzso species in zzso and warm temperate zzso zzso Australia and South zzso zzso zzso in cool temperate zzso zzso Europe and New zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso become more common in sheep zzso in more zzso zzso zzso
