Here we report the description of the zzso gene zzso which encodes a protein recognized by the zzso zzso zzso that has been widely used to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso zzso acids in zzso It zzso to the zzso compartment of the cell and associates with zzso in zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The central domain of the zzso protein is highly repetitive and shows sequence similarity to zzso proteins of which no zzso zzso have been zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that during zzso zzso is necessary for zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrate a functional interaction of zzso with other zzso In addition, we show that during development, zzso expression is zzso regulated in zzso zzso
