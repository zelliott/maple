We have investigated the possibility of inducing zzso T zzso zzso to Ras containing a zzso at position 61 or to normal zzso using zzso zzso viruses expressing these zzso zzso from zzso mice zzso with zzso expressing zzso Ras showed specificity for the zzso Ras protein and recognition of normal Ras was zzso The opposite specificity was observed after zzso with zzso expressing normal zzso since zzso isolated from these mice recognized normal Ras well and zzso Ras zzso zzso of zzso Ras expression were insufficient for zzso by these zzso One zzso zzso mapped to zzso acids zzso and zzso 61 was critical for T cell zzso zzso generated against zzso Ras protein recognized zzso zzso containing zzso zzso 61, while zzso Ras zzso recognized the zzso zzso zzso A second zzso mapped to zzso zzso of Ras and was recognized equally well by zzso raised to normal or zzso zzso The zzso data raise the possibility of exploiting zzso zzso for targeted zzso of certain human zzso
