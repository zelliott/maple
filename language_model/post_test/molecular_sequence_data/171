Mouse zinc finger zzso domain containing 12 gene zzso has been identified as a zzso zzso of bone zzso protein zzso zzso and human zzso was reported to be related to zzso zzso mental zzso zzso However, the details of how human zzso involve in the zzso still remain zzso In this study, we identified a novel nuclear zzso signal zzso in the middle of human zzso protein which is responsible for the nuclear zzso zzso northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso is highly expressed in human zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso showed that zzso is specifically expressed in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso regions of mouse zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that zzso enhanced the zzso activities of zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso response element binding protein zzso as a zzso In conclusion, we identified a new zzso in zzso and figured out that zzso functions as a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
