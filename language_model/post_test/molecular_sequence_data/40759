zzso characterization of the zzso acid zzso compositions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was carried out by zzso The measured molecular masses of these four proteins did not agree with those predicted from the published zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso with both zzso zzso and electron capture zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso identified in each protein by protein database searching and de zzso zzso tag zzso In addition, it was determined through accurate mass measurement and zzso composition generation that zzso to which the zzso groups are zzso is not in fact a zzso Instead, it was identified as a chemical analog of zzso the zzso zzso After incorporation of these three zzso zzso and the zzso into the protein zzso the zzso molecular masses of four proteins were completely consistent with the measured values within 1 zzso This work demonstrates the power of zzso zzso for a detailed structural confirmation of zzso zzso even without prior information on zzso zzso or zzso
