zzso of quantitative BK viral load using real-time quantitative zzso zzso were compared using two types of samples, extracted urine DNA and zzso zzso An excellent correlation was observed in quantitative viral load between zzso urine and extracted urine DNA zzso zzso zzso Compared to extracted urine DNA when a small sample volume of zzso urine was used (2 zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso is detection of zzso DNA was observed in 124 samples (106 positive and 18 zzso collected from zzso transplant recipient zzso There was no significant difference in the quantitative BK viral load zzso zzso detected in extracted urine DNA zzso compared to zzso urine zzso zzso pH in the range of zzso and zzso freezing had no effect on the zzso zzso The partial zzso of the zzso reaction observed when 5 zzso sample volume of zzso urine was used was markedly reduced at a sample volume of 2 zzso Using zzso urine for zzso detection of BK viral load is zzso while maintaining the sensitivity and accuracy associated with the use of extracted urine DNA, making a clinical zzso surveillance strategy in zzso based on urinary sample screening using zzso as the first line test more zzso
