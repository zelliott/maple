There have been conflicting reports regarding the association of zzso zzso and zzso spontaneous zzso It is difficult to assess the role of zzso in the zzso by zzso alone, since the characteristic zzso zzso are often scarce or absent in this zzso Our purpose was to use the zzso chain reaction zzso to detect zzso in zzso tissue of women with zzso spontaneous zzso DNA was extracted from 25 samples of zzso zzso zzso tissue from 21 women with at least three unexplained spontaneous abortions zzso zzso DNA from an zzso zzso section of each zzso was amplified using zzso multiplex zzso specific for the late zzso and the major immediate early genes of zzso The zzso used has a demonstrated level of sensitivity on the order of zzso zzso per square zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was successfully isolated from 21 specimens in 18 zzso zzso features of zzso infection were completely absent from these cases, and none of these specimens contained evidence of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso infection of zzso tissue is not a common direct cause of zzso spontaneous zzso
