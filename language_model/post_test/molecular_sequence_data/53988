The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes the human zzso zzso and is therefore of interest as an zzso zzso The zzso heavy variable chain zzso was humanized using the closest human zzso sequence as the template on to which to graft the zzso complementary determining regions zzso Two versions were proposed, one in which the zzso zzso 45 of the zzso form was maintained and another in which this framework zzso was changed to the zzso found in the human zzso These zzso humanized versions were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso from the zzso zzso was also zzso The binding activities of the zzso and both zzso zzso were determined by flow zzso zzso All the constructions were able to recognize human zzso harboring zzso indicating successful zzso with transfer of the original binding zzso Some differences between the two zzso versions were zzso The method used was simple and straightforward, with no need for refined structural analyses and could be used for the zzso of other zzso
