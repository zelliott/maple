For this study, 68 plum samples were collected from 12 provinces of zzso Low molecular weight zzso were extracted and used for zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso gel zzso and biological indexing using zzso zzso showed that 15 out of the 68 plum samples were positive for zzso stunt zzso zzso Four positive samples were selected for cloning and sequence zzso zzso indicated that most zzso sequences from the plum in China had 1-3 zzso changes from the closest zzso in zzso In addition, the sample zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso province had one sequence with a zzso zzso (named zzso zzso at the zzso position in the lower central zzso By biological indexing, cucumber zzso an indicator plant for zzso were zzso with zzso directly extracted from the original plum source zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing analysis of the progeny showed that zzso but not zzso was recovered from zzso zzso Although very unlikely, the possibility that this extra sequence was the result of a zzso artifact cannot be completely ruled zzso
