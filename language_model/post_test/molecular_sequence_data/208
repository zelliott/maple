zzso alcohol administration has been known to increase zzso zzso by enhancing zzso production of zzso oxide and zzso We previously reported that control of the zzso zzso balance and the cellular defense against zzso damage are primary functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through to supply zzso for zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells regulates zzso zzso We observed the significantly enhanced protection to cell killing, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso DNA damage, and decrease in generation of zzso zzso oxygen species and zzso nitrogen species in zzso cells compared to control cells upon exposure to zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso cells with zzso short interfering zzso markedly decreased the expression of zzso modulating cellular zzso status and subsequently enhancing the zzso of zzso zzso These studies support the hypothesis that zzso plays an important role in regulating the toxicity induced by ethanol presumably through maintaining the cellular zzso zzso
