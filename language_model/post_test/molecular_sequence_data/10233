The zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso zzso disease has been identified, zzso and zzso It is a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso transcripts with the complete zzso sequence were infectious and induced the typical symptoms of the zzso zzso zzso can form zzso structures in both polarity zzso Plus and minus zzso zzso zzso zzso during in zzso zzso and after zzso as predicted by these structures, which are stable and most probably act as single zzso structures as in zzso zzso mosaic zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the plus zzso zzso structure also appears to be active in zzso because the zzso zzso of the linear plus zzso zzso isolated from infected tissue is that predicted by the corresponding zzso zzso Both zzso structures of zzso display some zzso the plus zzso domain has an zzso A after the zzso A9 zzso and the minus one has an unusually long zzso zzso The most stable secondary structure predicted for zzso is a zzso zzso that does not fulfill the zzso or zzso model proposed for the in zzso structure of most zzso with the exception of zzso whose proposed secondary structure of lowest free energy also is zzso The unusual zzso of zzso and zzso is supported by their zzso in 2 M zzso in contrast to zzso and a series of representative zzso zzso that are soluble under the same high salt zzso These results support the zzso of zzso zzso into two subgroups, one formed by zzso and the other one by zzso and zzso
