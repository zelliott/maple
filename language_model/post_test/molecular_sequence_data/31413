Much like the host cells they zzso viruses must also regulate their life zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso a prominent human zzso uses a zzso zzso in conjunction with multiple viral zzso zzso Following entry into host cells, the zzso outer zzso proteins zzso and zzso act to increase expression of viral zzso zzso zzso thereby helping initiate the infection life zzso Because zzso has gone largely zzso we employed a hybrid mass zzso approach to determine how zzso exerts its functions during early stages of zzso For a zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso was performed in live cells to define its dynamic zzso from 2 to 24 h zzso Next, zzso protein complexes were zzso zzso during infection of human zzso and analyzed by mass zzso to investigate zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso is heavily zzso in at least 23 zzso One zzso site matched the consensus zzso zzso zzso consistent with our identification of zzso proteins and host and viral zzso as specific zzso zzso Moreover, we determined that zzso specifically interacts with the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso is partially zzso in a zzso manner during infection, and that the zzso activity of zzso is responsible for this zzso This is the first evidence of a viral protein being targeted for degradation by another viral protein during zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso levels are tightly controlled and important for the zzso regulation of viral gene expression throughout the virus life zzso The concept of a structural zzso zzso zzso performing zzso roles is likely to reflect a theme common to many zzso and a better understanding of these functions will be important for developing zzso
