zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and is considered as an attractive drug zzso We generated two different zzso fragments, an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso variable zzso zzso derived from three distinct zzso zzso zzso that inhibit the zzso of zzso by the zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or by zzso alone zzso The zzso were obtained by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso were cloned and subsequently expressed in zzso All zzso fragments revealed similar or slightly decreased affinities compared to those of the respective zzso except zzso In the presence of a zzso zzso excess of all zzso fragments, zzso of zzso by zzso was completely zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso were capable of interfering with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of MA, zzso or zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a significant reduction of zzso zzso time (except for zzso and this effect was comparable to that of potato zzso zzso zzso a well-known zzso zzso zzso experiments with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso capacity of the zzso was comparable to that of the zzso whereas the zzso had a more reduced zzso In conclusion, these highly specific zzso zzso are interesting tools to further evaluate the concept of zzso zzso in various zzso and zzso zzso
