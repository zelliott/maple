An zzso zzso zzso , which has a zzso in the basic genetic system in zzso was isolated using the screening of the high zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso and zzso studies showed the zzso had reduced activities of zzso I and II, molecular characterization of the zzso suggested that a zzso zzso impaired the expression of a gene zzso a zzso R family member with a targeting signal to zzso Since zzso R family members have a zzso zzso activity, we examined the zzso profile in zzso In zzso the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was impaired, and a significant reduction in zzso in zzso was found, suggesting that zzso functions in the maturation of zzso zzso The present results suggest that defects in the genetic system in zzso cause high zzso fluorescence, pale green zzso and marked reduction in the growth rate, whereas the levels of some zzso zzso were higher in zzso than in the zzso
