zzso and protein zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso regulates a variety of key biological zzso This study investigates the proposed zzso or zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso A range of zzso zzso tail zzso zzso with different length zzso were zzso and evaluated as zzso of zzso zzso We show that longer zzso between the zzso tail zzso and the zzso zzso zzso appear to allow for dual engagement of the two binding zzso zzso with zzso double zzso zzso zzso further confirm the requirement for a zzso charged surface on the zzso to interact with the zzso zzso
