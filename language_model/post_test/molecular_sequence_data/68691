We assessed the zzso properties of synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing either the normal sequence zzso 13 26) or the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso were monitored at 37 degrees C and pH zzso by measuring the amount of zzso remaining in solution, using zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso stain electron zzso revealed that all of the peptides formed zzso However, beta zzso showed greatly accelerated zzso formation compared to the other zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso properties on the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso acts by a different zzso zzso
