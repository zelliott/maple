zzso zzso from zzso coli is a zzso of identical zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso each containing a single zinc zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso of identical zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso After zzso from an zzso strain, the zzso from zzso zzso is found to contain a single atom of zinc per zzso zzso by flame atomic zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso indicates that each of the four zzso contains a binding site for the transition state analogue inhibitor zzso A region of zzso acid sequence zzso containing zzso that are involved in zinc coordination in the zzso from zzso coli, strongly suggests that in the zzso from zzso zzso zinc is coordinated by the zzso side chains of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This pattern of zinc coordination appears to be novel for a zzso zzso and might be expected to reduce the zzso of the active site substantially compared with that of the zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso Instead, the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso are found to be similar in their activities, and also in their relative binding affinities for a series of structurally related zzso with binding affinities that span a range of 6 orders of zzso In addition, the apparent zzso value of the active site is shifted upward by less than 1 zzso zzso zzso together with model building, suggest one possible mechanism of zzso
