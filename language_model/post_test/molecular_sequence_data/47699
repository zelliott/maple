zzso in zzso expression between species contribute to the zzso of many infectious pathogens for their zzso For example, we demonstrate that cultured human and monkey urinary zzso cells fail to bind a canine zzso coli zzso zzso however, zzso of these cells with the canine zzso zzso zzso zzso enables abundant adherence by the same zzso indicating that addition of a single sugar zzso to a zzso zzso has marked effects on microbial zzso Given the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso we sought to determine why human zzso do not express zzso zzso zzso of the zzso data base yielded a human sequence with high identity to the canine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Northern zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in all zzso zzso A human zzso zzso was zzso revealing identities with the canine zzso gene of 86 and zzso at the zzso and predicted zzso acid zzso zzso In contrast to the canine zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the human zzso zzso resulted in no zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso in zzso synthesis between species is an important zzso of microbial zzso zzso pressure from zzso organisms may have contributed to diversity in zzso expression among zzso
