We describe a simple and efficient technique that zzso the amplification of specific zzso for cloning and sequencing zzso An zzso bound to a small piece of membrane filter is used as a template to zzso complementary zzso The product of this reaction is then transferred to a new tube and amplified using a standard zzso zzso By simple zzso treatment, this zzso membrane can be zzso as many times as needed with no problems of low yield, zzso or zzso Multiple advantages and different applications can be gained with this zzso We have been using this technique to characterize a zzso zzso from human retinal zzso zzso cells following identification by Northern zzso According to the size of the zzso amplification products, this zzso band contains portions of the coding sequence for the zzso beta 1 zzso
