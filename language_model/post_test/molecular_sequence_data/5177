DNA vaccination may work through direct zzso of zzso presenting cells zzso or by zzso of the zzso protein by muscle or skin cells for zzso by zzso If zzso are attached to the zzso they may influence zzso or responding T cells to drive the response toward a zzso or zzso direction, and/or zzso it in an zzso zzso To test this concept, expression zzso were constructed containing the zzso zzso gene either alone, or linked to zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a sequence zzso nine zzso acids of zzso zzso These zzso expressed zzso fusion proteins in zzso which retained zzso zzso zzso mice were injected zzso with the DNA zzso Little if any zzso zzso was produced in response to any of the DNA zzso except for zzso However, zzso from zzso mice vaccinated with zzso and zzso beta zzso produced more zzso and less zzso during in zzso zzso zzso than did other zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso responses which were maintained or even increased over 16 zzso The zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso zzso the strongest zzso responses at 2 weeks zzso zzso responses were seen in all animals, even those lacking zzso zzso and were not related to zzso zzso These studies indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso responses to DNA vaccination can be effectively altered by certain zzso fusion zzso
