Although members of the protein zzso zzso zzso family share a common mechanism of action zzso of zzso the cellular processes in which they are involved can be both highly specialized and fundamentally zzso Identification of cellular zzso zzso will help zzso the biological functions of individual zzso Two types of zzso zzso are being used to isolate zzso zzso In the first, the active site zzso zzso is replaced by a zzso zzso zzso while in the second, the general acid zzso zzso is zzso by an Ala zzso zzso Unfortunately, only a limited number of zzso zzso have been identified with these two zzso which are usually relatively abundant cellular zzso Based on zzso considerations, we seek to create novel zzso zzso with improved zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterization of the newly designed zzso zzso indicates that zzso displays lower zzso activity than that of zzso In addition, zzso also possesses 6- and zzso higher zzso affinity than those of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso exhibits much higher affinity than both zzso and zzso for a bona fide zzso zzso the zzso growth factor zzso Moreover, zzso can also identify novel, less abundant zzso that are missed by zzso Thus, this newly developed and improved zzso zzso can serve as a powerful affinity zzso to isolate and purify both zzso and zzso protein zzso Given that both zzso and zzso are zzso among the zzso family, it is predicted that this improved zzso zzso would be zzso to all members of zzso for zzso zzso
