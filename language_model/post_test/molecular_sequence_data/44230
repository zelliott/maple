The type C zzso zzso zzso are a group of highly zzso proteins with substantial zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso species of zzso are reported to produce SEC and other zzso toxins produced by species other than zzso zzso have not been previously zzso In this study we report the zzso zzso and zzso properties of the canine SEC zzso expressed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso The mature form of zzso has 239 zzso acid zzso and a zzso of zzso Typical of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso response in monkeys and the proliferation of T cells in a zzso zzso Although zzso has zzso sequence identity to previously described SEC zzso its sequence is most related to zzso and zzso In contrast to the sequence zzso the zzso profile induced by zzso is typical of that induced by zzso This result is likely explained by the conservation of a zzso zzso at position 26 in zzso zzso at this position have been previously shown to determine zzso differences in zzso zzso interactions of other zzso Overall, these results show that zzso toxins produced by the multiple members of the zzso zzso are highly zzso in respect to biological and structural zzso Further, the frequent association of zzso with zzso in dogs supports the notion that the toxins are important for zzso survival and zzso
