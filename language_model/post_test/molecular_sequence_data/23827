zzso a protein expressed by chicken anemia virus, is found predominantly in the zzso in normal cells, whereas it zzso in the nucleus in transformed and zzso zzso However, the mechanisms that regulate the different zzso zzso of zzso in normal and tumor cells have not been fully zzso In this work, a putative nuclear export signal zzso in zzso was zzso It was testified that the putative zzso zzso of zzso was not a functional zzso but actually acted as a zzso retention zzso zzso of the zzso led to the nuclear zzso of zzso in normal zzso In addition, when a strong nuclear zzso signal was introduced into zzso it exclusively zzso to the nucleus in normal zzso These observations indicated that the zzso zzso of zzso in normal cells results from the balance between zzso retention and nuclear zzso On the other hand, the zzso was also proved to be necessary for zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso did not form obviously visible zzso zzso in normal or tumor zzso
