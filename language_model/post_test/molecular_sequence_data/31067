A deletion analysis of the zzso zzso zzso promoter defined a 196 zzso region zzso to zzso sufficient to zzso zzso expression on a zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso reporter gene in transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso This region, which contains DNA sequences I, G and zzso boxes, with zzso to other zzso zzso small zzso zzso gene promoter zzso directed expression independent of orientation and relative position in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sequences and subsequent expression analysis in transgenic tobacco showed that both G box and I box zzso in the context of the full zzso to zzso zzso promoter substantially reduced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso reporter zzso The G box has previously been shown to specifically bind in zzso a factor isolated from nuclear extracts of tomato and zzso This factor zzso is distinct from the factor zzso which binds to adjacent zzso boxes in the pea zzso zzso Multiple zzso in putative zzso zzso promoter zzso boxes had no pronounced affect on zzso possibly due to a zzso of these zzso zzso in which zzso promoter fragments were fused to truncated zzso zzso zzso mosaic zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso zzso promoter elements could partially restore expression to zzso zzso zzso
