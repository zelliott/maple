The zzso rolling circle replication zzso type zzso zzso from the zzso producer zzso zzso was characterized by DNA sequence analysis and zzso zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso revealed 11 open reading frames with high coding probability for which putative functions could be zzso zzso the replication zzso gene rep for zzso zzso contained only genes involved in zzso zzso The transfer gene zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso regulator zzso Six zzso genes involved in zzso zzso spreading are organized in two zzso consisting of two and three zzso coupled zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the transfer gene zzso represents a kill function and localized the zzso minimal zzso consisting of rep and the zzso origin to a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a modular zzso Its replication region resembled that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso while the transfer and spread regions involved in zzso zzso transfer were highly similar to the corresponding regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
