zzso zzso is known to occur in zzso However, knowledge of zzso in the third domain of life is rather zzso zzso searches of zzso zzso sequences reveals the absence of zzso systems in zzso zzso but the presence of zzso protein zzso and protein zzso Here, the influence of the offered carbon source zzso versus zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was studied by precursor acquisition independent from zzso count zzso In comparison to previous zzso studies, a high number of zzso sites zzso located on zzso zzso from 540 unique zzso were zzso thus increasing the number of currently known zzso zzso from 80 to zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso percentage ratio with an unexpectedly high predominance of zzso zzso was zzso zzso in most functional classes (21 out of 26 zzso were identified, suggesting an important regulatory role in zzso zzso Focusing on the central zzso metabolism in response to the offered carbon source, significant changes were zzso The observed complex zzso pattern hints at an important zzso function of protein zzso in control of the central zzso zzso which might particularly operate in channeling carbon flux into the respective zzso zzso
