The binding of zzso to the active site of zzso is thought to zzso among other things, zzso zzso and zzso hydrogen zzso In this study the contribution of these two putative hydrogen bonds to the interaction specificity of zzso was measured for pairs of zzso in which the zzso zzso in question was either intact or replaced by an zzso O zzso The probe zzso investigated comprised zzso zzso zzso zzso transition state analog zzso zzso zzso and zzso affinity labeling agents zzso Michael zzso zzso differences in interaction energies zzso delta zzso or delta delta zzso not equal to) for zzso zzso pairs indicated an apparent specificity energy of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso For the zzso bond delta delta zzso was zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso but close to zero for zzso lacking a zzso zzso These specificity energies are comparable to values reported for other zzso zzso However, the dependence of delta delta zzso for the zzso bond on the presence of a zzso donor suggests that these two hydrogen bonds may interact zzso in zzso zzso A zzso cycle approach was used to relate delta delta zzso to actual hydrogen bond strengths and other aspects of zzso and zzso zzso
