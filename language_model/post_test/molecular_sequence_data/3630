zzso are genetic elements able to capture zzso resistance and other genes and to promote their zzso Here, we have investigated zzso translation of an zzso zzso gene zzso inserted at the zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that translation of this gene was initiated at a zzso zzso which is not part of a plausible translation initiation region zzso A short open reading frame (called zzso overlapping the zzso site was zzso by zzso zzso for its contribution to zzso zzso When zzso and its zzso were deleted en zzso zzso efficiency dropped by over zzso as determined with an zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso of the zzso start zzso of zzso or its putative zzso sequence resulted in a decrease of over zzso whereas the decrease was much less pronounced when the zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso zzso was altered or when the distance between zzso and zzso was zzso This demonstrates that zzso translation is dependent upon the translation of zzso but almost certainly not upon the corresponding zzso These results lead us to conclude that an intrinsic short zzso present in the zzso segment of many class 1 zzso may substantially enhance expression at the zzso level of captured zzso zzso resistance zzso
