This paper describes the use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso tool for the identification of conditional promoters in zzso zzso Random fragments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned upstream of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso library was introduced into an zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and 40,000 clones were zzso The zzso coverage of the library was estimated to be zzso based on zzso insert sequence and restriction analyses of the zzso of randomly selected zzso The library was screened for clones that were capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in media containing up to 10, 100, or 300 zzso g of the competitive zzso inhibitor zzso per zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso revealed that the zzso production level required for growth increased in the presence of increasing zzso of zzso adding a quantitative factor to the primarily qualitative nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso library for clones that could grow only in the presence of zzso M zzso resulted in the identification of eight clones that upon Western zzso analysis showed significantly higher zzso production under zzso conditions than under zzso zzso These results established the effectiveness of the zzso zzso zzso screening method for the identification of promoters on their conditional or zzso zzso
