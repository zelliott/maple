A natural DNA zzso zzso was zzso with a sequence complementary to the translation initiation zzso region of the human zzso zzso and mixed with zzso to form zzso zzso It was found that tumor cell growth was inhibited when zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso complexes or with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into colon tumor cells was compared in the presence and absence of zzso The amount of labeled zzso found in cells that received optimal ratios of zzso to DNA was zzso to zzso higher than the amount found in cells that received zzso DNA zzso Although zzso DNA zzso treatment of zzso cells caused a zzso zzso of cell growth, there was a subsequent rise in target zzso zzso Because the mechanism of growth zzso could not involve an zzso of zzso zzso it was concluded that zzso probably exerts a zzso zzso effect upon the cell zzso producing an enhancement of zzso processing and zzso
