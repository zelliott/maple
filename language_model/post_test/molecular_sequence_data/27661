We have characterized a zzso unit at zzso band zzso that lies at the site of a zzso zzso zzso in T cell acute zzso zzso The zzso gene is structurally altered following a zzso zzso resulting in its head-to-head juxtaposition with the T cell zzso C beta gene and zzso of zzso zzso The predicted protein product of the zzso gene contains a potential zzso DNA binding motif also found in several proteins involved in the control of cellular proliferation and zzso all members of the zzso family, zzso zzso the zzso zzso twist, and zzso zzso and two recently described zzso zzso binding zzso The implication of zzso in cellular transformation suggests that other proteins containing similar DNA binding motifs may also be involved with zzso transformation in various cellular zzso
