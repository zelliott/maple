zzso zzso of zzso electron zzso in some zzso requires a complex chain of zzso zzso zzso that span the inner and outer zzso In zzso species, zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential component for zzso zzso of zzso The exact mechanism of electron transport has not yet been zzso but the arrangement of the zzso chain may have a strong influence on the capability of the zzso zzso to transport zzso The iron zzso of zzso are bound to its zzso chain via zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show the effects of mutating zzso zzso of zzso to zzso on protein expression and zzso zzso using zzso zzso strain zzso as a model zzso Individual zzso to six out of nine zzso zzso in zzso of zzso led to decreased protein zzso However, zzso zzso zzso resulted in various degrees of protein zzso In addition, the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso were tested using zzso and current production in microbial fuel zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso were unable to reduce zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso resulted in various degrees of zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso affect zzso zzso leading to loss of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso to the zzso zzso zzso are less zzso to protein zzso and zzso zzso can zzso
