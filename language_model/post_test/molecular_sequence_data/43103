We have isolated a zzso zzso for zzso zzso A zzso zzso from zzso zzso a Chinese tree that produces the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supplies zzso for the synthesis of the zzso component of zzso as well as for the formation of many other primary and secondary zzso In zzso zzso transcripts were detected only in young zzso and not in zzso zzso of older zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was studied in transgenic tobacco using three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso analysis of plants containing each of the three promoter zzso showed similar zzso and spatial expression zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso of young leaves and zzso particularly in zzso zzso Roots showed intense zzso in the cortical zzso in the zzso zone and light zzso in the zzso of mature zzso zzso expression was also observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of developing flowers, with darkest zzso in the zzso wall, zzso zzso and zzso Leaf discs from plants containing each of the zzso zzso showed a zzso to zzso wound induction of zzso expression over 72 zzso however, this increase in zzso activity was completely suppressed by treatment with zzso zzso Taken together, these data show that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso promoter is sufficient to zzso zzso regulation as well as wound induction and zzso zzso suppression of zzso expression in transgenic zzso
