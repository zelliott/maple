We describe a core gene zzso comprised of eight genes zzso zzso and associated with zzso toxin production in zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 10 putative open reading frames zzso zzso the previously characterized zzso and zzso genes that zzso respectively, the zzso zzso and a dual zzso required for zzso zzso zzso of eight of the genes was zzso induced under zzso conditions and was regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso affected by nitrogen and carbon sources and zzso was also controlled by another zzso zzso zzso previously shown to regulate zzso production and zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso a zzso or the zzso gene yielded zzso that were completely defective in zzso production and zzso expression of the other zzso cluster zzso Similar zzso zzso zzso was observed when the zzso or zzso but not zzso gene was zzso zzso of four zzso located on the two zzso ends of the cluster did not correlate with zzso zzso and did not show regulation by zzso suggesting that the zzso cluster was limited to zzso A zzso zzso and a regulatory network leading to zzso formation are zzso
