A fundamental issue in molecular zzso is to define how zzso interaction differs from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of a zzso of related G zzso receptors that are activated by the hormone zzso or related zzso The zzso of the zzso has recently been shown to be critical for binding zzso but not zzso Using a combination of zzso truncated zzso and zzso zzso individual zzso that provide these zzso binding zzso have now been identified in this zzso Our data establish that a single zzso zzso is critical for zzso binding to the zzso zzso substitution revealed that zzso was required at this locus and could not be zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso binding zzso or zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in defective zzso zzso zzso is zzso at this locus in all members of the zzso zzso hormone zzso family cloned to date, indicative of a fundamental role in zzso zzso In addition to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso form a patch contributing to zzso zzso This study provides molecular insight into the role of the zzso zzso and key differences between zzso and zzso binding zzso
