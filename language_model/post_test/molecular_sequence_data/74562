Many studies have revealed that lineages currently inhabiting formerly zzso areas were pushed into southern glacial zzso and have expanded into their modern range since the last glacial zzso There have been few studies that compare the effects of glacial cycles on lineage diversification and historical demography in closely related species with overlapping zzso In this study we compare zzso structure, historical zzso and approximate lineage age in two closely related and broadly zzso zzso snakes in eastern North America, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using sequences from the zzso gene zzso zzso We zzso three geographic lineages of zzso zzso and two of zzso zzso with no common geographic or zzso pattern of lineage diversification identified for these zzso zzso diversification occurred in the Late zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the Early zzso for zzso zzso ( approximately zzso zzso estimates revealed population expansion following the last glacial maximum zzso 20,000 years zzso in two lineages of zzso zzso (the Central zzso and Eastern zzso and one lineage of zzso zzso (the Continental zzso The Florida zzso of zzso zzso is the only lineage for which constant population size through time was zzso possibly due to stable populations zzso in areas unaffected by glacial zzso Our data suggest that unique habitat preferences may have shaped both the zzso and demographic histories of each zzso
