Cell differentiation is associated either with a complete loss of zzso potential or with a change in growth zzso zzso transformation may result from the zzso of zzso that support growth or from zzso or loss of tumor zzso zzso which are thought to regulate zzso To examine the relationship between tumor zzso genes and cell zzso we chose the gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso and studied its role in a zzso cell line, zzso using zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso to zzso When exposed to nerve growth factor for several days, zzso cells develop long zzso This zzso change follows the transient expression of immediate early genes and is associated with an zzso of zzso Interestingly, if the zzso of zzso was zzso using an zzso zzso technique, the zzso changes were zzso but the other parameters of the nerve growth factor response were zzso Moreover, when zzso expression was inhibited by zzso zzso to zzso in nerve growth zzso cells, the zzso zzso was zzso Our results demonstrate that the gene zzso is involved in a zzso segment of neural differentiation and provide the first direct evidence that a tumor zzso gene plays a role in cell zzso
