zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso colonize roots of the majority of land plants and assist them in the zzso of mineral nutrients in exchange for zzso zzso In the absence of sexual zzso structures and with asexual spore zzso zzso since the zzso zzso may be one of the oldest zzso lineages that rely predominantly on asexual reproduction for gene zzso zzso population structure detected in the majority of AM zzso examined to date supports this zzso However, evidence of zzso found in few local populations suggests that genetic exchanges may be more common in these organisms than is currently zzso To explore the significance of zzso expansion versus genetic zzso in the life history of modern zzso we examined the global population of a cosmopolitan fungus zzso zzso and made zzso about the population structure and the occurrence of zzso in the history of this zzso We sampled eight zzso from 84 zzso We found that although the global population of zzso zzso showed a pattern of significant zzso several zzso had a broad geographic distribution spanning multiple zzso zzso variation among the sampled zzso indicated an overwhelmingly zzso population structure and suggested that zzso expansion plays an important role in the ecological success of modern zzso In contrast, a pattern of zzso consistent with a history of zzso suggested that gene exchanges are not completely absent from the life history of these organisms, although they are likely to be very zzso
