A new member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tentatively named zzso was isolated from mouse brain zzso zzso It is predicted to contain zzso a candidate signal zzso zzso a zzso region with the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso recognition motif zzso zzso a zzso zzso domain, zzso a zzso domain, zzso a zzso zzso domain as a potential zzso domain, and zzso a short zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of its transcripts indicates that zzso is expressed in a zzso manner consistent with the origin of its zzso clone from zzso It is also highly expressed during embryonic development at stages day 11 and zzso Like other zzso zzso specifically activates zzso A when zzso in zzso canine kidney zzso Its ability to activate zzso A is dependent on its zzso activity since a zzso converting zzso to Ala in the zinc binding motif zzso renders zzso inactive against zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso tends to shed from cell surface as soluble zzso thus offering flexibility as both a cell bound and soluble zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these properties serve to distinguish zzso as a versatile zzso playing an important role in zzso zzso zzso events in the brain and during embryonic zzso
