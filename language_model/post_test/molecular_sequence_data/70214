The zzso relationships of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso have been examined in two zzso forms of the zzso In one zzso two zzso in the zzso domain, at positions 108 and zzso were replaced by zzso and in the second zzso in addition, zzso acid 103 was also replaced by zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the three proteins and their degree of zzso by zzso lipids indicate that the zzso are not producing major zzso changes or allowing a deeper degree of penetration of the domain into the zzso The zzso of the three proteins were zzso by determining strengths of zzso and membrane zzso and it was found that the protein with two additional zzso was much less zzso and the one with three additional zzso was much more zzso than the native zzso It appears that small changes in zzso acid zzso which produce no gross changes in the structure of the zzso domain, will nevertheless produce very large changes in the strengths of zzso and zzso These differences in zzso had profound effects on the times required for zzso to reach zzso
