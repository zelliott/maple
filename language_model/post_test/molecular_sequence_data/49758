zzso rod zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso visual zzso zzso Unlike other known zzso that form zzso zzso the rod zzso zzso core is a zzso composed of alpha and beta zzso A system for efficient expression of rod zzso is not zzso zzso to zzso the structural basis for specific zzso of rod zzso we constructed a series of zzso proteins between zzso and zzso which contain the zzso zzso zzso or portions zzso of the rod zzso These zzso were zzso in zzso cells in various combinations as zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was assessed using gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso The composition of formed zzso zzso was analyzed with Western zzso and zzso zzso with the selectivity of zzso zzso in zzso efficient zzso was observed between the zzso regions of zzso and zzso with no significant zzso In addition, zzso was able to form zzso with the cone zzso zzso Furthermore, our analysis indicated that the zzso zzso zzso contain major structural zzso for the affinity and selectivity of zzso of zzso zzso zzso The key zzso selectivity module of zzso has been localized to a small segment within the zzso zzso zzso This study provides tools for the generation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso that will allow us to address the question of functional significance of the unique zzso of rod zzso
