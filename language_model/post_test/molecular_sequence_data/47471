The zzso zzso targets not only normal zzso zzso zzso proteins for degradation when appropriate, but also serves to eliminate zzso proteins from the zzso An understanding of the molecular basis of the interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and target proteins is essential to explain the process in normal cellular function and in zzso zzso is the mouse zzso of the human zzso zzso which can participate in the in zzso degradation of many proteins including zzso We describe the characterization of the mouse zzso gene and the identification of a zzso zzso Four zzso transcripts of approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso observed on Northern zzso are differentiated by their zzso of alternative zzso zzso zzso A single alternative zzso zzso zzso termed zzso was also zzso The zzso zzso by zzso is incapable of forming an zzso in contrast to zzso despite retaining the key zzso zzso essential for zzso zzso formation and the active site consensus sequence that defines the zzso zzso zzso These observations are of particular relevance for analysis of zzso function in zzso as our studies indicate that the targeted deletion of the coding zzso absent in zzso would produce an inactive zzso protein and presents an alternative to disruption of its zzso initiation zzso zzso Furthermore, it suggests that a similar strategy may be zzso to disrupt the function of other zzso zzso in zzso
