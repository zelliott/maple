The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso death signals via the association of its zzso domain with several zzso zzso By screening a zzso zzso library using the zzso zzso cloning technique, we isolated a zzso zzso zzso which specifically interacts with the zzso death domain of zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso shares striking sequence zzso with the zzso zzso protein that is essential for the maintenance of zzso integrity during zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 6, zzso zzso is nearly identical to zzso a protein that interacts with the zzso tumor zzso implicated in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso Howe, zzso zzso zzso zzso Solomon, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso and the zzso zzso which associates with the zzso death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wei, zzso zzso Chang, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso interaction between zzso and zzso was further confirmed in zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppresses zzso activity in zzso cells, a human kidney embryonic zzso cell zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell line, as well as zzso zzso cell line, zzso Furthermore, the dominant negative zzso death domain protein zzso protein blocks the cell death induced by either zzso or zzso zzso these observations highly suggest a role for zzso in zzso zzso cell death signaling zzso presumably through the recruitment of zzso death zzso
