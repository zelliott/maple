We found that a mouse zzso of human DNA zzso delta interacting protein 38, referred to as zzso I in this paper, and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso identified as zzso genes in the heart of mice with juvenile visceral zzso play a role in the regulation of zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso I or zzso increased zzso or fragmented zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells, zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso I or zzso by zzso interference led to an increase in fragmented or zzso zzso in the cells, respectively, suggesting that zzso I and zzso are involved in the processes of zzso fusion and zzso zzso In addition, we showed that the zzso of zzso I resulted in an increase in the number of zzso zzso cells and the zzso of zzso resulted in an enhancement of the sensitivity of the cells to zzso stimulation by zzso The present results demonstrated that these proteins play a role in cell zzso
