The zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA regions zzso regions 1 and 2, zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were amplified by zzso Their zzso sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two zzso regions was zzso Whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso are characterized by a single type of zzso region 1, the zzso show a high degree of zzso in this zzso thus the zzso regions 1 with and without zzso were zzso However, as shown for zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene does not zzso the zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso signal is found downstream from the zzso zzso Based on comparison with zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso processing stem is zzso In zzso zzso one of the three different types of zzso region 1 contains no zzso but displays a 107 zzso zzso that forms a long zzso zzso A similar zzso zzso zzso in zzso was found in zzso zzso and base zzso zzso preserve the ability to form the long zzso zzso Such insertions may zzso to mobile intervening zzso as found in the zzso zzso coding sequences of some zzso zzso The zzso regions 1 and 2 from the three zzso of zzso were zzso and except for the zzso gene and the zzso processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of zzso typing zzso
