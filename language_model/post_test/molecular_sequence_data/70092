Three zzso toxins of zzso toxin 1 zzso produced by zzso coli strains carrying zzso zzso genes that were constructed by zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso They are zzso zzso acid at position 167 from the zzso of the A zzso was replaced by zzso zzso zzso at position 170 from the zzso of the A zzso was replaced by zzso and zzso zzso acid at position 167 and zzso at position 170 were replaced by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso had markedly decreased activities, such as zzso of protein zzso zzso to zzso cells and mouse zzso The decrease in the zzso activities was less than those of the other two zzso zzso Neither additive nor synergistic decreases of the activities were observed in the double zzso zzso in which two zzso acids were zzso zzso double gel diffusion showed that zzso against the zzso zzso gave a line of identity between zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed similar activity to that of zzso zzso in zzso the zzso cell zzso and mouse zzso of zzso The data suggest that these zzso zzso especially zzso and zzso may be candidate zzso that protect against diseases caused by zzso zzso zzso
