The generation of an accessible heat shock promoter in zzso in zzso requires the concerted action of the zzso zzso factor and zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of four zzso and is zzso distinct from the zzso zzso complex, a zzso zzso that also appears to alter zzso zzso We have obtained protein zzso and zzso evidence identifying the 140 zzso zzso of zzso as zzso previously of unknown function but highly related to zzso only in the zzso zzso The zzso protein is localized to the cell nucleus and is expressed throughout zzso development at levels as high as 100,000 zzso The convergence of zzso and genetic studies on zzso and zzso underscores these zzso and their close relatives as key components of independent systems for zzso zzso
