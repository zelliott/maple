zzso zzso are known to have a high zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and chronic zzso sometimes presents a clinical zzso We recently developed a highly sensitive and specific zzso chain reaction capable of detecting zzso copies of zzso zzso genes harboring zzso 12 single base changes in the presence of 300,000 normal zzso zzso zzso genes were detected in DNA zzso from pancreatic juice from all 6 cases of pancreatic zzso and 1 case of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso In 2 of 6 other cases with pancreatic zzso circulating zzso cells were detected in DNA zzso from peripheral zzso zzso zzso genes were not found in pancreatic juice of three control cases zzso zzso and zzso or in the peripheral blood of two patients with zzso zzso conclusions of this study are that there can be significant levels of shed tumor cells in peripheral blood and an even higher number in pancreatic zzso In addition, two different zzso zzso were found in some zzso
