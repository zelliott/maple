zzso B virus zzso budding from infected cells is a tightly regulated process that requires both core and envelope zzso Here we report that zzso uses cellular zzso and zzso possibly in conjunction with zzso to coordinate its assembly and zzso In search of interaction partners of the viral L envelope zzso we previously discovered zzso a putative zzso sorting and trafficking zzso of the zzso protein complex zzso We now demonstrate that the viral core interacts with the same zzso and that disruption of the zzso interactions zzso virus zzso zzso analyses revealed a zzso unknown zzso activity of zzso specified by a zzso zzso which contributes to its interaction with zzso For core, the zzso zzso at position 96, a potential target for zzso was identified to be essential for both zzso and virus zzso The participation of the cellular zzso system in zzso assembly was further suggested by our finding that core interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso partly via its late zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso inactive zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso indicating that protein zzso is functionally involved in virus zzso Additional evidence for a link of zzso assembly to the zzso machinery was provided by zzso studies that demonstrated zzso of core and L with zzso in compartments positive for the late zzso marker zzso Together, these data indicate that an enveloped DNA virus exploits a new zzso zzso together with zzso zzso functions for zzso from zzso
