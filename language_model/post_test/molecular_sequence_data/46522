The zzso zzso zzso is unique in lacking the entire zzso zzso This reduces its secondary structure to a zzso zzso Experimental evidence on the zzso structure has been obtained by chemically probing the zzso of both the bovine and human species in their native zzso and at various stages of zzso A structural model of the bovine zzso is presented based on the results of this chemical zzso on a comparison between nine zzso zzso zzso secondary structures and on analogies with the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso The proposed structure is very similar in shape to that of zzso zzso but is slightly smaller in zzso It is defined by a unique set of zzso zzso zzso considerations suggest that other zzso zzso zzso have smaller dimensions as zzso
