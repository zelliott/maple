The zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein that zzso the addition of a zzso zzso to a zzso in zzso zzso Since zzso forms of zzso proteins require the zzso group for transforming activity, the structure and mechanism of this zzso are important to zzso However, such studies have been difficult to approach because of the low abundance of the zzso in zzso zzso and hence the problems of obtaining large quantities of the zzso We report here the zzso of the two zzso of protein zzso by zzso cells infected with a zzso zzso containing the coding sequences of both zzso This results in the production of zzso quantities of zzso which can be readily zzso by conventional zzso zzso The individual zzso of the zzso can also be expressed in the zzso cells, but the ability to zzso active zzso from extracts containing individual zzso is quite zzso In contrast, the zzso produced by zzso of the two zzso is fully active and retains the properties of the zzso form, including the specificity for the zzso zzso acid of zzso proteins and the ability to bind short peptides encompassing the zzso site of a zzso zzso Furthermore, through atomic zzso analysis of the zzso zzso we have confirmed the previous tentative assignment of protein zzso as a zinc zzso by demonstrating that it contains an essentially zzso amount of zzso The ability to produce and purify zzso quantities of protein zzso readily will allow detailed zzso and structural studies on this zzso
