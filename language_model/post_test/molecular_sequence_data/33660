Twenty years ago, evidence that one gene produces two zzso via protein zzso emerged from structural and expression studies of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso consists of a single open reading frame and contains two independent genetic information for zzso (a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso DNA zzso as an zzso spliced insert in the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso cellular process, in which an intervening zzso termed as the zzso zzso is zzso excised out from a nascent zzso zzso precursor and two zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso are zzso to produce the mature zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that protein zzso is not unique to the zzso precursor and there are many zzso in nature, which implement genetic information editing at protein zzso To zzso its zzso chemical mechanisms, a series of zzso and crystal structural studies has been carried out with the use of various zzso zzso This article summarizes a zzso zzso mechanism for protein zzso that is triggered and terminated solely via zzso zzso with zzso zzso formed within the zzso sites where zzso zzso and zzso are driven by balanced zzso and zzso
