Using a Line zzso zzso type 3 zzso zzso zzso were selected from Brazilian blood zzso The partial zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso regions and the zzso typing region were zzso The E1 region had a zzso acid zzso of only 61 to zzso with the type 1 zzso zzso and 56 to zzso zzso with the type 2 zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso were also found for the zzso zzso region and for zzso Furthermore, the deduced zzso acid sequence of type 3 zzso was used to generate synthetic peptides which were strongly zzso with human zzso zzso which were previously determined as zzso negative, indicating that a zzso zzso response to the zzso protein may zzso
