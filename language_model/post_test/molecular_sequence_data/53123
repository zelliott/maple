We have previously shown that the expression of zzso zzso zzso I) zzso decreases during zzso differentiation induced with zzso zzso zzso and that zzso regulation depends on the zzso promoter that exists zzso of zzso Y zzso Taniguchi et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The regulation of zzso I may be important for the expression of zzso zzso zzso In the present report, we studied the zzso regulation of zzso I gene during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso To zzso the molecular basis of zzso I gene zzso the zzso region containing the zzso promoter of zzso I was isolated and functionally zzso Using a zzso zzso we identified a functional DNA portion that zzso an zzso located at zzso number zzso zzso to zzso within the zzso promoter of zzso I zzso zzso This element contains two sequences similar to zzso zzso and one sequence similar to zzso recognition motifs zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso sites showed that two zzso motifs and one zzso motif are essential for zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso activity is suppressed during zzso cell differentiation induced with zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso sequence may play a critical role in the zzso regulation of the zzso I gene during zzso cell zzso
