The C2 domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso membrane binding of this zzso To identify protein zzso in the C2 domain of zzso essential for its zzso and membrane zzso we selectively zzso zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso of zzso and measured the effects of zzso on its zzso activity, membrane binding zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show differential effects on the membrane binding and zzso of zzso indicating that two calcium zzso bound to the C2 domain have differential zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the calcium binding zzso show that the membrane binding of zzso is largely driven by zzso interactions resulting from the penetration of these zzso into the zzso core of the zzso zzso and zzso are fully inserted into the zzso whereas zzso and zzso are partially zzso Finally, the zzso of four zzso zzso in a zzso zzso have modest and negligible effects on the binding of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso respectively, indicating that they are not directly involved in membrane zzso In conjunction with our previous study on the C2 domain of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that C2 zzso are not only a membrane zzso unit but also a module that triggers membrane penetration of protein and that individual zzso zzso bound to the calcium binding zzso play differential roles in the membrane binding and zzso of their parent zzso
