zzso of zzso zzso I zzso zzso the key zzso for the transport of zzso zzso A zzso compounds into zzso have been developed as agents for treating diabetes zzso Type zzso zzso that the zzso I zzso zzso has effects on overloaded heart muscle, which are associated with an improved function, were unexpected and can be attributed to selective changes in the zzso gene expression of zzso zzso Also, the first clinical trial with zzso in patients with heart failure showed that zzso improved the clinical status and several parameters of heart zzso In view of the action of zzso on gene zzso putative molecular mechanisms involved in an increased expression of zzso the zzso pump of zzso zzso zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso of failing overloaded heart muscle are zzso The first 225 zzso of human, zzso rat and mouse zzso promoter sequence have high zzso Various zzso elements are also given for the promoter of the rat cardiac zzso zzso It is zzso that zzso increases zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso Regarding the possible direct action of zzso on zzso zzso activated zzso alpha zzso zzso it could zzso the expression of various zzso that participate in zzso thereby modulating some effects of zzso 1 zzso Any development of alternative drugs requires a better understanding of the signal pathways involved in the altered gene zzso In particular, signals need to be identified which are altered in overloaded hearts and can selectively be zzso by zzso
