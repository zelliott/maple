A central goal in zzso biology is to understand the origin and maintenance of zzso zzso Over evolutionary time, each zzso contribution to the zzso content of an zzso depends not only on its probability of long-term survival, but also on its propensity to generate zzso that are themselves capable of long-term zzso In this study we investigate which types of genes are likely to generate functional and persistent zzso We demonstrate that genes that have generated zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso more constrained prior to zzso than the genes that failed to leave zzso We further show that zzso genes have been consistently prolific in generating zzso for hundreds of millions of years in these two zzso These findings reveal one way in which gene zzso shapes the content of zzso zzso Our finding that the set of duplicate genes is biased has important implications for zzso zzso
