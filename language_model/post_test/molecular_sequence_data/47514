zzso deposits are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and the prion zzso The zzso zzso isolated from these different diseases share similar structural zzso However, the protein sequences that assemble into these zzso differ substantially from one disease to zzso To probe the relationship between zzso acid sequence and the propensity to form zzso we studied a zzso library of sequences designed de zzso All sequences in the library were designed to share an identical pattern of alternating polar and zzso zzso but the precise identities of these side chains were not constrained and were varied zzso The resulting proteins zzso into large zzso visible by electron zzso as zzso zzso Like natural zzso the de zzso zzso are composed of zzso secondary structure and bind the diagnostic zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso patterning of polar and zzso zzso arranged in alternating zzso can direct protein sequences to form zzso resembling zzso The model zzso zzso assemble and zzso zzso providing a zzso system for both basic studies into the mechanisms of zzso assembly and the development of molecular therapies that interfere with this zzso
