zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso disorder characterized by facial zzso zzso abnormalities and severe zzso zzso CLS had previously been mapped to zzso Recently, zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were shown to be associated with zzso We have tested five unrelated individuals with CLS for zzso in nine zzso of zzso using Single Strand zzso zzso zzso zzso Two patients had the same zzso zzso zzso which causes an zzso to zzso change zzso This zzso falls just outside the zzso zzso site in a highly zzso region of the protein and may lead to structural changes since zzso has an aromatic side chain whereas zzso is a 5 carbon basic zzso zzso The third patient also had a zzso zzso zzso resulting in an zzso to zzso change zzso The fourth patient had a zzso deletion zzso of bases zzso and zzso This creates a zzso that results in a stop zzso 25 zzso acids zzso thereby producing a truncated zzso This deletion also falls within the highly zzso zzso domain of the zzso The fifth patient has a nonsense zzso zzso which results in a premature stop zzso thereby producing a truncated zzso These zzso further confirm zzso as the gene involved in CLS and may help in understanding the structure and function of the zzso
