zzso is a newly identified member of the zzso zzso In humans, zzso signals through a zzso zzso consisting of zzso and zzso To investigate the zzso function of zzso and zzso we isolated a zzso zzso the mouse zzso which has been a missing component of the functional zzso complex for mouse zzso zzso we identified the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso gene by a database zzso The gene consists of about 24 zzso and is split into seven zzso Interestingly, zzso 2 begins with a zzso zzso instead of the consensus zzso although otherwise the overall structure of the mouse zzso gene is zzso similar to its human zzso The gene was mapped to mouse zzso 4 in the region zzso to the human zzso gene zzso In normal mice, zzso zzso is detected at very low levels in restricted zzso such as the zzso liver, and zzso However, upon zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is highly zzso in the liver, in contrast to zzso which is expressed zzso in a variety of zzso Thus, the expression of the functional zzso zzso in the liver is regulated at the gene zzso zzso
