In response to an external source of zzso zzso cells repress the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify necessary components of this zzso zzso we have isolated zzso that are zzso active for zzso These zzso were named zzso (for bypass of repression by zzso zzso is zzso to zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are new genes zzso respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and salvage of zzso are important steps in regulating expression of zzso zzso zzso We have also shown that two other salvage zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in zzso the zzso Finally, using zzso strains affected in zzso zzso or zzso zzso activities, we have shown that zzso needs to be zzso to zzso to exert its regulatory role while reduction of zzso into zzso by zzso zzso is not required for zzso zzso Together these data suggest that zzso or a zzso of zzso is the zzso zzso in the signal zzso zzso
