The spread of infectious diseases and the increase in zzso resistance represent a life-threatening global development that calls for new approaches to control zzso Of all potential targets, the essential and unique zzso of bacterial cell wall zzso targeted by the first known zzso zzso remains a perfect candidate for the development of new zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso exercises its zzso action by targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso unique to bacterial cell wall zzso We show that zzso sequesters cell wall precursors found in the outer leaflet of bacterial plasma zzso zzso II and zzso zzso into stable zzso We propose a model of zzso action for zzso in which the terminal zzso group of zzso targets the zzso groups of the bacterial cell wall zzso where it zzso via a hydrogen zzso The zzso zzso a highly zzso chemical group different from the zzso zzso motif for zzso has no zzso zzso with comparable properties and is unlikely to be susceptible to bacterial adaptations akin to those responsible for resistance to zzso and zzso
