zzso are small zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that are characterized by the presence of eight zzso zzso zzso and by a typical zzso zzso Class I zzso zzso at zzso zzso into highly zzso zzso zzso thereby changing the nature of zzso zzso surfaces become zzso while zzso surfaces become zzso To see whether surface properties of assembled zzso can be changed, 25 zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso were deleted zzso In addition, the zzso domain of zzso zzso was fused to the N zzso of mature zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and surface activity were not affected by these zzso However, zzso properties at the zzso side of the assembled zzso did zzso This was demonstrated by a change in zzso and by enhanced growth of zzso on zzso with zzso zzso or zzso compared to bare Teflon or Teflon coated with zzso Thus, engineered zzso can be used to zzso zzso
