The crystal structure of the zzso activated form of the insulin zzso zzso zzso in complex with a zzso zzso and an zzso analog has been determined at zzso A zzso The zzso loop zzso of the zzso zzso a major zzso change upon zzso of zzso zzso and zzso within the loop, resulting in unrestricted access of zzso and protein zzso to the zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso in stabilizing the zzso of the zzso zzso whereas zzso is completely zzso suggesting an availability for interaction with downstream signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso binds as a short zzso zzso to the zzso end of the zzso with the zzso side chains occupying two zzso pockets on the zzso lobe of the zzso The structure thus reveals the molecular basis for insulin zzso zzso via zzso and provides insights into zzso zzso zzso specificity and the mechanism of zzso
