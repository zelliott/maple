The zzso composition of zzso zzso zzso G protein was identified by using zzso zzso injection into the nucleus of rat portal vein zzso In these cells, we have previously shown that increases in the zzso calcium concentration zzso induced by zzso of zzso zzso receptors were dependent on zzso zzso entry by zzso zzso channels and subsequent zzso zzso release from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso were selectively inhibited by injection of zzso zzso directed against the zzso coding for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso reduction in zzso zzso and zzso protein expression was confirmed by zzso In addition, zzso zzso and synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that only the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in rat portal vein smooth zzso Furthermore, injection of zzso zzso selectively inhibited the zzso zzso increase in zzso We conclude that the zzso signal leading to increases in zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso protein composed of zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso
