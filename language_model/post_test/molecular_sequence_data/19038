A zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a green zzso marine zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that the new strain was affiliated with the class zzso and shared zzso % sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso which is the only zzso named member of the class zzso The strain could be differentiated zzso from the zzso member of the class zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid analysis of cell wall zzso indicated that the novel isolate did not contain zzso acid in the cell zzso The DNA zzso content of the strain was determined to be zzso zzso and the major respiratory zzso was identified as zzso 6 zzso From the distinct zzso position and combination of zzso and zzso zzso the strain is considered to represent a novel zzso in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
