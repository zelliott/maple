The degradation of rat liver zzso zzso has been studied after zzso of suitable expression zzso into zzso cells in zzso A normal rapid rate of degradation zzso about 6 zzso was observed in cells under stable zzso zzso However, the higher zzso levels produced during transient zzso or after amplification with zzso caused the apparent zzso of degradation to increase zzso Analysis of expression in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso with deletions near either end of the zzso zzso coding sequence showed that approximately the first 40 and the last 12 zzso acid zzso are not required to obtain normal zzso zzso When zzso active deletion zzso were examined for effects on zzso zzso degradation in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso short sequences near each end of the protein were found to be necessary for rapid zzso The required sequence near the zzso zzso is located between zzso acids 30 and 40 and includes the highly basic region zzso a potential zzso attachment zzso The other essential sequence zzso is located at the very zzso zzso of the zzso acid chain and is part of an zzso domain rich in zzso and having zzso characteristics zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso a potential zzso zzso II zzso site, is not required for activity or rapid degradation of zzso zzso No correlation was observed between the zzso degradation rates of the various zzso proteins and their heat zzso in zzso
