zzso zzso zzso a number of protein toxins across the outer membrane via the type II zzso system zzso Assembly of the zzso channel zzso zzso into the outer membrane is dependent on the zzso binding domain of zzso In this study, the zzso binding domain zzso family members were divided into a zzso group and a zzso zzso By comparison of their sequence conservation profiles and their representative crystal structures, we found the zzso members to have a highly zzso zzso that is not present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of nine zzso acids of the pocket were constructed in zzso Five of the substitution derivatives showed greatly decreased zzso zzso accompanied by defects in zzso zzso In addition, using in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso we showed that these zzso decreased zzso zzso These results suggest that the highly zzso pocket in zzso is the binding site for its zzso zzso and identify zzso critical for this zzso
