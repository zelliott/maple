A number of zzso factors including the zzso zzso zzso are regulated in a zzso zzso We have previously reported that the functional activity of the zzso is suppressed under zzso conditions and restored in the presence of reducing zzso In the present study, we have used a zzso human zzso fused to the zzso green fluorescent protein and demonstrated that both zzso and zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso is impaired under zzso conditions in living zzso zzso of zzso for zzso within zzso of the human zzso resulted in reduction of sensitivity to zzso treatment, strongly indicating that zzso is one of the target zzso acids for zzso regulation of the zzso Taken together, we may conclude that zzso regulation of nuclear zzso of the zzso constitutes an important mechanism for zzso of zzso signal zzso
