The West zzso green zzso zzso zzso , represent a species zzso Apart from zzso zzso which form at least one separate species, evidence exists for relevant differentiation among zzso zzso We present the results of a zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern, zzso and zzso zzso and molecular study zzso and characterization of a satellite DNA zzso carried out on a number of Central Asian, European and North African zzso For comparative purposes, our molecular analysis was also extended to specimens of three additional zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ), as well as two rare African zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a remarkable zzso and molecular evolutionary stasis in the zzso zzso zzso In fact, all zzso markers showed the same pattern and/or composition in all zzso independently of their origin and zzso zzso Even the zzso zzso were invariably two and located on the zzso regions of two zzso of the sixth pair, or zzso Furthermore, very similar patterns of zzso zzso of a zzso unit of the zzso I satellite DNA family (named zzso were observed in all zzso and zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso with zzso units of zzso I satellite DNA in all species zzso including zzso and zzso which are thought to have separated from zzso as early as in the zzso
