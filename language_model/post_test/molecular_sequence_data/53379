Due to their selectivity towards zzso calcium channels zzso zzso are being exploited as a new class of zzso in pain management and may also have potential application in zzso brain zzso Here, the zzso relationships zzso of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso In addition, the three-dimensional structures of these zzso and some structurally related peptides that form the zzso knot are zzso and the effects of the solution environment on structure zzso The diversity of binding and functional zzso used to measure zzso zzso at the zzso zzso warranted a zzso of the relationship between these zzso With one exception, zzso this analysis revealed a linear correlation between functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso that were tested over three zzso The binding and functional results of several studies are compared in an attempt to identify and distinguish those zzso that are important in zzso function as opposed to those that form part of the structural zzso Further to determining what zzso zzso are important for zzso zzso the range of possible interactions between the zzso and channel are considered and the factors that influence the selectivity of zzso zzso and zzso towards zzso zzso zzso
