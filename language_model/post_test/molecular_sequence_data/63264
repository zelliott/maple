zzso and more particularly zzso zzso that zzso zzso represent one of the most abundant living entities in aquatic and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso has only recently been investigated and so far reveals a cosmopolitan distribution of zzso genetic material (or zzso Here we address this cosmopolitan distribution through the analysis of zzso communities in modern zzso the living representatives of one of the most ancient life forms on zzso On the basis of a comparative zzso analysis of viral communities associated with marine zzso zzso zzso and freshwater zzso zzso II and Rio zzso zzso zzso we show that some zzso zzso are geographically zzso The high percentage of unknown sequences recovered from the three zzso zzso the low percentage similarities with sequences from other environmental viral zzso zzso zzso and microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso and the absence of viral zzso shared among zzso indicate that viruses are genetically unique in these zzso zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso were dominated by zzso DNA zzso that were not detected in any other samples zzso including sea water, fresh water, zzso zzso extreme, zzso and marine microbial zzso Finally, a marine signature was present in the zzso community of the zzso zzso II zzso even though this environment has not been in contact with the ocean for tens of millions of zzso Taken together, these results prove that viruses in modern zzso display zzso zzso and suggest that they may be derived from an ancient zzso
