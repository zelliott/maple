zzso plants acquire significant amounts of nitrogen from zzso The tropical carnivorous plant zzso accumulates zzso fluid containing zzso zzso (AP) in its zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the plant zzso insect protein as a nitrogen zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and characterized from sterile pitcher fluid of several species of zzso however, there is, as of yet, no information about sequence and expression of zzso zzso zzso To identify the pitcher zzso we cloned plant zzso zzso from zzso zzso and examined their zzso Five zzso zzso ( zzso were obtained by reverse zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso designed for the zzso sequences of plant zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences with other plant zzso demonstrated that zzso contained a zzso insert zzso a unique sequence of plant zzso However, zzso did not possess the zzso and had a shorter sequence (by zzso zzso zzso than the other zzso Northern analysis using a part of the coding region of zzso as a probe showed that bands of zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the sizes of zzso zzso were present in roots, zzso leaves, zzso and lower part of the pitchers, but a band of zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the size of zzso zzso was not observed in any zzso In pitchers, highest expressions of zzso were seen in the lower part of open pitchers containing natural zzso suggesting that the expressions of zzso are coupled with prey zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were detected in the zzso zzso where zzso zzso may zzso This result suggests that zzso and zzso are the possible zzso zzso into the pitcher of zzso zzso
