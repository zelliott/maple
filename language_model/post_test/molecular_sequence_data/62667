Memory is thought to be zzso by structural and functional zzso in synaptic zzso But although zzso plasticity requires gene zzso the identity of the proteins involved is largely zzso Using the chick zzso passive avoidance learning paradigm and differential display zzso zzso we identified 13 candidate genes which are zzso in the intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso an area that has been correlated with the initial processing of memory zzso One of the induced genes is a new member of the zzso family, with high zzso to zzso L zzso Analysis of the expression pattern of this gene after training revealed two time waves of zzso the first correlated with learning and initial memory process in the zzso the second correlated with memory consolidation, first in the zzso and then in the zzso zzso There is a correlation between zzso zzso zzso (the malaise zzso in the passive avoidance training zzso the duration of memory and the expression level of zzso zzso While training zzso on low zzso of zzso causes short-term memory and low expression level of zzso zzso high concentration of zzso zzso long-term memory and high expression level of zzso S in the zzso The role of zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression was zzso and it might serve as a key step in long-term memory zzso
