The surface zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coronavirus zzso normally zzso zzso zzso during transport to the cell zzso To determine whether the zzso of the zzso S zzso is required to activate its ability to fuse cellular zzso the zzso recognition sequence in a zzso copy of the S gene was altered from zzso into zzso by site directed zzso The zzso and wild type S genes were expressed by means of zzso zzso viruses and it could be shown that the zzso S protein was not zzso when it was expressed in mouse zzso cells, in contrast to the wild type S zzso Nevertheless, the zzso S protein induced extensive zzso formation in mouse zzso zzso These results clearly indicate that the zzso form of the zzso S protein is able to mediate cell membrane zzso Thus, zzso zzso is not an absolute requirement for its fusion zzso
