In the salvage zzso of zzso free zzso zzso is zzso by zzso to form zzso which is then further converted to zzso in the reaction zzso by zzso zzso We report here the cloning and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed as two transcripts of zzso and zzso base pairs, zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso acids with predicted molecular masses of 111 zzso and 120 zzso zzso Only the longer zzso zzso of zzso was zzso active when expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a protein of 591 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso the reaction product of zzso was identified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The tissue distribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was investigated by quantitative real time zzso which revealed high expression of zzso and zzso zzso in various zzso The wide expression of both zzso can also be observed from the large amount of data collected from a number of expressed sequence tag libraries, which indicate that not only the de zzso zzso alone, but also the salvage pathway, could have a significant role in the synthesis of zzso in the zzso
