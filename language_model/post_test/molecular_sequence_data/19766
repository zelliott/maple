We have previously identified zzso as a gene specific to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a truncated zzso zzso gene transcribed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso to the zzso pocket, and exhibits features compatible with a role as surface zzso Here we show that zzso is physically linked to a zzso of a gene zzso to zzso zzso zzso a gene involved in internal zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso is zzso for zzso zzso with each zzso located on independent zzso II zzso In 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso from distinct geographical origins and different zzso this zzso zzso was zzso The size of the zzso region between zzso and truncated zzso varied among zzso but was similar in zzso of the same geographical area, and this observation may be used in epidemiology to trace the geographical origin of zzso zzso zzso zzso
