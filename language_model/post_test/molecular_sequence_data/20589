The zzso and nuclear protein zzso was first identified in zzso cells from Hodgkin's zzso Despite studies showing its zzso zzso zzso and interaction with several regulatory zzso the functional role of zzso in human cells remains to be zzso Here, we investigated the relationship of zzso with zzso zzso Through zzso zzso we verified the association of zzso with the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso We also found that zzso zzso was able to bind to a zzso zzso probe in zzso mobility shift zzso In a classic zzso test, we showed that zzso can modify the zzso site selection of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Further zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso of enhanced green fluorescent zzso to nuclear bodies involved in zzso processing and or small nuclear zzso zzso depending on the cellular zzso status and its zzso zzso In zzso our findings suggest that zzso is probably involved in cellular events related to zzso functions, such as zzso zzso
