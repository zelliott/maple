zzso zzso are implicated in multiple diseases, but no drugs based on zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso developed to date feature zzso zzso that target the active site zzso which leads to a lack of selectivity and off target zzso zzso secondary zzso binding sites zzso can potentially work as an alternative strategy for drug zzso however, there are only a few reports of potential zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the study presented here, we zzso a series of zzso zzso to probe zzso and 17 interactions with its zzso zzso to identify the structural features that determine zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso of zzso did not directly bind the zzso used in the study but affected the binding zzso most likely because of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso of zzso affected the zzso of the zzso pocket contained within the zzso domain of zzso This suggests that zzso zzso of zzso play a role in zzso specificity and might help explain differences in zzso zzso of zzso and its closest zzso zzso We also addressed the question of which zzso features can affect zzso zzso zzso We found that all zzso zzso tested zzso zzso 12, and 17) significantly decreased activity when the zzso sequence was induced into zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role in determining zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings can help in the discovery of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
