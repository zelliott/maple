Ten different zzso genes from the silk worm, zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso These genes were transcribed in zzso in zzso nuclear extracts from the zzso silk zzso zzso or nuclear extracts derived from the middle silk zzso or zzso zzso Although the zzso levels were much higher in the zzso nuclear zzso the zzso efficiency of the individual genes followed a similar pattern in all the zzso Based on the levels of in zzso transcription, the ten zzso genes could be divided into three groups, zzso those which were transcribed at very high levels zzso clone zzso high to medium levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and low to barely zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso The coding sequences of all these zzso genes being zzso the differential zzso suggested that the zzso sequences zzso their zzso zzso The presence of positive and negative regulatory elements in the zzso zzso regions of these genes was confirmed by zzso competition zzso A positive element was present in the immediate upstream zzso sequences in all the zzso but no consensus sequences zzso to the zzso status could be zzso The presence of negative elements on the other hand was indicated only in some of the genes and therefore may have a role in the differential zzso of these zzso genes in zzso
