Plant cells do not in general process the zzso of transcripts expressed from introduced zzso zzso By studying the processing of model zzso in zzso plant zzso we have investigated the special requirements for zzso recognition by plant zzso Our results indicate that the requirements for zzso recognition in plants are different from those of both zzso and zzso A synthetic zzso of arbitrary sequence but incorporating zzso site consensus sequences and a high proportion of U and A zzso a characteristic feature of plant zzso was efficiently spliced in zzso We have studied the effects of various sequence zzso and conclude that zzso sequences are necessary for zzso zzso In addition, we find that the criteria for branch site selection are relaxed, as they are in zzso but a zzso tract is not zzso
