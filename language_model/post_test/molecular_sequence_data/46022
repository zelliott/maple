The selective mechanisms operating in regulatory regions of bacterial zzso are poorly zzso We have previously shown that, in most bacterial zzso regulatory regions contain high zzso of zzso zzso signals that are significantly above the zzso detected in zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the molecular evolutionary forces that operate in bacterial regulatory regions and how they affect the observed zzso of zzso signals, we have undertaken a comparative analysis across the completely zzso zzso of enteric zzso This analysis detects significant zzso conservation of zzso signal clusters across zzso some times in spite of strong primary sequence zzso This suggests that the conservation of the nature and exact position of specific zzso is not necessarily the priority of selection for maintaining the zzso function in these zzso We have further characterized the structural conservation of the regulatory regions of zzso and zzso across all zzso These two regions differ in zzso and mode of regulation, the regulation of zzso being more complex and involving interactions with several zzso zzso This results in substantially different modes of evolution, with the zzso region appearing to evolve under stronger zzso selection and the zzso region showing the likely effects of stabilizing selection for a complex pattern of gene zzso The higher flexibility of the zzso region is consistent with the observed less conservation of global regulators in zzso zzso of regulatory evolution are also found to be markedly different in zzso bacteria, in a manner consistent with regulatory regions suffering some level of degradation, as has been observed for many other characters in these zzso zzso the mode of evolution of bacterial regulatory regions appears to be highly dependent on both the lifestyle of the zzso and the specific regulatory requirements of different zzso In fact, in many bacteria, the mode of evolution of genes requiring significant zzso zzso in expression levels may follow patterns similar to those operating in the more complex regulatory regions of zzso zzso
