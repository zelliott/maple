Using genetic zzso in zzso zzso we have isolated a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppresses defects that are associated with the loss of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The full-length zzso clone isolated contains an open reading frame of 150 zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The gene appears to be present at single copy and is expressed at approximately equal levels in both zzso and insect forms of the zzso
