The zzso presents the greatest degree of zzso disparity in the zzso zzso with body forms ranging from the symmetrical and zzso zzso zzso to squat zzso and king zzso The zzso of the zzso has been fraught with zzso Recent debate has focused primarily on the phenomenon of zzso the evolution of zzso form from a zzso zzso focused chiefly on derivation of king zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We show by zzso analysis of five nuclear zzso gene sequences that zzso zzso have a single origin, but surprisingly, that almost all other major zzso and body forms within the zzso are derived from within the zzso zzso The zzso form and squat lobster form have each evolved at least twice from separate symmetrical zzso crab zzso In each case, a zzso trend can be zzso via a transition series from the initial symmetrical zzso zzso crab form, through the intermediate squat lobster or zzso zzso crab form, to the final zzso zzso zzso to zzso shell habitation evolved at least twice, once in an exclusively deep-water zzso and once in the common zzso of all other zzso zzso zzso (from which king zzso are zzso These remarkable cases of zzso suggest considerable zzso flexibility within the zzso crab ground plan, with a general tendency toward zzso Rather than having a separate origin from other major zzso zzso zzso have given rise to most other major zzso body zzso
