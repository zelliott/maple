Loss of zzso organization in zzso cell lines has been related to zzso and poor differentiation of zzso We investigated the invasion in zzso of various human colon cancer cell zzso Most cell lines were zzso into chick heart fragments, and this correlated with an zzso zzso Only cell lines zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were invasive and zzso We examined in these cell lines whether zzso was related to changes in the structure and function of the zzso zzso zzso functions as an invasion zzso and as a zzso zzso zzso when linked to the zzso via zzso plus zzso or zzso All zzso cell lines showed zzso linked to these zzso The zzso zzso zzso function in these cell lines was demonstrated by two zzso in zzso It was interesting that all invasive cell lines showed a dysfunctional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were defective in zzso zzso whereas the invasive zzso of zzso and zzso lacked the zzso zzso From zzso zzso zzso cultures with functional zzso complexes, we zzso zzso round cell zzso that were again invasive and expressed no zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso transformations toward a more invasive zzso in zzso cells are associated with zzso of zzso The mechanisms of this transformation and the level of zzso zzso are currently zzso
