zzso zzso belongs to the family of zzso proteins bearing the zzso hand zzso zzso studies in the cerebral zzso have demonstrated that zzso containing zzso include two types of zzso zzso zzso basket and zzso chandelier zzso The present study examines the onset and pattern of zzso zzso expression during the development of rat zzso and zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso with an zzso probe corresponding to rat zzso zzso In animals aged zzso no signal was detected above background in zzso or zzso At zzso a few cortical cells displayed a number of silver grains just above background zzso By zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso were detected almost exclusively in layer V of zzso frontal and zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso was mainly detected in layers IV, V and zzso By zzso there was a marked overall increase in the entire zzso including layer zzso both in the number of cells and in their intensity of zzso Further maturation in the pattern of zzso zzso concentration was observed between zzso and zzso In the zzso low zzso was observed at zzso In subsequent stages both the number of positive cells and the intensity of zzso increased zzso No clear-cut zzso zzso for the expression of zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso expression in the zzso does not follow an zzso zzso consistent with previous zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that the zzso sequence followed by the zzso protein directly reflects zzso abundance and suggest that zzso zzso expression zzso with the functional maturation of cortical zzso
