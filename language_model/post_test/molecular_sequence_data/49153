Recently we discovered a previously zzso gene with the characteristics of a membrane zzso zzso zzso in a fish model, spotted zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso and characteristics of other members of this zzso unknown family of putative zzso from several zzso species, including human, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with highly zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences and similar structures to the spotted zzso zzso The 13 zzso genes identified seem to belong to an unknown gene zzso zzso analysis indicates these zzso comprise three distinct groups (named zzso zzso and zzso within this gene zzso zzso analyses of the translated zzso suggest they zzso membrane proteins with seven zzso zzso The transcript sizes of the human zzso zzso and gamma putative zzso zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso and showed distinct zzso in zzso zzso kidney and zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso and mouse beta proteins produced in an zzso coli expression system demonstrated high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding for zzso Further analysis of binding to the zzso revealed binding was specific for zzso and was zzso with rapid rates of association and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest this is a new family of steroid receptors unrelated to nuclear steroid zzso but instead having characteristics of G zzso zzso
