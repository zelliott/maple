The zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso is an unusual zzso zzso that interacts with a diverse variety of zzso While the zzso has been zzso in zzso little is known of its biology in other zzso In this report, we characterize the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We show that two zzso zzso promoters drive zzso of zzso zzso and that these zzso zzso zzso that differ in their zzso zzso Both promoters are active in adult fish and during embryonic development, but the zzso promoter generates more abundant zzso The zzso of the more abundantly expressed transcript contains several zzso upstream of the main start zzso and these zzso regulate translation of a downstream reporter zzso Comparative sequence analysis shows that upstream zzso zzso are a feature of zzso genes in several other zzso including zzso zzso chicken, zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso The zzso is imprinted in zzso and zzso zzso and this zzso control of zzso abundance was proposed to have evolved following acquisition of an zzso growth factor 2 zzso binding site by the ancestral zzso Our observations suggest that zzso abundance was regulated at translation in ancestral zzso before acquisition of an zzso binding zzso We propose that evolution of zzso at the zzso zzso may have facilitated the loss of negative regulation of translation zzso by zzso
