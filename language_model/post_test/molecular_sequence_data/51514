This article reviews the technical advances in zzso engineering and the clinical applications of these zzso zzso DNA technology zzso the construction and expression of engineered zzso These novel molecules are designed to meet specific zzso Although zzso and zzso cloning have been used widely in the past to isolate the relevant zzso V zzso at present, the zzso cloning is the preferred zzso zzso and zzso expression systems are used commonly for the production of zzso zzso fragments, and zzso fusion zzso A range of zzso zzso with zzso V zzso joined to C regions from human and other species have been produced and found to exhibit the expected binding characteristics and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been developed to minimize the zzso response, and zzso zzso are being used in tumor therapy and zzso Single chain zzso and fusion proteins with zzso zzso zzso to zzso sequences provide a source of zzso molecules with novel zzso The potential applications of minimal recognition units and zzso zzso are zzso zzso libraries produced in zzso present an alternative to zzso for the production of zzso with the desired zzso binding zzso Future developments in this field are discussed zzso
