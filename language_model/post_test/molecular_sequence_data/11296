Transport of zzso in higher plants, as in bacteria and zzso is zzso by two broad classes of transport proteins that operate in the zzso and zzso zzso concentration zzso A search of the zzso zzso zzso database using zzso acid consensus sequences for the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso of zzso coli yielded two zzso sequences for zzso Cloning and sequencing of these genes gave single open reading frames for the putative zzso zzso and zzso with predicted molecular weights of 79 and 88 zzso The predicted gene products showed a high degree of zzso at the zzso acid level zzso zzso and exhibited significant zzso stretches in their zzso halves, consistent with 12 zzso zzso zzso Database searches using zzso and zzso identified 10 additional sequences in zzso as well as additional zzso sequences in the plant species zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and in Homo zzso zzso of zzso rescued growth on low zzso zzso in zzso zzso carrying deletions for the genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was associated with a zzso stimulation of zzso zzso and was sensitive to competition with external zzso but not to zzso zzso indicating that the gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso These and additional results suggest that zzso and zzso belong to a zzso of zzso zzso that have been zzso through zzso
