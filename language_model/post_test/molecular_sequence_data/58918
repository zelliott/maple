The heat shock response is a universal and highly zzso cellular response to zzso We describe here the effect of elevated temperature on the capacity of B cells to present zzso Heat shock markedly affects the ability of these cells to process and present zzso toxin to class zzso T cell zzso zzso of zzso presentation is due neither to a modification of zzso capture nor to a variation of major zzso complex zzso class II zzso synthesis and cell surface zzso zzso and zzso B cells are able to present peptides loaded at the cell surface with the same zzso Nevertheless, heat shock leads to an increase of zzso zzso generation in zzso zzso an enhancement of zzso B activity is also zzso These data suggest that such a stress zzso a failure in the zzso zzso loading onto zzso class II zzso
