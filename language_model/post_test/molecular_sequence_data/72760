zzso zzso zzso zzso is the third member of the zzso zzso family which plays an important role in body fluid zzso To determine a possible role of zzso in regulation of an inner ear fluid, we investigated the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat inner ear using a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso products with sizes expected for zzso and zzso were detected in the inner zzso After cloning and analysis, the sequences for zzso products were identical to those of zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso These results indicate that both zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in the inner ear of the rat and suggest that zzso may play a role in inner ear function (such as regulation of inner ear zzso in an zzso and/or zzso zzso
