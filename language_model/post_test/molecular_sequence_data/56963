The zzso melting of parallel DNA formed by a natural 40 zzso long sequence from zzso zzso zzso that possesses a normal zzso content was studied by using the special method of measuring the zzso of its complex with zzso as well as by conventional zzso zzso zzso allows discrimination of the melting of AT and zzso pairs because its zzso is zzso by zzso G zzso We have observed that about zzso of AT pairs melt at 14 degrees C while the remainder melt at 42 degrees zzso The zzso pairs remain stable up to approximately 40 degrees C and melt at 54 degrees zzso The higher stability of zzso pairs suggests the formation of zzso zzso pairs in parallel zzso
