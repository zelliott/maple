Two zzso zzso zzso and translation zzso zzso zzso as well as two zzso gene regions, zzso zzso of the large zzso and both internal transcribed zzso including the zzso gene region, were evaluated regarding their usefulness for reconstruction of zzso relationships in the zzso species zzso This included analyses of sequence divergence values, zzso of evolutionary rates and the reliability of the zzso zzso Both zzso genes showed greater capacities to resolve at the strain level and between the closely related species of zzso compared with the zzso gene zzso However, to obtain a fully resolved and reliable zzso tree that reflected the biological relationships it was necessary to combine three zzso sequence zzso The novel species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain CBS zzso is described as a result of the application of various molecular approaches to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso gene zzso of genetically divergent strains of zzso zzso as determined by amplified zzso length zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso indicated the presence of two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain CBS zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain CBS zzso which could be distinguished by habitat zzso
