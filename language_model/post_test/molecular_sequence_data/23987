To study the membrane mobility of zzso 7 zzso by cloning zzso zzso zzso cells with expression of zzso in which zzso zzso was fused downstream and in frame to zzso zzso 

The full sequence of zzso was amplified by zzso and then zzso in the downstream of the green fluorescent protein gene in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso into zzso zzso With fluorescent zzso zzso stain and Western zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso The sequence of zzso zzso of the zzso rat was logged into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Identification demonstrated that zzso fusion protein zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso cell line with stable zzso expression was set up successfully for advanced zzso
