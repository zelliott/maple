We have studied the domain structure of the A1 zzso nuclear zzso using both partial zzso and zzso zzso to zzso Both the intact A1 protein and its zzso fragment, the zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso V-8 zzso to produce two zzso of 92 zzso zzso These two zzso zzso to the internal repeat sequence previously noted by us to occur in zzso The two zzso can be zzso via zzso DNA cellulose zzso and independently zzso to zzso indicating that each domain can bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of A1 zzso peptides that had been zzso to zzso acid revealed that 4 zzso zzso zzso 16, 58, zzso and 149 are the sites of zzso zzso formation, with zzso 16 being the major site of zzso These zzso zzso are internally zzso when the repeat sequences in A1 are zzso that is, zzso 16 and 107 occupy analogous positions in the zzso zzso as do zzso 58 and zzso An examination of the primary structures of a variety of zzso zzso proteins with sequence zzso to A1 reveals that the zzso zzso in A1 are highly zzso among all of these zzso Our results provide the first experimental evidence that zzso zzso in the zzso acid repeating zzso shared by A1 and other zzso zzso acid zzso form part of an zzso zzso
