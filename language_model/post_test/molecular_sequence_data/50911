The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has been cloned and zzso Its transcript zzso bases zzso begins with a zzso and is organized in five zzso and four zzso like the other known zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso region suggests that zzso expression of the gene could be regulated through a zzso related to the zzso zzso factor zzso Two potential binding sites for such a factor were found in the first zzso suggesting a possible regulatory role for this zzso Moreover, two potential zzso regions are located at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso from the zzso start zzso These two regions could play an important role in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
