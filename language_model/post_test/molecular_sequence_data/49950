Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed the complete set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains 16 zzso zzso single copies of genes coding for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and two genes coding for each the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A relatively high number of truncated zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso could be detected with almost zzso zzso structures as compared with the functional zzso In addition, a variety of zzso zzso genes could be identified in zzso and other zzso They all belong to the zzso zzso zzso showing significant similarities to zzso sugar zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins all possess six to eight zzso zzso According to the analysis of zzso motifs in these zzso the zzso proteins can be divided into zzso the zzso zzso group zzso only zzso zzso zzso the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso the zzso group of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso group of plant and zzso zzso None of these proteins have been characterized so zzso The analysis of the putative zzso sites of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins led to the suggestion that all these proteins share common zzso sites on either side of the membrane each of which contain a zzso zzso zzso
