The zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso wild type and 10 independent zzso of different zzso have been cloned and zzso The wild type gene has two conservative changes compared to the gene of zzso zzso so that the proteins of the two species are zzso Six different zzso at five different zzso have been found, leading to the following zzso acid changes compared to the wild zzso zzso (three zzso zzso zzso zzso (three zzso zzso zzso A first characterization of the zzso proteins is given, and their implications for models of zzso structure and function are zzso
