zzso of minute virus of mice zzso which express truncated forms of the zzso zzso are known to exhibit a host range zzso replicating zzso in transformed human cells but not in cells from their normal zzso zzso To explore this zzso we generated viruses with translation termination zzso at various positions in the second zzso of zzso In human cells these zzso were viable, but showed a late zzso in progeny zzso release which put them at a selective disadvantage compared to the zzso In zzso cells, however, duplex viral DNA amplification was reduced to zzso of zzso levels and zzso DNA synthesis was zzso These deficiencies could not be attributed to a failure to initiate infection or to a generalized zzso in viral gene zzso since the viral zzso protein zzso was expressed to normal or elevated levels early in zzso In contrast, truncated zzso gene products failed to zzso so that each zzso exhibited a similar zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their subsequent assembly into intact particles were examined in zzso zzso infected cell populations labeled under zzso conditions were analyzed by differential zzso of native or zzso extracts using zzso which zzso between intact particles and isolated zzso zzso These analyses showed that at early times in infection, zzso protein synthesis and stability were normal, but particle assembly was zzso zzso VP proteins were retained in the cell for several hours, but as the zzso material zzso zzso protein synthesis progressively diminished, so that at later times relatively few VP molecules were zzso Thus in zzso infections of mouse cells there is a major primary zzso in the folding or assembly processes required for effective zzso zzso
