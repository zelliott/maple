zzso which have large application potential in the treatment of cancer, are the main active components of genuine medicinal material zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the important zzso zzso in the synthetic zzso of zzso In this study the zzso full length zzso of the zzso zzso was cloned via zzso cloning approach and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full length of the zzso zzso was 1 531 zzso zzso zzso zzso which contained a full 1 zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence exhibited five zzso zzso two of which is zzso of zzso zzso The result of real-time quantitative zzso zzso showed that zzso gene was expressed in different zzso of zzso zzso The expression increased from October to the first zzso period of December, and then zzso The zzso gene expression was higher in leaves but lower in zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of active components zzso B of zzso zzso during different periods indicated that its change trend should be consistent with zzso gene zzso It can be primarily deduced that zzso gene should be an important control point in the synthetic zzso of zzso zzso This study may facilitate the quality of medicinal plants through gene engineering in the zzso
