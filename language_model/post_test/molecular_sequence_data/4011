A molecular typing approach for zzso zzso and zzso coli was developed with restriction zzso length zzso analysis of a zzso zzso portion of the zzso gene zzso zzso Penner zzso reference strains were analyzed with this new zzso zzso and 32 zzso were zzso Eleven additional zzso were obtained from 87 clinical zzso zzso strains zzso This molecular typing method shows a correlation with the Penner zzso zzso method, a zzso typing method based on zzso structures that is often used as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso This strong correlation suggests that the data obtained can be directly compared with zzso data collected in the past by classical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the high percentage of zzso by zzso this molecular typing method results in zzso zzso and provides a superior alternative to zzso
