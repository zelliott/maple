The assignment of zzso zzso in the two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso with Spin Exchange at the Magic zzso spectrum of zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso segment of the zzso zzso in oriented zzso zzso is zzso The majority of the zzso were assigned through comparisons with zzso from selectively zzso labeled zzso peptides and specifically zzso labeled synthetic zzso Some zzso were assigned to specific zzso acid zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso A modification to the conventional zzso pulse sequence that significantly shortens the length of the experiments by combining the intervals for zzso zzso and zzso zzso recovery is zzso
