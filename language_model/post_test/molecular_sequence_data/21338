zzso leaf zzso initiate at the zzso of the shoot zzso zzso and extend zzso by cell division and cell expansion to form the flat zzso but the molecular mechanism of zzso outgrowth remains zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso regulator, in zzso zzso which is required for blade outgrowth and leaf vascular zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and its zzso by the zzso element of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to abortion of blade expansion in the zzso axis and disruption of vein zzso We also show that the classical zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is blocked in zzso formation and stem zzso is caused by deletion of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed at the zzso boundary layer of leaf zzso and zzso organization and outgrowth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not affect formation of lateral leaflets but is critical to their ability to generate a leaf zzso Our data suggest that zzso functions by modulating zzso zzso and zzso directly linked to sugar zzso highlighting the importance of zzso zzso and zzso signals for leaf zzso
