zzso which capture zzso data for subsequent interrogation can be extremely useful for our understanding of zzso zzso zzso in the mass zzso leading to novel hypotheses and zzso understanding of the underlying mechanisms determining zzso fragmentation zzso zzso in turn, can be used to improve database searching zzso for use in automated and unbiased interpretation of zzso product zzso zzso Here, we examine a previously published zzso using our established methods, in order to discover differences in the observation of product zzso of different types, following zzso zzso and zzso zzso either by zzso zzso or the zzso reaction, electron transfer zzso Using a zzso database searching strategy, a large data set of precursor zzso were confidently predicted as zzso sequence matches zzso at either a zzso or zzso zzso false discovery rate, as reported in our previous zzso Using these high quality zzso we have conducted a more detailed and novel analysis of the global trends in observed product zzso zzso in these zzso examining both zzso and zzso zzso We uncovered underlying trends for an increased propensity for the observation of higher members of the zzso series in zzso product zzso zzso in comparison to their zzso zzso Such zzso efforts will prove useful in the generation of new database searching zzso which are well suited to the analysis of zzso product zzso zzso
