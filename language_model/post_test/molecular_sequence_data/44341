The zzso complex factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors form zzso complexes with the serum response factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso signals are relayed via zzso zzso signal zzso pathways through the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso play an essential role in formation of this zzso zzso A 30 zzso acid sequence encompassing the zzso zzso is sufficient to mediate interactions with zzso In this study we have identified zzso acids which are critical for this interaction and derived a molecular model of the zzso binding zzso zzso scanning of the zzso zzso reveals five predominantly zzso zzso which are essential for binding to zzso and for zzso complex formation in zzso and in zzso These zzso acids are predicted to lie on one face of an zzso zzso encompassing the zzso retain biological activity and have zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex formation is disrupted by the introduction of zzso zzso zzso Our results are consistent with a model in which the zzso zzso forms an zzso zzso which presents a zzso face for interaction with zzso We discuss the wider zzso of our results to similar short zzso interaction motifs found in other zzso zzso
