zzso of an zzso template zzso was examined using the zzso zzso and its corresponding zzso zzso under alternating temperature zzso zzso temperatures enhanced the rate of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso products into the two separate zzso templates, reminiscent of the zzso chain zzso Under these conditions, the zzso zzso zzso system was observed to amplify through a mainly zzso process, generating additional copies of the starting zzso template zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso using the zzso under zzso fluctuating conditions will be an intriguing point to consider when explaining the primordial event of chemical zzso
