zzso proteins had been thought to be zzso behind the zzso zzso Recently, however, zzso proteins have been found to be expressed in zzso zzso The zzso basic protein zzso gene is embedded within a larger zzso unit called the zzso zzso This larger gene encodes both the zzso zzso as well as the structurally related zzso In this study, zzso expression in zzso zzso was examined in four different models of zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso Disease in these zzso models was induced by the adoptive transfer of T zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso mouse and the adoptive transfer of T zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In all four models, expression of zzso zzso zzso was increased two- to fivefold in zzso zzso of mice 45 to 60 days zzso zzso analysis indicated that expression occurred principally in zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso and this zzso ability resided within the adherent zzso zzso cell zzso An increase in zzso protein expression within zzso zzso during zzso has implications with regard to zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is the first report describing an increase in target zzso expression within zzso tissue during an zzso zzso
