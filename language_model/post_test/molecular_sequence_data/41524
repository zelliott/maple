zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso growth factor first identified in human zzso zzso zzso zzso protein has been observed to promote bone and cartilage differentiation and to suppress zzso in both in zzso and in zzso zzso Despite these findings, the cell surface receptors of zzso have remained zzso In this study, we observed for the first time that zzso promotes cell adherence in multiple cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, we found that zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso cell focal zzso By utilizing zzso methods, we determined that zzso cell surface binding and enhanced cell attachment were dependent on zzso zzso Finally, we observed that zzso of culture dishes or zzso zzso zzso scaffold with zzso resulted in a significant increase in both cell attachment and zzso zzso Our results identify for the first time a cell surface target of zzso zzso and zzso new functions of zzso in promoting cell adherence and zzso zzso
