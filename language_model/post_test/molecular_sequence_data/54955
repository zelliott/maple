In this study, dengue virus zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso dengue outbreak were genetically zzso The outbreak occurred during the zzso months zzso in a medical college campus in zzso South India in 2009 affecting 76 zzso Analysis of 39 viral zzso positive serum samples by a zzso specific zzso zzso chain reaction identified dengue virus zzso 1 zzso as the zzso zzso zzso of a distinct genetic zzso was revealed in the initial zzso analysis using zzso sequences of a partial zzso zzso zzso protein zzso coding region of 37 outbreak zzso The sequences of these strains clustered with that of the zzso III zzso strains from India, and 32 among them formed a single major zzso zzso sequencing zzso zzso of two strains zzso and zzso selected from this major zzso and subsequent zzso analysis using the full-length coding region sequence showed that the sequences grouped with that of the zzso from Thailand zzso zzso (1993), Singapore (1993), and zzso (2005) among the zzso zzso The sequences of the two strains had a zzso identity of zzso % and an zzso acid identity of zzso % with these closely related zzso zzso zzso acid similarity was shown with the Singapore zzso isolate zzso zzso Four zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso protein coding zzso seen as signature zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in another isolate from Kerala zzso and in the zzso isolate zzso These four zzso also had in common a zzso deletion in the zzso region of the zzso zzso This first report on the complete zzso characterization of zzso zzso from India reveals a dengue outbreak caused by a genetically different viral zzso The results point to the possibility of exotic introduction of these circulating viral strains in the zzso
