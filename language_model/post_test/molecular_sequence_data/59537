zzso forming proteins are known to form zzso zzso that are calculated to be 45 zzso in zzso zzso modeling indicates that the zzso is promoted by zzso zzso interactions between sections of alpha zzso and beta zzso Further zzso involves the formation of zzso in which two zzso are zzso and staggered to two characteristic degrees of zzso Modeling indicated that the degrees of zzso are dictated by the association of sections of alpha zzso in zzso zzso in which zzso side chains are zzso from contact with zzso The staggered arrangement of two zzso produces a zzso having sections of zzso rod in which zzso side chains are exposed to zzso Extension of the zzso to form zzso may be driven by associations with the zzso regions that reduce zzso exposure of the zzso side zzso Exposure of zzso groups may be reduced by the zzso regions folding back upon themselves so that the entire zzso becomes a zzso zzso This prediction is in line with electron microscope data showing that zzso of the lower zzso contain rods of uniform thickness ranging zzso from 45 zzso in a series having incremental increases in zzso Data from previous chemical zzso studies support this model and also the idea that the completed intermediate filaments each consist of seven zzso zzso
