The structure of an artificial pulmonary zzso was studied by scanning zzso and zzso light zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein C zzso prepared at the zzso interface of a zzso film balance and zzso by zzso under various states of zzso In order to zzso their topography by zzso the films were transferred onto a solid mica support by the zzso zzso zzso We found that a region of high film zzso of the spread zzso close to its equilibrium surface pressure zzso zzso 50 zzso was due to the exclusion of layered zzso with each layer zzso to zzso zzso zzso They remained associated with the zzso and readily zzso upon expansion of the zzso zzso with the zzso showed that the zzso contained the protein in high zzso The more the film was zzso the larger was the number of layers on top of each zzso The zzso arose from regions of the zzso with a distinct zzso that may have been responsible for their zzso The molecular architecture of the zzso remains to be zzso although some of it can be zzso from zzso data in combination with the zzso topographical zzso We illustrate our current understanding of the film structure with a molecular zzso
