A rabbit zzso zzso inhibitor in inflammatory zzso zzso cells was zzso to apparent zzso This inhibitor was extracted from zzso cells of the 24-hr stage of zzso zzso inflammation and zzso using zzso zzso gel zzso followed in this order by zzso liquid zzso zzso steps with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso factor showed a single band on zzso zzso This zzso of zzso 19,000 and zzso zzso inhibited the binding of both zzso alpha and beta to receptors on a zzso cell line, zzso and a zzso line, zzso We determined its primary structure by a combination of zzso chemistry and molecular zzso The inhibitor was zzso as a precursor composed of 177 zzso acids and was processed to a mature zzso of 143 zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid of the mature inhibitor was zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the inhibitor showed a zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and essentially the same mode of action as seen with human zzso We consider that this inhibitor is a rabbit counterpart of human zzso although there are differences with respect to the molecular zzso the zzso of the mature rabbit zzso at a position of nine zzso acids downstream from that of human zzso
