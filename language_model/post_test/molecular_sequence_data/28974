Members of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso tail zzso family bind zzso protein and zzso with high affinity and regulate gene zzso Gene knockout studies indicate that zzso is required for neural crest and neural tube development and that it functions as a zzso for zzso factor zzso zzso Here we describe human zzso a new member of this family, which is zzso by a single zzso mapping to zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein are present in zzso naturally occurring complexes, indicating that they interact zzso The interaction occurs between the zzso domain 1 of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso In keeping with this, zzso functions as a zzso when artificially targeted to a promoter zzso zzso physically interacts with all zzso zzso in zzso and strongly zzso all zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso and zzso zzso of zzso In zzso cells, zzso is significantly weaker than zzso for zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may function as a zzso for zzso They also suggest the existence of cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso which may result in differential zzso of zzso zzso
