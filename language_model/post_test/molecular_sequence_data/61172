We have cloned and characterized the zzso structure of the mouse gene for zzso zzso that is mapped to zzso zzso The gene is about 92 zzso in size and contains 15 zzso All zzso junction sequences conform to the zzso zzso zzso with the presumed domain structures of the mouse zzso zzso indicates that the zzso domain of the zzso is zzso by zzso zzso whereas the zzso domain is zzso by zzso 1-3 and zzso The zzso zzso zzso are zzso by two zzso zzso on zzso 13 and zzso and zzso on zzso zzso The zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso gene has structural features found in zzso gene zzso including a zzso segment and an absence of zzso and zzso zzso A primer extension zzso showed the presence of multiple sites for the initiation of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso region of the gene can direct efficient expression in zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the downstream zzso pair sequence of the region is required for promoter activity in the zzso
