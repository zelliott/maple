The human Tap protein has been proposed to mediate Mason Pfizer monkey virus zzso transport element zzso nuclear zzso export and may also play a role in global zzso zzso Here, we have used in zzso zzso in both zzso and human cells, together with in zzso zzso to further characterize the zzso binding properties of zzso which has been proposed to contain a novel zzso zzso binding zzso Using the zzso three hybrid zzso we selected zzso molecules that retain Tap binding activity from a pool of zzso zzso zzso The recovered zzso sequences differed only minimally from the zzso zzso yet all displayed lower affinity for Tap both in zzso and in zzso Analysis of the zzso export activity of the recovered zzso zzso revealed that Tap affinity was highly zzso of zzso biological zzso Together, these observations provide additional evidence supporting the identification of Tap as the direct zzso for zzso function and demonstrate that zzso binding by Tap is highly sequence zzso
