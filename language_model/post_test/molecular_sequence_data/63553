zzso modification in zzso is one of the key control points in gene regulation in zzso zzso zzso complexes composed of zzso zzso or zzso zzso repeat zzso and many other components have been implicated in this zzso Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of zzso a zzso protein crucial for repression of genes associated with zzso stress tolerance through zzso zzso in zzso zzso shares high sequence similarity with human zzso like protein zzso a component of a zzso protein complex involved in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene renders zzso plants hypersensitive to freezing zzso zzso is localized in the nucleus and specifically interacts with zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso is higher in the zzso zzso than in zzso zzso Moreover, the stress zzso zzso promoter is zzso and associated with a substantially higher level of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso under cold stress zzso Our results suggest a critical role for gene zzso by zzso zzso in plant zzso and tolerance to cold zzso
