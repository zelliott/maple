The activity, tissue specificity and zzso expression of the tandem promoter region preceding a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso a 19 zzso zzso zzso were tested in transgenic zzso zzso To simplify the analysis, the tandem promoter as well as each of the two separate promoter regions were fused to the zzso zzso reporter zzso All of the three zzso directed the synthesis of zzso in the zzso of transformed seeds indicating that both separate promoters are independently activated and show the same tissue and cell type specificity observed for zzso genes in zzso The zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso activity are not coordinated with those of zzso zzso seed storage proteins during the development of transformed zzso zzso we detected high levels of zzso activity in zzso of transformed zzso plants for all three zzso This appears to reflect the expression pattern of zzso genes in zzso since we detect zzso transcripts in zzso Finally, we discuss the possible origin and function of the tandem promoter arrangement on the basis of these zzso
