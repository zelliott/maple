Several strains of zzso bacteria containing zzso zzso zzso were isolated from soil samples and identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso and characterized from one of the isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso showed higher zzso stability than the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The seven zzso zzso zzso genes zzso of zzso were cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso All eight zzso acid sequences of zzso gene products had significant zzso regions containing zzso zzso which were previously suggested to be involved in an active site of the zzso To probe the zzso zzso three zzso zzso in the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso were replaced with zzso by zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso play important roles in the zzso zzso
