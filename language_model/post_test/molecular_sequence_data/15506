A novel, zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from the abdominal zzso of a sea cucumber, zzso zzso collected from seawater off the coast of zzso According to zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, this strain represents a novel, zzso lineage within the class zzso and clusters with zzso bacteria and zzso zzso Compared to species with zzso published names, the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso was to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that strain zzso represents a distinct zzso lineage related closely to the zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the major zzso whilst 17 : 0, 17 : zzso 15 : 0 and 16 : 0 were the major cellular fatty zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso was composed of zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid, zzso and zzso acid (1 : 2 : zzso The zzso zzso detected were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso From the zzso data obtained in this study, the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the zzso with type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso is also proposed for the distinct zzso line represented by the zzso zzso
