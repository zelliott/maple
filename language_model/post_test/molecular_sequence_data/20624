We have observed that zzso cell lines zzso zzso contain approximately 10 times the levels of zzso zzso as human cell lines, yet the sensitivity to zzso zzso the folate zzso that targets this zzso is zzso Our previous studies showed that zzso zzso protein levels increased after zzso exposure, and we proposed that this increase was due to the relief of feedback zzso of translation as a consequence of zzso binding to zzso zzso In the current report, we show that unlike what was observed in human cells, zzso zzso zzso levels do not increase in zzso cells after zzso zzso We provide evidence to show that although there are differences in the putative zzso structure between zzso and human zzso in the zzso zzso binding region previously identified, zzso of this region in human zzso zzso zzso did not change the level of the zzso or its induction by zzso Further experiments showed that human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and that it is the difference between the zzso and human zzso zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso that determines the response to zzso zzso We also present evidence to suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso in tumor cells is an zzso mechanism that decreases sensitivity to this zzso
