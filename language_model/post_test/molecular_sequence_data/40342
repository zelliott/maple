A zzso gene zzso zzso an zzso zzso was isolated from zzso soil and expressed in zzso zzso The gene contained a zzso reading frame and zzso a zzso zzso zzso The mature part of the zzso was expressed with an zzso zzso tag in zzso coli zzso zzso and characterized zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso combines the properties of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso characterized so zzso Its optimum pH and temperature for zzso activity was pH zzso and zzso zzso The zzso showed high preference for short chain zzso zzso zzso for zzso fatty acid zzso and surprisingly it also displayed high activity for zzso fatty zzso The deduced zzso zzso protein is probably from zzso and is organized as a zzso and belongs to the zzso zzso zzso
