zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso synthesis zzso The zzso promoter was cloned from zzso zzso zzso and fused to the reporter gene zzso zzso zzso the complex expression patterns directed by the zzso promoter were then characterized in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The promoter zzso and zzso zzso conducted on zzso indicated that the zzso to zzso zzso region supports zzso expression in the zzso and petals and the deletion of the zzso to zzso zzso region resulted in the loss of tissue specificity and a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso mobility shift zzso testified that an zzso and zzso element zzso to zzso zzso and an zzso zzso element zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso promoter would have functions for the complex expression profiling and efficient zzso zzso zzso These results further clarify the mode of the regulatory expression of class II zzso promoters in higher zzso
