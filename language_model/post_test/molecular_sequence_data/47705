zzso is a zzso protein originally identified as an intermediate filament zzso protein because of its zzso and zzso with the IF proteins zzso and zzso in muscle zzso Our sequencing studies have shown that zzso is an unusually large member zzso zzso zzso zzso of the IF protein zzso with the majority of the zzso consisting of a long zzso tail zzso zzso interaction studies demonstrate that zzso zzso interacts with zzso the major IF protein in mature muscle cells, and with zzso an integral zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expressed zzso rod and tail zzso zzso respectively, with zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso protein expression in zzso zzso lines reveals that zzso is zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells but is absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso requires the presence of another IF zzso such as zzso in order to assemble into zzso Taken in zzso our results suggest zzso functions as a component of zzso zzso and plays an important zzso zzso role by linking these zzso to other components of the zzso zzso in zzso muscle cells may enable these zzso to help link zzso of adjacent zzso and, zzso play an important role in zzso zzso
