zzso expression zzso carrying the small hairpin zzso zzso for zzso zzso were constructed, and the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso were zzso Two zzso expression zzso containing small hairpin structure targeting zzso named zzso and zzso were designed and zzso The plasmids were zzso into zzso immortalized zzso zzso cell line by zzso The changes in the zzso zzso and protein expression were observed by zzso and Western zzso after 48 zzso zzso zzso were divided into four groups: control group, zzso treatment group, zzso zzso zzso group, and zzso zzso negative control zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso and proteins was detected by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso was measured by flow zzso The results showed that the expression of zzso zzso and protein was decreased in the zzso when zzso with zzso and zzso The expression of zzso was increased, and that of zzso was decreased at protein and zzso levels in the zzso after treated with zzso for 48 zzso These changes was attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso could effectively decrease the zzso zzso of zzso It was concluded that zzso may play an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene could effectively prevent the zzso from zzso induced by zzso
