The zzso protein is an zzso protein zzso that is required for zzso at the silent zzso zzso zzso and the zzso DNA zzso zzso in the zzso salvage gene zzso weaken all three forms of zzso and also cause a reduction in the zzso zzso zzso We now show that zzso of a highly zzso zzso zzso in zzso results in a zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso activity is required for zzso zzso of another zzso salvage zzso gene called zzso caused a less severe zzso zzso and did not significantly reduce the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso in the absence of zzso was completely dependent on the import of zzso acid from the growth zzso zzso of a gene in the de zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso zzso zzso only on medium deficient in zzso acid, an zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized throughout the whole cell in an zzso growing zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was highly concentrated in the nucleus in approximately zzso of the cells, indicating that zzso salvage occurs in the nucleus in a significant fraction of zzso We propose a model in which two components of the zzso salvage pathway, zzso and zzso function together in recycling the nuclear zzso generated by zzso zzso activity back into zzso
