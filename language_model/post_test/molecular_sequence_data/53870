In order to characterize the Major zzso complex zzso class II A genes of the channel zzso zzso zzso a zzso library was screened and zzso was zzso Four different full-length zzso sequences for zzso class II A genes were obtained from a zzso B cell line derived from an zzso zzso Two different zzso sequences and corresponding zzso were obtained from a presumably zzso zzso zzso The A genes have five zzso and four phase one zzso The first zzso encodes the zzso untranslated region zzso and leader zzso the second and third zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The connecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as part of the 3' zzso are zzso by the fourth zzso and the rest of the 3' zzso is zzso by the fifth zzso Southern zzso analyses using an zzso three probe revealed two to four zzso fragments with considerable restriction zzso length zzso evident among randomly selected zzso channel zzso These findings are consistent with the presence of at least two functional zzso zzso class II A gene zzso An unusual aspect of the channel zzso zzso class II alpha chain is its lack of zzso zzso zzso
