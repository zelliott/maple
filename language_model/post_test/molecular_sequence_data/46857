zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been used to determine the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso This zzso has little persistent three-dimensional structure in solution, but when bound to zzso of zzso zzso it adopts a predominantly zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso has been determined by using zzso zzso the structure derived from zzso distance constraints and restrained molecular dynamics is largely zzso The derived zzso and zzso angle order parameters show that the zzso structure is well defined but with some flexibility that causes the structures not to be zzso over the full zzso zzso zzso exchange experiments suggest that many zzso zzso groups are readily accessible to the zzso but those associated with zzso zzso exchange more slowly, and this zzso is thus likely to be positioned on the surface of the zzso zzso In this zzso the zzso has one zzso face and two that are rich in basic zzso acid side zzso The zzso face of the zzso contains zzso previously shown to be involved in binding to the LDL zzso
