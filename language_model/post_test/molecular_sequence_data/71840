zzso zzso muscular zzso type zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso muscular dystrophy, are both caused by zzso in the recently cloned gene zzso gene symbol zzso Two large zzso have been described which have both types of patient in the same zzso Moreover, in both zzso zzso and zzso patients are zzso for zzso of the critical zzso This suggested that the same zzso in the same gene would lead to both zzso or zzso in these families and that additional factors were needed to explain the development of the different clinical zzso In the present paper we show that in one of these families zzso of zzso is changed to an zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso patients in this zzso are zzso for this zzso as are four additional patients from two previously unpublished zzso zzso analyses suggest a common origin of the zzso in all the zzso On western blots of muscle, zzso and zzso patients show a similar abundance in zzso zzso of 15 and zzso zzso zzso tissue sections show that zzso zzso to the zzso while tissue sections from zzso and zzso patients show minimal zzso which is indistinguishable between the two zzso These findings emphasize the role for the zzso gene as being responsible for both zzso and zzso but that the distinction between these two clinical zzso requires the identification of additional zzso such as modifier zzso
