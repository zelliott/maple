Relatively little is known about the mechanisms through which gene expression regulation zzso To investigate this, we systematically explored the conservation of regulatory networks in zzso by examining the zzso elements that govern the expression of zzso zzso We first identified groups of zzso zzso zzso genes enriched for genes with known upstream or downstream zzso zzso zzso that many of these gene groups are zzso in related species as well, we performed similar analyses on zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes in 13 other zzso zzso We find that many zzso gene groups are enriched for the same zzso regulatory sequences as those found in the zzso gene groups zzso zzso indicating that those regulatory systems have been zzso in multiple zzso zzso In addition to these clear cases of regulatory zzso we find examples of zzso evolution that suggest multiple modes of regulatory diversification, including zzso in zzso zzso zzso incorporation of new gene targets into an existing regulatory system, and zzso of regulatory systems to control a different set of zzso We investigated one example in greater detail by measuring the in zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and its zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the DNA binding specificity of these proteins has zzso with the sequences found upstream of the zzso target genes and suggest that zzso has a different function in zzso zzso
