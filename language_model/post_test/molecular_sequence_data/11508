The gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was cloned by using a simple zzso plate activity zzso zzso of the cloned gene results in the production of a zzso protein which has an apparent zzso molecular weight of 55,000 and is responsible for the major zzso zzso activity in culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso A DNA sequence analysis revealed a potential zzso region of the size expected to zzso the observed zzso which contained a sequence that exhibited significant zzso around a putative active site zzso zzso observed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso protein was a predicted signal zzso of 36 zzso acids followed by a zzso which could be zzso removed from a zzso Tap zzso The zzso start site for the gene was mapped by primer zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso lacking zzso Tap activity were able to grow and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that DNA zzso of the tap gene are present in most of the zzso strains zzso
