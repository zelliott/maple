To identify zzso that control the interactions between zzso chains and zzso zzso sequence comparisons were made between zzso class I zzso molecules with high zzso zzso and low zzso zzso affinities for beta zzso A single zzso at position 9 was evaluated for its contribution to the stability of the zzso zzso of the zzso acid at position 9 of zzso to zzso as is found in zzso and zzso resulted in both qualitative and quantitative effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In in zzso translation and assembly studies, the zzso zzso resulted in a more stable association of beta zzso with the heavy chain after zzso with the alpha 2 zzso zzso zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso L cells had similar surface expression compared with zzso despite exhibiting a slower rate of zzso However, cells expressing zzso were unable to present zzso zzso to a specific T cell zzso zzso in zzso cells, which are defective in zzso zzso zzso was expressed at higher levels than zzso and was stabilized more efficiently by the addition of zzso human beta zzso Thus, zzso acid position 9 not only plays an important role in the interaction of the zzso zzso with the beta zzso it also zzso and zzso influences zzso binding and zzso zzso
