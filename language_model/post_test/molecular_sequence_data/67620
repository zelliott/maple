zzso zzso zzso are known to regulate zzso sodium channels zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso showed that the zzso domain of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso can directly bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Similar zzso demonstrated various zzso can bind strongly to a native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso or not at all to a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso also showed that zzso redistributes from the zzso membrane to the zzso after zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso calcium zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies revealed zzso and zzso in close proximity in zzso cells when zzso activity and zzso calcium zzso are zzso zzso current zzso from zzso zzso cells treated with zzso and single-channel zzso studies of zzso zzso cells treated with a zzso inhibitor altered zzso zzso activity, which suggest an essential role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
