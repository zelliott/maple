Three zzso distinct DNA zzso activities have been identified in zzso cell zzso We have recently zzso DNA zzso II and DNA zzso III to near zzso from bovine liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing studies indicated that these zzso are zzso by the same zzso In the present study, human and zzso zzso clones zzso DNA zzso III were isolated with zzso based on the zzso zzso The human DNA zzso III zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso whose sequence is more closely related to those of the DNA zzso zzso by zzso than to zzso DNA zzso such as human DNA zzso zzso In zzso zzso and translation of the zzso produced a zzso active DNA zzso similar in size and zzso specificity to the zzso bovine zzso The DNA zzso III gene was localized to human zzso 17, which eliminated this gene as a candidate for the zzso disease Bloom syndrome that is associated with DNA joining zzso DNA zzso III is zzso expressed at low levels, except in the zzso in which the zzso levels of DNA zzso III zzso are at least zzso higher than those detected in other zzso and zzso Since DNA zzso I zzso is also present at high levels in the zzso we examined the expression of the DNA zzso genes during zzso DNA zzso I zzso expression correlated with the contribution of zzso zzso cells to the zzso in agreement with the previously defined role of this zzso in DNA zzso In contrast, elevated levels of DNA zzso III zzso were observed in primary zzso undergoing zzso prior to the first zzso zzso zzso we suggest that DNA zzso III seals DNA strand breaks that arise during the process of zzso zzso in germ cells and as a consequence of DNA damage in zzso zzso
