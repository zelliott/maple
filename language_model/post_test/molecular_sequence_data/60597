The molecular mechanisms underlying the targeting and zzso of zzso receptors at zzso sites is poorly zzso Recently, we have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso which specifically binds to the C zzso of zzso zzso zzso and may be involved in the synaptic targeting of these zzso Here, we report the cloning of zzso a zzso of zzso and the characterization of the zzso and zzso proteins in the rat zzso zzso and zzso are approximately 130 zzso proteins that are highly enriched in zzso zzso and zzso are widely expressed in brain, with the highest levels found in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso and zzso are enriched in synaptic plasma membrane and zzso density zzso zzso is expressed early in embryonic development before the expression of zzso receptors and zzso in expression at zzso day zzso In contrast, zzso is expressed relatively late in development and parallels the expression of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is expressed in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso and zzso zzso studies showed that zzso was enriched in zzso spines near the zzso density and was expressed in zzso shafts and in zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso appeared to be clustered at both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso binding proteins potentially involved in the targeting of zzso receptors to zzso zzso also may play functional roles at both zzso and zzso zzso as well as in early zzso zzso
