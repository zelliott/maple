zzso of the zzso model zzso zzso zzso were zzso by solid phase zzso synthesis using the zzso method for parallel zzso zzso The affinity of the peptides as zzso to the zzso zzso in rat cerebral zzso was zzso The model compound zzso zzso was a relatively poor zzso to the zzso zzso in rat brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were both important for zzso recognition by the zzso zzso zzso in several positions in the region corresponding to the zzso part of zzso resulted in zzso with only minor reduction of the affinity for the zzso zzso
