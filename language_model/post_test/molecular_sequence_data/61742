zzso zzso a database for full-length zzso from the human malaria zzso zzso zzso has been updated in at least three zzso zzso We added zzso sequences generated from the addition of new libraries, so that our collection of zzso full-length zzso covers zzso zzso of the estimated number of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso All of our full-length zzso and zzso zzso sequences were mapped to zzso sequences together with publicly available zzso genes and other zzso This precisely determined the gene structures and positions of the zzso start sites, which are indispensable for the identification of the promoter zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso sequences were newly generated from zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences were compared at both zzso and zzso acid levels, with those of zzso and the sequence alignment for each gene is presented zzso This part of the database serves as a versatile platform to zzso the zzso of malaria genes by a comparative zzso zzso It should also be noted that all of the zzso represented in this database are supported by physical zzso zzso which are publicly and freely available, and should serve as indispensable resources to explore functional analyses of malaria zzso
