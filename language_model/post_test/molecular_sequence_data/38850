Using a combination of zzso exchange and zzso zzso we have zzso the general zzso initiation factor zzso to near zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso the zzso box binding zzso and 14 distinct zzso factors zzso which range in size from 17 to 150 zzso Twelve of the zzso zzso have been previously identified, but two, zzso and zzso are zzso zzso exhibits significant sequence similarity to the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso human zzso and human zzso and is zzso by a previously identified gene zzso zzso shows no significant sequence zzso to any previously identified zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso are single copy and essential for normal zzso cell zzso Furthermore, neither zzso nor zzso are associated with the zzso zzso zzso complex or other zzso zzso zzso The significance of these results in terms of zzso structure, function, and organization is zzso
