The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been isolated and its expression has been zzso In contrast to several zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene contains a single zzso and is transcribed into a single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso reveals extensive transcript zzso in zzso nurse cells and a heavy maternal contribution to the early zzso zzso zzso discs are enriched with zzso transcripts relative to other zzso zzso further suggesting a possible relationship between high zzso expression and zzso zzso The zzso region contains several well-known regulatory elements including metal response, zzso response, and zzso response elements zzso zzso and zzso respectively), sites for zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator binding element factor zzso as well as classic zzso and zzso zzso That zzso expression in zzso is regulated in part by the zzso factor zzso via the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso is suggested by experiments which show that a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rolled gene substantially reduces levels of zzso transcripts and zzso with reduced resistance to zzso stress in rolled zzso
