The zzso reductive zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso A solution of zzso (Mr zzso zzso zzso in zzso buffer zzso zzso was incubated in the presence of zzso for 24 h at 37 degrees C under an oxygen atmosphere to yield zzso zzso zzso zzso an average Mr of zzso The zzso fragments contain 21 and zzso less zzso and zzso acid, respectively, but no zzso zzso They were zzso zzso with zzso zzso The resulting zzso and zzso were separated by gel zzso and zzso zzso and their structures were determined by zzso and zzso zzso fast atom zzso mass zzso and zzso techniques combined with chemical zzso The following structures derived from the reducing ends of the zzso fragments were zzso zzso zzso zzso acid (where zzso represents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso The following structures derived from the zzso ends were zzso zzso (a tentative structure, zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso reaction of zzso proceeds essentially by random destruction of unit zzso due to zzso free zzso followed by secondary zzso zzso of the resulting unstable zzso zzso
