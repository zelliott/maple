zzso C virus zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is involved both in the viral replication and particle zzso Its third domain zzso although not absolutely required for zzso is a key zzso for the production and assembly of novel zzso zzso As a prerequisite to zzso the precise functions of this domain, we report here the first molecular characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is mostly zzso but that short structural elements may exist at its zzso zzso zzso zzso circular zzso and finally zzso zzso all point out the zzso unfolded nature of zzso zzso zzso This lack of stable folding is thought to be essential for primary interactions of zzso domain with other viral or host zzso which could stabilize some specific zzso zzso new functional zzso
