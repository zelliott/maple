Following massive small zzso zzso zzso the remnant zzso zzso an zzso process characterized by increases in a number of zzso and zzso zzso These changes are the result of a stimulus that increases zzso cell zzso and zzso cellular progression along the zzso zzso To better define this process, we identified patterns of gene expression specifically within adapting zzso zzso cells following zzso 

zzso capture zzso was used to isolate mouse zzso zzso cells following zzso or sham zzso Multiple biological and technical complementary DNA zzso replicates allowed rigorous statistical analyses for identification of important expression zzso Major groups of genes were classified as to site of action, functional pathway, and possible regulatory zzso 

A total of 300 genes zzso expressed at significant levels within adapting zzso zzso were zzso zzso of this list of zzso expressed adapting zzso cell genes with a generalized mouse gene expression database (from 82 developing and adult mouse zzso showed the greatest overlap with developing and immature zzso zzso We identified prominent groups of genes involved with cell growth, signal zzso and zzso acid zzso Genes not previously shown to be involved with adaptation or development and maturation were zzso 

Identification of similar genes zzso regulated during both adaptation and development, processes that share key zzso features, provides a basis for new zzso insights into these shared zzso
