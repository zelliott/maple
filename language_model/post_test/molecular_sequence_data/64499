The X-ray crystal structures of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been determined to high zzso These zzso exhibit zzso sequence identity, yet their activities depend on different transition metals, zzso and zzso zzso The structures allow the origins of metal zzso selectivity and aspects of the molecular mechanism to be examined in zzso The zzso zzso belong to the type I family of zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso each zzso has four zzso zzso forming two structurally zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso metal is located in the zzso barrel and is zzso by two equatorial zzso zzso and zzso one zzso zzso zzso and two to three water zzso The first and second coordination spheres of these zzso are virtually identical zzso mean square difference over all zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the metal selectivity must be due to changes at a significant distance from the metal and/or changes that occur during zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the metal zzso at sites trans to the two zzso zzso and interacts with a unique, mobile zzso zzso The loop closes over the bound zzso presumably to seal the active site as the oxygen zzso process zzso An zzso coordination site trans to zzso is the likely binding site for zzso The geometry of the zzso complexes suggests that if a zzso formed zzso complex attacks the zzso without zzso from the metal, it must do so at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are positioned to interact with the zzso and/or bound zzso during zzso are identified and discussed in the context of current zzso zzso
