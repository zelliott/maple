The zzso gene zzso a high level of resistance to the root zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso A DNA marker zzso with zzso zzso resistance was used as an entry point for zzso cloning of a disease resistance gene family at the zzso zzso Two related gene sequences have been zzso at the zzso zzso One, identified as a zzso zzso encodes a zzso with a zzso binding site zzso and a zzso zzso this member of the disease resistance gene family is expressed in zzso A second zzso gene zzso cloned as zzso DNA, appears to be a zzso with a frame shift caused by a deletion zzso These two zzso related to members of the zzso zzso rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes were physically mapped to the zzso zzso zzso of the long arm of wheat zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso
