We have evaluated the importance of the zzso site in both the promoter and zzso regions for the induction of enhancement of zzso chain gene zzso after B cell zzso These studies show that although occupancy of the zzso site in the promoter is critical for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso it is not necessary for the increase in zzso induced by in zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso site in the zzso is necessary for neither zzso zzso nor in zzso zzso of zzso however, occupancy of this site is required for further zzso in zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso These results indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in the zzso of resting versus in zzso zzso B zzso The findings are discussed in relation to the zzso described for zzso zzso
