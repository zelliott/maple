In the present study, 16 samples representing zzso zzso zzso zzso from sheep and cattle from seven geographical locations in zzso were characterized genetically by sequences of the first zzso and second zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso of nuclear zzso DNA zzso The ITS zzso was amplified from individual liver zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and the zzso were zzso zzso The lengths of the zzso and zzso sequences were 422 and zzso zzso respectively, for all liver fluke samples zzso zzso of the ITS sequences of the zzso zzso samples examined in the present study with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from elsewhere revealed that the zzso zzso samples examined represent two species, namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of the existence of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso by a genetic approach, which provides foundation for further studies on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and has implications for studying the population genetic structure of the zzso zzso and for the diagnosis and control of the disease they zzso
