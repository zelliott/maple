zzso selectively binds zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, whereas zzso zzso protein zzso binds zzso zzso and zzso To identify the functional zzso of the zzso we generated four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which shared the zzso from zzso bound to zzso with high zzso and activated zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso which lacked the zzso failed to bind and zzso zzso responses, identifying the zzso of zzso as the selectivity zzso for zzso A zzso zzso with an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that all zzso except zzso exhibited varying degrees of binding affinity with commensurate zzso activity of zzso Surprisingly, zzso could neither bind the zzso zzso nor activate zzso despite having both zzso motifs from zzso These results suggest that the two zzso motifs of zzso must cooperate with other regions to successfully bind and activate zzso
