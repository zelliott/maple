From the shark zzso zzso we cloned and zzso a zzso zzso a novel type I zzso termed zzso By zzso zzso mass zzso of zzso proteins separated on zzso gels, we assigned zzso to a zzso protein which is the major zzso type I zzso zzso in this fish and is specifically expressed in zzso zzso In a zzso tree based on type I zzso sequences and with zzso zzso applied as zzso zzso branches off in a rather zzso zzso This tree strongly supports the concept that zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted from two independent gene radiation zzso The only exception is human zzso because its zzso have been found in all zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tree, they form a common, most early branch, with the shark version, zzso in the most zzso zzso Thus, the sequences of zzso and zzso also favor the classical view of zzso evolution that considers the zzso zzso as the most ancient living zzso To determine the overall expression patterns of zzso zzso and simple zzso zzso zzso in this zzso we zzso tested a panel of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of frozen tissue zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso of specific zzso is a convenient method to characterize zzso zzso in zzso
