The highly abundant zzso binding protein zzso factor Tu zzso fulfills multiple roles in bacterial protein zzso zzso peptides with high affinity for zzso were selected from a library of approximately zzso zzso zzso different zzso The lack of sequence zzso among the identified zzso zzso demonstrates zzso zzso binding by zzso zzso shotgun scanning of an zzso zzso was used to dissect zzso molecular recognition by zzso All zzso shotgun scanning zzso bound to zzso with higher affinity than the starting zzso Thus, zzso shotgun scanning can simultaneously zzso binding affinity and rapidly provide detailed structure activity relationships for multiple side chains of a zzso zzso The reported zzso zzso do not compete for binding to zzso with various zzso zzso zzso and could identify an zzso zzso binding site distinct from the zzso zzso zzso
