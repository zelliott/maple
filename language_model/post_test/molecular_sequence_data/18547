zzso is an iron zzso zzso which serves as an efficient scavenger of zzso oxygen species zzso to avoid zzso zzso In zzso the zzso activity of zzso in a variety zzso resistant to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso was always higher than that of the susceptible variety zzso suggesting that zzso activity may have a positive correlation with zzso resistance in zzso To understand the function of zzso at the molecular level, a zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso infected by zzso zzso zzso was predicted to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and its deduced zzso acid sequence shared a high degree of zzso with other plant zzso zzso growth of zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso cells under the stresses of zzso zzso and zzso indicated its high zzso zzso results showed that zzso was expressed at relatively high levels in the zzso whereas expression was moderate in stem zzso and stem zzso Different kinds of zzso including zzso zzso challenge, plant hormones zzso zzso and zzso treatments, zzso zzso stress, heavy metal zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso triggered a significant induction of zzso The zzso protein appeared to zzso in plasma membrane and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso using zzso and zzso blue zzso as well as zzso zzso indicated that zzso may zzso the zzso zzso In conclusion, the positive response of zzso to zzso and zzso stresses suggests that zzso is involved in protection of zzso against zzso zzso environmental zzso
