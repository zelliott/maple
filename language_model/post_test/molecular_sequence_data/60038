zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso using either zzso or zzso with comparable zzso zzso represents a key zzso link between zzso and zzso zzso and is therefore ubiquitous in both higher and lower zzso Only zzso zzso exhibits strong negative zzso with respect to the zzso however, and is regulated by a large number of zzso zzso 

The atomic structure of zzso in complex with zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso has been determined to zzso A zzso The major difference between the bacterial and bovine zzso structures is the presence of an additional zzso in zzso that zzso from each zzso twisting zzso along the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are clearly observed in the active site, but the contacts differ slightly from those observed in zzso zzso zzso A second, zzso zzso zzso lies buried in the core of the zzso Finally, two zzso molecules bind near the hinge region connecting the zzso and zzso zzso 

We propose that the antenna serves as an zzso communication zzso during negative zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso by keeping the zzso zzso in a closed zzso In contrast, zzso probably binds to the back of the zzso domain and activates the zzso by keeping the zzso zzso zzso zzso contacts between antennae within the crystal lattice may represent zzso interactions in solution and, perhaps, with other zzso within the zzso zzso
