zzso can function as a second messenger, and one mechanism for the zzso of this signal is its conversion to zzso acid, which is zzso by zzso zzso zzso We screened a zzso library from human skeletal muscle and isolated two zzso zzso that differed from the zzso clone originally identified in zzso zzso One transcript, which was zzso zzso long, was shown to be zzso it had a zzso deletion that included the translation initiation zzso The other was zzso zzso long with a unique zzso sequence of zzso zzso We also isolated a zzso clone of zzso and determined its organization and zzso it contains 32 zzso spans approximately 50 zzso of zzso zzso and maps to zzso zzso The protein zzso by the zzso transcript contains two zzso regions, a zzso domain, and zzso repeats like the zzso form of zzso as well as a unique zzso zzso The coding sequence was shown to be derived from alternative zzso of the zzso zzso In cells zzso with the zzso zzso we detected a zzso protein with an zzso to zzso and demonstrated that it was localized predominantly in the zzso We conclude that alternative zzso generates zzso zzso of zzso that share some properties but may have unique ones as zzso
