Recently it was documented that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso many protein precursors at pairs of basic zzso zzso thus liberating the biologically active zzso The zzso precursors follow a zzso zzso similar to these zzso where the precursor is initially processed to the zzso big zzso (big zzso before its conversion to the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso shows that they are susceptible to processing by zzso that cleave at pairs of basic zzso zzso For example, human zzso zzso precursor possesses a typical zzso zzso site motif zzso at the following zzso zzso and zzso We have isolated zzso from cultured bovine zzso cells and, using a human zzso zzso probe, shown that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso is present in these zzso We propose that zzso a novel zzso belonging to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso may be implicated in the processing of zzso zzso liberating big zzso
