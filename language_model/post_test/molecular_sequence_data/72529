In zzso zzso the precursor cells of the central nervous system zzso are induced by signaling from the organizer zzso Here we report the isolation of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in the zzso zzso nervous system in response to such zzso zzso is first expressed in zzso cells zzso the zzso organizer zzso zzso which retains its ability to induce zzso during zzso to the zzso end of the zzso We show that these zzso signals can be zzso in zzso by the activity of zzso growth factor zzso We demonstrate that zzso can substitute for the zzso genes in the fly and that it also has zzso activity in zzso zzso Together these results suggest that zzso functions as a zzso gene downstream of zzso signals (including zzso to promote the formation of the neural precursors that will give rise to the zzso zzso in the chick zzso
