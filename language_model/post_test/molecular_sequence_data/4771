zzso the zzso zzso of the family zzso has been divided into bovine viral zzso virus zzso classical zzso fever virus zzso and border disease virus zzso To date, zzso and zzso have been isolated from different species, whereas zzso seems to be restricted to zzso zzso are structurally and zzso closely zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso and most variable protein of zzso We cloned zzso genes of many different zzso zzso including those from a deer and a zzso The zzso genes were zzso zzso characterized with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on these data, we can delineate six major groups within the zzso zzso Four groups zzso to defined zzso whereas the two other groups could be new zzso within the zzso zzso One group comprises zzso strains isolated from zzso A second group consists of zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso which have been isolated from zzso and strain F from zzso A third group contains strain zzso from zzso strain zzso from zzso and strain zzso from zzso On the basis of zzso these viruses are very similar to zzso strains associated with acute severe outbreaks of bovine viral zzso so-called type 2 zzso The fourth group consists of zzso strains originating predominantly from zzso This zzso group can be divided into two zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains viruses from the United States, such as like zzso and Oregon, and some others, such as zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso contains strain zzso and several Dutch zzso The fifth and sixth zzso could be proposed as two new zzso and contain strains Deer and zzso zzso
