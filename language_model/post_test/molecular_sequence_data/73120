zzso proteins play important roles in the recognition and selection of the 3' and zzso zzso site of a given zzso and contribute to the zzso regulation of zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso is recruited to the zzso zzso site by zzso interactions involving the zzso zzso of the zzso protein and zzso Recently, it was suggested that zzso proteins might also contribute to the binding of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso MA, 1995, zzso zzso although it remains unclear whether these zzso proteins interact with proteins of the zzso zzso As a first step toward the identification of proteins that could potentially mediate the integration of the zzso zzso complex into the zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso complexes contain zzso zzso Three proteins in the zzso complex with approximate molecular weights of 27, 60, and 100 zzso were zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso which has been shown previously to zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso A et zzso 1993, zzso zzso Res zzso These proteins are thus prime candidates for novel zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso and molecular characterization of the zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso the zzso protein revealed an zzso zzso domain strongly zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to many other zzso zzso the zzso protein does not contain an zzso zzso The zzso protein can be zzso in zzso by the zzso protein zzso and exhibits several zzso zzso upon zzso gel zzso Thus, the zzso zzso protein could potentially be involved in zzso zzso zzso interactions and, zzso its zzso state could zzso zzso zzso
