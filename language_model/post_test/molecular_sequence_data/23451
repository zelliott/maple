zzso 1 zzso originally identified as melanoma zzso zzso represents a zzso zzso of transient zzso potential zzso proteins which serve diverse biological roles in a wide variety of cell zzso zzso of zzso expression in human zzso melanoma, as indicated by in zzso zzso appears to be a zzso marker for melanoma zzso However, the exact zzso zzso of zzso the zzso involved in the regulation of its expression and its role in melanoma zzso progression are not yet zzso In this study, we identified a zzso zzso upstream sequence of zzso containing four E boxes zzso including an 11 zzso M box zzso that is sufficient for zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso factor zzso (a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the two zzso E boxes zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter are required for both its zzso by zzso and its zzso activity in melanoma zzso Western zzso analysis using zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso identified several zzso presumably generated by both alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso melanoma zzso Thus, multiple mechanisms appear to regulate zzso expression in zzso and melanoma zzso
