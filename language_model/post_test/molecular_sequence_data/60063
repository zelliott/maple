Conventional zzso methods lead to zzso of the zzso acid bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso Random amplified zzso DNA zzso and repetitive element zzso zzso techniques were developed for a molecular study of these two zzso The zzso relationships were confirmed by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments were chosen to isolate zzso zzso zzso In addition to rapid molecular methods for identification of zzso zzso these results convincingly proved that some strains first identified as zzso zzso must be reclassified as zzso zzso The data clearly showed that these molecular methods are more efficient than zzso or zzso studies for bacterial identification at the species zzso
