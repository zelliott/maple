zzso zzso directly enhance the opening of the zzso zzso and zzso channels, although the mechanism remains zzso We examined why zzso and certain zzso zzso form functional zzso channels, whereas other zzso zzso only function in zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso that prevents its zzso expression was localized to its zzso which connects the zzso domain to the binding domain and contains a zzso that decreases the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso replacement of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso sequence transformed zzso into an inverse zzso that zzso zzso channel zzso Using zzso zzso we identified the structural basis for this gating zzso whereas zzso normally enhances the assembly of zzso zzso zzso into a zzso gating ring, inclusion of the zzso zzso reversed this action so that zzso now causes gating ring zzso Thus, zzso gating depends on the dynamic zzso of zzso binding zzso
