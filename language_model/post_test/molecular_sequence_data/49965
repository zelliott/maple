zzso zzso is an zzso protein localized to cerebral zzso of zzso including zzso Its zzso role is unknown but, like zzso zzso and zzso it may transport zzso zzso zzso oxygen species, or serve as a zzso zzso We reported recently that zzso stimulates zzso zzso of zzso in cultured cortical zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso expression increases hypoxic zzso injury, whereas zzso of zzso zzso resistance to zzso These findings are consistent with a role for zzso in promoting zzso survival after hypoxic insults in zzso Here we report that in rats, zzso administration of an zzso zzso but not sense, zzso increases zzso volume and worsens functional neurological outcome, whereas zzso administration of a zzso zzso virus zzso reduces zzso size and improves functional outcome, after focal cerebral zzso induced by zzso of the middle cerebral zzso We conclude that zzso acts as an zzso zzso factor in focal cerebral zzso and may therefore represent a target for the development of new treatments for zzso
