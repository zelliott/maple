zzso is processed in the zzso medium of zzso zzso cells producing fragments with the domain structures of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso and part of zzso 5, while zzso consists of the remainder of zzso 5 and the zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that formation of zzso involves reduction of zzso by a zzso zzso followed by zzso of the reduced zzso We present evidence that the zzso and zzso zzso bonds in zzso 5 of zzso were reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso and Chinese zzso zzso cells and the human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso but not by the zzso cell line zzso Neither primary zzso zzso blood zzso nor zzso or zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, cultured bovine and rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso small but zzso levels of zzso zzso Reduction of the zzso 5 zzso bonds triggered zzso at either zzso or two other positions zzso of zzso in zzso 5 by a zzso zzso zzso zzso could account for the zzso although another zzso was mostly responsible in zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso with apparent Mr of 70, 50, and 39 were zzso from zzso zzso zzso one or more of which could contribute to zzso of reduced zzso
