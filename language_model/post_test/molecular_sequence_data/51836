zzso zzso zzso are capable of converting zzso into either active zzso or inactive zzso Because the distribution of these zzso may be important for tissue zzso to zzso the expression and induction of zzso genes in the human zzso tract were zzso zzso biopsy specimens were obtained from zzso zzso zzso gastric body, zzso zzso and colon of 6 healthy volunteers before and 1 week after taking 20 zzso of zzso zzso zzso specimens were analyzed for the presence of zzso and zzso transcripts using zzso methods and the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso activity was assessed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were present zzso in the zzso of each zzso zzso (20 zzso for 1 week) induced zzso zzso and zzso activity in 5 of 6 zzso The one individual who did not initially respond had a marked increase in both zzso and zzso activity after receiving 60 zzso of zzso daily for 1 zzso After treatment with zzso two individuals had low levels of zzso zzso in several other zzso zzso as well as low levels of zzso zzso in the zzso The expression and induction by a pharmaceutical agent of zzso genes may have implications for zzso metabolism of zzso zzso including zzso
