zzso studies, zzso analyses and zzso mapping lead to the conclusion that the zzso sensory zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso is embedded in the plasma membrane zzso via four zzso segments zzso that form a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso that is fused at the zzso end of zzso possesses the zzso acid sequence signature of a zzso zzso zzso It probably functions as zzso zzso As an independent entity, this zzso behaves as a zzso zzso zzso As a component of the full-size zzso it adopts a different zzso presumably because of interactions with the zzso zzso zzso loop that connects zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso signal requires a precise zzso of the sensor but it does not involve zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of motif zzso Signal transmission through the plasma membrane by the zzso bundle may proceed in a way comparable to that of the zzso zzso zzso Signal zzso in the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso loop that connects zzso and zzso may proceed via the zzso of a putative zzso
