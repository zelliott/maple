The zzso zzso present at zzso plays a critical role in zzso both the capping and zzso regulation functions of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in higher zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso nova, exhibit zzso binding to their respective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are composed of a zzso mixture of zzso zzso zzso unlike in higher zzso which have a simple repeat that is maintained with high zzso In zzso the zzso zzso is recognized by the essential protein zzso which coordinates zzso and zzso activities at the zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso binds these zzso sequences with high affinity (3 zzso and sequence zzso To better understand the basis for this remarkable recognition, we have investigated the binding of the zzso to a series of altered DNA zzso Although an zzso of zzso sequence is required for full binding zzso only three of these 11 bases are recognized with high zzso This specificity differs from that observed in the other known zzso zzso zzso but is well suited to the specific role of zzso at zzso zzso These studies expand our understanding of zzso recognition by the zzso and of the unique molecular recognition properties of zzso zzso
