The structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been investigated by zzso and zzso zzso fast atom zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis, partial acid zzso and zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso zzso of strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso are composed of the same basic zzso repeating unit having the structure zzso zzso zzso in which zzso is zzso The detailed analysis revealed, however, differences in zzso patterns of the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso in strain zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in strains zzso zzso and zzso These structures represent novel, zzso repeating units of bacterial zzso that are characteristic and unique to the zzso zzso By use of the high-resolution zzso spinning zzso technique, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso directly in isolated zzso were zzso This allowed for almost full assignment and structural determination of the zzso By this technique the zzso components were also observed in their original form directly on the surface of living bacterial zzso
