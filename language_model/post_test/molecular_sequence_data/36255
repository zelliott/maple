zzso bearing zzso zzso have been prepared from zzso zzso containing zzso functions and deposited on porous zzso zzso These zzso affinity zzso supports were characterized by quantitative methods, which zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the presence of a soluble competitor zzso The column loading capacity for zzso was measured by the zzso zzso method in mass overload zzso On the basis of a zzso zzso the influence of the protein capacity and the concentration of the soluble zzso on the zzso volume was studied for the determination of the binding zzso The plate heights determined for zzso supports of various zzso and particle diameters show that the strong affinity interactions between zzso and zzso are mainly responsible for the low efficiencies zzso
