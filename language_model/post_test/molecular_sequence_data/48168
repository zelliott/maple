The zzso zzso zzso system of zzso coli is a zzso complex of the envelope involved in maintaining outer membrane zzso PAL and the zzso protein zzso two components of this complex, are interacting with each other, and they have also been reported to interact with zzso and the major zzso two proteins interacting with the zzso All these interactions suggest a role of the zzso system in zzso the outer membrane to the zzso zzso we were interested in better understanding the interaction between PAL and the zzso We designed an in zzso interaction zzso based on the property of zzso zzso to be zzso by zzso Using this zzso we showed that a zzso PAL protein zzso in zzso with pure zzso A zzso competition experiment further demonstrated that the region from zzso 89 to 130 of PAL was sufficient to bind the zzso Moreover, the fact that this same region of PAL was also binding to zzso suggested that these two interactions were zzso Indeed, the zzso complex appeared not to be associated with the zzso This led us to the conclusion that PAL may exist in two forms in the cell zzso one bound to zzso and the other bound to the zzso
