In a previous study, the zzso zzso zzso at position zzso of zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso when zzso to zzso resulted in zzso increase in converting zzso to its expanded zzso zzso compared with that of the zzso zzso However, the role of this zzso in zzso the improved zzso activity is not well zzso In this study, probing the molecular basis of zzso acid zzso at position zzso has underscored its importance for engineering various improvements in the ring expansion zzso zzso modeling using zzso revealed that zzso is surrounded by a zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the improved activity achieved by the zzso zzso was probably because of better zzso packing in this zzso To evaluate the role of zzso acids at position zzso of zzso and its influence on the molecular status of the zzso at this zzso zzso to 18 other zzso acids was done by zzso zzso The effects of each substitution on the zzso activity were determined by zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso G, zzso and zzso zzso obtained showed a drastic reduction in zzso activity when zzso was replaced with charged or polar zzso thus emphasizing the importance of zzso packing around this zzso The zzso results also illustrated that apart from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to improve the zzso conversion activity of zzso by zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso activity, zzso Similar trend of effects from each zzso was also observed for zzso G, zzso and zzso zzso The enhanced zzso activities were supported by zzso zzso indicating that all these zzso have lower zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in improvement in the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso this zzso study of zzso acids situated at zzso of zzso has provided a better understanding of the significance of specific zzso acid zzso at this position which can improve its zzso activity when given a plethora of zzso zzso to generate zzso possibly new, zzso
