zzso drugs are known to interact with zzso zzso both to zzso the effects of low zzso of zzso and to directly gate open the zzso channel in the absence of zzso however, the zzso involved in direct gating by these drugs is not zzso We have studied the ability of zzso (an zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso zzso to directly activate zzso zzso receptors containing the alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma zzso zzso zzso gating was not affected when either of two zzso beta 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso and beta 2 zzso are incorporated into the zzso although these zzso greatly reduce the affinity of zzso zzso These observations indicate that steroid binding and subsequent channel gating do not require these particular zzso as already shown for zzso zzso or zzso zzso competitive zzso of zzso zzso reduced the currents zzso by zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso however, zzso produced only a partial block of response zzso or zzso and zzso only partially blocked responses to zzso These observations indicate that the zzso do not compete with zzso or zzso for a single class of sites on the zzso zzso Finally, at receptors containing alpha 1 beta 2 zzso gamma zzso zzso both zzso and zzso showed weak zzso activity and actually zzso responses to zzso These observations indicate that the blocking drugs can produce zzso changes in zzso zzso at least those containing this zzso beta 2 zzso We conclude that the sites for binding steroids and zzso do not overlap with the zzso zzso Furthermore, neither zzso nor zzso competes for binding at the steroid or zzso zzso The data are consistent with a model in which both zzso and zzso act as zzso zzso of channel opening for the zzso zzso after binding to the zzso zzso
