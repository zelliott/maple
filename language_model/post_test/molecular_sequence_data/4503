zzso alpha and beta are members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family and are expressed on the zzso surface where they have been proposed to play a role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding and zzso fusion make zzso an attractive target for the development of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso were isolated from a rat zzso zzso library and zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso the zzso expression of zzso alpha and beta was determined in zzso and mature rat zzso zzso alpha zzso was present at all stages of development, suggesting that it is not exclusively expressed in zzso germ zzso In contrast, zzso beta zzso was first identified in day 19 zzso zzso with the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso zzso to part of the zzso zzso and two zzso fusion proteins identified a 90 zzso protein in zzso zzso extracts and a 60 zzso protein in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the predicted sizes for rat zzso beta precursor and mature protein zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso stained the zzso cap of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
