zzso 19 of zzso hormone zzso plays a unique role in the interaction process with the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso of the zzso protein zzso increases the binding affinity when incorporated into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and has no effect when introduced into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To explore zzso and the zzso zzso zzso we designed the novel zzso scaffold zzso zzso which has the zzso domain linked to the zzso segment via a zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso resulted in a zzso increase in binding zzso Additionally, the substitution enhanced zzso zzso formation in cells expressing zzso a zzso zzso construct lacking most of the zzso confirming that zzso 19 is interacting with the zzso portion of zzso The binding and signaling capacities of the zzso zzso were diminished relative to those of zzso indicating that the zzso 10-14 region of zzso provides more than just a simple zzso zzso To probe this further, the structural consequences of the zzso zzso and its interaction with zzso were examined by circular zzso zzso zzso and extensive zzso molecular dynamics zzso The structural data clearly illustrate the zzso effect of zzso substitution zzso zzso from position 19 to the zzso zzso Overall, these studies suggest that an zzso is the preferred zzso for the zzso zzso region of zzso and that zzso 10-14 are also required for full affinity and potency of the zzso
