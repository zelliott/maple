zzso zzso a unique group designated among the scorpion zzso class that inhibit sodium channel zzso are highly toxic to mice but do not compete for zzso binding to zzso site 3 on rat brain sodium zzso We zzso the sequence of a new zzso zzso which was also highly active on insects, and studied its action and binding on both zzso and insect sodium zzso Action of the zzso toxin on isolated zzso zzso is similar to that of an zzso and the radioactive toxin binds with a high affinity to insect sodium zzso Other sodium channel zzso interact competitively or zzso with the insect zzso toxin zzso site, similarly to zzso suggesting that the zzso toxin zzso site is closely related to zzso site zzso zzso on rat brain sodium channels, specific binding of zzso toxin could not be zzso although at high concentration it zzso sodium current zzso on rat brain sodium zzso The difficulty in measuring binding to rat brain channels may be attributed to zzso binding due to the zzso properties of the zzso toxins that also impair the interaction with zzso site zzso The results suggest that zzso toxins bind to a distinct zzso site on sodium channels that is zzso related to zzso site 3 on zzso and insect sodium zzso
