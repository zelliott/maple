In this study, we have analyzed the zzso between the zzso and zzso H active sites of human zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso using an in zzso system that closely mimics the initiation of zzso DNA zzso Time course experiments show that zzso pauses after addition of the 12th DNA zzso and at this stage the zzso H activity starts to cleave the zzso primer from newly zzso zzso zzso of zzso profiles obtained with zzso and zzso primer strands indicates that zzso now zzso in the opposite direction, zzso in the zzso direction of the zzso zzso DNA synthesis resumes again in the 3' direction, after the zzso junction was efficiently zzso Moreover, we further characterized complexes generated before, zzso and after position zzso by treating these with zzso to zzso the zzso H active site on the DNA zzso Initially, when zzso binds the zzso zzso zzso strand breaks were seen at a distance of 18 base pairs upstream from the primer zzso whereas 17 base pairs were observed at later stages when the zzso binds more and more zzso These data show that the initiation of zzso synthesis is accompanied by a zzso change of the zzso zzso
