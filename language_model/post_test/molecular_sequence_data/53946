We have cloned a zzso that codes for mouse zzso zzso mouse zzso The zzso is comprised of zzso base pairs and it contains a coding sequence for a protein of zzso zzso acids with 12 putative zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the mouse zzso shares 64 and zzso identities with the reported human and rat zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that mouse zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso We also report here the structural organization of the mouse zzso gene as the first evidence for the structure of a gene zzso an zzso The mouse zzso gene spans approximately 60 zzso in length and consists of 16 zzso including two zzso zzso All the zzso are flanked by zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrate three zzso zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso The zzso region of the gene contains consensus zzso and zzso boxes and several potential binding sites for zzso factors for zzso zzso binding protein zzso and zzso nuclear factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors important for zzso gene zzso
