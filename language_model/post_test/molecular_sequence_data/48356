A novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso was isolated and zzso zzso has an zzso head and a long zzso tail with a tail zzso Genome sequencing revealed a zzso DNA of zzso zzso having 73 open reading frames zzso To identify the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that were resistant to the zzso were zzso All of the zzso zzso were found to have zzso in genes involved in zzso formation, suggesting that the zzso is the zzso target of this zzso Analysis of zzso infection using the zzso zzso which is zzso but zzso demonstrated the requirement of zzso rotation for zzso zzso Further analysis of zzso infection using the zzso zzso revealed that zzso could zzso host bacteria only when the zzso is rotating zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso zzso filament is essential for zzso zzso and required for successful infection by zzso In contrast to the well-studied zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot zzso the zzso zzso that makes a zzso without a zzso filament, suggesting that these two zzso zzso zzso different infection zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso zzso its DNA into the zzso filament for infection by assessing DNA transfer from zzso zzso zzso to the host zzso
