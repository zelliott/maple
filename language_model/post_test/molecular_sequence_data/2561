zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso zzso by detecting zzso activity in an extract of an zzso coli strain containing zzso zzso et zzso 1986, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso insert has been determined and is shown to differ significantly from the zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 82, zzso Comparisons of the coding regions of the two zzso show there are 52 zzso differences, 19 of which are responsible for 18 zzso acid zzso These differences explain the zzso observed at 17 positions during the sequencing of native zzso Five zzso zzso extracted from zzso tissue are observed on zzso gels and the zzso zzso zzso is shown to zzso with one of these zzso The multiple zzso could be caused by the presence of a zzso family since Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA suggests the presence of a minimum of four zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso native zzso is zzso zzso during its zzso from zzso zzso of the deduced zzso translations and the protein sequence suggests the loss of seven zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso coli now provides the means of obtaining gram quantities of a single zzso of the protein which can be converted to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso oxygen and an appropriate zzso Proper extraction procedures and a single zzso step provides zzso which is greater than zzso zzso
