zzso of zzso killer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at natural positions of variation showed that zzso zzso at position 283 uniquely changes zzso zzso and can strongly influence binding of the zzso zzso zzso motifs at positions 2, 47, and 54 in zzso and 182 and 283 in zzso distinguish the two zzso zzso typified by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso combines zzso of zzso with zzso of zzso and binds zzso more strongly than either zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso with zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso cannot bind zzso Thus, zzso zzso directly affects the zzso of the zzso zzso binding zzso From these zzso multiple sequence zzso and zzso zzso we constructed structural models for zzso and its complex with zzso In these models, zzso zzso and zzso come together to form a binding surface for zzso which is contacted by all three zzso zzso A central pocket binds zzso 83, the only zzso motif zzso essential for zzso interaction, similar to the binding of zzso 80 in zzso by zzso Central to this interaction is a salt bridge between zzso 83 of zzso and zzso 282 of zzso which juxtaposes the functionally influential zzso at position zzso Further zzso zzso were tested and shown to have zzso properties consistent with the zzso zzso was not bound by zzso the zzso counterpart of zzso Moreover, introducing any one of three zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso
