To study the interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and human zzso virus zzso and the zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso from six zzso zzso zzso African green monkeys (three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso clones representing zzso zzso were generated from total zzso from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification including reverse zzso in initial reactions followed by two rounds of zzso zzso zzso sequences were selected from regions zzso among human and zzso zzso zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences revealed interesting zzso First, all of the zzso zzso molecules were about zzso identical to the human zzso sequence except the zzso zzso Second, two zzso or two African green monkey subspecies were as zzso related as the human versus zzso zzso Third, zzso of zzso sequences could not be predicted on the basis of geographic origin zzso zzso zzso Finally, upon sequencing several clones from individual zzso a low degree of sequence variation zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found within the same animal, and in case of zzso zzso two zzso populations of zzso molecules were present within three of four zzso The distinguishing features involved eight zzso acid changes, including a single zzso deletion relative to a zzso consensus sequence in the first zzso region of zzso These two zzso populations were present also at the zzso DNA level and may arrive from the two zzso zzso suggesting the existence of distinct zzso zzso zzso Overall, the zzso and to a lesser extent zzso were the most variable regions among the sequences zzso By construction and expression in zzso cell lines of zzso zzso in which these regions of the human zzso were replaced by those of the African green monkey and zzso zzso a higher molecular mass of the zzso zzso were obtained in sodium zzso zzso gel zzso suggesting that the additional zzso zzso sites present in these monkey zzso are also zzso
