The production of large-scale peptides in solution has some advantages and some zzso zzso zzso The layout of the synthesis can be planned in advance in respect of: zzso and zzso zzso zzso selection and methods of zzso zzso to minimize zzso zzso In production: zzso at best zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis can be performed at each step and zzso criteria defined and different fragments can be produced at the same zzso zzso There are a number of problems: zzso of the zzso limited zzso zzso introduction of processes into production in an immature state; zzso over several years; long-time requirement for the zzso which depends on the zzso that are available and the most time-consuming path of the synthesis and the demands of the market cannot be met on short zzso
