This study examined the age structure of the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso growth rings in 204 individual specimens collected from the zzso River of the zzso River zzso zzso basin in April, zzso There were only two different age classes, 1 and 2 years of zzso 3 year zzso were zzso The age structure of zzso zzso was zzso The complete zzso DNA zzso b gene sequences zzso of 80 individuals from 4 populations collected in the zzso River drainage were zzso and a total of 44 variable sites were found among 4 different zzso The global zzso diversity zzso and zzso diversity zzso were calculated at zzso zzso respectively, and 0, 0 in each population, indicating a consistent lack of genetic diversity in each small zzso There was obvious geographic structure in both the zzso River basin zzso group, and the zzso River zzso zzso The genetic distance between zzso and zzso was calculated at zzso suggesting that genetic divergence resulted from long-term isolation of individual zzso Such a simple age structure and a lack of genetic diversity in zzso zzso may potentially be due to small populations and locale fishing zzso zzso the results of this study prompt us to recommend that the zzso zzso and zzso River populations should be protected as three different evolutionary significant units or separated management zzso
