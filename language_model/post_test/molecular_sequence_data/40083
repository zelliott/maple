Secondary growth is supported by a dividing population of zzso cells within the vascular zzso whose daughter cells are recruited to differentiate within secondary zzso and zzso zzso We cloned a zzso Class 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the shoot zzso zzso zzso and the vascular zzso and is zzso in the terminally differentiated cells of leaves and secondary vascular zzso that are derived from these zzso Transformation of zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso results in similar zzso zzso characterized by zzso of the differentiation of leaves, zzso zzso and secondary vascular cell types in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of genes zzso in the stems of zzso zzso plants zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso synthesis or zzso including proteins involved in cell identity and zzso cell zzso or cell zzso These gene expression differences are reflected in zzso of cell wall zzso and zzso composition in zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso has a complex mode of action that may include regulating cell fates through modification of the zzso zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that the SAM and vascular zzso are regulated by overlapping genetic zzso
