A rapid detection method was developed for DNA zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso The examined zzso include an zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso 3, a zzso zzso that occurs within a zzso III site of zzso 8, and the previously described zzso transition that causes a zzso II zzso in zzso zzso Gene fragments encompassing each zzso site were amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso with an appropriate restriction zzso whose recognition site was either naturally affected by the zzso or artificially created with a mismatched zzso According to the zzso profiles, zzso were zzso zzso With this method, respective zzso zzso were determined for 50 or 70 normal zzso The procedure will facilitate zzso zzso in the large zzso
