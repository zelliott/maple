We have cloned a novel ABC zzso gene zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso by zzso using zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed 37% identity to zzso from the same zzso zzso identity to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso identity to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso were generated in two independent zzso zzso strains and their zzso were zzso These zzso displayed increased sensitivity to zzso (a zzso zzso (a zzso zzso (a zzso zzso (the zzso of zzso and zzso (an zzso Delta zzso disruption zzso were previously reported to show resistance to zzso zzso zzso These zzso were found also to display increased sensitivity to zzso (the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso (an zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was strongly induced in response to several zzso including zzso that specifically induced zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso specifically induced zzso zzso These findings indicate that expression of the two ABC zzso genes is regulated differently, and that they have complementary roles in zzso resistance, with each having different zzso
