The zzso domain of the major zzso protein zzso of canine zzso was shown to be an excellent target for development of a synthetic zzso zzso but detailed information about number of zzso optimal zzso sequence choice, and site of zzso to the carrier protein was zzso zzso several overlapping peptides based on this N zzso were zzso to establish conditions for optimal and zzso induction of zzso zzso in zzso The specificity and zzso ability of the zzso response for these peptides were zzso Within the zzso 23 zzso of zzso two zzso able to induce zzso zzso and which overlapped by only two zzso zzso at positions 10 and 11 could be zzso The shortest sequence sufficient for zzso induction was nine zzso zzso longer than 13 zzso consistently induced zzso provided that their N zzso were located between positions 1 and 11 of zzso The orientation of the peptides at the carrier protein was also of importance, being more effective when coupled through the N zzso than through the C zzso to zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the presence of zzso acid zzso 2 to 21 (and probably 3 to 17) of zzso in a single zzso is preferable for a synthetic zzso zzso
