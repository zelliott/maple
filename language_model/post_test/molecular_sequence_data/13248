zzso receptors are members of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Three types of zzso receptors have been cloned and characterized and are referred to as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors has provided a great deal of information about functionally important zzso acid side chains that constitute the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso that were express in human embryonic kidney zzso cells in order to define zzso zzso that are responsible for zzso type zzso All zzso receptors and zzso delta and zzso zzso receptors displayed zzso binding of zzso (an zzso zzso (an zzso and zzso (a mixed zzso In contrast, zzso that lacked the putative first zzso loop of the zzso zzso did not bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that lacked the putative third zzso loop of the delta zzso did not bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso Point zzso in the putative third zzso loop of the zzso delta zzso that converted zzso zzso zzso to zzso abolished zzso binding while not affecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso acids in the putative first zzso loop of the zzso zzso are critical for zzso zzso binding and that zzso zzso in the putative third zzso loop of the delta zzso are important for zzso zzso zzso
