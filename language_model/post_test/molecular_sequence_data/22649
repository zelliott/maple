The family of zzso cassette (ABC) zzso consists of several zzso proteins that use zzso zzso as an energy source for the transport of a variety of substances through cellular zzso Two members of this family, zzso and zzso are implicated in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso content in milk is highly variable among species, breeds, and individuals of the same species, but a potential application of these genes in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso has never been zzso In the present work, expression of zzso and zzso in the bovine was demonstrated for the first time and characterized by quantitative zzso The entire coding region and promoter area were zzso and screened for motifs involved in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso presented a high level of length and sequence identity with other zzso zzso In the zzso promoter region, 2 zzso boxes, a liver zzso zzso response element, and a nuclear zzso response element, important factors in other zzso regulatory zzso were zzso As expected, high expression levels of both zzso and zzso were present in liver and zzso tract samples, and interestingly, in the zzso zzso opening new avenues for further investigation about their potential role in zzso trafficking and zzso during zzso
