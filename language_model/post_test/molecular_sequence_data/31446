We have devised a method for zzso virtually pure and comprehensive libraries of restriction fragments that contained replication initiation sites zzso in zzso We have now zzso and mapped the zzso fragments from zzso a zzso zzso zzso cell line, and have compared origin zzso with a comprehensive replication timing study recently published for this cell zzso We find that zzso origins, which represent zzso of all origins, overwhelmingly represent zones, associate only marginally with active zzso units, are localized within large zzso of open zzso and are significantly associated with zzso I zzso zzso zzso falls from zzso to zzso but rises again in late zzso to levels only zzso lower than in early zzso zzso late origin density calculated on the zzso scale increases as a function of increasing zzso zzso Furthermore, the median efficiency of origins in zzso zzso zzso is only zzso lower than in zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso and zzso origins must be regulated by quintessentially different zzso The zzso data can be unified into a model in which initiation site selection is driven almost entirely by zzso factors that fashion both the long-range and local zzso zzso with underlying DNA sequence and local zzso activity playing only minor zzso zzso the comprehensive origin map we have prepared for zzso zzso moderately well with origin maps recently reported for the zzso of four different human cell lines based on the zzso of small nascent zzso
