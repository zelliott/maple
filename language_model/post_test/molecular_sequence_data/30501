A zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso has been zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso type D producer zzso contained zzso fragments of zzso and zzso zzso pairs zzso that zzso in Southern zzso analysis to a probe containing only zzso zzso type A structural gene zzso Presumably, probe zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso because of the sequence zzso between zzso and zzso This zzso zzso fragment, which was part of a zzso zzso was isolated and zzso into an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso clones were zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to be part of a viable zzso zzso and it contained zzso This zzso zzso was cloned into zzso coli, and its DNA sequence was zzso zzso of the zzso sequence revealed a zzso region that contained an open reading frame with 85 and zzso zzso and derived zzso acid sequence identifies with zzso and zzso zzso type A, zzso This open reading frame has 83 to 50% zzso sequence identities with the other types of zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be transcribed into stable zzso However, the zzso zzso was not translated into an zzso protein because it lacks an appropriate translation initiation zzso
