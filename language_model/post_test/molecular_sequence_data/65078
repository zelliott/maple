zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso produced by an zzso coli clinical isolate which is active on strains of zzso zzso Its zzso by zzso coli zzso cells depends on the presence of any of the outer membrane proteins zzso zzso and zzso the three zzso receptors of this zzso The zzso sequence of a portion of the zzso genetic system that had not yet been studied was zzso Five open reading frames were identified, three of which corresponded to genes zzso functions related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso was found to promote the production of the zzso zzso zzso The possible relationship between zzso synthesis and zzso production was zzso zzso strains failed to produce zzso when transformed with the zzso genetic zzso and upon introduction of the zzso genetic zzso the production of both the zzso and zzso was zzso Further studies demonstrated that at least the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso The relationship found between zzso and zzso zzso production is discussed, and a model outlining zzso synthesis is zzso
