zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disease caused by zzso that affect the proper function of zzso Recently, deletion of DNA zzso zzso zzso in mice produced a zzso characteristic of zzso zzso et zzso 2002, zzso zzso zzso zzso Because it is unclear how a zzso in a DNA zzso would result in a specific zzso in zzso the targeting construct was examined zzso Analysis of the zzso region surrounding the Poll gene revealed an zzso zzso named zzso that is predicted to be transcribed from the opposite strand relative to zzso The deletion of Poll would also remove the first zzso of zzso Because it is possible that the zzso zzso observed is due to the absence of either zzso the expression of these genes during zzso of human airway zzso cells was zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that zzso expression increases during zzso cell zzso the expression of zzso zzso To examine directly whether zzso is zzso in cases of human zzso the complete coding sequence of zzso was zzso from 51 unrelated zzso zzso No zzso zzso were zzso however, one zzso could not be zzso zzso zzso remains a novel candidate gene for zzso
