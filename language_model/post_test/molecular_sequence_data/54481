zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently associated with life-threatening systemic infections, and the recent global emergence of zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso from agricultural and clinical settings has raised zzso In this study, we determined the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from human zzso in zzso Comparative zzso analysis revealed that zzso displays high sequence similarity to strain zzso which was originally isolated in 1940, indicating that progeny of zzso might be zzso zzso possesses a unique zzso zzso island, designated as zzso which is composed of zzso resistance zzso including a zzso composite zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mercury resistance zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso resistance protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso system zzso and zzso and an iron zzso zzso Since zzso is flanked by zzso zzso zzso zzso likely played a role in the acquisition of this zzso island through horizontal gene zzso The zzso zzso gene and a class 1 zzso harboring the zzso gene cassette responsible for zzso and zzso resistance, respectively, were identified on zzso zzso and appeared to have been acquired through zzso zzso with zzso This study represents the first characterization of the unique zzso island zzso that appears to be associated with possible zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso It is expected that future zzso studies will aid in the characterization of the horizontal gene transfer events for the emerging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
