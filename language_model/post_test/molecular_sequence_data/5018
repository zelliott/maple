The zzso family of zzso receptors are involved in cell growth, migration and zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins composed of an alpha and a beta zzso each with a large zzso a single zzso and a short zzso zzso The dynamic regulation of zzso affinity for zzso in response to cellular signals is central to zzso zzso This process is energy dependent and is zzso through zzso zzso zzso However, the cellular machinery regulating zzso affinity remains poorly zzso Here we describe a genetic strategy to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression occurs when zzso of isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso were identified by their capacity to complement dominant suppression in an expression cloning zzso zzso an early zzso zzso zzso that associates with functional zzso was found to regulate zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso These data indicate that zzso is involved in regulating zzso zzso and validate an unbiased genetic approach to zzso zzso zzso zzso
