A zzso approach was zzso to further investigate the molecular zzso of canine zzso 2 zzso with emphasis on Korean zzso and the complete zzso gene sequences for 23 Korean zzso in 2007 and two vaccine strains were zzso Of the 44 Korean zzso 40 were identified as zzso three as zzso and the remaining one as a zzso zzso having a zzso zzso Compared with zzso our findings also showed the presence of six additional zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso gene of the Korean zzso In the zzso tree, the overall Korean zzso did not emerge as an independent zzso within the global zzso nor did they show a close relationship to the zzso from any other zzso Our zzso sequence data also revealed no geographic influence on the spread of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso selection is acting on the zzso gene of Korean zzso
