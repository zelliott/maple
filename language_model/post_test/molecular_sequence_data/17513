Computer analysis of the primary zzso acid sequences deduced from zzso sequences of cloned genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used to examine features of zzso involved in formation and degradation of zzso All 4 zzso for which sequence data are available show a common structure characterized by a series of reiterated repeats in the zzso one third of the zzso These repeats are also found in zzso zzso zzso protein and resemble those found in zzso from other bacteria with binding zzso
