The molecular properties of substance P zzso zzso zzso and three of its zzso were derived by measuring the Gibbs zzso zzso providing information on the surface activity, the molecular shape, and the zzso values of the different zzso The following three zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso SP is only moderately surface zzso The zzso acid zzso lead, however, to an increased surface activity of the zzso From the concentration dependence of the surface activity it was possible to zzso the packing characteristics of the individual zzso SP shows zzso areas of 300 zzso 5 zzso to 240 zzso 5 zzso zzso 5 to 8, 154 zzso zzso at zzso below zzso M, zzso in the zzso concentration range, indicating a folded SP zzso Upon increasing the packing density to zzso larger than zzso M the surface area was only half as large zzso zzso 5 zzso to 124 zzso 3 zzso suggesting now a relatively extended zzso of the SP zzso with its long molecular axis perpendicular to the zzso zzso In contrast, the three zzso were characterized by surface areas of 147 zzso 3 zzso to 126 zzso 3 zzso which were almost independent of zzso The zzso thus adopt a relatively extended zzso in the whole concentration range zzso This is further supported by computer zzso which shows that the zzso are zzso restricted and can adopt neither a bent nor a zzso zzso The surface activity of the zzso was dependent on the pH of the zzso At low zzso zzso (about zzso zzso it was possible to resolve and determine the zzso values of all individual charged zzso acid side zzso The zzso values observed for the zzso were about two zzso units lower than those of the free zzso acids in zzso The zzso shifts of the zzso at the zzso interface are explained in terms of the zzso zzso SP and its zzso bind to zzso zzso in the order of their surface zzso While the binding of SP is mainly due to zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions contribute to the binding of the zzso
