This report describes the characterization of zzso virus, the zzso agent of an outbreak of zzso zzso that has the zzso of a zzso and genetic properties that distinguish it from previously identified strains in the zzso virus zzso zzso analysis of the zzso virus zzso showed it contained the zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso and zzso characteristic of members of the family zzso with an organization identical to that reported for the Manchester virus where the zzso region of the zzso is fused to the zzso zzso zzso virus however, demonstrates considerable sequence divergence from both the Manchester and zzso zzso providing the first indications that genetic diversity exists within zzso of this previously homogeneous zzso On the basis of recent advances in the genetic characterization of members of the family zzso we propose a new interim zzso zzso system in which zzso virus would be included with Manchester and zzso virus as a separate group distinct from the small zzso viruses zzso zzso that also cause zzso in zzso
