zzso zzso is a major pathogen of chickens and zzso causing economic losses to the poultry industry zzso In this study, we validated and applied zzso chain reaction zzso and DNA sequence analysis on the zzso end of the zzso zzso gene zzso as an alternative for the detection and initial typing of field strains of zzso zzso in commercial zzso zzso zzso were tested against zzso of zzso zzso from various sources along with other avian mycoplasma and other bacterial zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly specific in the identification of zzso zzso with a detection limit of zzso zzso zzso color changing zzso DNA sequence analysis of amplified products was also conducted to validate the potential for typing zzso zzso strains using the zzso region of the zzso zzso To evaluate the test, we applied the zzso zzso to zzso zzso collected from chickens challenged with zzso zzso strain zzso and compared the results to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also evaluated directly on zzso samples collected from commercial zzso Overall, this zzso zzso zzso is a useful tool for detection and initial typing of zzso zzso and can be applied in the preliminary identification of zzso zzso zzso directly from clinical zzso
