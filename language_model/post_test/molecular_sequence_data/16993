zzso are commercially important tropical fish which, like many zzso have zzso discrete zzso zzso called zzso zzso When transplanted into diabetic nude mice, zzso zzso provide long-term zzso and zzso zzso tolerance zzso 

Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso insulin gene so that it codes for zzso human insulin while maintaining the zzso regulatory zzso Following zzso into zzso eggs, we screened DNA isolated from whole zzso shortly after zzso by zzso Positive fish were grown to sexual maturity and zzso to zzso and positive zzso were further zzso 

Human insulin was detected in both serum and in the clusters of beta cells scattered throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells as well as other zzso were negative indicating beta cell specific zzso zzso and sequencing of both zzso zzso verified that the insulin was properly processed and zzso 

After extensive zzso transgenic zzso could become a zzso inexpensive source of zzso tissue that can be easily mass-produced for clinical zzso zzso Because zzso zzso are zzso resistant to zzso by zzso standards, transgenic zzso zzso should be ideal for zzso using zzso zzso
