zzso peptides are efficiently taken up by biological cells through different zzso which can be exploited for delivery of zzso zzso For example, their zzso is known since 1967, and this typically produces zzso of the peptides in zzso zzso The resulting zzso (and zzso degradation in zzso is of little therapeutic zzso zzso zzso (and various zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso may also gain access to zzso and nucleus of zzso zzso This process is known since 1988, but it is poorly understood whether the zzso zzso appearance requires an active cellular machinery with membrane proteins and signaling zzso or whether this zzso occurs by passive diffusion and thus can be zzso with model zzso devoid of proteins or zzso In the present chapter, protocols are presented that allow for testing the membrane binding and zzso of zzso on model zzso with special focus on particular zzso zzso zzso include zzso preparation, zzso zzso and analysis of membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and membrane binding zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso a major difference among zzso is zzso At low zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso have only a poor affinity for model zzso with a zzso composition typical of zzso zzso No membrane leakage is induced by these compounds at low zzso zzso In contrast, their zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 2001), bind and disturb zzso model zzso already at low zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the mechanism for zzso zzso delivery (and potential zzso differs among zzso despite their common zzso
