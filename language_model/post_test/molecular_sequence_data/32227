Surface levels of zzso on memory zzso T cells influence zzso zzso Alternative promoter usage results in the generation of zzso zzso zzso that differ based on whether they contain or lack the untranslated zzso zzso The impact of zzso zzso transcripts on zzso surface expression is zzso In this study, we show that the increased cell surface expression of zzso on primary T cells is associated with selective enrichment of zzso zzso zzso The promoter that drives zzso zzso transcripts is highly active in primary human T cells but not in transformed T cell zzso The zzso factors zzso and zzso inhibit and zzso respectively, the expression of zzso zzso transcripts and zzso surface zzso However, zzso at zzso zzso sites in the zzso promoter of nonhuman primates abrogate the binding of these zzso zzso These results identify zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factors that regulate the expression levels of these zzso zzso as key parameters that affect zzso surface expression levels, and by extension, zzso to zzso among humans, and zzso the observed zzso differences in zzso to zzso zzso
