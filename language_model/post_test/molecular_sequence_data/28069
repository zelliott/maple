The zzso acid sequence of the zzso from rat liver was deduced from analysis of zzso clones and a zzso zzso zzso with zzso raised against a zzso sequence deduced from the zzso sequence indicated that the determined zzso acid sequence is that of the zzso The deduced sequence predicts a zzso acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso There are 16 potential zzso zzso sites in the zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence indicates that the protein has two zzso zzso One is located at the zzso and the other is near the zzso zzso A full-length clone zzso the zzso was expressed zzso in mouse L cells and human zzso zzso The cell zzso from the zzso cells contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expressed protein is zzso and has an apparent molecular weight zzso similar to that of the rat liver plasma membrane zzso
