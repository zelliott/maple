The zzso zzso of tobacco etch virus zzso encodes a large zzso precursor that is processed to mature proteins by zzso zzso zzso sites located within the zzso two-thirds of the zzso are processed by a zzso 49 zzso zzso while the zzso responsible for zzso the remaining sites has not been zzso In this study, a second zzso zzso has been identified based on zzso expression of defined zzso zzso The boundaries of this zzso have been delineated by deletion analysis and zzso zzso The zzso active domain has been localized to the zzso half of the 56 zzso zzso helper zzso A zzso site that is recognized by this zzso has been identified in the zzso adjacent to the zzso of the zzso and the zzso appears to cleave by an zzso zzso zzso in zzso occurs between a zzso zzso as determined by zzso sequencing at the zzso of the zzso zzso
