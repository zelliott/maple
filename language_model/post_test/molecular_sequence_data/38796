zzso translation termination factors zzso factors zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit a high degree of zzso acid sequence zzso and share many common zzso In contrast to zzso zzso of zzso have not yet been studied in zzso Here, we describe for the first time the cloning and expression in zzso coli of the gene zzso the zzso chain zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso which was zzso in zzso coli, was active as a zzso with all three termination zzso zzso demonstrating the functional resemblance of zzso and zzso This observation confirms the earlier prediction that zzso and zzso form a common zzso zzso protein family, originating from a common ancient zzso
