zzso proteins serve important biological functions, yet precise information on their secondary and zzso structure is very zzso The boundaries and structures of zzso zzso in integral membrane proteins can be determined by a method based on a combination of zzso zzso and zzso spin zzso The application to one zzso segment in zzso a zzso zzso that functions as a zzso zzso pump is zzso Single zzso zzso were introduced at 18 consecutive positions zzso 125 to zzso Each zzso was reacted with a specific spin label and zzso into zzso that were shown to be zzso The relative collision frequency of each spin label with freely zzso oxygen and zzso zzso zzso was estimated with power zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso 129 to 131 form a short zzso loop, while zzso 132 to 142 are zzso The oxygen accessibility for positions 131 to 138 varies with a zzso of zzso zzso thereby providing a striking demonstration of an alpha zzso The orientation of this zzso segment with respect to the remainder of the protein was zzso
