zzso zzso are known to zzso regulate target zzso through the zzso which interacts mainly with the zzso of zzso in zzso Here we identify many zzso motifs within human zzso specific to the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in particular has significant interaction sites in the zzso less zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso have significant interaction sites only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are actively evolving in response to each zzso Additionally, many zzso with their zzso interaction sites in the zzso turn out to simultaneously contain zzso interaction sites in the zzso Based on these findings we demonstrate zzso interactions between a single zzso and both end regions of an zzso using model zzso We further show that genes exhibiting large-scale protein changes due to zzso zzso or deletion contain both zzso interaction sites zzso We provide the predicted targets of this new zzso target class, zzso as an efficient way to screen potential targets, especially for zzso zzso since the target search space is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with the zzso zzso zzso is confirmed by showing zzso regulation with zzso a zzso identified only in zzso opening the door to the study of zzso zzso Finally, zzso (and associated zzso involved in this new targeting class may prevent zzso zzso scanning through the zzso and keep it from reaching the zzso preventing zzso zzso
