The zzso protein zzso zzso functions as a negative regulator of the cell cycle in zzso zzso acting downstream of the zzso protein zzso In the present work we report that zzso of zzso zzso and an zzso truncated form zzso zzso lead to growth arrest in zzso compromised zzso zzso zzso zzso Both forms of zzso zzso zzso were zzso active and preferred zzso basic protein zzso as a zzso over several other zzso zzso analysis of bovine zzso by tandem zzso revealed two major zzso zzso sites, zzso and zzso zzso containing each site were obtained and tested as zzso zzso Both forms of zzso zzso a zzso containing the zzso zzso with far more efficient zzso than zzso The zzso zzso zzso values of the full-length zzso reaction were zzso zzso and zzso zzso and those of zzso truncated zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso of zzso Although neither form of zzso was able to zzso two generic protein zzso zzso zzso both were zzso on zzso zzso in zzso and underwent zzso zzso when reacted with zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was zzso both in zzso and in zzso after reaction with zzso zzso with protein zzso zzso zzso removed all of zzso zzso content and drastically reduced zzso activity against zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso content of the zzso is essential for its zzso zzso Although the zzso truncated zzso was expressed at a lower level than the full-length zzso its zzso activity and zzso content were significantly higher than those of the full-length zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso is a dual specificity protein zzso which zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso
