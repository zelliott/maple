The zzso zzso of the recently cloned zzso zzso zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso was demonstrated with a zzso specific zzso in rat zzso zzso This zzso detects a zzso zzso major, and a 46 zzso minor band in membrane preparations of rat zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso was present in zzso and basket zzso zzso cell zzso spines and their zzso zzso showed selective zzso zzso zzso parallel zzso and zzso processes were devoid of zzso It is suggested that the selective zzso zzso of this zzso at the zzso spines of zzso cells serves as the zzso basis for long term depression processes in the molecular layer of the zzso zzso
