zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of various cardiovascular zzso In vascular smooth muscle cells zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso 1), a zzso zzso of zzso zzso is low and is induced upon stimulation by zzso factors, while it is abundantly expressed in colon zzso zzso To clarify the regulatory mechanisms underlying such zzso zzso the upstream regions directing zzso of the zzso gene were zzso In zzso cells, a cell line originated from mouse zzso two novel zzso zzso species, the zzso and zzso were zzso These transcripts contained zzso regions that differed from the colon type zzso zzso and zzso an additional zzso zzso of 28 zzso zzso When these transcripts were fused to the zzso tag and expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, a fraction of translated proteins demonstrated the size containing the additional zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso activities equivalent to the activity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in the colon and in the intact zzso whereas the zzso zzso was detected in the primary cultured zzso migrated from zzso zzso in vascular tissue of a zzso model and in the zzso zzso of mice infused with zzso zzso The promoter region of the zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, a mouse colon zzso cell zzso These results suggest that expression of the zzso gene is regulated by alternative promoters and that the novel zzso transcript is induced under zzso zzso of zzso
