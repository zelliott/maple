In bacteria, stalled zzso are recycled by a hybrid zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso is zzso with zzso and is delivered to the zzso by zzso where it zzso with the growing zzso zzso zzso entry into stalled zzso poses a challenge to our understanding of zzso function because it occurs in the absence of a zzso zzso Instead, zzso entry is licensed by the binding of its protein partner, zzso to the zzso decoding zzso We analyzed a series of zzso zzso and found that its zzso tail is essential for zzso accommodation but not for zzso zzso We obtained evidence that the tail likely functions as a zzso on the zzso to promote accommodation and identified key zzso in the tail essential for this zzso In addition, our zzso analysis points to a role for the zzso zzso tail zzso in zzso after zzso transfer to zzso presumably zzso zzso or translation of the zzso zzso Surprisingly, analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals that while these zzso zzso are essential for normal zzso selection, they play little to no role in zzso transfer to zzso These studies clarify how zzso interacts with the zzso decoding center to license zzso entry into stalled zzso
