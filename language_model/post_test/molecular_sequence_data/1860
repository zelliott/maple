Small zzso partner zzso zzso is an unusual orphan nuclear zzso that lacks a conventional zzso domain and acts as a zzso of zzso activities of a number of nuclear zzso zzso we report that the human zzso promoter zzso is activated by zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso which regulates the expression of various genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid zzso zzso of zzso activated the human but not mouse zzso promoter, although zzso had little effect on the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso deletion reporter zzso revealed that zzso region is located within the sequences from zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso I zzso gel shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso binds directly to the zzso zzso zzso zzso made it clear that the zzso promoter zzso by zzso is mostly zzso by the zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso promoter, which is not zzso in the mouse zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso Finally, we found that a zzso deletion zzso in the zzso promoter, which is reported to be associated with altered body weight and insulin zzso in human, zzso with the zzso This zzso strongly decreased both zzso and zzso dependent activities of the zzso promoter, because of the reduced binding of zzso to the zzso zzso Overall, our results demonstrate a differential regulation of human and mouse zzso promoters by zzso We propose a possible role of zzso in the species differential regulation of cholesterol and zzso acid zzso via a novel mechanism of zzso of the zzso gene zzso
