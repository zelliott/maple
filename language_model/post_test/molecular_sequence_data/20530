zzso remains a major global health burden and current drug therapies are compromised by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was validated as a new drug target through the identification of potent and selective zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity in zzso Here we report zzso structure determination of zzso bound to three zzso from this series, representing the first of the zzso bound to malaria specific zzso We demonstrate that zzso flexibility results in an unexpected binding mode identifying a new zzso pocket on the zzso zzso this plasticity allows zzso to bind zzso from different chemical classes and to accommodate inhibitor modifications during lead zzso increasing the value of zzso as a drug zzso A second discovery, based on small zzso zzso is that the zzso populate a resonance form that promotes charge zzso These intrinsic zzso allow formation of energetically favorable zzso interactions with the zzso The importance of zzso to binding affinity was supported by zzso zzso and the demonstration that zzso zzso that lack this intrinsic zzso are zzso Finally, the zzso bound structures provide considerable new insight into zzso inhibitor binding in this zzso zzso Together, these studies will directly impact efforts to exploit zzso for the development of zzso zzso
