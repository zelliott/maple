The zzso chain reaction, employing zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso III and VI of zzso zzso was used to generate partial clones zzso those receptors carried by cultured rat zzso smooth muscle zzso One zzso spanning the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso specific for zzso zzso was used as a probe to screen a human zzso zzso zzso The clone zzso zzso a selective type of human zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame zzso a protein zzso zzso acids in zzso with a relative molecular weight of zzso zzso The sequence analysis suggests the presence of a signal zzso two potential sites for zzso in the N terminal zzso domain, the seven zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso and several potential sites for zzso in the C terminal zzso zzso At the zzso acid level, the human zzso shows zzso and zzso identity with the rat and bovine zzso respectively, and 59% similarity with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso injected with the cloned zzso express binding sites specific for zzso zzso of the message in zzso 7 cells gave a zzso product to which binding of the zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso specific for zzso
