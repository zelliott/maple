The zzso virus 40 zzso large T zzso was used as an zzso zzso to express a zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso recognition zzso corresponding to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice with a cell line, zzso expressing the zzso T zzso was able to induce the generation of zzso zzso in both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso memory zzso zzso were detected in these mice for at least 6 months following zzso at a slightly lower frequency than in those mice zzso with infectious zzso zzso was also able to activate in zzso zzso memory zzso obtained from mice previously challenged with zzso Overall, these findings support the use of a zzso T zzso as a zzso in determining the zzso potential of individual zzso zzso and to assess their potential contribution in inducing a protective immune response in zzso
