A new rare zzso form of zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was identified in three unrelated zzso zzso The first was a Caucasian male with a total cholesterol zzso of 313 zzso and total zzso zzso of 282 zzso the second an African-American female zzso 345 zzso zzso zzso zzso and the third, an African-American male zzso 345 zzso zzso 1000 zzso Each subject was found to be zzso for a G to A substitution in the zzso for zzso 38, resulting in a zzso for zzso zzso This accounts for the increased zzso value of zzso The third patient, in addition to zzso had zzso another charge zzso This was determined by DNA sequencing, confirming the zzso for zzso change at zzso 55 previously predicted by analysis of zzso fragments in this zzso Similar zzso zzso of zzso and zzso energies were observed when the ability of zzso to activate zzso zzso was compared to normal zzso This indicates that major changes in charge around zzso 38 lack effect on the zzso zzso The zzso may be altered in some other property, such as zzso zzso but since the distribution of zzso revealed no simple zzso with zzso levels, it is unclear to what extent it plays a role in the observed zzso The presence of other factors acting together with the zzso may zzso to elevated zzso zzso
