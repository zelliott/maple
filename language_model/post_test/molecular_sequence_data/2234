The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso end of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The predicted sequences of the two zzso do not have typical signal sequences at their zzso zzso Both zzso are zzso as inactive higher molecular weight precursors zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso into the external medium where zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso occurs with a zzso of less than 5 zzso at 37 degrees C in zzso broth zzso whereas that of zzso occurs with a zzso of about 150 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso B, zzso and C were zzso zzso starts at the zzso zzso whereas B and C start, respectively, at zzso zzso and zzso of the sequence deduced from the zzso zzso A short zzso extension is therefore removed during the zzso process, most likely by an zzso zzso zzso B shows a high degree of sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which also lacks a signal zzso and for which an inactive higher molecular weight form has been zzso
