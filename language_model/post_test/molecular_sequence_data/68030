In producing zzso mice by gene targeting in embryonic stem zzso cells, the efficient isolation of the zzso zzso is still a critical zzso We previously reported on a negative selection using the diphtheria toxin A zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso It was efficient but limited to gene zzso expressed in zzso zzso For wider zzso of this negative selection to many gene zzso not expressed or expressed at low levels in zzso cells, we exploited a novel targeting zzso composed of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a pausing signal for zzso zzso II from the minute virus of mice, and the zzso zzso There was about a zzso decrease in frequency of zzso colonies with this strategy against that using only the zzso gene in the zzso and zzso zzso were obtained at zzso of more than zzso among zzso resistant cells at zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso gene zzso
