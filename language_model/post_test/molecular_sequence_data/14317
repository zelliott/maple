zzso zzso displays zzso growth, alternating between a zzso zzso zzso form and a zzso zzso generated by mating of zzso cells and which is an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transition of zzso strains in zzso by change in ambient pH has been used to understand the mechanisms governing this differentiation zzso In this study we used suppression zzso zzso to generate a zzso library of zzso zzso genes zzso in the zzso form induced in zzso at acid zzso zzso analysis using quantitative zzso showed that the induction of two zzso identified in this library coincided with the establishment of zzso growth in the acid pH zzso This expression pattern suggested that they were specifically associated to zzso development rather than merely acid zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso encodes a protein containing three zzso recognition motifs and zzso repeats and was selected for further zzso The zzso gene contains 4 zzso and produces a zzso zzso by a zzso zzso site within the third zzso zzso deleted for zzso showed a slower growth rate than wild type strains in liquid and solid media, and their colonies showed a zzso zzso on solid zzso Interestingly, although zzso strains were not affected in zzso growth induced by acid pH and zzso acid, they exhibited reduced zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso Our data suggest that zzso is probably involved in cell growth, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
