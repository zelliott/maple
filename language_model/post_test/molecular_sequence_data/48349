zzso zzso of animal zzso was developed for identifying zzso candidates from complete zzso zzso zzso zzso for short zzso proteins zzso zzso revealed a number of overlooked zzso short proteins with an abundance of zzso throughout their zzso We applied zzso and zzso methods to zzso the function of several top predicted zzso We focused on zzso peptides that adopt the fold of the zzso proteins zzso We identified a cluster of duplicated genes that share a structural similarity with zzso zzso such as zzso In the zzso zzso there are about 60 such proteins that belong to the zzso zzso These proteins are zzso or anchored to the cell zzso zzso proteins are associated with a rich repertoire of functions, including binding to receptors and zzso zzso proteins zzso cell signaling in the context of brain functions and cells of the innate immune zzso We zzso that zzso as zzso of cell zzso may be associated with zzso and cellular zzso We show that proteins of the zzso family are associated with cancer diagnosis and malfunction of the immune zzso
