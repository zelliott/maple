In the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the satellite zzso were each found to consist wholly or largely of a single family zzso of the zzso Several clones of each family were obtained and zzso The repeat unit in each species is characterized by both the repetition of a basic motif and the presence of an inserted zzso zzso comparisons with satellite DNA from zzso zzso and zzso zzso provide plausible scenarios for the evolution of the satellite DNA in each zzso zzso and zzso tracts in each consensus sequence suggest the formation, in zzso of hairpin structures and bend centers that may play a role in zzso zzso in zzso The insertions in the repeat units of each species also contain these structural features, suggesting that maintenance of these insertions requires constraints similar to those pertaining to the rest of the zzso zzso
