The zzso plant zzso zzso has zzso sex zzso and comparison of the positions of zzso genes indicates that at least three large zzso have occurred during the evolution of the Y zzso In this article, we describe the isolation of a new zzso gene from zzso zzso which provides new information on the evolution of this plant's young sex zzso By using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso sequence of zzso a zzso zzso we found two copies in zzso zzso which we named zzso and zzso Southern zzso and genetic segregation analysis showed that zzso is located on the X zzso and zzso is zzso No zzso copy of zzso was found by either Southern zzso analysis under zzso conditions or zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso so we conclude that zzso probably has no zzso zzso It is unknown whether the Y zzso lost the zzso copy by zzso of this individual gene or whether deletion of a larger zzso region was zzso Several tests lead us to conclude that dosage compensation has not evolved for this zzso zzso We mapped the zzso in the zzso relative zzso zzso zzso to compare the location in a species that has no history of having sex zzso zzso maps to the same linkage group as other fully zzso zzso indicating that it was not added to the X, but was lost from the zzso Its location differs in the maps from the two species, raising the possibility that the X zzso as well as the Y, may have been zzso
