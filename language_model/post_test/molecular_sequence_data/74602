We analyzed the zzso pol gene from patients in Cape Town to determine the genetic diversity of zzso in the region and to assess the baseline zzso resistance level of zzso zzso Plasma was collected prior to the national zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso was zzso followed by zzso and automated DNA sequencing of the viral zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso coding zzso zzso was done through zzso zzso The sequences were inspected for zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso A total of 140 pol sequences were zzso of which 133 zzso belong to zzso zzso C, five zzso were zzso B, and one each was zzso G and zzso Five sequences zzso had zzso zzso These include three zzso zzso zzso With the progression of the national ART program, it is important to monitor the resistance profile of zzso and zzso zzso
