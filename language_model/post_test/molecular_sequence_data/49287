In zzso type 12 transformed cells, the zzso of zzso class I zzso contributes to the zzso zzso and is solely zzso by zzso zzso Previous in zzso studies with class I zzso sequences have indicated that there is an increased binding of zzso zzso and its associated zzso and a decreased binding of zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to determine in zzso whether these proteins regulate class I zzso by affecting zzso The zzso zzso revealed that there is lack of zzso zzso zzso in the region of the class I zzso in zzso zzso This is regulated by zzso zzso as it was further demonstrated in zzso that zzso and zzso are associated with the class I zzso zzso In agreement with in zzso studies, zzso could be recruited to the class I zzso following induction by zzso However, this zzso zzso failed to zzso class I expression because the class I zzso zzso remained zzso as a result of zzso zzso by zzso in association with zzso Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time that repression of zzso through zzso zzso is a major mechanism in zzso class I zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso a zzso binding zzso was shown to be present in the natural protein complex bound to the class I zzso
