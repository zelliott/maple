zzso zzso the zzso putative zzso factor zzso are subject to zzso regulated alternative zzso and they zzso protein zzso that differ in the number of zinc zzso One zzso zzso encodes an zzso that includes three zinc fingers and a zzso zzso Two other transcripts zzso zzso with six and seven zinc fingers which bind to distinct promoters and DNA target zzso Thus, because of alternative zzso a single gene appears to zzso distinct zzso zzso each capable of regulating different gene sets in different zzso and zzso zzso
