A major mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso is initiated by zzso followed by zzso zzso which exposes the transcript to zzso to 3' zzso zzso The zzso zzso that removes the zzso cap structure is zzso by the zzso zzso To understand the function of the zzso zzso we used zzso scanning zzso to create 31 zzso versions of the zzso and we examined the effects of the zzso both in zzso and in zzso Two types of zzso that affected zzso zzso in zzso were identified, including a zzso zzso First, two zzso produced zzso zzso that were defective for zzso in zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso are required for zzso zzso In contrast, several zzso that moderately affected zzso zzso in zzso yielded zzso zzso that had at least the same specific activity as the zzso zzso in zzso Combination of zzso within this group yielded zzso zzso that showed a strong loss of function in zzso but that still produced fully active zzso in zzso This suggested that interactions of the zzso zzso with other factors may be required for efficient zzso in zzso and that these particular zzso may be zzso such zzso Interestingly, partial loss of zzso activity in zzso led to a zzso in normal zzso zzso but it did not affect the rapid zzso zzso triggered by early nonsense zzso This observation suggested that these two types of zzso zzso differ in their requirements for the zzso zzso
