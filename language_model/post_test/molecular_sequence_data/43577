In this study a size selected zzso library from zzso zzso was screened for zzso zzso The resulting zzso were zzso by zzso for their usefulness as molecular markers in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 17 out of 52 tested primer pairs resulted in the amplification of a zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso found per locus varied from 6 to zzso Combining the genetic variation observed for the characterized zzso provides a unique zzso for all the individuals zzso Using zzso controlled crosses of zzso zzso trees zzso inheritance could be shown for five zzso
