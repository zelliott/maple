zzso are a family of soluble zzso zzso distributed in both zzso and zzso and, more recently, found also in zzso The zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the first zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Physical mapping by zzso artificial zzso zzso filter zzso revealed that the zzso zzso gene is located on zzso zzso Analysis of the transcript zzso zzso showed the presence at its zzso of a zzso zzso leader sequence zzso The entire zzso structure spanning zzso zzso pairs zzso including the zzso region, two intervening sequences zzso 1 and zzso and the zzso region, was completely determined by the combination of zzso zzso chain reaction and conventional colony zzso zzso 1 was relatively long zzso zzso and was found to be inserted after the ninth zzso zzso from the initiation zzso This position proved to be almost zzso to the zzso first zzso zzso position in the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and chick zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso 2 was much shorter zzso zzso and it was inserted into the central region of the second zzso zzso Although such an zzso pattern has never been observed in the zzso zzso zzso it seems to be common in zzso zzso tandem zzso zzso zzso as predicted by the zzso zzso zzso project zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Genome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso Based on extensive sequence comparison, the origin and molecular evolution of the tandem zzso zzso are zzso
