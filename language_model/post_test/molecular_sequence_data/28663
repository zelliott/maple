The zzso zzso to zzso zzso editing of zzso zzso B zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is structurally zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso zzso but has evolved specific features required for zzso zzso binding and zzso A signature sequence for zzso has been used to identify other members of this zzso One of these zzso designated zzso is found on zzso zzso Another gene zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is located adjacent to zzso on zzso zzso Seven additional zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso are arrayed in tandem on zzso zzso Not present in zzso this locus is apparently an zzso expansion of the zzso zzso The conclusion that these new genes zzso orphan C to U zzso zzso of the zzso family comes from similarity in zzso acid sequence with zzso zzso zzso organization, zzso zzso zzso and zinc and zzso binding similar to zzso zzso expression of these genes in a variety of cell lines, along with other evidence, suggests a role for these zzso in growth or cell cycle zzso
