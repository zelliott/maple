From a human fetal brain zzso library, we isolated a novel gene sharing significant zzso with the genes of zzso assembly proteins zzso This zzso zzso designated zzso zzso assembly protein zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its predicted zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity and zzso similarity with zzso In its zzso half zzso contained several characteristic motifs strictly zzso with zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso half showed little zzso zzso analysis revealed strong expression of a zzso transcript in human adult brain and weak expression in zzso zzso was closely linked to a marker zzso mapped to zzso bands zzso where genes responsible for several zzso mental zzso syndromes have been zzso
