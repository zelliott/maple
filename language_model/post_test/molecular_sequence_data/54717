A large number of researches focused on zzso E1 and zzso of zzso C virus zzso aimed at the development of zzso vaccines and zzso Enhancement of zzso expression and zzso is critical for the characterization of these zzso and thus for zzso vaccine zzso In this study, we designed and zzso three signal zzso sequences based on online programs zzso zzso and zzso then removed and replaced the signal zzso preceding zzso by overlapping the zzso chain reaction zzso We assessed the effect of this zzso on zzso expression and zzso in zzso cells, using western zzso analysis, dot zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso capture zzso zzso zzso the peptides preceding E1 and zzso with the signal peptides of the tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in maximum enhancement of zzso expression and zzso of E1 in zzso cells, without altering zzso Such an advance would help to facilitate both the research of zzso biology and the development of an effective zzso zzso zzso The strategy used in this study could be applied to the expression and production of other zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso
