The largest zzso of zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso contains at its zzso zzso an unusual domain consisting of 52 tandem repeats of the consensus sequence zzso This domain, designated the zzso domain zzso is essential for viability and is extensively zzso during the transition from zzso complex assembly to zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of the zzso may play an important regulatory role in this zzso We show here that the zzso is also modified by a novel form of protein zzso zzso This modification has been found on numerous zzso factors and other nuclear and zzso proteins zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso by zzso high performance liquid zzso and zzso zzso from such experiments suggest that zzso occurs at multiple sites throughout the zzso similar to the zzso of this zzso The zzso however, is not zzso on the zzso form of the zzso This observation is consistent with the idea that zzso and zzso are mutually exclusive zzso The zzso of zzso II, therefore, appears to exist in three distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The differential modification of the zzso may play an important role in the regulated expression of genes transcribed by zzso zzso zzso
