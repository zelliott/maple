zzso zzso zzso zzso initiate O zzso of zzso proteins in zzso We have characterized zzso which encodes the second zzso protein of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso The zzso of zzso are 21 and zzso identical to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking one or two zzso zzso grow normally and contain normal zzso zzso activities in cell extracts but show zzso including a partial block of zzso formation zzso and a zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be suppressed by overproduction of known components of signaling zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting a specific zzso target protein upstream of these zzso zzso lacking both zzso and zzso are viable and show zzso zzso zzso and an additional sensitivity to the iron zzso zzso zzso The lack of zzso significantly reduces adherence to zzso cells and overall zzso in a mouse model of systemic zzso The results suggest that zzso regulates a more narrow zzso of proteins in zzso zzso than zzso including zzso proteins responsible for zzso and zzso zzso
