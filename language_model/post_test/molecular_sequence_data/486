We investigated whether there are long-lasting effects of exposure to zzso zzso zzso treatment on zzso response to zzso zzso inhibitor zzso therapy among human zzso virus zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso study was conducted in Johannesburg, South zzso zzso and sustained zzso response to zzso therapy was compared between 94 zzso women who had received zzso zzso months earlier and 60 zzso zzso women who had been pregnant zzso months zzso zzso load was measured every 4 weeks up to week 24 and then every 12 weeks up to week zzso Time to viral suppression zzso load, zzso zzso and confirmed rebound in the viral load zzso load, zzso zzso were zzso Drug resistance was assessed using zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso and population zzso 

Almost all women zzso of zzso women and zzso of zzso zzso P zzso zzso achieved viral suppression by week 24, and similar percentages of zzso and zzso women zzso and zzso zzso experienced viral rebound within 78 weeks after treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected with the zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso among zzso and zzso women before zzso detection was strongly zzso of inadequate viral response: zzso of women for whom zzso was detected in either viral zzso or DNA did not experience viral suppression or experienced viral rebound, compared with zzso of women for whom zzso was not detected zzso zzso zzso After treatment, the zzso zzso occurred less frequently among zzso women than among zzso women, but the frequency of zzso zzso was similar between these groups of women with inadequate zzso zzso 

Exposure to zzso in the prior zzso months was not associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving and sustaining viral suppression while receiving zzso zzso However, women with minority zzso zzso before treatment had a reduced durability of zzso zzso
