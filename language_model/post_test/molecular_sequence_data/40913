The evolution of zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso prior and after treating active tuberculosis zzso with chemotherapy in zzso patients was zzso Two time points zzso zzso were evaluated by comparing zzso patients with active tuberculosis zzso and zzso patients without tuberculosis zzso Plasma samples were obtained from the Frankfurt zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and molecular cloning was zzso Eight to zzso clones were zzso from each zzso Various zzso analyses were zzso We found a significant increase in diversity and divergence in zzso compared to the zzso For zzso the average rate of evolution of zzso zzso was higher than previous reports zzso zzso Two groups of zzso were observed based on the rate of zzso evolution and zzso zzso A fast evolving zzso dominating group and a relatively slowly evolving zzso zzso The results demonstrated that active zzso has an impact on zzso viral diversity and divergence over zzso The influence of active zzso on zzso evolution of zzso may be zzso for zzso zzso
