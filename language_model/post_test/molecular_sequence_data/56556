The zzso of genetically susceptible strains of mice with type II collagen zzso elicits a zzso arthritis that resembles zzso zzso Our laboratory previously identified a region of zzso zzso that contains a T cell zzso that is prominent in the immune response to zzso zzso critical to the zzso presentation of this zzso have been zzso To produce synthetic peptides with the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso synthetic analogue peptides were developed that contain zzso zzso in critical zzso One analogue zzso was found to be an efficient competitor for binding to zzso and to be capable of zzso T cell responses in zzso When zzso mice were zzso with zzso and the analogue zzso the zzso and severity of arthritis were greatly reduced, zzso with the zzso immune responses to zzso
