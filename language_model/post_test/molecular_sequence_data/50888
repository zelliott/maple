A zzso diet stimulates zzso zzso and zzso net production of very low density zzso in the zzso To study changes of zzso zzso gene expression in response to such a diet, we measured the zzso abundance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of rats fed a zzso diet or a control diet for 3 zzso In zzso of zzso rats, the abundance of cellular and nuclear zzso zzso zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of control values zzso less than zzso zzso In zzso rats, the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso measured in a zzso zzso system using isolated liver zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso of control zzso less than zzso In contrast, this diet neither affected the abundance of cellular and nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso activity of these genes in zzso These results are consistent with specialization of the regulatory elements of the genes coding for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso gene may zzso increased synthesis of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso due to the close linkage of the three genes in the rat zzso
