In an attempt to identify genes that are involved in zzso embryonic cardiac development, we have cloned and characterized a gene whose function is required late in zzso to control heart rate and muscular zzso This gene has been named held out wings zzso because zzso zzso zzso produce adult animals that have lost their ability to fly and that keep their wings horizontal at a 90 degree angle from the body zzso In contrast to the late zzso observed in zzso zzso the How protein is expressed early in the zzso zzso and this expression is apparently under the control of zzso When the different zzso lineages zzso the expression of How becomes restricted to the zzso zzso including the zzso and probably all the zzso zzso directed against the protein demonstrate that How is localized to the zzso how encodes a protein containing one zzso which has been implicated in binding zzso how is highly related to the mouse zzso gene which plays a role at least in zzso and that could serve to link a signal zzso zzso to the control of zzso zzso The properties of the how gene described zzso suggest that this gene zzso in the control of expression of as yet unidentified target zzso coding for proteins essential to cardiac and muscular zzso
