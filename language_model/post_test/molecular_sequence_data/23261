zzso organize zzso material to form zzso and also template the formation of zzso Despite the importance of zzso in dividing and differentiated cells, their assembly remains poorly understood at a molecular zzso Here, we develop a zzso zzso zzso for zzso assembly in the zzso stage zzso zzso zzso We use this zzso to characterize zzso a zzso protein that we identified based on its requirement for zzso zzso We show that zzso a member of a zzso zzso protein family, is specifically required for new zzso zzso a result we confirm by electron zzso We further use the zzso assembly zzso to examine the roles of three zzso material zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the zzso material promotes daughter zzso formation by concentrating zzso around the parent zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso material proteins contribute to zzso zzso
