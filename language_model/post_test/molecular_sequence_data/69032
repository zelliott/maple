We characterized four new zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene in three male infants who died from acute zzso zzso and one male infant with late onset zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso in the zzso of the three zzso whereas residual zzso activity was present in the fourth zzso All 10 zzso of the zzso gene were amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso DNA of the four zzso The amplified DNA was screened for abnormal gel zzso migration patterns via zzso zzso zzso zzso One patient showed an abnormal zzso pattern of zzso 8 and zzso 9, a second patient had an abnormal zzso 6, a third had an abnormal zzso 9, and the fourth patient revealed an abnormal zzso zzso zzso of the abnormal zzso revealed that the first patient had a deleterious zzso in zzso 9 consisting of a zzso zzso in zzso 310 causing a zzso coding zzso The abnormal zzso 8 of this patient contained a common zzso consisting of an zzso transition in zzso zzso resulting in zzso code zzso The abnormal zzso 6 of the second patient contained an zzso transition in zzso 183 causing a zzso zzso zzso 9 of the third patient contained a deletion of a zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a shift of the reading frame and a code for premature termination 28 zzso zzso The fourth patient with a zzso clinical presentation had an zzso zzso in zzso 3 zzso zzso causing a zzso zzso
