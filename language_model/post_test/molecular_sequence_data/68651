The 21 zzso proteins zzso by zzso genes are thought to be involved in zzso signal zzso zzso of zzso genes activated by point zzso after zzso into zzso cells can zzso the response of these cells to zzso added growth factors and their expression patterns of growth zzso We analyzed zzso cells from 50 patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso for the presence of zzso point zzso of the zzso gene using zzso chain reaction zzso and differential zzso zzso This zzso allows zzso determination of the relative abundance of cells carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso noted in the large majority of zzso cells of the six of these patients, was correlated significantly zzso zzso zzso with the ability of these cells to express zzso 6 zzso previously shown to be expressed at high levels in approximately zzso of primary zzso zzso In 16 patients, the presence of zzso zzso was observed only in zzso of zzso zzso The zzso involvement of some but not all zzso cells was further demonstrated by zzso analysis of individual clones grown in soft zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso complementary changes in zzso structure occurred in cells exhibiting zzso zzso of zzso For instance, zzso zzso of zzso and amplification or zzso of zzso have been observed in various tumor zzso Southern zzso analysis did not, however, reveal gross zzso of zzso gene structure or copy number in these zzso
