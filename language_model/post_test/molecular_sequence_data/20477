As one of the most important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to protect the zzso In this study, a full-length zzso of zzso was isolated from zzso grouper zzso zzso and the sequence analysis of deduced protein revealed the presence of only two zzso zzso zzso and the absence of the zzso zzso site and complementary determining region zzso The grouper zzso zzso was detected in almost all the peripheral zzso zzso especially the zzso zzso by zzso Additionally, zzso grouper zzso was zzso expressed in the zzso cell line and identified as a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the association of zzso zzso and zzso grouper zzso was zzso Taken together, the present study provided strong evidence that grouper zzso was produced as a zzso zzso and probably involved in the zzso zzso
