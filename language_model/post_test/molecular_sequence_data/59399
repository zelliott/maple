zzso acid zzso zzso is the second zzso involved in zzso zzso and is a member of the zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso clone of zzso were isolated from a zzso library and a zzso library of a hybrid zzso zzso zzso and were zzso They might be interrupted by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were very similar to each other not only in coding regions but also in zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that four zzso genes for zzso constructed a small gene family in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the promoter regions, there were many common zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso
