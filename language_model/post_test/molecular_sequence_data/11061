zzso have numerous lateral zzso in the position of their zzso but the molecular basis for the determination of zzso zzso zzso remains largely zzso zzso genes such as zzso and zzso are zzso zzso expressed in developing mouse zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso 

We have identified two highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the mouse zzso These two genes are tightly linked on mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both expressed in a zzso zzso fashion in mouse zzso However, the major expression zzso of the two genes are different: zzso expression is predominantly zzso to the left side of zzso neural tube, whereas zzso is strongly expressed in the lateral plate zzso on the left zzso In zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso which cause zzso zzso the expression sites of both genes are affected, either reversed or zzso indicating that zzso and zzso are downstream of zzso and zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso are not readily processed in cultured cells, zzso zzso proteins can be processed to a zzso zzso We have examined the activities of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In animal cap zzso zzso and zzso induce neural cells in the absence of zzso zzso The direct zzso activities of zzso and zzso thus seem remarkably similar to those of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso suggesting that the action of zzso and zzso may be to locally antagonize zzso zzso zzso zzso signals in zzso positioned on the left side of the mouse zzso 

There are two zzso genes in mice zzso and zzso both of which are expressed in a zzso zzso fashion and are downstream of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso possess direct zzso activity in zzso zzso resembling the activities of zzso zzso
