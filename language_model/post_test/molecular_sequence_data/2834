A mouse zzso segment containing three new members of the zzso zzso alpha zzso gene family was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso A 4 zzso zzso zzso contained a new zzso gene named zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the coding and zzso regions of this gene showed a high level of zzso to those of known members of the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso 8 gene in zzso cells and zzso translation of in zzso transcripts both led to a biologically active zzso The zzso activity was neutralized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso sequence shows features characteristic of an zzso regulatory region, the zzso 8 gene is not expressed in zzso zzso treated with zzso disease virus or zzso
