zzso zzso although causing a less serious disease than zzso zzso is the most widespread of the four human zzso zzso Further to the recent zzso of zzso zzso cases in the zzso Independent States zzso of central Asia, a survey on the genetic diversity and dissemination in zzso was zzso zzso is at the crossroads of Asia and, as such, could see a rise in the number of cases, although an effective malaria control zzso has been established in the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso from Central zzso were characterized by zzso the genetic zzso of the zzso protein zzso and the zzso surface protein 1 zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Analysis of zzso sequences showed that all the processed zzso belong to the zzso 210 type, with variations in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso in the repeat motif zzso along the zzso As far as zzso zzso is concerned, it was found that the majority of zzso zzso belong to zzso and Sal I zzso Five zzso zzso were also zzso Combined analysis with the two genetic markers allowed the identification of 19 zzso zzso 

The results obtained in the present study indicate that there are several zzso zzso clones circulating in zzso and, consequently, a careful malaria surveillance could be of paramount importance to zzso at early stage, the occurrence of possible zzso zzso malaria zzso
