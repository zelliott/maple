zzso the zzso regulator of gene expression of zzso zzso in zzso coli, contains a cluster of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso which resembles the zzso zzso of zzso zzso It is possible, therefore, zzso that zzso binds metals with the zzso as zzso and zzso that this property is related to the regulatory function of zzso These questions were investigated, with the following zzso zzso zzso of the 4 zzso zzso of zzso can be zzso with zzso in zzso zzso or zzso bacteria without the addition of reducing zzso The time required for zzso zzso of the zzso was 50 zzso in zzso bacteria and 6 zzso in zzso zzso The difference in the zzso was specific for the zzso of zzso These zzso zzso were also highly zzso in zzso grown bacteria, when the growth medium contained zzso agents such as zzso (15 zzso The effect of the zzso agents was reversed by an excess of zzso metal zzso such as zzso or zzso in the zzso The presence of zzso (10 zzso also zzso the expression of zzso zzso an zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso exists in two different forms which differ in terms of the zzso of their zzso zzso to zzso The zzso of both forms appears to be regulated by the availability of zzso and by the binding of metal zzso The two forms of zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
