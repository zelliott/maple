The amount of oxygen released by zzso roots and the community structure and in zzso activity of zzso bacteria in the root zzso were analyzed by the combined use of zzso zzso zzso analysis, quantitative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were obtained for individual roots of zzso in a horizontal flow reactor fed with artificial medium zzso zzso zzso profiles revealed that zzso was released at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso only in the zzso region (up to zzso 40 zzso from the root zzso where there was a high abundance zzso to zzso copies zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso however, sharply declined to the detection limit at positions more zzso than 80 zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene identified strains related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and strains related to zzso marina and zzso zzso as the zzso zzso in the root zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso the zzso region only extended about zzso zzso into the surrounding zzso due to a high rate of zzso consumption in the zzso The net zzso and zzso consumption rates in the zzso region were higher than those determined at the zzso zzso surface in which the abundance of zzso and zzso was one order of magnitude lower than in the zzso These results clearly indicated that zzso root zzso played an important role in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
