zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso (also called new duckling zzso belongs to the family zzso of zzso zzso We determined the DNA sequences of the zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso of four zzso zzso strains by directly sequencing zzso zzso zzso A sequence similarity analysis confirmed the zzso position of zzso zzso in the family zzso in zzso zzso V and allowed fine mapping of zzso zzso on a separate zzso branch zzso the most closely related species, zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso genes of the four zzso zzso strains varied between zzso and zzso but all of the strains occupied the same position on the zzso zzso In general, differences in zzso genes were observed among zzso zzso zzso even within a given zzso as shown by restriction zzso length zzso of zzso zzso zzso
