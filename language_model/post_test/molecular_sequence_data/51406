zzso is a zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso of a variety of cellular zzso The protein binds approximately 25 zzso of zzso with low affinity and approximately 1 zzso of zzso with high affinity and is believed to be a site for zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso In the present study, we describe zzso procedures for the isolation of zzso and native zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, using the zzso zzso fusion protein system, and was zzso to zzso on zzso followed by zzso Q zzso zzso A selective ammonium zzso zzso method was developed for the zzso of native zzso The protein was zzso from ammonium zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso procedures, which eliminates the need to prepare membrane zzso The zzso procedures reported here for zzso and native zzso yield homogeneous preparations of the zzso as judged by the zzso zzso zzso and by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso native and zzso zzso were identified by their zzso zzso acid zzso by their zzso binding properties, and by their zzso with zzso zzso
