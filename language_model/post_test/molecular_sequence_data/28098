The zzso gene family encodes at least three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso on cortical zzso and a number of T cell zzso On zzso zzso forms zzso complexes with zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso with zzso This report describes the isolation and characterization of zzso clones zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was used to investigate the formation of zzso zzso by zzso with other members of the zzso gene family and with zzso No zzso zzso were observed during transient expression in zzso zzso However, an exclusion hierarchy was observed between members of the zzso gene family when two or more members of the family were zzso into zzso zzso
