DNA complementary to zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso was cloned and five segments larger than zzso zzso were used in Northern zzso zzso analysis to identify two zzso zzso approximately 8 zzso zzso 1) and 3 zzso zzso 2) in zzso The clones selected as zzso did not zzso with zzso from various zzso or from beet zzso yellow vein zzso and peanut clump zzso In an attempt to determine the zzso position of the virus, about zzso of the zzso zzso 2 was zzso and four open reading frames zzso were zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 zzso proteins of Mr zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso 4 was zzso zzso 2, 3 and 4 overlapped in an arrangement closely resembling the triple gene block identified in zzso zzso 2, barley stripe mosaic virus zzso zzso 2, potato virus X and potato virus M zzso The presumed coat protein gene of zzso zzso 2 zzso 1) is situated to the zzso side of the triple gene block as for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were detected among the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected between the zzso protein of zzso zzso 2 and the zzso protein of zzso zzso 2, with a motif specific for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso viral DNA zzso zzso The presence of a triple gene block in zzso zzso 2 indicates that zzso has affinities with members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups but not with the zzso zzso The divided zzso zzso of zzso and the sizes of the two zzso suggest that zzso is most closely allied to the zzso but the unique nature of its different biological properties and lack of any zzso relationships with zzso lead us to conclude that zzso has no clear zzso to any zzso group of plant zzso
