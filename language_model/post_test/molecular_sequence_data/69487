DNA zzso generated by the zzso chain reaction zzso were used to differentiate clinical zzso of zzso This zzso method employed single zzso that were originally designed as zzso zzso for DNA zzso experiments to probe zzso and zzso DNA zzso To evaluate this zzso 35 zzso from 20 patients in several intensive care units and 12 zzso obtained from the oral cavities of healthy dental patients were zzso The zzso patterns of zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso patients revealed fewer differences than zzso from the dental zzso Multiple zzso from different body sites of the same patients revealed that patients may zzso zzso of zzso with the same or different zzso Since this method is generally simpler and faster than established methods of zzso medically important zzso zzso may prove useful for the surveying of large numbers of pathogens for zzso zzso
