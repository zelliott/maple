zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso which comprises three zzso the zzso zzso coding gene zzso zzso an MFS zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso gene is located upstream of the zzso genes in the opposite zzso In spite of this, zzso zzso zzso lacks the ability to zzso zzso This zzso zzso results from the genetic regulation of the genes coding for zzso transport and zzso proteins zzso by the zzso zzso protein since zzso zzso grow on zzso as the sole carbon zzso zzso binds to sites near the zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoters (one site downstream of the zzso with the consensus sequence zzso being required for its zzso The newly discovered zzso comprises the three basic functional elements required for zzso zzso regulation, zzso and metabolism to zzso further processed to the common intermediate of zzso zzso When relieved from zzso repression, zzso zzso which lacks a functional zzso zzso the zzso derived from zzso and imports it by the zzso zzso In order to use zzso from seaweed biomass zzso as a carbon source for the production of useful commodity chemicals and materials, an zzso system using the zzso promoter was zzso For zzso with the zzso we propose to zzso zzso as the zzso zzso
