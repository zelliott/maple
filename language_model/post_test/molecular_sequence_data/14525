Growing zzso ends serve as transient binding platforms for essential proteins that regulate zzso dynamics and their interactions with cellular zzso zzso proteins zzso autonomously recognize an extended region at growing zzso ends with unknown structural characteristics and then recruit other factors to the dynamic end zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging, we present a zzso model of how the zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the end zzso growing zzso The zzso zzso domain bridges zzso except at the zzso zzso By binding close to the zzso zzso site, the zzso domain is zzso positioned to sense the zzso zzso zzso The same zzso region is also a stabilizing structural cap protecting the zzso from zzso This insight supports a common structural link between two important biological phenomena, zzso dynamic instability and end zzso
