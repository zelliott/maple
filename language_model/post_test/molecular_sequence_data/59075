zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of higher plants exists as an zzso zzso that zzso the reductive step of the Calvin zzso In dark zzso the zzso exhibits a molecular mass of 600 zzso whereas in illuminated zzso the molecular mass is altered in favor of the more active 150 zzso zzso We have expressed in zzso coli proteins corresponding to the mature A and B zzso of spinach zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in addition to a zzso of the B zzso lacking the zzso zzso extension zzso One zzso of each of the three proteins so expressed was zzso to zzso zzso with conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli is shown to be a highly active zzso zzso zzso which does not associate under zzso conditions in zzso to zzso zzso forms of zzso 600 zzso Since B4 forms of the zzso have not been described from any source, we were surprised to find that spinach zzso zzso from zzso coli was active zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso from zzso coli is more highly active zzso zzso than zzso with the zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso lacking the zzso is a zzso that does not associate to zzso forms whereas zzso with the zzso occurs exclusively as an zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso association of zzso zzso in zzso occurs through zzso zzso zzso
