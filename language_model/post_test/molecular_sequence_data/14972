The timely breakdown of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso is essential for development, zzso and cell proliferation in plant and animal zzso zzso of the zzso green zzso zzso zzso that mediates breakdown of the zzso cell wall to liberate the daughter cells after cell division is characterized as a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is specifically transcribed during zzso phase in a synchronized zzso cell zzso In zzso analyses using a zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso the zzso is zzso after zzso cell division and accumulated in the daughter cells before zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso is localized to the zzso of the daughter cells within the zzso cell wall, and released into the culture zzso The data suggest that zzso is released from zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso cell wall, and then the daughter cells are hatched from the zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso
