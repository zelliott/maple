We determined almost complete zzso zzso DNA sequences for 12 zzso strains which were either previously classified as zzso strains or defined as zzso strains but shown to contain major amounts of zzso acid in their zzso zzso These sequences were subjected to zzso analyses together with the sequences of 34 zzso zzso zzso trees were reconstructed by using both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso species always formed a stable zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso appeared to be either a sister zzso of the zzso zzso or a lineage that originated from within zzso species, depending on the zzso zzso zzso trees were also constructed by using the sequences of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso species were consistently recovered as two distinct zzso independent of the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso evidence, we propose that the zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1982 should be zzso
