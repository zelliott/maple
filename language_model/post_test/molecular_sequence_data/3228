zzso zzso has a narrow, zzso distribution along the east coast of zzso We studied ticks from 17 localities throughout the geographic range of this zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is 793 zzso zzso We found zzso variation at eight of the 588 zzso positions zzso that were compared for all zzso There were eight different zzso zzso Most sequences were not restricted to a particular geographic zzso However, sequences zzso G and zzso which had an zzso at position zzso were found only in the far north of zzso other ticks had a zzso at this zzso The low level of zzso variation in this tick zzso contrasts with the sequence divergence between zzso zzso and its close relative, zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso does not contain cryptic species despite possible geographic isolation of some zzso We conclude that variation in the zzso is likely to be zzso about the zzso of the zzso
