The zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso and zzso to the complementary zzso zzso This sequence is derived from a spontaneous zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso tester strain of zzso zzso and is a hotspot for zzso pair zzso The solution structure of the modified duplex was examined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted in loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an approximately 24 degrees C decrease in zzso of the zzso zzso experiments revealed zzso zzso zzso which involved the modified base pair and its zzso base zzso At pH zzso the zzso resulted in a localized zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was rotated about the zzso bond from the anti to the zzso zzso thus placing the zzso zzso into the major zzso This resulted in the observation of a strong zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of the attached zzso Additional zzso were observed between the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso An zzso zzso resonance from the zzso complementary to zzso and zzso at zzso characteristic of a zzso base pair, was observed at 15 zzso but was broadened due to exchange with zzso The zzso zzso of the complementary zzso were shifted downfield from the other zzso zzso zzso characteristic of a zzso zzso at the site of zzso A second equilibrium involved the zzso base pair, which zzso between zzso and zzso zzso also via rotation of the zzso zzso bond from the anti to the zzso zzso The zzso exchange of the zzso base pair was sufficiently slow on the zzso time scale to allow simultaneous observation of zzso from the zzso and the zzso zzso
