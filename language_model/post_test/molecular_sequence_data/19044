A novel zzso strain designated zzso was isolated from northern zzso zzso This strain exhibited potent broad spectrum zzso activity against clinical zzso of zzso zzso species and several other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso developed zzso aerial zzso and pale zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso The isolate produced branching zzso zzso with zzso bearing zzso developing at a late stage of zzso The zzso contained smooth, zzso zzso zzso characteristics of strain zzso were typical of the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Low zzso zzso values were recorded between strain zzso and its closest zzso zzso zzso zzso was also distinguished from the nearest zzso zzso using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso and molecular properties, strain zzso is considered as a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
