The basic molecular mechanisms that govern the search for DNA zzso and subsequent zzso pairing during genetic zzso are not zzso zzso is the central zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso because several zzso zzso have been identified in zzso cells, it is likely that the mechanisms employed by zzso are zzso throughout zzso Analysis of the zzso of the zzso search and pairing reactions zzso by zzso should therefore provide insights of general relevance into the mechanisms by which zzso zzso and interact with, specific DNA zzso 

zzso forms zzso synaptic complexes with a zzso zzso and a zzso region in duplex zzso The zzso of this initial pairing reaction were characterized using duplex DNA molecules of various zzso and complexities containing a single target site, as well as various zzso of zzso zzso zzso The formation of the synaptic complex follows apparent zzso reaction zzso with a rate zzso to the zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso and the target sites within the duplex zzso The reaction rate is independent of the complexity of duplex DNA in the zzso We propose a kinetic scheme in which the zzso DNA filament interacts with duplex DNA and locates its target in a relatively fast zzso We also suggest that complex zzso changes occur during the subsequent zzso zzso 

We conclude that, during the formation of synaptic complexes by zzso the search for zzso is not zzso and that the iteration frequency of the search is around zzso zzso This value agrees well with what has been calculated as the minimum number for such a frequency in zzso searches, and limits the possible structures involved in the search for zzso to those involving very soft zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, from the order of the reaction at the DNA zzso found in zzso zzso and the rate constant of the overall reaction, we predict that the search for zzso is also not the zzso step in the zzso searches implicated in zzso and in gene zzso
