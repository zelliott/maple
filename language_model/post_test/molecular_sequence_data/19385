zzso E zzso is a major protein component of zzso zzso particles in the central nervous system and in zzso zzso of zzso are associated with cardiovascular disease and with a predisposition to Alzheimer's disease and other forms of zzso For full biological activity, zzso must be bound to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mimic many of these zzso In contrast to a widely accepted zzso model of zzso bound to zzso which is based on solution studies, an X-ray zzso study of zzso bound to zzso zzso indicated that zzso particles are zzso and that the packing of the zzso core is similar to a zzso Using zzso X-ray zzso we show that zzso particles in solution are zzso and that the shape of the zzso core is compatible with a zzso zzso The proposed model is consistent with the results of mass zzso analysis of products of limited zzso These revealed that the zzso regions of zzso in the particle are consistent with an zzso zzso
