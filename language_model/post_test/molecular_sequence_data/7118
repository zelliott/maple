The ability to interact with zzso cells is a crucial zzso attribute of the zzso and the zzso Like most bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso initiate infections by colonizing the zzso zzso which serves as the site of zzso After this step, both bacteria cross the intact zzso zzso While zzso zzso is likely to remain in the zzso zzso where it zzso an intense inflammatory reaction, zzso zzso enters the zzso and eventually the zzso fluid to cause zzso Both pathogens have evolved very similar mechanisms for interacting with host zzso Surface structures that influence zzso interactions include zzso the zzso class 5 outer membrane proteins or the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso This review examines what is known about the roles these structures play in bacterial zzso and invasion, with special emphasis, on zzso zzso Finally, the importance of these structures in zzso zzso is zzso
