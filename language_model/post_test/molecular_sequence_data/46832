We describe the identification and functional analysis of an evolutionary distinct new avian zzso zzso of snow geese zzso zzso with a duck zzso B virus zzso virus, designated zzso was demonstrated by detection of envelope proteins in zzso with zzso zzso and S zzso Comparative sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed unique zzso sequence features compared with other avian zzso Unlike zzso zzso shows an open reading frame in an analogous position to zzso X zzso Four of five cloned zzso were competent in zzso gene zzso and virus particle zzso in chicken zzso zzso zzso duck zzso were zzso for infection with zzso suggesting a similar or identical host zzso zzso was found to zzso a significant fraction of zzso particles containing zzso viral zzso This was observed both in cell culture medium of zzso zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso of several birds, suggesting that it is a stable trait of zzso Taken together, zzso has several unique features that expand the knowledge of the functional and evolutionary diversity of zzso and offers new experimental opportunities for studies on the life cycle of zzso
