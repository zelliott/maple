The selective amplification by zzso chain reaction zzso of gene fragments corresponding to new zzso receptors resulted in the cloning of 18 orphan members of this gene zzso Of these, three human clones amplified from zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be structurally zzso zzso clones corresponding to zzso and zzso were isolated and their putative coding region zzso Following the characterization of two zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso appeared to zzso the zzso zzso zzso whereas the partial clone zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso sequence suggests that the zzso zzso gene is split by an zzso in the zzso untranslated zzso The zzso zzso gene was mapped by in zzso zzso to the zzso region of the human zzso The zzso locus turned out to be a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with multiple zzso and point zzso introducing stop zzso Southern zzso on zzso DNA did not allow the further detection of related zzso in the human zzso
