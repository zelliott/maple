zzso cells employ a wide variety of strategies to reinforce and give pattern to their zzso cortical zzso Whereas some use common zzso elements such as zzso others are based on novel zzso proteins that are zzso in higher zzso The zzso zzso zzso possesses a continuous zzso of scales or plates, located within flattened zzso zzso zzso just below the plasma zzso and this provides rigidity and form to the zzso Using zzso techniques, the major proteins zzso these zzso zzso have been identified and termed zzso zzso and zzso The present report describes work leading to the molecular characterization of three zzso alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso zzso of 61 and 56 zzso and a zzso form zzso zzso All three proteins have features that are hallmarks of zzso a class of zzso proteins that has been identified in the zzso of a wide variety of zzso cells, including certain zzso zzso zzso and zzso Chief among these common features are a prominent primary domain of tandem zzso acid repeats, rich in zzso and zzso and a secondary domain of fewer, shorter repeating zzso However, variations in zzso acid use within both primary and secondary repetitive zzso and a much more zzso character zzso zzso of zzso indicate that the zzso represent the first proteins in a new zzso or family of zzso This conclusion is supported by another novel feature of the zzso the presence of a zzso zzso signal zzso at the zzso of each derived zzso zzso This zzso well with the final cellular location of the zzso which are assembled into plates within the zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report in any zzso of zzso proteins with such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso to the zzso as zzso reveals that new zzso plates zzso in cortical zones undergoing zzso label more faintly than mature parental zzso During plate assembly (or zzso the zzso thus appear to exist in a more soluble zzso
