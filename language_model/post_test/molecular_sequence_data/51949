We have analyzed the zzso locus zzso in four zzso human populations zzso of Northeast zzso zzso Indian of zzso New zzso zzso of zzso New zzso and a relatively homogeneous Caucasian population of North German zzso using both Southern zzso analysis and the zzso chain reaction zzso technique to: zzso compare the efficiency and limitation of Southern zzso versus zzso techniques in zzso variable number of tandem repeat zzso and zzso provide zzso frequency data at this locus in these four zzso defined zzso zzso zzso amplification of smaller zzso associated with zzso was corrected by lowering the DNA template concentration to 200 zzso and by reducing the extension time to 2 zzso A perfect correspondence was observed between the results from Southern zzso and zzso analysis in all but one zzso A very large zzso of approximately 24 to 25 repeat units, detected by Southern zzso could not be amplified by zzso resulting in an incorrect zzso rate of less than zzso Considering the grave consequences of zzso in forensic and zzso testing, it is suggested that zzso controls consisting of large and small zzso should be employed in each zzso experiment, and zzso zzso should be confirmed by Southern zzso zzso variation in the number and frequency of zzso at this locus was observed in the four examined zzso A total of 15 different zzso were zzso The average zzso varied from zzso in the zzso to zzso in the zzso No zzso zzso was observed at this locus in any of the examined zzso
