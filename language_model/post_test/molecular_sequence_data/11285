The zzso sequence of the zzso genes and their zzso zzso acid sequences were determined from 35 zzso species and compared with the published sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequences were zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid level, with total conservation of zzso acids determined to be associated with sites known to be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No apparent difference could be determined in the arrangement of zzso acids that would predict a functional difference in zzso from species associated with disease and zzso from species isolated only from the zzso Additionally, a zzso comparison of the sequences with published zzso zzso zzso using both genetic distance and maximum zzso methods, was zzso Few relationships were apparent that were well supported by both data sets, the most robust being a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
