The complete zzso sequences of the zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso the DNA sequences of the zzso genes from these bacteria were zzso zzso zzso and 59% similar, respectively, to the zzso coli zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins are 202 zzso long whereas that of zzso zzso is zzso Two putative zzso zzso binding sites were localized upstream of each of the zzso zzso the distance between them being 5 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso as in the zzso gene of zzso coli, and 3 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first zzso site present in the zzso operator of all five bacteria is very well zzso However, the second zzso box is considerably more zzso The zzso bond, at which the zzso zzso of zzso coli is zzso during the induction of the zzso response, is also found in the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Likewise, the zzso acids zzso and zzso are present in all of these three zzso zzso These zzso also exist in the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but they are displaced by 4 and 6 zzso zzso Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of zzso coli are highly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
