The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso synthetic zzso that acts as both a zzso for DNA binding and a zzso for targeted delivery to tumor zzso zzso forms a stable complex with zzso DNA, and the complex maintained high zzso efficiency after storage at 4 degrees C for six months and after four zzso zzso During the storage and zzso zzso the particle size of the zzso complex remained less than zzso The size of the complex is an important factor for its zzso into cells via the zzso zzso therefore, the stability of the particles will strongly contribute to high zzso efficiencies after storage and repeated zzso
