A zzso zzso zzso directed against an unknown zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and the respective zzso zzso has been zzso A zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso was used to select peptides from zzso display zzso The peptides identified from the zzso display library clones reacted specifically with the respective target zzso zzso and with human zzso previously identified as having zzso zzso to zzso zzso The selected zzso zzso sequences tended to be composed of charged zzso surrounding a core of zzso zzso The zzso with the best binding could inhibit zzso of binding to the zzso suggesting that the selected zzso binds the zzso of the respective zzso The zzso reacted with human zzso previously determined by zzso to have zzso zzso zzso The zzso was competitively zzso with the zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso in an indirect zzso zzso format, demonstrating its potential utility in the development of zzso The use of this novel zzso may allow investigators to establish standardized zzso free from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso
