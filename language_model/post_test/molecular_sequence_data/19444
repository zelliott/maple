Several naturally occurring zzso zzso T cells were isolated from zzso infiltrates of zzso zzso In accordance with the results of others, these T cells recognized the segment of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso encompassing the zzso sequence bound zzso to zzso in two main zzso registers in which two zzso at the zzso end, zzso and zzso influenced binding and T cell zzso zzso occurring zzso T cells exhibited differing zzso with the zzso zzso zzso although various single zzso changes in either the zzso or the core segments affected T cell zzso The insulin peptides represent another example of a weak zzso zzso that is highly zzso giving rise to distinct populations of zzso T zzso
