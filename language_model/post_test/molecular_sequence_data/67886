The zzso zzso of a zzso of the zzso binding site of zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity by suppressing the zzso of alcohol zzso zzso and zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso facilitated the zzso of the same zzso We have determined the zzso potential of the zzso zzso by measuring their zzso mobility to study the effects of the surface charge on the zzso of protein zzso The zzso zzso possesses a large negative zzso potential value which is unaffected by the binding of the zzso charged zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is stable as a zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso possesses a low zzso potential value, which was significantly reduced with the binding of the zzso charged zzso The canceling of the surface charge of the zzso zzso upon zzso binding reduces zzso stability and thereby zzso protein zzso These results indicate that one of the key factors determining whether zzso zzso display zzso or zzso activity is their zzso interaction with the zzso The surface of the zzso zzso comprises a zzso environment, and the zzso activity of the zzso zzso is best explained by the zzso zzso binding driven by zzso zzso On the basis of these findings, we designed zzso of zzso zzso of zzso that prevent protein zzso associated with neurodegenerative zzso
