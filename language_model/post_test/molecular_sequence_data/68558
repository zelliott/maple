We used DNA zzso by the arbitrarily primed zzso chain reaction zzso technique for an zzso investigation of 23 zzso zzso zzso obtained from 11 zzso zzso zzso patients attending our zzso zzso This approach was compared with zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identical in resolving power, since the two methods generated four different profiles and identified the same group of zzso Six patients on the one hand and four on the other zzso strains of the same zzso thus raising the possibility of either zzso transmission or acquisition from a common hospital environmental zzso zzso results were in good agreement with those of the other two methods, but zzso seems more zzso since it generated a fifth profile for a single strain in a group of zzso Our results show in zzso stability for the three methods during a period extending from 3 to 41 zzso These zzso techniques are particularly promising for clinical laboratories to help to clarify the epidemiology of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso method constitutes an easier alternative to the well-established zzso zzso zzso provides the zzso results with minimal technical zzso However, our results suggest that it is less zzso than the zzso zzso zzso
