Due to the slightly success of protein secondary structure prediction using the various zzso and zzso techniques, similar techniques have been developed for predicting zzso in proteins by Kaur and zzso zzso A zzso based method for prediction of zzso in proteins from multiple sequence zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso However, the major limitation of previous methods was inability in predicting zzso zzso In a recent investigation we introduced a sequence based predictor model for predicting zzso types in proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso types prediction in proteins using the support zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present work, in order to analyze the effect of sequence and structure in the formation of zzso types and predicting zzso types in zzso we applied novel hybrid neural zzso modeling zzso As the result, this study clarified the efficiency of using the statistical model zzso in determining the effective zzso Moreover, the optimal structure of neural network can be simplified by a zzso in the first stage of hybrid approach, thereby reducing the needed time for neural network training procedure in the second stage and the probability of zzso occurrence decreased and a high precision and reliability obtained in this zzso
