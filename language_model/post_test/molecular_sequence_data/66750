zzso is a zzso zzso protein involved in several distinct zzso events including zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion, zzso junction formation and the zzso to zzso protein targeting zzso zzso associates with the zzso membrane via zzso and zzso zzso has three putative zzso sites, at zzso 4, 5 and zzso Here, we show that each of these zzso may serve as a zzso zzso zzso at zzso 7 alone provides partial function of zzso whereas zzso at either zzso 4 or zzso 5 alone is sufficient for zzso zzso In the former zzso there is a severe zzso in the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso while in the latter zzso there is a partial zzso in the zzso of zzso In addition, our studies provide evidence that zzso targets zzso to specific membrane zzso
