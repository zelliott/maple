In zzso zzso regulation of zzso plays an important role in the checkpoint zzso zzso to completion of DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso abolish checkpoint control without seriously affecting normal cell zzso However the molecular basis of this zzso is not zzso To better understand the role of zzso in checkpoint control, we have screened for more zzso in zzso zzso zzso with this zzso We have isolated zzso and zzso as well as three new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The altered zzso map to two different regions on opposite faces of the zzso suggesting that the interaction between zzso and components of the checkpoint zzso may be zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso the new zzso alter zzso that are zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso including the human zzso zzso zzso of the equivalent human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso checkpoint control, suggesting that these zzso could be involved in zzso regulation of other zzso zzso
