Recent work has shown that zzso zzso zzso the application of zzso tools to analyze preserved DNA in zzso records, is a promising approach to reconstruct the diversity of past zzso zzso This provides information about past ecological and environmental zzso A major advantage of this approach is that individual species, including those that did not leave other characteristic zzso can be zzso In this study, we determined which zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso provided the most detailed information about the zzso succession of zzso in an Antarctic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The preserved zzso revealed two intervals in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso diversity was the highest until approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and included zzso related to known zzso zzso A lower concentration of zzso in sediments zzso zzso zzso zzso coincided with a community shift towards a predominance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is not a source of zzso zzso cultures of zzso zzso are known to produce other diagnostic zzso but these were not recovered zzso In addition, conspicuous resting zzso of zzso zzso were not preserved in the analyzed zzso Overall, zzso were rare and the zzso zzso approach revealed the highest diversity of zzso in Ellis zzso and was the only approach that recorded a shift in zzso composition at approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso indicative of a colder climate with more extensive ice cover - this timing zzso with a period of changing climate reported for this zzso
