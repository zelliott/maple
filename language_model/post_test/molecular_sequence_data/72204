zzso element binding protein zzso 1 and zzso are zzso expressed zzso factors that play key roles in the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid zzso zzso and zzso share approximately zzso sequence identity and map to zzso 17 and 22, zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso In this paper we describe the gene structure and zzso sequence of zzso zzso spans 72 zzso and is composed of 19 zzso and 18 zzso The locations of the zzso boundaries of zzso are remarkably similar to those of zzso but zzso is approximately zzso times larger in zzso The zzso regions of zzso and of two alternatively spliced forms of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and the zzso zzso start site was zzso A perfect zzso zzso regulatory element zzso sequence was present in the promoter region of zzso No zzso was identified in the zzso sequences of either zzso or zzso but several zzso sequences were present in zzso Thus, analysis of the zzso regions provides support that these two zzso factors, though similar in their coding sequence and overall gene structure, have different zzso zzso Finally, evidence is presented for the presence of another expressed gene of unknown function located 500 zzso upstream of zzso
