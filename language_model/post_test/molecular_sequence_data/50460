zzso zzso zzso zzso which are arrested at the zzso border of zzso contain an inactive zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that is activated when zzso are zzso to resume the zzso cell zzso We have made extracts from these zzso that respond to four cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso clam zzso A delta 60 and B delta 97, and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso All four induce the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso acid, but not zzso also lead to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes in extracts of zzso zzso Using extracts prepared from zzso zzso cells, we show that although zzso zzso can occur in response to zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso occurs without intervening zzso zzso Neither the zzso zzso nor zzso a zzso that lacks the zzso consensus sequence directing zzso and subsequent membrane association, is an effective zzso of zzso in zzso
