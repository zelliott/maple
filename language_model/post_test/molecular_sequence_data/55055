zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso gene of zzso This gene is located on zzso 1, spans zzso and contains 12 zzso and 11 zzso Previous studies have reported three transcript zzso zzso produced by alternative zzso C1 contains all the 12 reported zzso C2 uses an zzso alternate zzso site in zzso and zzso produced by zzso zzso These zzso differ in their channel zzso and opening zzso In our study, we report the presence of two new transcript zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expressed in mouse zzso day 3 and adult skeletal zzso These transcripts contain novel first coding zzso either zzso or zzso zzso is located in the zzso zzso while zzso is an extended zzso zzso extension of zzso contains an initiation zzso which produces a novel transcript zzso Either of the two zzso can zzso with the internal zzso to produce mature transcripts making different zzso ends of the zzso zzso the proteins zzso by these two transcripts differ at zzso The presence of zzso zzso containing transcript was further supported by the availability of zzso from the zzso These new zzso display zzso zzso They differ in the presence of signal zzso zzso and zzso of their zzso acid zzso of the new zzso of the gamma zzso
