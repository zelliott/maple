Multiple sequence alignment can be a useful technique for studying molecular evolution and analyzing zzso zzso Until recently, it has been zzso to apply dynamic programming, the most widely accepted method for producing zzso zzso to comparisons of more than three zzso We describe the design and application of a tool for multiple alignment of zzso acid sequences that zzso a new zzso that greatly reduces the zzso demands of dynamic zzso This tool is able to align in reasonable time as many as eight sequences the length of an average zzso
