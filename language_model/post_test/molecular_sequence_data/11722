A zzso Carlo zzso simulation was used to investigate the behavior of zzso zzso coat proteins in a model membrane zzso Our simulation agrees with the previous experimental observations that despite the low sequence similarity between the major coat proteins of zzso and zzso zzso their structure in the membrane environment is very zzso These results support the hypothesis that the zzso effect exerts an important influence on membrane protein zzso The model may also be used for modeling the zzso and transport processes in zzso zzso The example of zzso protein was also used as a test of sensitivity of our model to temperature, thickness of the hydrocarbon phase, and simulation zzso In all cases, the results were independent (over the tested zzso of the particular values of the zzso
