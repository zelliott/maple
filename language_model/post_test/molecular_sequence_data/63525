The zzso zzso has a unique structure zzso the zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso are key zzso for its zzso However, the different functional roles of these zzso in its zzso remain zzso Recently, we reported that a zzso form of this zzso which is zzso by zzso but not by zzso is expressed on two zzso in mouse zzso In this study, we found that a novel zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso in mouse kidney was enriched in the nuclear zzso The protein was zzso and identified as zzso and we also confirmed the zzso zzso structure including zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso of kidney sections revealed that zzso appeared not to be zzso with the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso treatment strengthened the signals of both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso resulting in overlapping of zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso on zzso is usually embedded and masked in the robust basement membrane in tight association with other zzso To clarify the associated proteins and the functional role of the zzso zzso we investigated the interaction between zzso and zzso through their zzso in mouse kidney using the overlay zzso zzso We obtained evidence that zzso acid as well as zzso acid inhibited this interaction, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso on zzso may regulate its binding and play a role in maintenance of the proper structure in the kidney zzso zzso
