zzso sequence tags zzso that showed significant zzso to rat zzso zzso were found in a human fetal brain zzso zzso A protein coded by the zzso showed zzso identity to rat zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the generation of mature peptides from rat zzso it was expected that zzso at zzso zzso acids in the zzso portion of the coded protein might produce at least two different sizes of mature peptides with 29 and 17 zzso acid zzso zzso We chemically zzso the predicted mature zzso with 17 zzso acid zzso zzso and examined its biological zzso It bound to all human zzso zzso zzso zzso in almost the same manner as rat zzso It also inhibited zzso production induced by zzso through zzso Administration of zzso to the cerebral zzso showed zzso of cortical and zzso zzso in zzso These results indicate that a zzso zzso zzso by the zzso is a human counterpart corresponding to rat zzso
