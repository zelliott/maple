zzso gene expression is a critical component of the lung zzso rejection zzso response and tolerance development in rat zzso In order to determine the specificity of zzso gene expression for zzso and zzso we examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso and control zzso zzso levels in two models of rat lung zzso rejection by zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso Southern zzso The first model zzso develops a mild to moderate zzso zzso on days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which spontaneously resolves by day 35 zzso with subsequent development of zzso tolerance zzso surviving without evidence of zzso for zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso develops a similar zzso zzso by day 14 zzso but by day 21 zzso the graft shows severe zzso zzso zzso and has zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso was extracted from zzso removed on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 35 and 42 zzso Five animals for each group zzso and zzso were examined at each time point, except that no animals in the zzso were examined on day zzso zzso was zzso from total extracted zzso and zzso specific for rat zzso rat zzso rat zzso rat zzso zzso and rat zzso were used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso 20 zzso The cycles numbers chosen for comparison were found to be optimal during preliminary experiments and occurred during the exponential phase of zzso zzso products were zzso on a zzso gel and zzso zzso were subsequently zzso to nylon zzso which were zzso with zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso gene expression was similar for both models at all time points zzso this also served as an internal standard for zzso In the zzso tolerance model, zzso zzso levels were not zzso on days 3 and 7 zzso were at very low levels on day 14 and were zzso on day 21 zzso In marked contrast, the zzso rejection model showed zzso zzso present on day 3 which increased markedly on day 7 and peaked on day 14 zzso zzso zzso levels decreased on days 21 and 35 zzso a time when the lung was undergoing zzso The pattern of zzso and zzso zzso expression was similar to that for zzso However, zzso zzso was clearly zzso in the zzso tolerance model on day 7 and zzso was not present until day 14 zzso The zzso rejection model showed very high levels of zzso and zzso on day 3 which peaked on day zzso The ratio of zzso in the zzso rejection model was more than 5 times that seen in the zzso tolerance model on day 3 zzso zzso zzso The ratio of zzso was higher zzso zzso in the zzso rejection model than in the zzso tolerance model zzso zzso zzso on day zzso On day 14 zzso the zzso ratio in the zzso rejection model was three times that of the tolerance model zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio was zzso times greater in the zzso tolerance model than in the zzso model zzso zzso zzso This was due to equal expression of zzso and zzso in the rejection model, but poor zzso expression in the tolerance zzso 

1) The zzso tolerance model develops mild to moderate zzso infiltrates on day 14 which is associated with low level zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso are present at day 3; however, by day 14, zzso is the predominantly expressed zzso zzso and zzso is not zzso The infiltrates ultimately resolve and the animals develop a functional tolerance to their zzso
