The zzso sequence of a zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso was zzso The sequence contains an entire zzso region of zzso zzso which encodes an zzso zzso of 260 zzso zzso The DNA sequence coding for zzso zzso was placed under the control of the alcohol zzso I promoter of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso capable of autonomous replication in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells transformed by this zzso showed zzso zzso activity and were used in zzso zzso zzso These experiments revealed that the zzso concentration in zzso fermented by the zzso zzso strain was significantly lower than that in zzso fermented by the parental zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso activity produced by zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and that this degradation caused a decrease in zzso zzso
