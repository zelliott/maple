zzso possess a zzso zzso apparatus that is involved in protein import into the zzso zzso We have analyzed one of the genes essential for this process, zzso A zzso gene from the zzso red zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso active, demonstrating for the first time that zzso is functional in a zzso Unlike the situation seen in bacteria the zzso zzso gene is transcribed zzso despite the fact that it is part of a large zzso gene cluster that resembles bacterial zzso zzso A molecular zzso is presented for 8 zzso zzso zzso four of which have not been published zzso In this analysis zzso zzso genes fall into two zzso One of these, zzso of genes from zzso red algae and zzso clusters in a zzso tree with a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso are zzso genes from zzso zzso and a zzso red zzso All zzso and zzso sequences are located on the same branch, separated from bacterial zzso We zzso that the two classes of zzso genes are zzso zzso their gene products are involved in different protein zzso zzso Based on this assumption a model for the evolution of the zzso zzso apparatus is zzso
