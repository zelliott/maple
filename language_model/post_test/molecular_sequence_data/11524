To determine whether zzso in the D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso gene are associated with zzso the coding sequence was examined in 106 zzso 11 African-American, 8 Asian, and 6 Native American zzso zzso 350 zzso of zzso sequence was screened by zzso zzso a method related to single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis that detects virtually zzso of sequence changes zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso was identified in Asians and one in zzso but neither altered the zzso acid sequence zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a previously reported zzso in the zzso untranslated region of zzso 2 at zzso zzso was found to be common, with an zzso frequency of approximately zzso in Caucasians of Western European zzso Based on the fact that no sequence changes of likely functional significance were identified, these data suggest that zzso affecting the structure of the D1 zzso zzso protein are uncommon and are unlikely to contribute significantly to the genetic predisposition to zzso The D1 DR gene also was examined in eight zzso including 3 African-Americans and 1 Native American, but no sequence changes were zzso
