Japanese quail zzso total zzso was zzso from total zzso by the classical method, using zzso reverse zzso the zzso zzso of DNA zzso I and zzso zzso The results of the synthesis of total zzso partially differed from those published for the synthesis of chicken total zzso The presumed causes of the differences in the complete reverse zzso of zzso and incomplete reverse zzso of zzso and a large part of zzso in our case are zzso An zzso strategy was used for cloning full-length zzso The total zzso was zzso then zzso by zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso of different lengths were isolated from the gel using zzso cellulose zzso A zzso fraction about zzso zzso long containing full-length zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and cloned into competent zzso coli zzso zzso zzso clones were screened for the presence of full-length zzso initially by insert size and then by means of zzso zzso Four clones containing zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso ends in one of these clones were zzso zzso of these sequences with those of chicken zzso indicated that almost full-length zzso had been zzso They lacked a small number of zzso at their zzso ends, which had probably been split off during the degradation of the hairpin loop by zzso zzso A sequence of zzso bases from the zzso end of zzso is presented and compared with the known sequence of chicken zzso The advantages of the cloning strategy zzso in particular, its cloning efficiency and the possibility of simultaneously identifying clones of also other zzso zzso species (in this work: zzso and, tentatively, zzso are zzso
