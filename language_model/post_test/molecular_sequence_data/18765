Two novel zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were isolated from soil and zzso samples from zzso and zzso hot springs, zzso zzso Their young cells in the exponential phase of growth were zzso zzso straight zzso zzso zzso in size, but they became zzso long, approximately zzso by zzso zzso after the stationary phase of zzso zzso varied in tests for zzso and had a zzso positive reaction for zzso Both strains could grow between 40 and 70 zzso with optimal growth at 60 zzso zzso and 55 zzso zzso Growth occurred within the range pH zzso with optimal growth at pH zzso zzso and pH zzso zzso zzso zzso grew within a zzso range from 0 zzso zzso zzso with optimal growth at zzso while strain zzso grew within the range zzso zzso with an optimum at zzso The new zzso differed from each other in some zzso and zzso characters as well as repetitive zzso zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities suggested distant relationships with other members of the family zzso zzso although the two strains showed zzso sequence similarity between them, and had zzso zzso by zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso data of zzso and zzso zzso of low amounts of zzso acid, zzso to zzso zzso types in zzso fatty acids including zzso zzso zzso and zzso supported the consideration of these zzso as members of a novel zzso Based upon zzso zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that new zzso represent a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
