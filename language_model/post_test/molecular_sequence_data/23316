zzso is an abundant zzso whose degradation is zzso primarily by bacterial zzso We developed a zzso zzso primer set to amplify a approximately zzso zzso of family 18, group I zzso genes and used it to retrieve these gene fragments from environmental zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso genes were created for nine water and six zzso samples from 10 aquatic environments including freshwater and saline lakes, zzso water and zzso and the central Arctic zzso zzso zzso sequences were also retrieved from the zzso Sea zzso sequence zzso We were unable to obtain zzso product with these zzso from an zzso zzso lake zzso Lake, zzso In total, 108 partial zzso gene sequences were zzso with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 13 zzso sequences obtained from each zzso All zzso sequences were novel compared to previously identified zzso zzso sequence diversity was low, while we found significant differences between libraries from different water column samples and between water column and zzso zzso However, identical sequences were retrieved from samples collected at widely distributed locations that did not necessarily represent similar zzso suggesting zzso of zzso communities between some zzso
