We have screened zzso 11 of the low density zzso zzso zzso gene from familial zzso zzso zzso for point zzso by using analysis of single strand zzso zzso zzso A zzso pattern was observed in three out of 39 zzso By DNA sequencing, this zzso pattern was found to be due to a zzso transition at zzso zzso that affects the third base of zzso zzso A zzso method was developed to screen FH zzso and normal subjects for this zzso The gene zzso in FH zzso and normal subjects were zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso cannot be in linkage zzso with a zzso that causes zzso Rather, the zzso may be a useful genetic marker at the zzso zzso zzso analysis at the zzso locus in two FH families where the zzso possessed the zzso revealed that the zzso was on two different zzso This finding is consistent with the zzso occurring at a zzso hot zzso
