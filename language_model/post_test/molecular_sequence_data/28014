A zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was isolated by screening a zzso zzso expression library with zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence predicts a mature protein containing zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso preceded by a leader zzso of 24 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the sequence deduced from the zzso Some zzso zzso in zzso sequence and zzso in zzso acid zzso is observed between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The highest degree of similarity is observed near the zzso active zzso zzso essential for zzso activity, the zzso and zzso zzso can be identified in the zzso acid zzso Near these zzso zzso is also observed with several other zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cultures indicates that the level of zzso zzso zzso with expression of the zzso and its zzso This is consistent with the regulation of the zzso being at the level of zzso
