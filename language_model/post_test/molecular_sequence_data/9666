Human zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a zzso repeat zzso binds the blood zzso protein human zzso zzso with extraordinary affinity zzso zzso zzso Here we report a zzso A resolution crystal structure for the zzso complex that, together with extensive zzso data from earlier studies, reveals the molecular features of this tight zzso The zzso binding interface is large and encompasses 26 zzso from zzso and 24 from zzso recruited from multiple zzso of both zzso However, a substantial fraction of the energetically important contacts involve only a single region of each: the zzso segment zzso of zzso and the zzso active zzso of zzso most notably the zzso zzso zzso Although the overall zzso of zzso resembles that observed for zzso A in the crystal structure of its complex with the zzso zzso zzso the vast majority of the interactions in the two complexes are distinctive, indicating that the broad specificity of the inhibitor for pancreatic zzso zzso proteins is based largely on its capacity to recognize features unique to each of zzso The implications of these findings for the development of small, zzso zzso of zzso for therapeutic use are zzso
