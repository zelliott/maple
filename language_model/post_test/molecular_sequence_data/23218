A critical step in the development of zzso zzso into mature red blood cells is the zzso of the nucleus, followed by zzso degradation of the remaining zzso It has been hypothesized that the breakdown of cellular zzso in rabbit zzso is initiated by zzso In zzso the zzso rabbit zzso zzso binds and zzso zzso zzso thereby releasing the zzso contents of the zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso leads to the collapse of the zzso pH zzso in zzso cells, using a novel reporter of zzso zzso zzso No change in zzso pH was observed with a zzso of zzso that lacks zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is capable of zzso the pH zzso maintained by zzso in living cells without additional factors specific for red blood cell zzso
