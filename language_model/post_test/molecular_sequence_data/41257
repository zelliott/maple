zzso zzso islands zzso are small zzso islands that are zzso by zzso zzso zzso elements zzso due to similar origins of zzso Their zzso integration and zzso are zzso by the zzso that they zzso but their zzso transfer entirely depends upon the zzso machinery of zzso zzso In this study, we report the mechanisms that control the zzso and integration processes of zzso We found that while the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to promote zzso integration, efficient zzso from the host zzso requires the combined action of zzso and of a novel zzso zzso factor, zzso We determined that the genes zzso these proteins are activated by zzso the main zzso zzso of zzso zzso Although they share the same regulators, we found that unlike zzso zzso has a zzso level of expression in the absence of zzso These findings explain how an zzso can integrate into the zzso of a new host in the absence of a zzso ICE and shed new light on the cross talk that can occur between zzso and zzso elements that mobilize them, helping us to understand part of the rules that dictate horizontal transfer zzso
