The influenza virus zzso zzso has been adapted to grow in zzso or chicken zzso cells zzso in the absence of zzso Changes occurred in the biological properties of the virus zzso selected, depending on the cell type used for zzso They coincided with enhanced zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In the case of zzso cell selected zzso growth, plaque formation, and zzso zzso were restricted to this cell type, whereas the zzso zzso displayed altered activities in a broad range of host zzso Unlike the zzso virus and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had acquired zzso properties for zzso By zzso sequence analysis of the zzso genes of the zzso cell zzso several point zzso were found, which were localized predominantly at the zzso zzso part of the zzso zzso The mechanism by which these point zzso increased zzso zzso has not been zzso In the zzso zzso besides point zzso an zzso of 54 zzso adjacent to the zzso site was observed, which zzso in its sequence to a region in the 28 S zzso zzso This zzso is probably responsible for the altered zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leading to increased growth potential and zzso
