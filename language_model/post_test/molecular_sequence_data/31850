Recent developments in molecular diagnostic tools have led to the easy and rapid detection of a large number of zzso zzso zzso However, the lack of clinical and zzso data zzso the interpretation of these diagnostic zzso From October 2009 to January 2011, we conducted a prospective study in hospitalized children from whom samples were taken for the detection of respiratory zzso zzso zzso and zzso data from zzso patients with zzso disease episodes were zzso When zzso tested positive, strains were further characterized by sequencing the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was the single respiratory virus detected in 254 disease episodes zzso Overall, 99 different zzso were detected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso had more underlying pulmonary illness compared with patients with no virus zzso zzso or patients with another respiratory virus besides zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of breath and a need for oxygen were significantly more present in patients with zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso required extra zzso No respiratory zzso except for oxygen need, was zzso of the presence of zzso In zzso of zzso disease episodes, zzso infection was hospital zzso zzso analysis revealed several clusters of zzso in more than zzso of these clusters zzso information was suggestive of transmission within specific zzso In conclusion, the detection of zzso may help in explaining respiratory illness, particular in patients with pulmonary zzso zzso zzso provides opportunities for timely zzso of infection control measures to prevent zzso zzso
