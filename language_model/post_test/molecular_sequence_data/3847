zzso zzso zzso zzso rich in zzso also called zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso whose modular organization has been highly zzso between zzso and zzso indicating a conservation of function during zzso zzso Genome analysis has revealed a single copy of the zzso ( zzso zzso As a first step towards investigating the function of zzso in zzso we examined its zzso distribution during zzso During zzso zzso zzso transcripts are restricted to zzso zzso zzso and the fat zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso by the zzso and fat body cells is concentrated in zzso zzso surrounding internal zzso During zzso zzso transcripts are restricted to the zzso cells of the zzso and zzso zzso with embryonic development, the zzso protein is concentrated in zzso zzso zzso in type IV collagen are associated with a dramatic decrease in zzso protein zzso in zzso The data suggest that the production and assembly of zzso in the zzso zzso is dependent on type IV zzso and raise the possibility that zzso and type IV collagen interactions are a prerequisite to the assembly and structural integrity of zzso zzso in zzso
