This paper describes the characterization of zzso a zzso clone from rice zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso class of putative zzso zzso zzso maps to zzso 10 and belongs to a family of related rice zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso protein can zzso but can also form zzso with an zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso interactions may also occur between different zzso proteins in rice, which would provide enormous versatility for generating specific zzso zzso zzso zzso could be detected in various rice zzso at different zzso zzso with highest levels in zzso shoots of zzso and leaves of mature zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso retarded growth and affected leaf size and shape, indicative of a role as zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso interacts with the zzso sequence zzso confirming that the protein represents a zzso zzso zzso was found to repress reporter gene activity in rice suspension cells, most likely by a mechanism of active zzso zzso zzso was strictly dependent on the presence of upstream zzso binding sites in the reporter gene zzso and a function of the zzso region of zzso preceding the zzso
