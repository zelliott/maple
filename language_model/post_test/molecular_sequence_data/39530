The involvement of zzso zzso in the interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in an in zzso zzso zzso PA zzso in zzso were zzso after 1, 3, and 5 weeks in dual culture with zzso zzso and changes in PA pools were compared with the growth of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were localized during the formation of zzso During zzso formation, zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found in developing zzso mantle and zzso net, and zzso zzso zzso transcripts in specific root zzso cells adjacent to zzso and in zzso cells of the root zzso zzso However, no zzso difference in zzso transcript zzso between zzso and zzso roots was zzso Regardless of the unchanged distribution of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso increased free zzso zzso and zzso zzso in roots within the first week in dual zzso The concentration of free and zzso zzso and zzso zzso also increased in the needles due to the zzso The zzso lateral root formation and main root zzso were greatest between the first and third week in dual culture, coinciding with retarded zzso or a decrease of free zzso These results show that zzso of zzso in the host plant is one of the first indicators of the establishment of zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the in zzso zzso
