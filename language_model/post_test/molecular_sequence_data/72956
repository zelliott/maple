Resistance to zzso acid in zzso zzso is due to zzso of an zzso zzso zzso that converts the steroid zzso into an inactive zzso zzso and several internal zzso acid sequences were prepared from the zzso zzso Using one of the deduced zzso to probe a zzso DNA library, the zzso gene was cloned and zzso zzso analysis located an zzso which, zzso to the presence of two putative start zzso indicates a predicted protein with 520 or zzso zzso zzso A signal zzso was identified by aligning the deduced zzso acids with the zzso sequence determined for the mature zzso The zzso part of the deduced zzso contains a region of three zzso repeated stretches of 50 zzso zzso which is preceded and followed by zzso acids showing high zzso with the zzso zzso was found to share a zzso motif with some deduced zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso on a zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso equally well an zzso a zzso or a zzso group from the 16 zzso of zzso acid and its zzso However, a zzso group at the 16 zzso was attacked with difficulty and a 16 zzso group was not zzso at zzso These data indicate that zzso is a highly specific zzso The zzso gene is widely distributed among zzso that modify zzso acid to its inactive zzso zzso
