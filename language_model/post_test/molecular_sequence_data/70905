zzso zzso zzso represent the zzso oldest zzso zzso Recently, from the marine sponge zzso zzso a first zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso was zzso In the present study basic functional experiments have been conducted to test the hypothesis that in sponges zzso zzso also function as zzso molecules and as zzso signaling zzso The sponge zzso zzso has been used for the experiments because from this sponge only has a cell culture been zzso Here we report that zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is blocked by the zzso zzso which is known to interact with beta zzso Both zzso and zzso were found to stimulate DNA synthesis within 24 zzso The beta zzso of the zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso the estimated zzso zzso comprises the characteristic zzso zzso conservation of the beta zzso was assessed by comparison with corresponding beta zzso zzso from evolutionary higher zzso zzso zzso of zzso or of zzso to isolated cells of zzso zzso causes a rapid zzso 1-2 zzso increase in the zzso zzso concentration which is further zzso in the presence of zzso Furthermore, incubation of the cells with zzso or zzso causes an zzso of the zzso protein zzso In addition it is shown that after a prolonged incubation of the cells with zzso and zzso the expression of the genes coding for Ras and for zzso is zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso functions in the sponge system not only as zzso zzso but also as a zzso involved in zzso zzso
