zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso protein zzso that is essential in regulating diverse cellular zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso of human zzso gamma 1 and its complex with zzso at zzso A zzso The anomalous scattering from zzso was used in a multiple wavelength anomalous zzso experiment to derive zzso phase zzso The protein adopts a single domain with a novel fold, distinct from that of the protein zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso and zzso is situated at the zzso site that binds the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso was used to identify the nature of the zzso bound to the zzso The structural data indicate that zzso is zzso in a single step by a zzso water zzso This contrasts with other zzso including protein zzso zzso acid and alkaline zzso which form zzso zzso The structure of zzso provides insight into the molecular mechanism for zzso recognition, zzso regulation and zzso of this zzso by toxins and zzso promoters and a basis for understanding the expanding family of related zzso which include zzso and zzso zzso
