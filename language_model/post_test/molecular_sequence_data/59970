zzso a zzso factor, zzso the zzso of the zzso gene through binding to the zzso sequences in the promoter excluding zzso from binding to these zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso gene was isolated by zzso chain reaction of the zzso zzso DNA library using the zzso primer and the zzso zzso zzso The elements required for zzso of the zzso promoter following serum stimulation were zzso by zzso of zzso rat zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso sequential deletions or base zzso The results showed that the promoter was activated by zzso and zzso through the E box and zzso zzso The formation of zzso complexes with zzso zzso containing the E box or zzso site with cell extracts prepared during zzso progression was correlated with the promoter zzso and greatly reduced by zzso of zzso or zzso from the zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso gene is a target of zzso and zzso and that these factors repress the zzso gene expression through induction of zzso during zzso phase zzso
