zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso possesses a zzso metal center in which two metal zzso are bridged by a zzso zzso zzso Here, we characterized zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited no activity but could be activated when zzso with some metal zzso before analyzing its activity, and was in the order: zzso zzso zzso however, activity of zzso zzso zzso was also significantly inhibited with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was increased by adding the reducing agent zzso zzso but was decreased by treating with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso but not zzso was zzso Analysis of zzso zzso by gel zzso zzso revealed a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso Substituting the putative metal binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with Ala completely abolished the activity of zzso even zzso with zzso zzso On the basis of these results, as well as the zzso profile, the reaction mechanism of zzso is discussed and compared with those of other zzso zzso
