The zzso expression of DNA extracted directly from environmental samples zzso DNA zzso in easily cultured hosts provides access to natural products produced by previously zzso zzso When zzso zzso libraries were screened in zzso coli for zzso active zzso zzso zzso clones were found in every zzso zzso These apparently common natural products have not been previously described from screening extracts of cultured bacteria for biologically active natural zzso Of the 11 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso that were zzso 10 are unique zzso A predicted protein of previously unknown function from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is 14 to 37% identical to zzso zzso When cloned into zzso coli, this open reading frame zzso the production of zzso zzso to the host and is therefore the first zzso from a cultured zzso to be functionally zzso zzso the role that zzso zzso zzso acids play in soil microbial communities should now be feasible with the identification of a cultured zzso that has the genetic capacity to produce these zzso
