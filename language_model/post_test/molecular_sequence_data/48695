As part of their immune system, plants have pattern recognition receptors zzso that can detect a broad range of zzso molecular patterns zzso Here, we identified a zzso of zzso zzso with specificity for the bacterial zzso zzso from zzso Response to zzso seems to be restricted to the zzso family and also varied among different zzso of zzso In crosses between sensitive zzso and the insensitive zzso zzso zzso perception mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso required gene zzso that code for a longer version of zzso that we termed zzso (for zzso of zzso zzso is a typical zzso with structural similarity to the tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso which detects zzso zzso as a zzso Attempts to demonstrate zzso function by zzso transfer of zzso to zzso zzso were successful after using hybrid receptors with the zzso part of zzso replaced by that of zzso These results show that zzso determines specificity for zzso They also demonstrate hybrid zzso technology as a promising tool to overcome problems that impede zzso transfer of zzso to enhance pathogen detection in crop zzso
