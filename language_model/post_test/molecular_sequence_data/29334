zzso mice develop a zzso zzso zzso We have previously identified several intervals that were linked to disease and, in an attempt to zzso lupus zzso genes within these zzso we have sought to isolate zzso expressed zzso zzso difference analysis was used to compare gene expression between zzso and zzso mice using zzso and zzso as a source of zzso The majority of zzso expressed sequences identified were zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these being characteristic of the zzso Among other isolated sequences were a zzso zzso a mouse zzso virus zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso gene not only zzso spliced zzso but also produced high levels of zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated that the copy number of the three linked zzso zzso zzso and zzso was amplified in zzso and that the structural zzso of this locus varies in different mouse zzso This locus consists of three parts, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Different combinations of the regions are present in different mouse zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that this region at the zzso end of zzso 11 is zzso linked to zzso markers of zzso
