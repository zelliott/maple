The zzso gene encodes zzso molecules that are very similar to the type I zzso zzso Two distinct types of the zzso gene products, zzso (a soluble zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso are produced by alternative zzso Here we demonstrate that the human zzso gene has two alternative promoters followed by distinct zzso first zzso which are located more than 8 zzso apart and are spliced to the common zzso 2 containing the translation initiation zzso Within 1001 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of the cloned zzso promoter, there are four zzso The main promoter used for the expression of the zzso gene in zzso a human zzso cell line, is distinct from that in zzso a human zzso cell zzso Although zzso cells use both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso promoter is used zzso for expression of both zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, almost all zzso in zzso cells starts from the zzso zzso These results contrast with those of former studies on the rat system, in which zzso and zzso zzso were generated by use of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells use multiple zzso initiation sites in both the zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells starts at a unique zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso and zzso proteins have distinct functions in different cells within different biological systems, such as those of growth control, differentiation and zzso zzso
