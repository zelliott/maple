zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso disorder marked by zzso bacterial zzso zzso from zzso patients lack secondary and zzso zzso and their content proteins and lack normal zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been identified in 2 zzso zzso Our studies on a third zzso patient revealed a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso However, we demonstrate elevated levels of zzso and zzso proteins in the patient's peripheral blood zzso The expression of the zzso factor growth factor zzso zzso however, was found to be markedly reduced in our zzso patient despite the absence of an obvious zzso in this zzso This may explain the elevated levels of both zzso and zzso which are targets of zzso zzso zzso We have generated a growth zzso zzso cell line from the bone zzso of zzso and zzso mice as a model for zzso zzso and demonstrate that lower levels of zzso expression in the zzso zzso cells is associated with reduced levels of secondary zzso protein zzso gene zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate a positive role for zzso in zzso zzso in that zzso binds to and zzso the promoter of zzso zzso (an zzso zzso in cooperation with zzso but not with zzso zzso We zzso that decreased zzso levels in our zzso patient, together with the zzso zzso block zzso zzso thereby contributing to the underlying zzso of the disease in our zzso
