zzso is a zzso of miniature zzso repeat zzso elements zzso that is widespread and abundant in plant zzso Like other zzso however, its origin and mode of amplification are poorly zzso Several lines of evidence point to plant zzso elements zzso as the autonomous partners of the zzso zzso zzso To better understand this relationship, we have taken advantage of the nearly complete zzso sequences of two rice subspecies to generate the first inventory of virtually all zzso and zzso families zzso in a single plant zzso Thirty-four different zzso were found to group into three major zzso and 25 zzso More than 22,000 zzso zzso were identified and classified into 36 zzso On the basis of detailed sequence zzso zzso were confirmed to be the best candidate autonomous elements for zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, sequence similarity between zzso and zzso families was restricted to the terminal zzso repeats zzso and, in a few cases, to adjacent zzso zzso These data suggest a model zzso most of the zzso zzso in rice were zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso related zzso
