In zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso perform the functions of zzso in higher plants, while the structural and zzso characteristics of the zzso are essentially zzso Our interest in studying the evolutionary relationship between zzso and zzso led us to focus on zzso genes of the zzso apparatus, specifically genes equivalent to those of the bacterial zzso and zzso zzso The structure of a large zzso protein gene cluster from zzso DNA was characterized and compared with that from zzso and zzso zzso of the following zzso genes encompassing zzso zzso are reported here: zzso zzso zzso contain five more zzso protein genes than do higher plant zzso and four more genes than zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of this gene zzso The gene zzso zzso is zzso in contrast to the case in other zzso zzso These zzso including the previously characterized genes zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed as a primary transcript of approximately zzso zzso The occurrence of transcripts smaller than this zzso primary transcript suggests that it is processed into defined zzso zzso zzso 3' of zzso where a 40 zzso hairpin with one mismatch zzso zzso may be zzso Immediately downstream of zzso an open reading frame, zzso is contained on a separate zzso A comparison of gene content, zzso structure and deduced zzso acid sequence of the genes in the zzso and zzso zzso from different organisms supports the notion that zzso are zzso between known zzso and zzso
