Like humans, zzso possess zzso zzso a unique protein component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibits extensive variation with respect to size and serum zzso In this report, we have cloned the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso gene (I zzso and performed promoter mapping studies to identify sequences that control zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region is similar to the human zzso and contains two zzso repeats that distinguish the zzso gene from zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso start site for the zzso zzso is located 85 zzso upstream from the major start site for the human zzso zzso For promoter mapping studies, we constructed two sets of deletion clones zzso to 3' and 3' to zzso in zzso reporter plasmids for zzso of zzso cell lines zzso and zzso These experiments showed that the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso contains a positive promoter element with zzso identity to the consensus binding site for zzso nuclear factor 1 alpha zzso zzso and a negative element that is functional in zzso cells, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells showed that the positive promoter element acts in an zzso zzso We also cloned the zzso zzso region from a zzso carrying a zzso zzso that produced no zzso zzso transcripts or serum zzso in zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso possessed a promoter that was functional in zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso gene zzso contains zzso promoter zzso but that other unknown sequences must influence zzso expression in zzso
