A zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in transgenic tobacco zzso To separate native from zzso zzso the protein was extended by six zzso at its C zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso zzso of pure zzso followed by zzso on zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso with zzso yielded zzso zzso that formed zzso readily after dilution of the zzso without further in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the typical zzso zzso ratio at all steps of zzso indicating no significant loss of zzso zzso tobacco zzso amounts of zzso protein that corresponded to about zzso of total zzso This yield suggested that expression in zzso might be an alternative to the expression of zzso membrane proteins in zzso zzso zzso was able to form two-dimensional zzso after addition of zzso which zzso electrons to zzso zzso zzso carrying a replacement of zzso with zzso accumulated to only zzso of total zzso zzso This zzso was zzso in the zzso membrane probably due to the deletion of the zzso binding site and was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Exchange of zzso with zzso impaired zzso zzso in a similar way presumably due to the lack of a zzso a binding zzso
