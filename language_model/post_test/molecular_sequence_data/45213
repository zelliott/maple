zzso mimicry between zzso zzso zzso and human proteins has been considered as a mechanism leading to zzso reactions in rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease zzso zzso zzso has been shown as a putative zzso recognized by zzso of rheumatic fever zzso We assessed the human zzso T cell response against human light zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides and zzso proteins by proliferation zzso zzso induced by zzso peptides were also zzso The frequency of zzso T cell clones that recognized zzso peptides was zzso Thirty-four percent of T cell clones presented zzso with different zzso 1) zzso and zzso zzso 2) zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 3) myosin, zzso proteins and zzso zzso In addition, several zzso peptides were recognized simultaneously showing a multiple zzso pattern of zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were predominantly produced by zzso T cells upon stimulation with zzso zzso The alignment of zzso and zzso zzso peptides showed frequent zzso among zzso zzso acid zzso This is the first study showing the cellular response by human zzso T cells against cardiac zzso zzso in zzso zzso The high percentage of zzso against cardiac zzso strengthens its role as one of the major zzso involved in rheumatic heart zzso T cell zzso toward zzso zzso in zzso patients may also trigger the broad recognition of zzso proteins with structural or functional zzso
