zzso are zzso respiratory proteins that have been thoroughly studied in various zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins have long been considered unnecessary in zzso (including zzso which acquire zzso via an elaborate zzso zzso However, we recently identified a functional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso and zzso experiments to study the presence of zzso in a broad range of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We obtained a total of 12 full-length and 5 partial zzso sequences of zzso from representatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No zzso could be identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso or in the zzso zzso + zzso It is not currently known why zzso has been lost in some zzso zzso zzso usually consist of two distinct zzso zzso Whereas type 1 zzso may represent the central building block, type 2 zzso may be absent in some zzso zzso analyses support the zzso hypothesis and show that type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso before the emergence of the zzso The zzso insect storage zzso evolved from zzso type 1 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso being a possible zzso The evolution of zzso zzso follows the widely accepted zzso of the zzso and provides strong evidence for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso are zzso with respect to the zzso
