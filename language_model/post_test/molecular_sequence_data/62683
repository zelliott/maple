zzso is an essential zzso involved with zzso metabolism and zzso We report here the X-ray structure of zzso zzso zzso in its native zzso and as a complex with zzso These reveal a novel protein fold that displays no structural similarities to previously described zzso The molecular unit is a zzso with two active zzso zzso binding promotes extensive structural zzso secondary structure zzso and rigid body zzso of 20 A or more, which effectively bury the zzso within the zzso core for the purpose of zzso The molecular complex is a trapped zzso arrangement which clearly demonstrates zzso specificity and zzso zzso This zzso is a novel zzso and therefore a potential drug target in the treatment of zzso zzso
