zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the removal of zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso leading to the release of zzso zzso and generates the zzso end during the maturation zzso The zzso crystal structures of the zzso and the zzso forms of zzso zzso from zzso zzso reveal a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso tightly associated into a zzso ring structure in the form of a zzso of zzso A five zzso pair network, zzso and an zzso zzso that are positioned zzso in the zzso interface play critical roles in the formation of a zzso zzso Single or double zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in these zzso pairs leads to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso without zzso the overall zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso completely lost its binding affinity and zzso activity against a precursor zzso Our structural and zzso analyses of zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso ring formation is a critical feature for the function of members of the zzso zzso zzso
