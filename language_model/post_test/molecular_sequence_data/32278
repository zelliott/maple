The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of zzso hormone zzso zzso involved in the zzso regulation of reproduction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso type I was successfully cloned from the zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso end zzso methods in the zzso The complete zzso type I zzso is zzso zzso which includes an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 364 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso type I was found to be highest in the zzso An intramuscular injection of various zzso types in zzso was zzso The expression of zzso type I was zzso by a single injection of salmon zzso while in the case of chicken zzso II treatment, the expression of zzso type I was zzso This suggests that the action of chick zzso II is probably enhanced through the zzso zzso of different zzso Furthermore, none of them were expressed by an injection of zzso zzso and this is likely attributed to the injection dose being below the threshold level, and this remains to be further zzso In conclusion, zzso of various types are effective in stimulating the expression of zzso through various forms of the zzso and multiple forms of the zzso gene likely exist in zzso
