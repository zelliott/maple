Using zzso zzso zzso as a template, we performed zzso amplification with the zzso and zzso zzso for isolation of a partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We screened the zzso zzso zzso library prepared with zzso zzso zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso fragment, zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso two zzso repeats in 162 zzso to 624 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso from zzso zzso shared about zzso similarity with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
