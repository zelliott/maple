Several zzso zzso DNA structures have been discovered to date, which may be incorporated into future zzso zzso for gene therapy and DNA vaccine zzso In this study, intrinsic DNA structures were included at a defined point in a zzso zzso zzso and their effects on cell growth rate, total zzso yield, and zzso zzso the relative proportions of zzso zzso open circular and linear zzso were zzso The stability of the inserted sequences were assessed using gel zzso zzso was shown to be unstable in a batch zzso coli zzso production system grown in complex zzso zzso other sequences studied zzso bend and zzso did not cause spontaneous zzso and no zzso effect was found on growth rate or on total zzso zzso indicating that such sequences could be included in future DNA products without any zzso effect on zzso zzso although the zzso molecular triplex studied significantly decreased the proportion of zzso zzso
