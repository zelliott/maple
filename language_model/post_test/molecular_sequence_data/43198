The gene for the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by use of a functional expression system in zzso coli zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the protein has zzso to the sequences of the zzso class of zzso with the highest similarities being found to the sequences of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso However, the regions of highest zzso within the zzso class of zzso which are essential for the zzso activity, are only scarcely found in the sequence of zzso By using the zzso isolated from culture zzso of transformed zzso coli cells, it is possible to zzso linear zzso from zzso indicating that the zzso is not capable of producing zzso linkages on its zzso
