To analyze the zzso relationship of a zzso zzso molecules with zzso activities were isolated from a pool of zzso that have a region of 14 random zzso for zzso by a novel in zzso selection zzso Active zzso from the pool were selected using a zzso zzso anchored to an zzso zzso After 7 or 8 selection cycles, the pool of the selected molecules showed zzso activity against the zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of the individual selected zzso molecules were then analyzed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso All the active zzso were found to catalyze the same zzso zzso reaction as does the zzso zzso and contain the zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso
