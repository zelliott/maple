zzso zzso zzso zzso from more than 50 species of bacteria contain a short gene zzso a small protein that ranges from zzso to 50 zzso acids and is predicted to zzso to the cell zzso Although zzso zzso zzso have been studied for more than 70 years, little is known about the role of this small zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we report that zzso coli zzso lacking zzso exhibit zzso associated with reduced zzso zzso In addition, cell membrane extracts from zzso zzso strains have reduced zzso activity in zzso zzso with data showing that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso experiments indicate that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these data support the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex that is required for complex zzso The results of zzso analysis of zzso suggest that few individual zzso acids in the small protein are essential for function, at least in the context of protein zzso In addition, the results of analysis of the zzso small zzso protein zzso show that the two proteins could have some overlapping functionality in the cell and that both have the potential to interact with the zzso zzso
