zzso is a zzso zzso minor groove binding agent which forms zzso with zzso on opposite DNA zzso DNA zzso induced by zzso in zzso DNA of zzso cells, as well as zzso and zzso zzso virus 40 zzso DNA, were zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated a zzso distribution of zzso damage in zzso cell zzso DNA with zzso of zzso zzso base pairs zzso for zzso zzso from 10 to 400 zzso zzso zzso of these data suggested that, at zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso per cell may be sufficient to inhibit cell growth by zzso zzso While the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso zzso DNA was comparable to that in zzso DNA, higher levels of zzso formation are observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso structure has little effect on zzso of zzso zzso since treatment of either infected cells or zzso zzso DNA reveals a similar pattern of drug-induced zzso zzso zzso sites zzso on the zzso zzso as zzso strand breaks at zzso zzso zzso are found in regions centered at zzso zzso zzso and approximately zzso The location of these regions of intense zzso bonding zzso with the sites of potential zzso predicted using the zzso zzso The analysis of zzso zzso at the sequence level in the zzso zzso DNA zzso indicated that zzso of total damage was in potential zzso sites and an additional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
