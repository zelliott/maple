The zzso of human zzso zzso is closely linked to the characteristics of the zzso zzso that it zzso in the zzso zzso In a previous study of zzso we reported that the zzso of zzso for zzso DNA increases as zzso progress toward cervical zzso However, the zzso of zzso did not increase during the process of zzso from severe zzso to invasive zzso These findings suggest that patients with invasive zzso had much fewer DNA copies of zzso in host zzso Based on these findings, we have prepared a zzso DNA standard zzso zzso with an zzso restriction site by using a zzso chain reaction zzso technique and zzso zzso We have also developed a sensitive quantitative method based on zzso that uses zzso and competition between the patient's zzso DNA and an internal DNA standard for the determination of numbers of copies of zzso zzso In this study, zzso cervical zzso obtained from 12 patients with invasive zzso were studied using competitive zzso zzso to determine the number of zzso DNA zzso We found that the number of copies in the zzso of patients with invasive varied between 5 zzso zzso to 4 zzso zzso zzso
