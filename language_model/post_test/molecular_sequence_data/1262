A basic understanding of the major zzso complex zzso class I, which, together with zzso zzso is a key player in zzso recognition by zzso T zzso is necessary to study the cellular immune response to zzso zzso The zzso has hardly been reported in zzso monkeys ( zzso zzso although zzso monkeys have been frequently used as the surrogate animal zzso We attempted to determine the zzso sequences of the zzso class I A locus of zzso monkeys ( zzso and eventually 34 independent sequences of zzso were obtained from 29 zzso zzso These 34 sequences were classified into 14 zzso zzso according to the results of zzso analyses using the zzso zzso One to three zzso zzso were obtained from a single zzso We also tried to establish a multiplex zzso method for convenient typing of zzso zzso zzso from a family of zzso zzso which is composed of four zzso and four zzso were examined by multiplex zzso The result of multiplex zzso showed that an individual zzso monkey had two or three zzso zzso suggesting that the A locus of zzso monkeys might be zzso
