Genes zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been analyzed zzso within a very large cohort of zzso from bacteria and zzso We focus on this relative of zzso zzso along with zzso from other zzso to determine whether there have been systematic transfers of zzso genes from the presumed zzso zzso of the zzso to the nucleus of the early zzso The zzso zzso representing the eight zzso zzso studied here tend to cluster in zzso zzso Nevertheless, not one of these zzso zzso is related as a sister zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso Nor is there a close zzso relationship between zzso genes from zzso and any other bacterial zzso In contrast, several of the reconstructions suggest that there may have been systematic transfer of sequences zzso zzso zzso from zzso to some green zzso Otherwise, surprisingly little exchange between the bacterial and zzso zzso is zzso The descent of zzso genes zzso zzso of zzso metabolism is zzso
