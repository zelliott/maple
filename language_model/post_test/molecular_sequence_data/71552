zzso protein zzso zzso pathways are zzso involved in the zzso of zzso signals to zzso targets in all zzso zzso zzso pathways are regulated by different zzso stimuli and are implicated in a wide variety of biological zzso In plants there is evidence for zzso playing a role in the signaling of zzso zzso pathogens and plant zzso The large number and divergence of plant zzso indicates that this ancient mechanism of zzso is extensively used in plants and may provide a new molecular handle on old zzso
