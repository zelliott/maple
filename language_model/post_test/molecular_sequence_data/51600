The zzso zzso is found as a zzso protein in the zzso surface of zzso zzso To provide insight into possible functions, we have assessed the timing of expression and the distribution of the zzso protein during mouse zzso using three different zzso zzso northern blots and zzso Our results indicate that zzso expression zzso with zzso differentiation in stomach, zzso zzso zzso kidney and zzso zzso Once started, zzso synthesis continually increases with time, mainly due to zzso area zzso Our data suggest that expression of the zzso gene is under spatial and zzso control during zzso Although zzso is present in different zzso its expression is not induced zzso but according to the particular onset of zzso polarization and branching zzso of each individual zzso It is of particular interest that zzso protein can be detected lining the zzso surfaces of the developing zzso when the zzso of these zzso is still undergoing folding and zzso and zzso activity has not yet zzso We speculate that zzso may participate in zzso sheet zzso formation during early development of the zzso known to express zzso This speculation is based on: zzso the detection of zzso expression early during zzso zzso the defined zzso zzso in different zzso zzso the decrease in zzso interactions when zzso protein is highly expressed and zzso the possible interaction of its zzso tail with the zzso zzso However, it remains to be established using in zzso systems, whether the zzso and local expression of the zzso gene zzso with the zzso events described here is relevant for the zzso
