zzso exhaustive and continent wide patterns of genetic divergence within and between species have rarely been described and the underlying evolutionary causes shaping zzso distribution remain zzso Here, we show that geographic patterns of zzso and zzso genetic divergence among nearly all of the North American freshwater fish species zzso zzso support a dual role involving both the late zzso zzso fluctuations and zzso rate in determining zzso zzso of genetic divergence and very likely influencing zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso glacial cycles caused global reduction in zzso diversity, zzso genetic zzso and species richness at higher zzso At the opposite, longer geographic isolation, higher zzso rate increasing substitution rate and possibly the rapid zzso of genetic zzso led to an increasing zzso towards lower zzso This indicates that both intrinsic and zzso factors similarly affect zzso and zzso evolutionary processes shaping global patterns of zzso zzso These results also indicate that factors zzso zzso zzso are the main drivers underlying the diversification of North American freshwater zzso
