zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso and a minor zzso zzso A zzso gene was defined on a zzso zzso of clone zzso by virtue of fluorescent colonies in the presence of zzso zzso sequencing revealed an zzso open reading frame with the potential to zzso a zzso protein with zzso acid sequences similar to those in other zzso suggesting it encodes the minor zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso coli zzso zzso was detected mainly in the zzso fraction and zzso detected a zzso protein in this zzso zzso has an zzso zzso leader zzso preceding two probable zzso zzso and a zzso zzso These functional zzso are separated by zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of zzso zzso zzso peptides from the major zzso zzso suggested that zzso may be a precursor of zzso In addition, an zzso truncated version of zzso retained zzso activity as expected if in zzso processing of zzso generates zzso
