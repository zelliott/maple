zzso obesity is often associated with a zzso syndrome zzso in particular, by a type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular zzso This could be induced by an excess of local production of zzso zzso by zzso tissue (or other zzso This production of zzso by its target zzso depends on the zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso Our aim was to characterize some mechanisms which control the expression of the human zzso gene zzso in zzso By using different zzso zzso containing fragments of the zzso promoter, we demonstrate that two members of the zzso protein family, zzso and zzso are required for the zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso This effect depends on the binding of each zzso to specific binding zzso zzso of either one of these sites induced a zzso decrease of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso A zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells induced an increased zzso expression of zzso By zzso studies using the zzso zzso zzso it appears that zzso was strongly involved in this zzso as the zzso stimulation was suppressed after zzso of the zzso binding zzso Part of the mechanism involved the increase of nuclear zzso protein levels induced by zzso and a zzso step associated with an enhanced binding of the zzso factor to its zzso These data indicate that members of the zzso family control zzso levels of zzso in zzso via the regulation of the zzso and zzso expressions of zzso
