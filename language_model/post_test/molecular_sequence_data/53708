The zzso coli zzso gene was predicted to zzso a small hypothetical protein of 81 zzso zzso the cellular function of which is not zzso To gain insight into the function of this zzso zzso zzso genetic and zzso studies were zzso We first tried to express and purify the zzso protein to prepare an zzso zzso Western zzso showed that the hypothetical zzso gene is indeed transcribed and translated as a minor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells formed colonies poorly on a rich medium zzso zzso zzso containing a relatively low concentration of zzso while they can grow normally either in LB containing zzso zzso or in a synthetic medium zzso zzso During exponential growth in rich zzso an early step of cell division was inhibited in delta zzso cells, forming zzso For the zzso zzso cells, the zzso formation was analyzed with zzso zzso The zzso formation did not occur normally in the delta zzso zzso although the zzso cells contained the zzso protein at a certain level comparable to that in the zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to function as a zzso zzso of the delta zzso zzso Another zzso zzso gene was identified as the zzso zzso zzso that either the zzso or zzso gene was introduced into the zzso cells with its zzso state, the resulting zzso were capable of growing in rich zzso formed zzso short zzso These results are discussed with regard to the presumed function of this ubiquitous zzso
