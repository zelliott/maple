zzso contain accessory genes that have evolved to counteract the effects of host cellular zzso proteins that inhibit productive zzso One such restriction factor, zzso zzso human zzso virus zzso infection of zzso cells as well as resting zzso T cells by reducing the cellular zzso zzso zzso concentration to a level at which the viral reverse zzso cannot zzso In other zzso including zzso and related zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso restriction is overcome by the action of viral accessory protein zzso zzso or the related viral protein r zzso that target and recruit zzso for zzso zzso The molecular mechanism by which these viral proteins are able to zzso the host cell's zzso machinery to destroy the cell's protection against these viruses has not been zzso Here we present the crystal structure of a zzso complex of zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso region of human zzso zzso is made up of a zzso bundle stabilized by a zinc finger zzso and wraps tightly around the zzso zzso zzso to present a new molecular zzso This adapted surface is then able to recruit zzso via its C zzso making it a competent zzso for the zzso zzso to mark for zzso zzso The structure reported here provides a molecular description of how a zzso accessory protein is able to zzso the cell's normal protein degradation zzso to zzso the cellular viral zzso zzso
