zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is needed for zzso assembly and may be involved in a specialized protein export zzso that proceeds without signal zzso zzso zzso shows extensive sequence similarity to the zzso beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is even more similar to the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Oaks, zzso zzso zzso 1992) and the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are believed to play a role in the export of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso that zzso to zzso important zzso in the F1 beta zzso resulted in loss of zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso is an zzso zzso was zzso and zzso almost to zzso It demonstrated zzso binding but not zzso An zzso raised against zzso permitted detection of the protein in zzso cells and an estimate of about 1,500 zzso per zzso An zzso directed against the F1 beta zzso of zzso coli zzso with zzso confirming that the proteins are structurally zzso The relationship between three proteins involved in zzso assembly zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in a variety of zzso systems is zzso
