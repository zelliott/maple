During zzso zzso zzso cell divisions are achieved by differential segregation of zzso zzso into one of the daughter cells to cause a bias in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a second zzso gene with significant sequence similarity to zzso mouse zzso When expressed in dividing neural precursors in zzso zzso is zzso distributed in the zzso unlike zzso zzso or expressed mouse zzso zzso both of which are zzso localized to one half of the cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso allows both daughter cells of a neural precursor to adopt the fate of the cell that normally zzso zzso In mice, zzso zzso is zzso expressed in adult and embryonic nervous zzso In the developing zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso in the cortical plate, but not in zzso within the zzso zone where zzso and zzso are zzso We have also found that, in dividing cortical zzso zzso is distributed around the entire zzso unlike zzso which is zzso localized to the zzso zzso We propose that an interplay between zzso mechanisms zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso mechanisms zzso by zzso may be involved in both zzso cell proliferation and zzso differentiation during zzso cortical zzso
