zzso acts to rescue stalled bacterial zzso while zzso a zzso tag added zzso to the nascent zzso targeting it for zzso The zzso gene structure found in a group of zzso is shown to produce a zzso mature zzso as had been observed previously for the independently zzso gene of zzso The pieces have been mapped onto the gene sequence and aligned for the zzso zzso zzso zzso including four novel zzso zzso probing and base pair zzso support a secondary structure model in which two pairings in the zzso domain hold the two pieces together, and the coding piece bearing the tag reading frame additionally contains a single transient zzso and three other zzso This represents a dramatic reduction in zzso number from the five present in zzso zzso zzso
