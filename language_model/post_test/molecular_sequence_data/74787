The zzso zzso zzso protein structure has been determined to zzso zzso This is the first example of a single crystal structure to show the active site zzso zzso in both the reduced and zzso zzso zzso zzso with this observation the process of zzso appears to require very little zzso of the surrounding protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso structure has been compared to other zzso protein structures already known and is found to be highly zzso The zzso zzso protein is most similar to that of the zzso from its human and animal hosts but it resembles other zzso zzso with regard to having no additional zzso zzso and is therefore not regulated by transient zzso bond formation as proposed for zzso from higher zzso zzso
