In order to assess the importance of the buried zzso observed in the structure of zzso an analog in which zzso was replaced with Ala zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso data showed that the solution structure of the zzso analog is essentially the same as that for the native zzso Also, the zzso zzso activity of the zzso analog was similar to that of the native zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso chemical shifts, which are significantly zzso in the native zzso exhibit more zzso zzso This observation indicates that in the native zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso are critical for function, this interaction is not essential for zzso zzso
