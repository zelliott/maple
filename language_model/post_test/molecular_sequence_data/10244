Recently, zzso in the Met zzso zzso zzso have been identified in both zzso and sporadic forms of zzso zzso zzso We have introduced the corresponding zzso into the met zzso and examined the effect of each zzso in zzso and biological zzso We find that the Met zzso exhibit increased levels of zzso zzso and enhanced zzso activity toward an zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells expressing zzso Met molecules form zzso in zzso and are zzso in nude zzso zzso and biological differences were evident among the various zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were generally more active than those of zzso zzso A strong correlation between the zzso and biological activity of the zzso was observed, indicating that zzso by Met is zzso related to its level of zzso These results demonstrate that the Met zzso originally identified in human zzso zzso zzso are zzso and thus are likely to play a zzso role in this disease, and these results raise the possibility that zzso Met zzso also may contribute to other human zzso
