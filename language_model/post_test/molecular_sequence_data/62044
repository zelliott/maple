zzso zzso are important for blood zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Using a plaque screening zzso we isolated zzso zzso a novel zzso from a shrimp zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso The deduced protein has 757 zzso acid zzso a calculated molecular mass of zzso Da and an zzso point of zzso Neither a typical zzso leader sequence nor a zzso domain could be identified from the deduced zzso Thus, shrimp zzso may be a typical zzso zzso The sequence of shrimp zzso was similar to zzso other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in all zzso zzso This is consistent with the zzso low-level expression of zzso zzso However, high levels of zzso expression were detected in zzso zzso zzso signals were stronger in zzso cells, indicating that cell proliferation and zzso synthesis are zzso zzso data showed that zzso zzso existed the zzso activity but lacked zzso zzso
