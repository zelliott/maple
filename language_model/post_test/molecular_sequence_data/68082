A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso cells at an optimal concentration of zzso This result suggests the existence of a zzso which regulates zzso formation in zzso zzso We report here an attempt to identify this target zzso in bovine brain using zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso of zzso was changed to zzso to serve as a zzso for the zzso As a result, we have zzso a zzso with a molecular weight of about zzso zzso as a zzso degrading zzso The activity of the zzso was inhibited efficiently by zzso and was different from known zzso activities of zzso in some aspects, suggesting it to be a novel zzso Thus, the zzso may be involved in the regulation of zzso formation in zzso zzso
