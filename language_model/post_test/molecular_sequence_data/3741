We identified a novel mouse zzso zzso as a zzso target gene using differential display zzso and extensive promoter zzso The zzso protein has 255 zzso acids and differs from the human zzso zzso protein by two short zzso deletions of two and nine zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in multiple cancer cell lines by zzso delivery of zzso and by gamma zzso or zzso both in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression in zzso and transformed cells further supported zzso gene zzso Using zzso reporter and zzso mobility shift zzso we identified a zzso binding site within zzso 1 of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso induced zzso in multiple cancer cell lines including prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a human lung cancer cell line, zzso and two zzso human colon cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso V zzso zzso zzso and in selected cases zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso of the signal zzso from the N zzso of zzso reduced its zzso activities, suggesting that a zzso and soluble form of zzso may zzso in part, its zzso zzso
