A natural zzso virus internal deletion defective interfering zzso zzso previously shown to zzso a truncated zzso protein and previously cloned under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter, was expressed from zzso and shown to replicate in cell tissue culture when the viral proteins zzso zzso and L were zzso from cloned zzso The efficient replication was dependent on the total length of the zzso to be a multiple of 6 zzso showing that the zzso of zzso applied for a zzso zzso that has zzso the end sequences of the zzso viral zzso Compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the replication efficiency of the internal deletion zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso exchanges between the zzso zzso primary sequences of the two zzso zzso showed that the replication efficiency of the derivatives obtained directly correlated with the origin and the extent of the primary zzso Moreover, some of the derivatives exhibited a replication efficiency comparable to that of the zzso zzso zzso with, however, the ability to transcribe a functional zzso similar to the internal deletion zzso zzso This indicated that the zzso ability of a viral zzso was not sufficient to explain a low replication zzso
