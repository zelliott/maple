Human zzso are poorly understood at both the genetic and the physical zzso In this paper, we have been able to distinguish the zzso zzso sequences of zzso 5 from those of zzso zzso This result was obtained by zzso gel zzso after cutting zzso DNA with restriction zzso zzso zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso We could thus define a highly zzso marker, representing length variations of the zzso domain located at the zzso arm boundary of the zzso 5 zzso The zzso region of zzso 5 was then analyzed in full zzso We established an approximately zzso physical map of the whole region with five zzso zzso by using zzso zzso two of which were shown to contain the very ends of zzso on both zzso The zzso side of zzso was shown to contain an zzso subset zzso different from those described thus zzso Two genes and several putative zzso could be precisely located close to the zzso Several zzso elements were shown to be present within alpha satellites at the boundary between zzso and zzso sequences on both sides of zzso They were used to define zzso that could serve as physical anchor points at the junction of zzso with the p and zzso zzso Some zzso were placed on a radiation hybrid zzso One was zzso and could therefore be used as a second zzso genetic marker at the p arm boundary of zzso We could thus estimate zzso rates within and around the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso is highly reduced within zzso with zero zzso in 58 zzso being detected between the two markers located at the two zzso of the zzso In its immediate vicinity, zzso indeed exerts a direct negative effect on zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso This effect is, however, less important than expected and is zzso as different rates are observed on both arms if one compares the 0 zzso of the p zzso first zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso first 5 zzso to the zzso zzso zzso found throughout the entire zzso zzso Rates then become close to the average when one goes further within the zzso Finally, most zzso zzso irrespective of the arm, are of female origin, thus showing that zzso around zzso is essentially occurring in the female zzso
