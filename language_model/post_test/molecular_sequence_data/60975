Previous screening of a zzso library of leaf zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the characterization of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A second zzso zzso designated zzso has now been found by zzso the zzso The deduced zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso has a predicted molecular mass of zzso D, and is zzso identical to the deduced zzso zzso Isolation and characterization of zzso DNA fragments revealed that the zzso and zzso genes are each closely linked to another zzso zzso These additional genes have been designated zzso and zzso zzso In each case, the second gene is located upstream and in the same zzso orientation as the gene characterized through zzso zzso A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was used to demonstrate that zzso and zzso transcripts predominate in leaves, whereas zzso and zzso transcripts predominate in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso transcripts is light zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso from leaves demonstrated that zzso is zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso zzso mechanism active in zzso zzso
