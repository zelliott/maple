The zzso coli low molecular mass zzso proteins zzso are zzso sensitive, zzso involved in the terminal stages of zzso zzso These zzso are believed to anchor to the zzso face of the inner membrane via zzso zzso zzso but to date the only support for this hypothesis has been obtained from theoretical zzso In this paper, the zzso zzso of synthetic peptides corresponding to these zzso zzso zzso was studied as a function of zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using circular zzso zzso zzso The CD data showed that in zzso or sodium zzso all three peptides have the capacity to form an zzso zzso but in zzso solution or in the presence of zzso zzso only those peptides corresponding to the zzso and zzso zzso were observed to do zzso A pH dependent loss of zzso zzso in the zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso was found to correlate with the zzso of zzso to membrane zzso This correlation would agree with the hypothesis that an zzso zzso is required for membrane interaction of the zzso zzso zzso
