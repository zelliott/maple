The objective of this study was to enhance zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso It had been known that zzso zzso from zzso zzso could convert zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso however, the activity for zzso was extremely low compared to zzso activity zzso We used the information on the crystal structures of aromatic zzso acid zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso with high zzso zzso zzso In zzso structural modeling analysis suggested that zzso and/or stacking interactions with the zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso would increase zzso zzso Based on this hypothesis, we introduced a zzso zzso towards these sites followed by the evaluation of zzso productivity using a modified Gibbs zzso Three and nine positive zzso were obtained from the zzso and zzso zzso libraries, zzso Among the zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest zzso zzso activity at the respective zzso zzso kinetic analysis revealed that zzso values for zzso zzso were increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the double zzso zzso displayed higher zzso zzso activity than the zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso increased to zzso zzso showing a zzso increase compared to zzso zzso zzso
