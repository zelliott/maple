The DNA of a human zzso zzso virus zzso zzso into the cellular zzso under conditions zzso for viral DNA zzso The zzso DNA can be rescued from the cellular zzso by zzso with a helper virus, zzso zzso To characterize the organization of the zzso DNA in greater detail, we isolated three zzso zzso from a zzso infected human cell zzso Our findings, based on sequence analysis, restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that the viral terminal repeats zzso are present at or near the zzso DNA zzso but significant deletions of the zzso sequences have zzso One of the zzso clones has extensive zzso which apparently occurred by zzso zzso The zzso arrangement of one of the zzso clones is consistent with limited DNA replication prior to integration by a mechanism similar to that seen in a productive zzso Although there are zzso fragments in the cell line we have zzso which are the right size to have come from a zzso tandem zzso critical double zzso show no evidence for the presence of a zzso tandem repeat of zzso zzso zzso Use of zzso derived from the zzso cellular DNA enabled us to determine that in this cell line the viral DNA had integrated into a site composed of zzso zzso
