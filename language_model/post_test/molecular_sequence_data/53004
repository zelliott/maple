zzso zzso virus zzso zzso onto zzso zzso leads to a hypersensitive response zzso controlled by the dominant gene zzso zzso is a member of the class of resistance zzso genes that contain a zzso zzso a zzso binding site, and zzso zzso The zzso position of zzso and its zzso to resistance gene zzso and two zzso zzso indicate that unequal crossing over and gene conversion may have contributed to zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to an zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite very strong similarities within the zzso family, zzso and zzso are specific for the respective pathogens they zzso zzso the zzso family provides molecular evidence that sequence changes between closely related members of zzso families can generate novel zzso for radically different zzso zzso plants expressing zzso developed an zzso but generally remained susceptible to zzso because of a second zzso zzso that regulates resistance to zzso However, several transgenic plants that zzso zzso produced zzso or no zzso when zzso with zzso and were resistant to zzso zzso of the zzso coat protein gene in zzso containing zzso resulted in massive necrosis and death, indicating that the zzso factor detected by the zzso protein is the zzso coat zzso
