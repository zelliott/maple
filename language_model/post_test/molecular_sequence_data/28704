Recently, we identified and characterized a novel zzso zzso whose domain structure is similar to that of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso its possible zzso partner by a zzso zzso system revealed that an zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso form of zzso zzso of the zzso complex was readily detected in the pancreatic beta cell line zzso Moreover, the tissue zzso of zzso and zzso are remarkably zzso both had significant and specific expression in pancreatic zzso and in zzso zzso but no expression was noted in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso density zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso are localized on the membrane of insulin zzso These findings suggest that zzso functions as a zzso zzso protein in beta zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso significantly enhanced high zzso insulin zzso without affecting zzso insulin zzso Although zzso another zzso zzso zzso has some similarities with zzso in primary zzso zzso distribution, and affinity toward zzso zzso of zzso caused different effects on insulin zzso These results indicate that zzso is involved in the regulated zzso of conventional zzso zzso possibly through the interaction with zzso in addition to its recently identified role in zzso zzso
