The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso plays a crucial role in zzso We determined the structure of the zzso domain of zzso in complex with a low molecular mass inhibitor in two different crystal forms, obtained from soaking and zzso To our knowledge, these are the first structures of zzso showing the binding mode of an inhibitor with high binding affinity zzso zzso zzso The two crystal forms revealed zzso flexibility in the binding site and extend the experimental basis for rational drug zzso Crystal zzso contained one zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso contained 12 zzso which arrange into two different types of zzso zzso One of them may serve as a model for an intermediate state during zzso zzso as each zzso zzso places its zzso segment into the zzso zzso binding groove of the zzso zzso
