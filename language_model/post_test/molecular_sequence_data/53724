Members of the Sox gene family zzso zzso factors that have diverse and important functions during zzso We have recently described the cloning of chick and mouse zzso and the expression of these genes in a population of zzso zzso in the embryonic spinal zzso We report here the cloning and sequencing of the human zzso of zzso Human zzso shows remarkable sequence conservation compared with zzso from other zzso species and probably mirrors the expression of these genes in the developing brain and spinal zzso Using radiation hybrid mapping and zzso in zzso zzso we have zzso zzso close to the sequence zzso site zzso on human zzso zzso Three zzso disorders have been zzso to this zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso and zzso syndrome type 2 zzso We have found that zzso is unlikely to be involved in any of these disorders because of the position of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso and the lack of zzso coding region zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
