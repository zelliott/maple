zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli containing a zzso zzso at position 330 zzso zzso or at position zzso zzso or 149 zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso demonstrate that after incubation in the presence of zzso zzso products of approximately 19 and zzso zzso are observed on zzso with zzso zzso zzso the same zzso products are observed with zzso embedded in the native zzso zzso with the zzso half of the zzso expressed independently as a standard indicates that the zzso product results from zzso near the zzso end of zzso zzso whereas the 6- to zzso zzso probably results from fragmentation near the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso are entirely consistent with a zzso model of the zzso half of the zzso derived from earlier zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similar studies with zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso products at approximately 19 zzso and at zzso zzso The larger zzso probably reflects zzso at a site near the zzso end of zzso zzso whereas the zzso to zzso zzso is consistent with zzso near the zzso end of zzso zzso When zzso is moved 100 degrees to position 149 zzso zzso zzso zzso a single product is observed at 19 zzso suggesting fragmentation at the zzso end of zzso zzso However, when the zzso is moved 100 degrees in the other direction to position 147 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso The results suggest that zzso V is in close proximity to zzso zzso and VIII with position 148 in the interface between the zzso position 149 facing zzso zzso and position 147 facing the zzso zzso
