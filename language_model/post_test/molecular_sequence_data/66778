zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso in a zzso zzso This zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Although the structures of several zzso members demonstrate that these zzso have a similar fold and domain structure, the low sequence conservation and diversity of the zzso zzso have limited the utility of these structures in understanding zzso binding in more zzso related zzso in this zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have allowed a directed approach to investigating zzso binding and zzso in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso structure, the zzso group of zzso zzso which mimics the zzso zzso lies in a zzso zzso Modeling of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso structure showed similar active site architecture, and alignment of the zzso acid sequences of proven zzso indicates that the four zzso that compose the putative zzso binding pocket are well zzso These four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were targeted for zzso and our results support that they do indeed form the zzso binding pocket and that zzso at these positions significantly alter the zzso affinity for zzso as well as the range of zzso zzso that can be zzso In particular, zzso appears to be the primary zzso for zzso chain length that can be zzso in the binding zzso
