To test whether zzso zzso in the cancer zzso gene zzso adversely affect zzso we examined 14 zzso zzso zzso for effects on zzso DNA transactions and zzso viability in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analogous to those associated with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso or those that reduce zzso interactions with zzso or DNA all impair zzso mismatch repair as measured by increased zzso zzso However, their effects on zzso zzso repair, crossing over, zzso zzso and zzso vary from complete loss of zzso functions to no zzso zzso and zzso defective in one zzso process are not necessarily defective in zzso DNA binding and zzso binding but not zzso zzso are required for zzso crossing zzso The results reveal clear separation of different zzso functions in zzso and zzso and they suggest that some, but not all, zzso zzso may be a source of human zzso
