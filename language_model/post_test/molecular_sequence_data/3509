Chicken zzso and bacterial zzso are proteins familiar from their use in various zzso technological zzso zzso binds the vitamin zzso with the highest affinity known for zzso interactions found in zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso has zzso in chicken, named zzso genes zzso In the present study we used the zzso genes to produce zzso zzso proteins zzso 1, 2, 3, zzso 6 and 7) in insect cell cultures and characterized their zzso affinity and zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis and molecular zzso were also used to predict and explain the properties of the zzso We found that the zzso proteins are very similar to zzso both structurally and zzso Despite the numerous zzso acid zzso in the zzso interface regions, the zzso form extremely stable zzso similar to those of zzso zzso were found in some zzso properties of the zzso as compared with zzso including lowered zzso increased zzso and, most notably, zzso zzso binding for two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed how the replacement zzso in zzso alters the shape of the zzso pocket and thus results in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses showed that zzso bonds can form and link zzso in zzso a property not found in zzso zzso together with the other properties of the zzso described in the present paper, may offer advantages over zzso and zzso making the zzso zzso for improved zzso technological zzso
