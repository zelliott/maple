We report molecular analyses which identify zzso strains present in environmental zzso These analyses do not require the isolation and culture of zzso Identification of zzso used the zzso chain reaction zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso was either by restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso or sequencing of the zzso zzso Identification was based on sequence zzso of the zzso zzso region zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with database zzso We have found that the length and sequence of the zzso is capable of predicting the zzso accurately, but not the zzso zzso was determined with zzso zzso for key steps in the zzso toxin synthesis zzso We have shown that it is possible to easily and routinely obtain zzso amplification products and differentiate the strains in bloom zzso The methods can detect even minor components in bloom samples, which may not be apparent on microscopic zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso are effective on environmental samples, eliminating the need for isolation and culture of the zzso The use of a suite of tests described here will allow water managers to determine the presence and the type of zzso and their zzso zzso
