Several zzso zzso and characterized from zzso zzso have been shown to be zzso active under zzso conditions when zzso zzso or zzso zzso are used as zzso Although high levels of the zzso are present in the zzso zzso their zzso role remains zzso To be functional, the zzso are expected to be zzso active at or near the zzso pH of zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that the rat zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso active toward zzso zzso at pH zzso shows maximum activity towards a zzso zzso zzso at neutral zzso Several lines of evidence, including zzso studies using zzso to the acid zzso and zzso competition studies, indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities are caused by a single zzso and that the two zzso are probably zzso by the same zzso zzso Competition studies with various zzso indicate that this zzso is capable of zzso a variety of zzso linkages found in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso column zzso of the zzso of zzso fluid under several conditions of buffer and pH show that, whereas the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions zzso zzso only zzso and zzso zzso zzso 180,000 and zzso zzso were observed in neutral conditions zzso zzso This zzso phenomenon is zzso These studies indicate that zzso is present in the zzso fluid in zzso forms, and is therefore zzso active towards zzso zzso at zzso zzso The potential role of the zzso in modification of zzso surface zzso is zzso
