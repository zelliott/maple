zzso zzso zzso placed under the control of the zzso promoter, were constructed by in zzso zzso between a gapped zzso zzso containing the zzso gene and four different fragments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly of the zzso sequences was screened by the expression of the zzso reporter gene fused to the zzso coding zzso zzso and sequencing analysis of 35 zzso showed that in all cases, the hybrid sequences was obtained as zzso between continuous sequences specific to zzso and zzso separated by a region of zzso In all but three cases, the junction sequences were not located at regions of greatest zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso used, junction distribution fell into two zzso In the first, the junctions were scattered over several hundreds of zzso upstream of the zzso of the zzso fragment, while in the second, they were concentrated at this zzso Analysis of the alignment of the zzso and zzso sequences suggests that the distribution is not related to the size of the region of identity at the zzso boundary but depends on the degree of identity of the zzso genes upstream of the region of identity, the zzso of successive zzso leading to a clustered distribution of the zzso Moreover, the introduction of seven closely spaced zzso near the end of a zzso segment with an zzso level of identity with zzso led to a significantly increased concentration of the junctions near this zzso These data show that a low level of identity in the vicinity of the common boundary stretch is a strong barrier to zzso In contrast, consecutive zzso or regions of overall moderate identity which are located several hundreds of zzso upstream from the zzso end do not necessarily block zzso
