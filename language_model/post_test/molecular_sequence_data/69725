The zzso motifs of two zzso zzso B8 and zzso which are associated with zzso diseases including zzso zzso were determined from natural zzso pools using zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso are zzso zzso terminated by zzso As a characteristic feature of the zzso zzso there is a high degree of conservation of positively charged zzso acids at position 3 and 5, exclusively zzso at position 3, and zzso or zzso at position zzso Additional evidence for this zzso motif is the presence of these features in several viral peptides recognized by zzso restricted T zzso The zzso motif is characterized by four zzso zzso positions ordered in an almost symmetrical arrangement, as has been found for zzso and zzso zzso A first zzso anchor three to four zzso apart from the zzso (at relative position 1) appears to be a common feature of DR zzso The second anchor is an zzso at relative position 4, which is likely to be the zzso contact site in the zzso Two additional zzso positions closer to the zzso are occupied by charged zzso acids at relative position 6 and by zzso zzso at positions 8, 9, or zzso Eight individual naturally processed zzso zzso were zzso and were found to be derived from zzso proteins and zzso membrane zzso These natural peptides conform well to the determined zzso A single exchange of the zzso positions in a model zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
