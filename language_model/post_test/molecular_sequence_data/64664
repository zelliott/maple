zzso in either zzso or zzso cause zzso sclerosis complex, an zzso dominant disorder characterized by seizures, mental zzso and benign tumors of the skin, brain, heart, and zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso genes have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso lacking zzso or zzso have similar zzso including decreased zzso zzso decreased expression of three zzso acid zzso and low zzso levels of four members of the zzso zzso zzso Recently, the small zzso zzso was identified as a target of the zzso domain of zzso in zzso cells and in zzso We show that the zzso in zzso zzso in cells lacking zzso is rescued by the expression of a dominant negative form of zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not by expressing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene with a zzso zzso within the GAP domain did not rescue the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings support a model in which zzso zzso is regulated through zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and also suggest a role for the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso acid zzso and zzso
