zzso has been discovered as a factor playing a central role in the translation of genetic information zzso in DNA and transcribed to zzso into zzso acid sequences of zzso However, subsequent studies led to the hypothesis that during evolution, zzso originated in zzso not zzso Indeed, there are many examples of zzso molecules playing roles in reactions other than translation, including replication of various zzso In this review, we have focused on functions of zzso molecules (not zzso zzso outside of their direct roles in translation as factors for a passive transportation of zzso acids into a zzso and deciphering triplets of zzso in zzso of zzso Interestingly, it appears that such zzso reactions are effective only when zzso is zzso The most spectacular examples come from bacterial cells and include induction of the stringent control, regulation of zzso of some zzso and control of replication of zzso zzso Recent studies indicated that zzso (not only zzso shown previously to be capable of zzso of zzso zzso can be responsible for specific zzso of another transcript, a zzso zzso zzso I, which is involved in the regulation of zzso DNA replication zzso If this reaction is not restricted to zzso I but represents a more general phenomenon, one might suspect a potential role for zzso zzso molecules in regulation of various zzso whose efficiency depends on zzso zzso This kind of regulation would provide a possibility for a cell to respond to different nutrition conditions resulting in different levels of zzso zzso
