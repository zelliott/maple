zzso zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso regulates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by binding a zzso site upstream of the authentic zzso site using four tandem zzso zzso binding zzso While the binding zzso and specificity of zzso have been established, little is known about the contributions of each zzso zzso domain to overall protein stability and zzso binding zzso Using a construct containing only the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso we introduced a zzso relevant point zzso into each zzso domain of zzso individually and measured stability and zzso binding affinity of the resulting zzso zzso Although secondary structure, as measured by circular zzso zzso is only subtly changed for each zzso protein relative to wild type, zzso binding affinity is reduced in each zzso zzso in the second or third zzso zzso of the protein are significantly more deleterious to zzso recognition than zzso of the outer zzso and zzso zzso These results show that despite the ability of a single zzso domain to bind zzso in some systems, zzso requires multiple tandem zzso zzso for specific and zzso recognition of zzso zzso
