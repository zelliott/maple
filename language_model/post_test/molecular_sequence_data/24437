zzso zzso were generated against various gene products present in zzso nuclear zzso zzso profiling was performed to identify zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso four of the eight inhibitor zzso identified by this screen contained an zzso sequence identical to the zzso site of zzso zzso Such zzso were shown to impede zzso complex assembly on a zzso zzso In addition, zzso small nuclear zzso particles zzso and pol II had been zzso in the absence of zzso These results suggest a role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
