We report the isolation of the mouse zzso zzso located on zzso 2, coding a nuclear zzso protein that has a zzso region zzso to zzso coli zzso protein and that is recognized by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso binds to curved DNA in zzso and in zzso suggesting a role in illegitimate zzso and in regulation of gene zzso We have shown that the zzso gene is about 8 zzso in length and displays three zzso and two zzso The zzso zzso region lacks a zzso zzso box but presents several putative regulatory zzso A major zzso initiation site is located zzso zzso upstream of the translation start zzso The zzso transcript of the zzso gene is zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso and cell lines as determined by Northern zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso DNA of other species in Southern analysis indicates the conservation of the gene among zzso and suggests that the zzso gene plays a zzso role in DNA zzso
