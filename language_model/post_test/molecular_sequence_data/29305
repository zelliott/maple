zzso ranging in size from 4 to 21 zzso acid zzso were introduced into the zzso protein of the zzso zzso encephalitis zzso zzso These deletions zzso affected a zzso domain which is present at the center of all zzso zzso protein sequences and part of which may form an zzso zzso In the context of the full-length zzso zzso the deletions did not measurably affect protein expression and up to a deletion length of 16 zzso acid zzso corresponding to almost zzso of mature protein C, viable virus was zzso This virus was strongly attenuated but highly zzso in adult mice, revealing zzso protein C as a new and attractive target for the directed zzso of zzso Apparently, the larger deletions zzso with the correct assembly of infectious virus zzso and this zzso of zzso assembly is likely to be the molecular basis of zzso However, all of the zzso carrying large deletions produced substantial amounts of zzso zzso which as judged from density zzso analyses were identical to zzso zzso particles as obtained by the expression of the surface proteins zzso and E zzso The structural and functional flexibility of protein C revealed in this study and its predicted largely zzso zzso are reminiscent of zzso proteins of other enveloped zzso such as zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and suggest that all of these may belong to a common structural class, which is fundamentally distinct from the classical zzso structures of many zzso viral zzso The possibility of attenuating zzso by disturbing virus assembly and favoring the production of zzso but highly zzso zzso particles opens up a promising new avenue for the development of live zzso zzso
