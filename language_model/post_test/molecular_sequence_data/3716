zzso zzso factors have been shown to play regulatory roles on lung zzso Although zzso gene expression is detected in the prenatal lung during development, its function has not been clarified zzso We constructed an expression zzso of a zzso zzso coding region, which was cloned from zzso fetal lung cell line zzso zzso deletion was found in the zzso zzso coding sequence when compared with the mouse zzso Under conditions of zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso gene expression of Clara zzso zzso zzso whereas the cells showed reduced expression of zzso protein zzso These zzso were attenuated by the zzso with zzso zzso zzso The results show that the cells with zzso zzso were reinforced to have characteristics of Clara cells but did not have the characteristics of zzso type II cells, and that zzso played a zzso role on Clara cell differentiation in zzso zzso In addition, the expression of Clara zzso zzso protein and zzso protein C genes was enhanced upon transfer of cells to collagen zzso suggesting that collagen zzso has some regulatory functions on lung cell differentiation through cell zzso
