zzso zzso of zzso a potential zzso zzso has been found in many tumors of humans as well as zzso The zzso status in normal and transformed mouse liver cell lines has, however, not been zzso We examined possible point zzso and compared zzso and protein expression of the zzso gene in normal zzso transformed mouse liver zzso The transformed cells studied included lines spontaneously transformed by zzso zzso transformed by zzso virus 40 zzso and chemically transformed by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso point zzso at zzso zzso position 1, of zzso was detected in zzso cells after screening of 5 zzso zzso regions where zzso zzso are zzso The zzso causes a zzso zzso No zzso were found in normal or other transformed zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso were decreased in chemically transformed (both zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso protein were found in spontaneously transformed and zzso cells, an observation that may reflect a longer zzso of the zzso as has been shown in other transformed zzso The low level of the zzso protein in zzso cells may result from zzso depression of the zzso zzso We conclude from these data that abnormal zzso status, such as point zzso or altered zzso may play a role during the zzso transformation of mouse liver zzso
