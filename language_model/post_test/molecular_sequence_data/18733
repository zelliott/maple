Two full-length zzso zzso of the zzso gene from zzso and Chinese zzso were isolated and zzso to identify structural and functional zzso The sequences for zzso in zzso zzso and Chinese zzso zzso were essentially identical to those for cattle zzso and buffalo zzso Except for two zzso in the zzso acids zzso the domain for signal zzso zzso in zzso the additional zzso were highly zzso across the species zzso zzso site (PBS) of zzso and zzso was highly reserved in the zzso domain among all species zzso The lack of zzso in zzso is consistent with the conception that the gene is highly zzso among all zzso zzso The very high conservation of the zzso gene among zzso including zzso may be due to its recent evolutionary zzso
