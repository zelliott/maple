For interpretation of zzso zzso and the considerable differences in the size of zzso among three groups of zzso zzso restriction maps were constructed from several zzso zzso maps were also developed to compare zzso zzso and gene zzso The appearance of various zzso of zzso zzso strains are different in size, but their gene content is almost zzso The zzso zzso size difference between two closely related zzso zzso zzso can be attributed to the presence or absence of an zzso in zzso zzso This phenomenon demonstrates that the migration of zzso is possibly responsible for the development of variable zzso zzso in zzso The striking differences in size and restriction patterns between two main zzso groups might derive from both the zzso variations and the altered zzso zzso
