Three zzso zzso zzso from the seeds of the squash zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso using gel zzso zzso exchange zzso and zzso zzso Their sequences could be determined only after zzso zzso In the case of zzso and zzso it was shown that their zzso zzso are zzso a structure that has never been described in squash zzso They contain 34 zzso acid zzso with 3 zzso bridges and measured molecular masses of zzso and zzso zzso They are the largest known zzso peptides containing zzso zzso Their sequences show strong zzso to other squash zzso suggesting a similar three-dimensional structure and an analogous mechanism of zzso A model of zzso was constructed by zzso to the crystal structure of the complex between bovine zzso and zzso indicating that the zzso connecting the two zzso is flexible and does not impose significant geometrical zzso This flexibility allows an zzso zzso bond zzso to occur in this region, giving rise to two zzso of zzso Although the importance of zzso is not clear, it might zzso increased stability and resistance to zzso A minor species, zzso was also characterized as containing 30 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso This component possesses a linear backbone with a blocked zzso zzso represent interesting candidates for drug design, either by changing their specificity of zzso or by using their structure as natural scaffolds bearing new binding zzso
