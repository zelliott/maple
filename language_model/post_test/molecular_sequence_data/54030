zzso factor zzso is essential for normal zzso zzso sites are consistently found in promoters or enhancers of genes expressed selectively in zzso zzso To discover novel zzso zzso we searched for zzso transcripts in zzso cells, an zzso line derived from zzso embryonic stem zzso By zzso analysis, we identified a new zzso cassette (ABC) zzso that is strongly and rapidly induced by zzso This zzso named zzso (for zzso zzso zzso to the zzso inner membrane and is expressed at particularly high levels in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is induced during zzso maturation in cell lines and primary zzso cells, and its zzso enhances zzso synthesis in zzso zzso The ABC proteins participate in diverse zzso processes by zzso zzso zzso to the transport of a variety of zzso across cell zzso We speculate that zzso a newly identified zzso ABC zzso member, may mediate critical zzso transport functions related to zzso zzso
