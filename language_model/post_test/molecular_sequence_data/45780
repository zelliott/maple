A novel zzso zzso protein has been designed that consists of six zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso C zzso Five of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are being used in many of the third-generation kits while sixth zzso zzso is an additional sequence from a newly identified Indian zzso The genes for these zzso have been joined together to code for a single zzso protein that has been evaluated for its diagnostic potential for the detection of zzso zzso in human zzso Two separate synthetic genes have been zzso both zzso the same six zzso in a single open reading frame along with zzso having additional zzso acids to function as flexible zzso or rigid zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso C zzso protein in zzso coli has been zzso The protein has been zzso using a single affinity step yielding zzso zzso pure zzso culture and used as the coating zzso in zzso zzso The use of this zzso protein eliminates the requirement for multiple diagnostic zzso for the development of zzso diagnostic zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso protein was evaluated by Boston zzso Worldwide Performance zzso zzso zzso Panels and zzso zzso zzso and was found to be comparable with commercially available zzso zzso zzso This analysis indicated its unequivocal performance as capture zzso in zzso zzso The high zzso density, careful choice of zzso and use of zzso coli system for zzso coupled with simple zzso protocol provides the potential for the development of an inexpensive diagnostic test with high degree of sensitivity and zzso
