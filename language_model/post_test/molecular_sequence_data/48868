A novel zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso habitat in Xinjiang Province, zzso zzso Its zzso status was determined using a zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso zzso gene sequence of the strain showed that it formed a zzso zzso within the radiation of the zzso zzso and the zzso was related most closely to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it had relatively lower mean zzso zzso values with the above strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso growth occurred at 35 zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of 12 % zzso zzso The zzso sugar pattern consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : 0 zzso zzso and zzso : 0 zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso detected were zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unknown zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso
