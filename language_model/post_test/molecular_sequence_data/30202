zzso zzso zzso directs the synthesis of zzso particles zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso with a zzso marker and found within zzso are capable of zzso into naked target DNA in zzso zzso consisting of a Ty long terminal repeat zzso or zzso marked with zzso and flanked by appropriate restriction sites were zzso These artificial zzso whose zzso resemble those of zzso full-length zzso reverse zzso can be zzso with zzso zzso unmarked reverse zzso resulting in the very efficient integration of the artificial zzso The results suggest that Ty DNA is limiting for zzso in zzso suggesting that inefficient reverse zzso regulates zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso of these model zzso which resemble in zzso zzso zzso zzso or differ from them in subtle ways, shows that Ty zzso proceeds by the linkage of the 3' zzso zzso of the reverse transcript to target zzso
