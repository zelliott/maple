The zzso metabolism of zzso acid occurs in specific blood cell types and zzso zzso and is activated in inflammation and tissue zzso In the course of studying zzso expression in human skin, we detected and characterized a previously zzso zzso that at least partly accounts for the zzso metabolism of zzso acid in certain zzso zzso The zzso was cloned from human hair roots, and expression of the zzso was detected also in zzso zzso and zzso an additional 16 human zzso including peripheral blood zzso were negative for the zzso The zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of 76 zzso The zzso acid sequence has approximately zzso identity to the known human zzso zzso and zzso When expressed in zzso zzso cells, the newly discovered zzso converts zzso acid exclusively to zzso acid, while zzso acid is less well zzso These features contrast with the previously reported zzso which zzso zzso acid mainly at zzso but also partly at zzso and for which zzso acid is an excellent zzso The different zzso activities and tissue distribution suggest a distinct function for the new zzso compared with the previously reported human zzso
