The results of two laboratory diagnostic zzso zzso virus zzso tests, an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso chain reaction zzso were compared with the clinical examination in the diagnosis of zzso We determined when diagnostic laboratory tests provided the initial diagnosis of zzso zzso disease and when they were only zzso 

The sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso were determined using 22 zzso zzso clinical samples, 10 zzso zzso clinical samples, 5 samples from normal zzso 4 bacterial samples, and 1 sample containing zzso zzso zzso The medical history of the 22 patients with positive zzso cultures were reviewed to determine the initial diagnosis by clinical examination and the initial zzso 

For typical presentations of zzso zzso disease, the clinical examination is as accurate as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, for zzso presentations of zzso zzso disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were more accurate in detecting zzso infection than the clinical zzso 

Laboratory diagnosis of zzso from zzso samples was most useful to the zzso in zzso presentations of zzso zzso zzso
