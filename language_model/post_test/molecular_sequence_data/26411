A zzso clone zzso a new member zzso zzso of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a library prepared from day zzso mouse zzso The zzso sequence of zzso predicts a protein of zzso zzso acids with a zzso zzso of zzso The sequence contains a pair of zzso zzso at positions zzso which is likely to represent a site for zzso zzso The zzso following the presumed zzso zzso site shows significant zzso with the known members of the zzso beta zzso matching the other family members at all of the zzso positions, including the seven zzso zzso with their characteristic zzso zzso is most zzso to zzso zzso zzso but is not likely to be the zzso zzso of zzso In zzso translation experiments were consistent with zzso being a zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that zzso may be highly zzso across zzso These results suggest that zzso is most likely an zzso factor zzso cell differentiation events during embryonic zzso
