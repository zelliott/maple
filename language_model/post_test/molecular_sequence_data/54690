The zzso zzso includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and zzso Small zzso zzso are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not been investigated in zzso Research on zzso in zzso is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify zzso candidates, thus zzso zzso zzso research to a zzso zzso Thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential zzso in the zzso zzso to open up the field of zzso research in zzso Using comparative zzso analyses combined with predictions of zzso zzso and zzso we predicted zzso in 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although more than one-third of predicted zzso have zzso zzso zzso only zzso have a start zzso downstream of zzso zzso thus, most of the predicted zzso are zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and Northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of zzso in zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested zzso We identified a zzso novel zzso which, together with the downstream gene coding for an zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso responds to the zzso zzso The number of predicted zzso correlated with the zzso function of the species zzso for zzso low for zzso and intermediate for zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso
