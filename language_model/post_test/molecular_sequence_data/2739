The zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso gene contains an zzso open reading frame that encodes a zzso zzso basic protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso West, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell 45, zzso The open reading frame zzso has been cloned as a fusion protein behind a zzso zzso promoter and zzso in zzso zzso The amplified zzso protein is associated with zzso inclusion bodies and zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso about 7 zzso smaller than zzso Data obtained from DNA sequencing, zzso acid sequencing of the fusion zzso and zzso Y zzso suggest that although the cloned gene is not altered and the protein is made from the expected start zzso it appears to terminate about 90 zzso acids before the zzso stop zzso zzso zzso during or soon after synthesis appears to be responsible for the truncated zzso The expressed protein is zzso in zzso zzso and zzso by dialysis against high zzso This partially zzso preparation has been found to contain a DNA zzso activity specific for the zzso delta I zzso which contains a precise deletion of the zzso
