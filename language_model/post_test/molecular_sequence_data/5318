zzso zzso is initiated within the zzso cell layer of zzso zzso and is zzso via the process of zzso In the zzso at least two populations of zzso cells can be distinguished during zzso development on the basis of their inherent zzso or resistance to zzso in zzso Given the previously established correlation between expression of zzso and zzso zzso cell resistance to zzso the present studies were conducted to characterize expression of zzso and an avian zzso zzso zzso in zzso at various stages of zzso zzso of zzso zzso were significantly higher only in zzso cells from the largest zzso zzso zzso compared to 3- to zzso zzso zzso By comparison, zzso zzso levels were zzso to zzso higher in zzso cells from the three largest zzso zzso compared to those from zzso 9 to 12 zzso in diameter and zzso zzso The increase in neither zzso nor zzso was correlated with the stage of zzso development associated with the acquisition of resistance to zzso in zzso cells zzso at the zzso to zzso zzso zzso from the present studies do not support a close correlation between zzso expression of zzso or zzso zzso and the transition from a state of zzso zzso to zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is proposed that zzso and zzso play more of a supportive role in regulating additional aspects of zzso cell function such as cell proliferation and/or zzso
