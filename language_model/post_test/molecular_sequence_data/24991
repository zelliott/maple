Four zzso clones of tobacco that could code for zzso with two zzso zzso were zzso Among four zzso and other zzso family zzso sequence similarity was basically limited to the two zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins with the zzso zzso domain of four zzso bound specifically to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain showed weaker binding activity with the zzso compared to the zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso domain was abolished by zzso and this zzso was recovered specifically by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zinc zzso motif in the zzso domain abolished the DNA zzso In addition, zzso in the zzso zzso sequence at the zzso side of the zinc zzso motif also significantly reduced the zzso activity, suggesting that these zzso are required for proper folding of the zzso zinc zzso
