Gene zzso which encodes zzso A of the zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso was identified and zzso This gene encodes a protein of 158 zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso The known sequence of 15 zzso acids around the zzso zzso and the known zzso zzso of the protein are correctly predicted by the zzso zzso An zzso termination zzso zzso corresponding to the location of the single zzso zzso in the zzso was found in frame at position zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was inserted behind the zzso zzso of an zzso coli expression zzso An zzso coli strain transformed with this zzso produced an zzso zzso that was not detected in extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso G reacted specifically with this zzso which was indistinguishable from authentic zzso zzso zzso A by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso expressed protein to zzso zzso protein components B and C zzso the active zzso zzso zzso Although synthesis of zzso active protein A depended on the presence of zzso in the growth zzso formation of zzso zzso protein did zzso Moreover, synthesis of zzso active protein in a transformed zzso coli zzso zzso strain indicated that there is a zzso mechanism of zzso zzso These findings imply that zzso secondary structures of zzso zzso zzso are not functional for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso coli expression zzso
