The regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso has been examined using two zzso zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso zzso coli strain zzso DNA sequence analysis and zzso coli zzso analysis were used to map two genes zzso and zzso within the zzso regulatory regions of both zzso and zzso and the protein products of these genes were zzso zzso transcription, initiated at the zzso promoter, was monitored by constructing single copy zzso zzso with zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso strains onto solid zzso minimal medium containing zzso and the zzso indicator zzso zzso yielded both zzso and zzso colony zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso since zzso of zzso with bacteria picked from zzso colonies gave rise to a much higher fraction of zzso colonies than zzso of zzso with bacteria picked from zzso zzso zzso of phase transition rates for zzso coli zzso zzso onto zzso showed that the zzso transition frequency zzso X zzso was reduced zzso when cells were zzso onto minimal medium containing zzso zzso However, the zzso frequency obtained using zzso zzso X zzso was zzso lower compared to results obtained with zzso In contrast, lowering the incubation temperature of zzso coli zzso cultures from 37 degrees C to 23 degrees C caused all cells to shift to the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
