zzso deposits within the cerebral tissue constitute a characteristic zzso associated with zzso zzso They mainly consist of the zzso zzso zzso and display an abnormal content in zzso zzso together with many zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso The region zzso of zzso can be considered the minimal zzso domain and contains two zzso subject to protein zzso The influence of zinc binding and protein aging related modifications on the zzso of this region of zzso is of importance given the zzso of this domain to constitute a therapeutic target, especially for zzso zzso In this study, we determined from zzso data the solution structure of the zzso complex in zzso solution at pH zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso were identified as zzso that zzso coordinate the zzso zzso In zzso aging experiments on zzso led to the formation of truncated and zzso zzso The major zzso generated, zzso displayed a local zzso change in the zzso region but kept a zinc binding propensity via a coordination mode involving zzso These results are discussed here with regard to zzso zzso and the zzso of the region zzso of zzso to be used as a therapeutic zzso
