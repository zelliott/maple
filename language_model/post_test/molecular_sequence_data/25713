Four zzso long zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are capable of forming zzso zzso or zzso zzso duplexes have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso In the present study, the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complex zzso were used to investigate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The products were analyzed by zzso gel zzso with zzso zzso The results confirm the duplex nature of the zzso combinations of zzso and reveal structural differences in comparison with the zzso zzso Under conditions in which zzso is substantially sensitive to zzso both the zzso and zzso duplexes are very zzso A similar result was observed with zzso and zzso although with the latter zzso the modification pattern of the labeled strands zzso and zzso was slightly different for the parallel than for the zzso zzso The zzso complex efficiently zzso the zzso but not the zzso duplex and shows a preference for zzso zzso We also tested the effect of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the chemical zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration leads to a dramatic increase in the zzso and zzso modification of zzso molecules and the zzso but not the zzso zzso We attribute the apparent reaction with zzso to a zzso of this zzso under the conditions of zzso In contrast, all reactions with zzso are somewhat depressed at high salt zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
