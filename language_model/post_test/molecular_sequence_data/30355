zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso disease characterized by a lack of plasma zzso B zzso zzso In this report, the hypothesis that zzso is due to rare zzso in the zzso B gene was zzso A total of eight zzso families were zzso zzso B gene zzso were used to establish the zzso of the zzso B zzso in family zzso zzso score analysis was used to study the linkage between the zzso B zzso and zzso These families were zzso arbitrarily as class I, II, III, or IV because of differences in the results derived from both zzso and zzso score zzso In a class I family, affected siblings, who on the basis of the hypothesis would be expected to have the same zzso B zzso had different zzso zzso score analysis of this family gave an infinite negative number at a zzso fraction zzso of zzso In two class II families, zzso who were the result of zzso marriages and who, on the basis of the hypothesis, should be zzso for a defective zzso B zzso were zzso at this zzso The sum of the zzso scores from these two families was zzso at zzso zzso zzso In one class III family, a parent was apparently zzso for a particular zzso B zzso and yet not zzso This also contributed zzso to the zzso zzso In four class IV families, disease inheritance was compatible with segregation of the zzso B zzso This, however, was not statistically significant zzso score zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
