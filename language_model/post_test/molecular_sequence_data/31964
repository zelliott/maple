zzso zzso channels are selective for zzso over zzso zzso during their transport across zzso We and others have previously shown that zzso zzso channels are primarily occupied by zzso zzso in their selectivity filters under zzso conditions, demonstrating the channel's intrinsic equilibrium preference for zzso zzso Based on this zzso we zzso that the preference for zzso zzso over zzso zzso in the filter determines its selectivity during zzso zzso Here, we ask whether zzso zzso channels, which share an overall structure and similar individual zzso sites with zzso channels, have an zzso preference at zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel we examine are all selective for zzso over zzso zzso at zzso Thus, the detailed architecture of the zzso channel selectivity zzso and not only its equilibrium zzso zzso is fundamental to the generation of selectivity during zzso zzso
