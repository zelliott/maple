A zzso for an alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso dependent protein zzso zzso was cloned from a human zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso base pairs zzso encodes a protein of 502 zzso acids (Mr approximately zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence differs from the zzso form of this gene by a 30 zzso deletion in the coding region, the position of which matches those in the two other genes for the zzso zzso These data indicate that this alternative zzso event arose prior to the divergence of the three zzso The deduced sequence of the human protein is only zzso identical to the zzso zzso form, in striking contrast to the other two zzso zzso zzso which are highly zzso between mouse and human zzso zzso this indicates a more rapid rate of evolution for the zzso zzso Analysis of Southern blots containing DNA from zzso zzso cell hybrids show that the gene is on human zzso zzso
