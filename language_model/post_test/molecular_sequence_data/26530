We present, to our knowledge, the first quantitative evidence that music and genes may have zzso by demonstrating significant correlations between traditional zzso folk songs and zzso DNA variation among nine indigenous populations of zzso These correlations were of comparable magnitude to those between language and genes for the same zzso although music and language were not significantly correlated with one zzso An examination of population structure for zzso showed stronger parallels to music than to zzso Overall, the results suggest that music might have a sufficient zzso to zzso ancient population movements and, zzso that it might be capturing different aspects of population history than zzso Music may therefore have the potential to serve as a novel marker of human zzso to complement zzso language and other zzso
