zzso DNA sequencing, coupled with in zzso gene zzso is a robust approach to identifying unknown genes in selected zzso zzso Using this approach we have isolated a novel human zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso and its mouse zzso The human zzso gene spanned 17 zzso of zzso zzso its zzso was zzso zzso long, with 8 zzso that included an open reading frame of 825 zzso zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso 1995 zzso long, was predicted to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in human zzso and has been highly zzso among divergent species from bacteria to zzso suggesting its important cellular zzso The gene product is likely to be a soluble zzso zzso but its function remains to be zzso
