A class of zzso that recognizes zzso and discriminates against other zzso zzso was recently zzso zzso that carry the consensus sequence and structural features of zzso zzso are located in the zzso untranslated region zzso of numerous zzso zzso where they control the expression of proteins involved in zzso salvage and zzso We report that three representatives of this zzso class bind zzso with values for apparent zzso constant zzso zzso that are several orders of magnitude lower than those for binding zzso Because preference for zzso is attributable to a single zzso zzso the zzso most likely recognizes its zzso by forming a zzso base zzso In addition, the zzso zzso associated with the zzso gene of zzso zzso functions as a genetic zzso switch, wherein zzso binding causes a structural zzso that zzso formation of an intrinsic zzso zzso zzso
