zzso d 1, the group I zzso of Bermuda grass zzso had been zzso and zzso 

A sequential B cell zzso on zzso d 1 was studied with zzso zzso zzso zzso d 1 was zzso by zzso zzso I into fragments, and the resulting peptides were zzso on zzso columns before being reacted with zzso d 1 zzso in a zzso A zzso d 1 zzso recognized by its zzso was selected for zzso zzso A synthetic zzso was constructed according to the determined zzso 

The zzso on zzso d 1 recognized by zzso zzso was found to be zzso independent, since its activity was not changed after sodium zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso containing this zzso was determined to be zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso d zzso The presence of this sequence in the zzso recognized by zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso and further confirmed by zzso of binding zzso zzso with synthetic zzso Some zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso p 1 was also zzso 

The primary structure of a sequential zzso on zzso d 1 was determined, and its activity was confirmed with peptides zzso according to the determined zzso
