zzso is often cited as having a stabilizing effect upon proteins with respect to zzso zzso and other forms of zzso We present here a model study on an zzso zzso that has been chemically zzso to produce single zzso The resulting zzso zzso are more stable with respect to their own zzso degradation and that by other zzso zzso parameters for zzso activity with respect to the degradation of zzso zzso zzso reveal no significant change in inherent activity thereby suggesting that reduced zzso and zzso are a consequence of stabilization, perhaps by zzso blockade of zzso points or zzso of local unfolding zzso Variation in zzso identity suggests that greater zzso size leads to greater zzso
