We report the zzso sequence and zzso of a protein first identified by zzso filament zzso of zzso zzso extracts as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Field, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso acid protein which we name zzso zzso zzso at 190 zzso on zzso zzso is expressed throughout zzso development and in tissue culture zzso By zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus of zzso cells, except in the zzso zzso where it is always zzso During zzso it is present in the zzso and cortex, and during zzso it becomes highly enriched in the zzso zzso along with zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso along with zzso is enriched in cortical areas undergoing cell cycle regulated zzso including zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In zzso rings, zzso zzso and nascent ring canals, zzso remains bound to the zzso zzso suggesting a stabilizing zzso zzso is not expressed in cells that have left the cell zzso zzso isolated from zzso extracts binds directly to zzso zzso The domain responsible for this binding has been mapped to a region of zzso zzso acids by expression of protein fragments in zzso This domain, which is zzso in solution, also zzso zzso zzso We speculate that zzso plays a role in organizing and/or stabilizing the zzso zzso and other cell cycle zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
