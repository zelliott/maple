The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are comprised of a zzso layout containing an zzso zzso region, a repeat domain, a zzso region, and a zzso zzso zzso Both proteins contain zzso zzso regions that are predicted to be in different environments within the zzso The zzso zzso zzso region is found at the zzso ends of the thin zzso zzso however, is predicted to extend 150 zzso from the center of the zzso To dissect out the functions of the zzso domain of zzso we have performed a zzso zzso screen using zzso zzso zzso as zzso We have identified zzso zzso and zzso as binding zzso zzso of the zzso interaction indicates that zzso predominantly interacts with the zzso These data suggest that zzso a known component of zzso muscle zzso interacts with zzso zzso
