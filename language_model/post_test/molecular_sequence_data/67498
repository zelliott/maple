zzso diversity can be driven by the interaction of plants with different zzso zzso bases involved in ecological adaptations to zzso constraints can be explored using zzso zzso zzso are major crops worldwide and soil zzso is a main stress affecting yield in these zzso We analyzed in the zzso zzso zzso the root zzso of two zzso having contrasting responses to salt zzso zzso sampled in a salty zzso soil, and the reference zzso A17 zzso zzso plants show increased root growth under salt stress as well as a differential zzso of sodium zzso when compared to zzso zzso analysis revealed specific gene clusters zzso regulated by salt in root zzso of zzso notably those related to the zzso zzso and to changes in zzso zzso zzso Many genes zzso zzso factors zzso were also zzso regulated between the two zzso in response to zzso Among those selected for functional studies, zzso in roots of the A17 zzso of the zzso zzso most zzso regulated between zzso improved significantly root growth under salt zzso Despite the global complexity of the differential zzso responses, we propose that an increase in this zzso zzso expression may be linked to the adaptation of zzso zzso to saline soil zzso
