zzso zzso zzso zzso the irreversible zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso is involved in the first step of the most widespread zzso route of zzso zzso zzso missing in high zzso is a potential zzso and zzso drug zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso by the zzso anomalous zzso method at zzso A zzso The structure exhibits similarity to other zzso or zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso despite the lack of significant zzso acid sequence zzso to these zzso The similarity spans a core domain zzso five zzso motifs arranged in a circle around a zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an additional zzso domain of novel zzso inserted between the first and the second zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso in a different manner from that of the zzso zzso seen in the other zzso zzso is also zzso in zzso as well as many other zzso involved in zzso zzso Based on this conservation pattern and the assumption that the zzso binding mode is similar to that of zzso an zzso zzso mechanism is zzso The main players are zzso which mounts the zzso attack on the carbon atom of the zzso group of zzso and zzso which serves as a general zzso
