zzso zzso which act through the pairing of complementary bases to an zzso target zzso are showing great promise in research and clinical zzso However, the selection of effective zzso zzso has proven more difficult than initially zzso We developed a prediction zzso to identify those sequences with the highest predicted binding affinity for their target zzso based on a zzso cycle that accounts for the zzso of structural zzso in both the target zzso and the zzso The model was used to predict the binding affinity of zzso zzso complementary to the rabbit zzso zzso and mouse tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso for which large experimental zzso were zzso Of the top ten candidates identified by the zzso for the zzso zzso six were the most strongly binding sequences determined from an experimental zzso The prediction for the zzso zzso also identified high affinity sequences with approximately zzso zzso zzso prediction of zzso efficacy is more zzso and faster than in zzso or in zzso selection and can potentially speed the development of sequences for both research and clinical zzso
