Two zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso were isolated from a newborn with fatal zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was the zzso virus zzso in the brain, and a zzso zzso zzso was the zzso virus zzso in the lung and gastrointestinal zzso zzso and zzso restriction zzso patterns indicated that zzso and zzso are related zzso The zzso zzso produced plaques similar in size to those produced by zzso zzso Unlike zzso or zzso zzso was highly cell associated and processing of zzso C and zzso D was limited to precursor forms in infected zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso could be transferred into zzso by zzso of plasmids containing the zzso or zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso with the zzso gene of zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso from within the zzso gene indicated differences for zzso zzso and zzso zzso data indicated two sets of deletions in the zzso gene that distinguish zzso from zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso following zzso zzso of young zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso was much less able to cause lethal zzso disease zzso zzso whereas zzso caused no zzso zzso of zzso selected for viruses zzso and zzso which were attenuated for lethal zzso disease, were not zzso and differed in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso or zzso resembled that of zzso These findings support a role for zzso in promoting virus zzso and for zzso zzso
