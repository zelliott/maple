The cluster of differentiation 44 zzso zzso referred to as zzso represents a novel class of zzso (Mr zzso cell zzso molecules that are involved in zzso and zzso zzso events in a variety of organ zzso We report the detection of distinct zzso in both zzso and zzso human cell lines, that zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso these two zzso zzso are located on the same approximately 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso and Southern zzso analyses performed on zzso chain reaction zzso amplification copies of these zzso confirm that their sequences zzso with previously reported zzso zzso A consensus zzso donor site which is zzso in human, zzso and mouse zzso that zzso a zzso with an zzso zzso domain zzso is zzso to generate a distinct but zzso zzso species that encodes zzso with a truncated zzso domain of only three zzso acids zzso zzso of the relative abundance of these zzso species in zzso cells using the zzso amplification technique exhibit average zzso ratios ranging between 100 and zzso zzso zzso zzso adhesive events may be regulated through a differential capacity of zzso and zzso to interact with the zzso and to participate in zzso signaling zzso
