zzso zzso the zzso isolated from the zzso of the Thai zzso zzso zzso , causes paralysis by preventing zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso receptors zzso In the current study, the region of the zzso zzso that is directly involved in binding to zzso is used as the target for zzso drug zzso The crystal structure zzso of zzso in complex with the zzso binding protein zzso a soluble zzso of the zzso binding domain of zzso was selected to prepare an zzso active binding site for zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso structure, the binding site of zzso were used as the positive control to validate the prepared zzso active binding site zzso mean square zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of the National Cancer Institute diversity set, a library of 1990 compounds with zzso zzso profiles, using zzso against the zzso active site, revealed 39 potential inhibitor zzso The adapted in zzso zzso competition zzso using zzso and zzso against the zzso from the marine species, zzso zzso zzso and from the freshwater zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed 4 compounds from the list of inhibitor candidates that had zzso to zzso zzso for the toxin binding to zzso Three hits zzso zzso and zzso can prolong the survival time of the mice if administered 30 zzso before injection with zzso but only zzso and zzso can prolong the survival time if injected immediately after injection with zzso These zzso serve as novel zzso for the development of more potent and specific zzso
