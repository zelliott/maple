A bacterial strain designated zzso was isolated from an zzso tree affected by Dutch zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso The complete zzso zzso sequence of this zzso was obtained and zzso analysis based on the zzso method indicated that the closest related zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of the family zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed the presence of type zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso found were zzso in large zzso zzso zzso and zzso and traces of zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed two peaks, the main peak corresponding to zzso and the smaller one to zzso The major fatty acid found was zzso : zzso zzso acids were zzso The polar lipids detected were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso Growth was observed with many carbohydrates including zzso and zzso as the only carbon zzso zzso activity was not zzso The data from this zzso study suggest that this zzso belongs to a novel zzso of the family zzso It is proposed that isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso be classified in a new zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso
