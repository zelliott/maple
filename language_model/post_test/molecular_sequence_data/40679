Members of the zzso protein family are involved in many important cellular events, including stress response, survival and zzso Genes of the zzso family are zzso from plants to humans, and some members are responsive to zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation of the complete zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso sea zzso zzso referred to as zzso and the zzso relationship with other zzso described in different zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by zzso during development and found to increase from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso exposure, early stage zzso collected zzso later showed a zzso (at zzso and a zzso (at zzso increase in zzso transcript levels compared with zzso The spatial expression of zzso zzso detected by whole mount in zzso zzso in both control and zzso exposed zzso harvested at late zzso zzso showed transcripts to be located in the zzso of zzso stage and widely distributed in all germ zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso parallels the failure in zzso zzso observed zzso as well as the lack of specific zzso zzso investigated by indirect zzso on whole mount zzso zzso confirm the involvement of zzso in the stress response zzso by zzso and zzso for the first time, its contribution at the zzso level in the sea zzso zzso
