Unlike the majority of flowering plants, which possess zzso flowers, white zzso zzso zzso is zzso and has flowers of two different zzso The sex is determined by the combination of zzso sex zzso zzso in females and zzso in zzso The Y zzso of zzso was zzso to generate a zzso probe which was used to screen a young male flower zzso zzso We identified five genes which represent the first active genes to be cloned from a plant Y zzso Here we report a detailed analysis of one of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in male zzso A closely related zzso zzso is predicted to be located on the X zzso and is strongly expressed in both male and female zzso zzso and zzso zzso almost identical proteins containing zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that these proteins are localized in the nucleus, and that they are most abundant in cells that are actively dividing or beginning to zzso Interestingly, they do not accumulate in arrested sexual zzso and represent potential targets for sex determination zzso These genes will permit investigation of the origin and evolution of sex zzso in zzso
