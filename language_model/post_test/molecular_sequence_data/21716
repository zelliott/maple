zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a central role in iron zzso and it is this function that is associated with a role in the innate immune system zzso The clear link between zzso and immune defense mechanism lead to propose zzso as a candidate gene for disease zzso In this study, zzso and zzso sequences of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso zzso gene structure consists of a coding region of zzso zzso divided into 17 zzso and a zzso region that includes 16 zzso and spans zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein for zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso acids and consists of an initial zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso This gene structure is similar to that of previously described zzso genes in other fish zzso zzso analyses carried out in different zzso and two zzso stages showed zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso Finally, by sequencing the zzso zzso sequences of 20 unrelated zzso 31 zzso were zzso These data allowed the zzso of the frequency of zzso substitution in the zzso gene as zzso per zzso zzso were detected in different regions of the zzso sequence but they were mainly localized in zzso regions, specifically, zzso frequency in zzso regions was zzso higher than within coding zzso
