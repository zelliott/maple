To clarify the mechanism of zzso of higher plants, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso zzso had an increased sensitivity to zzso showing a dramatic zzso of zzso synthesis and zzso arrest of leaves when grown on medium containing more than zzso zzso the wild type required exposure to zzso zzso to show the same zzso The zzso zzso is a single zzso zzso zzso caused by a zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso reduction in the translation product but not the transcript for zzso zzso zzso reduction in zzso activity monitored with zzso modulated zzso zzso impaired zzso development, as observed by electron zzso These results indicate that the zzso of such zzso functions as zzso activity observed in the zzso zzso is caused by impaired zzso protein synthesis associated with loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso gene and zzso are zzso
