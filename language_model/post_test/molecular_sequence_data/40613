zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in cellular DNA is a major source of zzso transition zzso if zzso is not repaired by the DNA base zzso repair zzso zzso Since zzso increases rapidly with temperature, zzso in particular, are expected to succumb to such zzso There has been only one report of zzso zzso showing strong similarities to that in most zzso and bacteria for zzso zzso Here we report a different type of zzso performed by extract prepared from cells of the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso showed that the zzso family 4 type of zzso zzso zzso is the principal and probably only zzso in this zzso a zzso mechanism rather than a zzso mechanism is employed for incision of the zzso site following zzso zzso The resulting 3' remnant is removed by efficient zzso activity followed by zzso zzso and zzso The finding that repair product formation is zzso similarly by zzso and zzso in zzso raises the question of whether zzso is more important in zzso because of its higher heat zzso
