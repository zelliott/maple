An internally truncated C gene of zzso zzso B virus core zzso with long internal deletion zzso zzso with zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and the products zzso were zzso from a crude zzso of the zzso by three steps: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso test and density analysis of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso products zzso zzso with zzso zzso mainly located at the zzso of zzso g zzso Observation and analysis of the zzso zzso products by zzso indicated that the zzso zzso protein produced in zzso zzso could zzso into three or more size classes of core particles which exhibited a zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso These different size classes of core particles mainly zzso on the range whose mean diameter was from 10 zzso to 48 zzso especially on the position of 11 zzso zzso zzso and the range from 27 zzso to 41 zzso zzso Furthermore, the most number of core particles mainly zzso on the range whose mean diameter was from 27 zzso to 41 zzso These results above indicated that the truncated internal long zzso zzso probably had no effect on zzso of the zzso core particles which implied the internal length zzso zzso was not the sole domain for zzso of zzso zzso or the truncated zzso protein zzso formed the fresh interactive domain with each zzso These initial results above by zzso analysis were very important for further research on the zzso zzso zzso interaction and core internal deletion zzso zzso function of zzso core zzso
