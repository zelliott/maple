The human zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is a zzso hormone found as zzso deposits in pancreatic extracts of nearly all type 2 diabetes zzso The zzso zzso of sequence zzso zzso has been shown to be responsible for the zzso zzso of the full length zzso Various zzso forms of zzso zzso were described by using zzso transform infrared zzso and solid-state zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and two forms of seeded zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso parallel zzso As a first step toward understanding this zzso we explore the equilibrium structures of the soluble zzso zzso using multiple molecular dynamics zzso simulations with the zzso Potential for zzso structure zzso zzso zzso implicit zzso force field for a total length of zzso zzso zzso the zzso is found mainly random zzso consistent with the signal measured zzso during the lag phase of zzso zzso formation, the central zzso zzso have a relative high propensity to form zzso zzso and zzso zzso are more probable than parallel zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso matches exactly the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our simulations, however, do not reveal any evidence of zzso parallel or zzso zzso zzso as reported for seeded zzso zzso All these results indicate that zzso zzso is partially zzso in a zzso
