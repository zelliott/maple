zzso are a family of cell zzso receptors involved in many zzso and zzso zzso Some of these zzso zzso such as alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha v beta 1, specifically recognize the zzso acid sequence zzso zzso within their zzso The zzso sequence is found in zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso of eggs from human and several other zzso species contain receptors capable of binding to zzso zzso and that zzso zzso are expressed by zzso Four distinct techniques were zzso to identify the presence of functional zzso on zzso zzso zzso receptors were detected on the surfaces of zzso eggs from all species zzso zzso coated with zzso which contains zzso bound to the eggs and formed zzso zzso was competitively inhibited by zzso and by zzso a soluble zzso zzso but not by zzso An zzso using zzso zzso directed against the zzso tails of the zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso alpha 5, beta 1, and alpha zzso but not beta 3, in zzso extracts of Syrian zzso zzso A dot zzso confirmed the presence of alpha v in zzso egg zzso Finally, the zzso zzso alpha 2, alpha 5, alpha 6, but not alpha 4, were detected on the surfaces of zzso eggs from human and Syrian zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso specific for alpha 2, alpha 5, and alpha 6 bound to the eggs and formed zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
