This study aimed to identify sites of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the associated zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso was used to zzso the abundance levels of proteins in whole cell zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso was then used to identify zzso zzso proteins and the precise sites of zzso zzso zzso was found on the proteins zzso factor zzso zzso 2, and zzso as well as zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites were mapped in all zzso zzso zzso of known and putative zzso in association with zzso showed that zzso is zzso by zzso at zzso 30 and zzso by zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso at zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed that putative zzso zzso affects the zzso of proteins zzso and zzso this was detected by Western zzso and zzso This zzso shows strong zzso conservation and a zzso motif associated with its active zzso We suggest that zzso zzso is named zzso zzso 2 zzso in line with the recent naming of zzso as zzso
