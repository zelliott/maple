zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso invades zzso cells of the peripheral nerves leading to nerve damage and zzso which is the hallmark of the zzso Wet experiments have shown that zzso zzso binds to a major peripheral nerve zzso the zzso P zero zzso This protein is specific to peripheral nerve and may be important in the initial step of zzso zzso binding and invasion of zzso cells which is the feature of zzso Though the receptors on zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso have been identified the molecular mechanism of nerve damage and zzso is not clearly zzso Recently pathogen and host zzso sequence similarities zzso zzso have been implicated in neurodegenerative zzso The approach of the present study is to zzso zzso tools to understand zzso nerve damage by carrying out sequence and structural similarity searches of zzso zzso with zzso and other zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is unique to peripheral zzso its sequence and structural similarities in other zzso have also been zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso proteins revealed two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso membrane zzso which showed similarity to the query zzso zzso with the entire zzso database zzso by basic local alignment search tool for proteins zzso and fold zzso of zzso alignment of proteins zzso searches revealed that zzso zzso had zzso similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso anthrax protective zzso diphtheria zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso among zzso These proteins are known to be associated directly or indirectly with zzso zzso and structural similarities to the zzso regions of zzso zzso could have implications in zzso zzso as it has zzso adhesive zzso Although these observed similarities are not highly significant in their percentage identity, they could be functionally important in molecular zzso zzso binding and cell signaling events involved in zzso
