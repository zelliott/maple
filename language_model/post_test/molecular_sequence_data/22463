Despite increasing exploitation of zzso zzso as a model system there is a lack of convenient zzso for research and zzso zzso with the commonly used promoter, zzso 1, requires a zzso regime involving the removal of zzso zzso from a growing culture and further growth for 18 h to achieve maximum zzso thus underlining the need for more zzso zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of a truncated zzso of the zzso 1 promoter having novel induction zzso it is induced by shift of growth temperature from 36 degrees C to 25 degrees C, achieving maximum expression within 3 zzso Similar features of expression were observed with the reporter genes zzso and zzso a native zzso zzso 18, and a commercially important foreign therapeutic zzso zzso The new promoter element offers additional advantages, such as lack of deleterious effect on cell viability and potential ability to express toxic zzso These features make the new promoter a potentially better alternative to zzso 1, both as a research tool and for expression of commercially important proteins in zzso zzso and suggest the possibility of using similar approaches to design promoters with novel and useful zzso
