The zzso and zzso reactions of the zzso drug zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso have been investigated by high performance liquid zzso mass zzso and nuclear magnetic zzso zzso mediates a rapid zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bond in zzso acid solution zzso zzso or zzso for all three zzso leading to release of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and formation of zzso zzso complexes of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso An alternative reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the original zzso following zzso zzso The downstream zzso zzso is competitive with the likewise zzso upstream zzso of the zzso linkage in the zzso zzso This leads to formation of both the zzso complex of zzso due to upstream zzso and the analogous zzso complex for zzso due to initial downstream loss of zzso followed by upstream loss of zzso zzso As downstream zzso is not observed for zzso under similar conditions, it may be concluded that rapid zzso zzso substitution of the zzso zzso in zzso to an zzso zzso S atom must assist zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
