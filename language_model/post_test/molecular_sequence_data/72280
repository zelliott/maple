A gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated, zzso a zzso constructed by zzso the zzso was as sensitive to killing by ultraviolet light and gamma radiation as the zzso zzso and slightly more sensitive to killing by zzso zzso There was no suppression of killing by ultraviolet light when a zzso strain was transformed with a zzso zzso containing zzso nor was there suppression when zzso was transformed with a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso proficiency as measured by a gap repair zzso was diminished in both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the frequency of zzso was zzso but the spectrum of events was similar to that observed in wild type, while in zzso the frequency as well as the spectrum of zzso events were zzso Studies with the zzso zzso double zzso indicated that there was zzso in the action of zzso and zzso in certain repair and zzso functions, but some measure of independent action in other zzso
