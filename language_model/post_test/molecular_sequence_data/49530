We have screened a cohort of 239 Norwegian cancer patients for sequence variation in the coding and regulatory regions of the zzso zzso gene zzso and analyzed the impact of gene zzso on zzso zzso in zzso In all, 12 single zzso zzso zzso were identified, 10 of which have not been previously zzso Only one zzso causes a change in zzso acid sequence zzso Seven zzso zzso were observed and three main zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso to zzso serum ratios among 175 patients who received chronic oral zzso therapy, and who had normal zzso and zzso zzso The apparent lack of functional zzso fits well with the near zzso but zzso zzso of the ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that factors other than zzso zzso may be more deciding for the zzso in zzso zzso to zzso serum zzso
