We have analyzed the zzso activity of the zzso tumor zzso gene in human tumor cell lines harboring activated zzso zzso The levels of zzso protein and incorporation of zzso in zzso zzso cells were determined simultaneously by flow zzso The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso colon zzso cell lines were equally sensitive toward zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso independent of the state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso at zzso acid zzso 143 resulted in increased proliferation of zzso cells, which have two zzso zzso zzso zzso To mimic the genetic constitution of an evolving tumor cell that has sustained a zzso in one zzso zzso we zzso both zzso and zzso zzso genes controlled by strong viral promoters in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed a reduced zzso zzso similar to cells into which only zzso zzso had been zzso The zzso zzso gene is a dominant growth zzso over the zzso in all three different cell lines zzso By zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate the presence of both the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso protein in the zzso zzso
