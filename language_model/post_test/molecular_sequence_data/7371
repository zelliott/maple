The zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned by zzso of an zzso coli zzso strain zzso for zzso zzso The gene was zzso and found to zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso with a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed strong conservation with that of the zzso coli zzso and to other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The physical location of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso was at about 200 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene yielded zzso zzso strains zzso for zzso indicating that the zzso gene product is responsible for synthesis of the zzso zzso required for zzso zzso We also found that transformation of the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso that grew in the absence of zzso In agreement with prior work, our attempts to determine the zzso activity in zzso zzso extracts were zzso However, expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso coli gave zzso activity that was only slightly inhibited by zzso zzso Since the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso is very sensitive to zzso zzso by zzso zzso these results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from that of zzso zzso It seems that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso synthesis at the level of gene expression rather than through the zzso coli mechanism of strong zzso zzso of an zzso produced in zzso
