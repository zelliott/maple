The zzso regions of T cell zzso zzso and zzso chains play central roles in the recognition of zzso zzso zzso zzso repertoire is created on the basis of zzso recognition specificity by zzso To analyze the potential spectrum of zzso and zzso to exhibit zzso specificity and generate zzso repertoire, we established hundreds of zzso zzso bearing a single zzso or zzso chain derived from a zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso and randomly picked up zzso or zzso zzso Surprisingly, one-third of such zzso containing random zzso beta from zzso T cells of normal mice could zzso the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso A similar dominant function of zzso in forming zzso zzso though zzso was obtained for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we generated zzso and/or zzso transgenic zzso mice specific for zzso zzso and analyzed the zzso repertoire of zzso zzso Similar to the results from zzso zzso zzso zzso generated zzso with zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso bearing a single zzso These findings of zzso recognition with minimum involvement of zzso beta expand our understanding regarding the flexibility of the spectrum of zzso and suggest a zzso role of zzso chain in determining the zzso repertoire of zzso zzso
