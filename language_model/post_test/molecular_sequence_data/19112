In normal prostate zzso the zzso gene zzso a type II zzso zzso is directly regulated by male hormones through the zzso zzso In prostate cancer zzso zzso frequently gains hormonal control by seizing gene regulatory elements of zzso through zzso fusion zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso gene has been established, little is known about other elements that may interact with zzso promoter sequences to zzso zzso expression in zzso gene fusion zzso 

Comparative zzso analyses of the zzso promoter upstream sequences and zzso analyses were performed by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes expressions were evaluated by zzso or by quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for monitoring the gene expression levels of zzso zzso zzso regulatory function of zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso to its zzso elements was monitored by zzso zzso zzso 

Comparative analysis of the zzso promoter upstream sequences among different species revealed the conservation of binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso such as, zzso loss, zzso attenuated expression or decreased protein stability represent established pathways in prostate zzso We found that zzso directly binds to zzso upstream sequences and zzso regulates the expression of the zzso zzso through the zzso gene zzso 

These observations imply that the frequently noted zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso in prostate zzso
