In the present study, we characterized a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso heat shock protein 23 zzso zzso named zzso zzso The two zzso zzso genes are transcribed in opposite directions and zzso two almost identical zzso Furthermore, the two genes exhibit a very high degree of similarity in their zzso untranslated and zzso promoter zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso proteins are zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso regions of the zzso genes revealed the presence of several putative heat shock zzso Both zzso genes are induced by heat in a similar zzso In addition to zzso the zzso genes are expressed at several stages of normal development as well as in zzso and zzso In general, the zzso expression patterns of the zzso genes are similar, suggesting that they are under similar regulatory zzso However, the expression of the zzso genes differs significantly from the expression of the zzso zzso gene in certain embryonic and zzso zzso suggesting differential regulation of the zzso genes in the two zzso zzso The expression of both zzso genes in adult flies is increased with age, especially in zzso
