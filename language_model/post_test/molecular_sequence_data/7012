The binding of DNA zzso III zzso zzso to a zzso DNA zzso containing a strong zzso site has been zzso The minimal zzso requirement for zzso zzso zzso has been determined to consist of 7 zzso 6 bases zzso to the zzso site and only 1 base 3' to the zzso zzso zzso protection experiments indicate that the zzso also binds to its zzso zzso protecting approximately 12 bases zzso to the zzso site and only 2 bases 3' to the zzso zzso A zzso inactive zzso of zzso III shows the same protection pattern as the active zzso indicating that zzso III is a zzso binding protein as well as a zzso zzso with this view, an zzso containing a zzso site is a more effective inhibitor and is bound more efficiently by zzso III than an zzso without a zzso zzso
