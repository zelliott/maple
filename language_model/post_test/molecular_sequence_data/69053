The zzso zzso zzso tax was used to gain insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso cell lines produce zzso zzso zzso An zzso promoter zzso zzso construct that contained an zzso B site was active in the zzso zzso cell line, which contains defective zzso but expresses zzso The observation that a zzso zzso B construct zzso was inactive in zzso confirmed the importance of zzso B in zzso gene zzso Tax was zzso into zzso human zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso expressing tax contained elevated levels of zzso B that directly bound to the zzso B zzso Tax zzso with reporter zzso into zzso cells zzso activated zzso and zzso zzso and also activated zzso to a lesser zzso In zzso T cells, tax induced zzso activity by two- to zzso though there was no induction of zzso The increase in zzso zzso activity mirrored the increase in zzso zzso activity seen under these zzso These studies, the first to demonstrate induction of zzso promoter activity over zzso levels, indicate that zzso tax causes low-level zzso of both zzso zzso and the zzso promoter, at least in part through zzso of zzso zzso
