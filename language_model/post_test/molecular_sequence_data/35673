A zzso that could be recovered from the zzso of cultures, as well as from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a 29 zzso zzso by its ability to degrade DNA after zzso in zzso zzso zzso Some clones of a gene library of strain zzso zzso established in zzso coli were found to produce the 29 zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso this zzso was zzso and zzso The deduced zzso zzso had a molecular weight of zzso presented a zzso signal zzso in its zzso region and showed zzso to the products of the zzso gene from zzso zzso and the zzso gene from zzso zzso The zzso protein from zzso itself, or from the cloned zzso gene expressed in zzso coli, zzso the degradation of both zzso and DNA, had the potential to act as an zzso and functioned best in the presence of zzso or zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated which failed to produce the 29 zzso zzso
