The gene for the zzso small nuclear zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is interrupted by an zzso whose structure is similar to those found in zzso zzso precursors zzso zzso This is the only known example of a split zzso gene from any zzso plant, or zzso To address the uniqueness of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the structures of the zzso genes from five zzso strains and three other zzso A zzso of the zzso coding sequence was amplified from the zzso DNA of each strain by the zzso chain reaction zzso The sizes of the zzso products indicated that all of the zzso zzso strains possess zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes from the other zzso appeared to be zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso gene fragments revealed that each had an zzso of approximately 50 base pairs in precisely the same zzso In addition to the zzso sites and putative branch point regions, a sequence immediately upstream of the branch point consensus was found to be zzso in all of the zzso zzso zzso This sequence matches the consensus for the B box of zzso zzso zzso These results raise the interesting possibility that synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso might involve the use of internal promoter elements similar to those found in other genes transcribed by zzso zzso zzso
