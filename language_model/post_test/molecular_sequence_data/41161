A zzso zzso zzso short rod, designated zzso was isolated from a spent mushroom zzso sample collected in the zzso region, South zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso was a member of the family zzso however, the isolate formed a branch separate from other zzso within the zzso zzso similarity between strain zzso and other members of the family zzso was zzso the highest sequence similarity being with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (both zzso Some zzso properties of strain zzso were consistent with those of the family zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the major cellular fatty acids and zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso as the polar zzso However, strain zzso contained a zzso zzso not previously found in the family zzso The DNA zzso content was 68 zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was considered to represent a novel zzso and species in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
