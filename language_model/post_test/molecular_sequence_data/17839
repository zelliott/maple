A head zzso zzso analogue is described which even at high zzso does not lose its biological zzso By zzso two zzso molecules over a zzso zzso the zzso was sufficiently altered, such that zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso In addition, the introduction of a zzso instead of zzso in one of the two zzso molecules allowed radioactive zzso with zzso This zzso zzso was used to investigate the effect of zzso at different zzso and as zzso for zzso zzso zzso We found that low zzso zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso cell zzso and that higher zzso zzso zzso were required for the determination of zzso cells to nerve zzso zzso of the radioactive zzso zzso to living zzso and to zzso membrane zzso was zzso and zzso zzso was compatible with zzso zzso with a stable zzso zzso but less well with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and kinetic analyses revealed the presence of at least two types of binding site in the membrane zzso one with a zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and one with a zzso higher affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso cells were zzso zzso suggesting that the number or types of zzso receptors may vary depending on cell cycle zzso A zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso contained zzso more zzso receptors per zzso protein than other zzso species or zzso
