A transport protein is described with 12 zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso domain, several novel zzso repeats are zzso in human, zzso rat and zzso four to six of which had the zzso form zzso In the zzso domain, a zzso sequence zzso is zzso zzso expression of the zzso was identified in zzso cells of the adult zzso that zzso growth hormone and zzso In the zzso expression was restricted to zzso zzso zzso zzso central nervous system, eye, liver and zzso In particular, expression was found in structures associated with rapid calcium exchange including the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso that expresses zzso zzso Furthermore, expression found in zzso and zzso within the zzso portions of zzso and collecting zzso was consistent with a role in calcium zzso In human zzso four zzso zzso and in mouse zzso three zzso transcripts were zzso In developing mouse zzso the amount of each transcript varied that suggested the multiple transcripts might be zzso expressed in different zzso zzso We propose that the zzso is specific for a zzso complex and is important for growth and calcium zzso
