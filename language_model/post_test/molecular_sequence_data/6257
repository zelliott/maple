A simple and efficient method of the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso nylon zzso was zzso The method is based on the reaction between a zzso introduced zzso group of an zzso and membrane zzso zzso by a water soluble zzso Judging from the mechanism of zzso group zzso by the zzso optimal conditions of the zzso were selected, which made it possible to increase the zzso efficiency and carrier capacity as compared with those described zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso as an example, the zzso immobilized were shown to be capable of zzso with complementary zzso
