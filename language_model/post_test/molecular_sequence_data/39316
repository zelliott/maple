zzso the zzso processes affecting endangered species is crucial both to interpreting their evolutionary history and to the establishment of conservation zzso Lions provide a key opportunity to explore such zzso however, a lack of genetic diversity and shortage of suitable samples has until now hindered such zzso We used zzso control region DNA zzso sequences to investigate the zzso history of modern zzso using samples from across their entire zzso We find the sub-Saharan African lions are zzso among modern zzso supporting a single African origin model of modern zzso evolution, equivalent to the zzso African zzso model of modern human zzso We also find the greatest variety of zzso zzso in the zzso of Africa, which may be due to the distribution of physical barriers and zzso habitat changes caused by zzso glacial zzso Our results suggest that the modern zzso may currently consist of three geographic populations on the basis of their recent evolutionary zzso North zzso southern African and middle zzso Future conservation strategies should take these evolutionary subdivisions into zzso
