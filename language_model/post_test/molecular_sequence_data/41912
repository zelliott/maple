Both the spliced and zzso zzso zzso species are transcribed from the viral zzso of the high risk human zzso 16, 18, and 31 zzso 16, 18 and 31) in zzso cervical zzso but no spliced zzso transcripts have been found in the low risk zzso zzso and 11 in zzso benign zzso In this study, to examine the in zzso biological activities of the spliced and zzso zzso zzso of zzso we zzso three zzso zzso zzso that is, zzso zzso zzso I and zzso II, for full-length zzso zzso and two spliced zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, from the cervical zzso cell line zzso by reverse zzso zzso zzso We also constructed two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which carry single point zzso at the zzso donor site and the zzso zzso site, zzso These zzso zzso were cloned and tested for the ability to transform primary rat zzso zzso with activated zzso gene and to induce cellular DNA zzso zzso I showed almost the same level of these activities as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The transforming activities of the zzso site zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of zzso were low compared to zzso zzso and none of these zzso showed any zzso abilities to induce cellular DNA zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is important for in zzso biological activities of the zzso zzso region, possibly by high-level zzso protein zzso
