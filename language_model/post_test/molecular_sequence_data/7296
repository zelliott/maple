We have studied the membrane topography and zzso of the envelope proteins of zzso zzso virus zzso strain zzso zzso of open reading frames zzso 2, 5, and 6 were in zzso translated in the absence and presence of zzso zzso and the products analyzed for molecular weight, sensitivity to zzso zzso F and zzso and reaction with zzso zzso The zzso 6 zzso translation was enhanced in the presence of zzso zzso zzso 6 encodes a zzso class III membrane protein identified as the zzso zzso envelope protein zzso approximately 18 zzso The protein has a very short (about 11 zzso zzso zzso a longer (about 79 zzso zzso zzso zzso and crosses the membrane three times between these zzso zzso 5 encodes the primary zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that it is a zzso class I zzso After removal of a signal zzso the processed protein of about zzso zzso acids consists of a short zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso with three zzso zzso that appear to be zzso a segment that crosses the membrane three times, and an about 74 zzso acid long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are probably directed to an zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso 2 protein is a standard class I zzso with a single zzso membrane anchor segment and its signal zzso is removed during zzso zzso The remaining zzso (about 165 zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso which appear to be zzso Our results suggest that the zzso 2 protein may be present in a low concentration in zzso zzso zzso
