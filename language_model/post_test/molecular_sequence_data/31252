We have recently found that the zzso region of the cell zzso zzso zzso associates with three proteins named zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we show by analysis of various zzso zzso zzso expressed in mouse L cells that this association is zzso by a specific domain in the zzso zzso A specific recognition site for zzso is located in a zzso acid zzso Interestingly, 69 of the 72 zzso acid zzso are zzso by a single zzso of the zzso zzso To demonstrate the direct interaction between zzso and the zzso acid domain, zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and various 3' sequences of zzso were expressed in L zzso zzso proteins between zzso and the zzso acid domain of zzso were zzso by zzso with zzso zzso to complex with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso connect zzso to zzso zzso We provide zzso evidence for an association of the zzso complex with zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso alpha plays a key role in the association with zzso zzso whereas zzso beta binds more directly to the zzso region of zzso In cell zzso zzso with zzso cells expressing normal or zzso zzso the adhesive function was expressed only when zzso was associated with zzso From these results we conclude that the zzso zzso of zzso is of major biological zzso
