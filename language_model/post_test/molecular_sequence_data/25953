zzso zzso has been used to study the interaction of zzso A with zzso at low and intermediate zzso ratios (less than zzso zzso contacts were identified by nuclear zzso effect zzso which also served to monitor exchange of the drug between different binding zzso At low zzso ratios zzso zzso A binds in two zzso within the five central zzso base pairs and has a preference zzso for binding with the zzso end directed toward the zzso side of the zzso zzso The pattern of zzso contacts corresponding to the preferred binding orientation are consistent with the drug sliding between adjacent zzso and zzso binding sites at a rate that is fast on the zzso time zzso Similarly, the pattern of zzso associated with the less favored orientation are consistent with the drug sliding between adjacent zzso and zzso sites, again in fast zzso zzso for the drug from the major and minor binding zzso were measured to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, at 35 degrees zzso At intermediate zzso ratios zzso exchange of the drug between the two zzso and the two sites of a zzso complex is zzso zzso for both drugs from the zzso complex were measured to be zzso zzso zzso zzso (35 degrees zzso
