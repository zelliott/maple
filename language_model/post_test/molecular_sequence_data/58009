We describe a new approach for the production of peptides using a combination of zzso DNA technology, chemical zzso and zzso zzso An artificial substance zzso is produced as a zzso zzso fusion protein containing nine copies of the zzso sequence zzso The fusion protein accumulates in zzso coli as zzso inclusion bodies which are easily isolated and zzso The zzso blocks are selectively zzso from the zzso fusion protein by zzso zzso a zzso zzso is produced when a zzso zzso is included in the zzso reaction zzso This zzso zzso is converted converted to substance P by zzso zzso transfer and subsequent zzso zzso These results demonstrate that peptides can be readily produced by a combination of zzso DNA technology and zzso zzso The approach allows incorporation of groups other than natural zzso acids into zzso and zzso
