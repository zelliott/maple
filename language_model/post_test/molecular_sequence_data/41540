Although single zzso zzso zzso are commonly used in human zzso they have only recently been incorporated into genetic studies of zzso organisms, including zzso zzso have several advantages over other molecular markers for studies of population zzso they are quicker and more straightforward to score, zzso comparisons of data are less complicated, and they can be used successfully with low-quality zzso We screened portions of the zzso of one of the most abundant zzso in zzso waters, the common zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified 153 zzso resulting in an overall average of one zzso every 463 base zzso Custom zzso zzso were designed for 53 of these zzso and their performance was tested by zzso a set of zzso zzso samples, including some with low-quality zzso We found that in zzso of the zzso zzso the minor zzso frequency zzso estimated during initial zzso zzso using a DNA pool of 10 individuals differed significantly from the final zzso after zzso over 100 individuals, suggesting caution when making zzso about zzso values based on small data zzso For two zzso we also characterized the basis for unusual zzso patterns to determine whether their data could still be zzso for further genetic zzso zzso results support the use of these zzso for accurate analysis of both poor and zzso zzso We report the first zzso markers and zzso zzso for use in population and conservation genetic studies of zzso zzso
