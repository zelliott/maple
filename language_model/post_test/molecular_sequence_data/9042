A novel zzso type, designated zzso zzso was found to be zzso and produced by the strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was active against both zzso and zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso The zzso zzso activity gene zzso and the zzso zzso immunity gene zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was very similar in its zzso zzso domain to zzso zzso zzso identity in the last 178 zzso acid zzso indicating pore forming as its lethal mode of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso gene zzso which encodes the zzso outer membrane protein with unknown function, as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso gene into the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso restored its zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso strain zzso coli zzso acquired zzso to zzso zzso only when both the zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso similarities between the zzso and zzso zzso and the detected partial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso producers suggest a common evolutionary origin of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
