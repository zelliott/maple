Drug zzso are an important part of the defense of cells against zzso zzso One major group of zzso is known as zzso resistance associated proteins zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso belong to the zzso binding cassette zzso zzso One family member, zzso (also known as zzso functions as a cellular zzso pump for zzso drugs, such as zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso agents such as zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso to an zzso and subsequently determined the zzso gene zzso This analysis revealed that the zzso was attributed to two additional zzso that would be predicted to produce premature termination zzso zzso in zzso The highly similar mouse zzso gene also contained these zzso which were remarkable because their size and sequence identity were much higher than the overall similarity between these zzso Further, a comparison of human, monkey and zzso zzso genes revealed that these same zzso zzso were also highly zzso in zzso As all the zzso zzso containing these zzso zzso might produce nonsense zzso we further tested the hypothesis that these zzso were targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso selectively stabilized zzso containing zzso transcripts in human, monkey and zzso cell zzso Moreover, the amount of zzso zzso transcripts was critically dependent upon protein zzso as removal of the inhibitor dramatically decreased zzso which correlated with the resumption of protein zzso These are the first studies to indicate that the highly zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene may dictate its zzso
