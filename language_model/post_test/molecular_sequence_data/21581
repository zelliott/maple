zzso and cell surface proteins are generally modified with zzso zzso and zzso enrichment is an attractive tool to analyze these zzso The role of zzso zzso in cardiovascular disease, particularly zzso and zzso injury, is poorly zzso Observation of zzso by mass zzso is challenging due to the presence of abundant, zzso zzso and robust methods for zzso are zzso We employed zzso with multiple zzso to increase zzso coverage coupled with parallel zzso zzso using zzso capture, titanium dioxide, and zzso interaction liquid zzso with and without an zzso zzso zzso peptides were treated with zzso F and analyzed by liquid zzso This allowed the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso sites, representing zzso protein groups from ex zzso rat left zzso zzso False positive zzso were observed on 44 peptides containing a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso by analysis of samples without zzso F zzso We used zzso via zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso and validation with zzso labeling to analyze changes in zzso from tissue following prolonged zzso and zzso (40 zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso indicative of zzso zzso The zzso approach revealed 80 of zzso zzso with altered zzso while zzso labeling confirmed 46 of these and revealed an additional 62 significant zzso These were mainly from predicted zzso zzso and basement membrane proteins that are implicated in cardiac zzso Analysis of zzso released from zzso proteins suggest that the observed changes were not due to significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso proteins included the zzso complexes and collagen assembly zzso zzso mast cell zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and rich in zzso and zzso zzso The data suggest that cardiac zzso is initiated earlier during zzso than previously zzso
