zzso zzso beta zzso zzso gene zzso occur in a third of early zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso D, and J segments involved in these inappropriate zzso remain unknown and are of interest, both because partial D beta J beta and complete V beta D beta J beta zzso occur at distinct stages of zzso maturation and because these zzso are regulated zzso We have therefore studied in detail seven cases of zzso ALL that show inappropriate zzso zzso beta gene zzso Analysis of zzso DNA by Southern zzso with C zzso J beta 1, V beta 8, and V beta 11 zzso suggested the involvement of V beta segment in tumor cell zzso A complete zzso library constructed from one case was screened with a C beta probe, and the zzso beta gene zzso was cloned and fully zzso to show an out of frame V beta zzso beta zzso zzso zzso beta gene zzso occurring in other cases were further analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso using J beta and V beta zzso and the resulting specific zzso products were zzso Evidence of zzso V beta zzso was obtained in all zzso These unexpected findings represent the first definitive demonstration that complete V zzso zzso beta zzso can occur in zzso cells and contrast with the previously reported lack of V zzso zzso beta zzso in B cells from V zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso In the context of increasing evidence that zzso are linked to zzso of zzso gene zzso these data prompt a search in zzso ALL cells for the presence of zzso V beta transcripts whose zzso expression may be linked to early transforming zzso
