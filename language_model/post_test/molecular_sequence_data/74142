zzso diseases are fatal neurodegenerative conditions for which there is no effective zzso zzso propagation involves the conversion of cellular prion zzso zzso to its zzso zzso zzso which accumulates in zzso Here, we show effective therapeutic zzso of zzso expression using zzso in mice with established prion zzso A single administration of zzso expressing a zzso targeting zzso into each zzso of mice with established prion disease significantly prolonged survival zzso zzso animals lived zzso and zzso longer than mice given an zzso zzso or not treated, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also prevented the onset of behavioral deficits associated with early prion disease, reduced zzso zzso and protected against zzso zzso In contrast, mice receiving empty virus or no treatment developed early cognitive impairment and showed severe zzso and zzso zzso The focal use of zzso zzso in prion disease further supports strategies depleting zzso which we previously established to be a valid target for zzso zzso This approach can now be used to define the zzso zzso and regional requirements for zzso zzso for effective treatment of prion disease and to explore mechanisms involved in zzso zzso dysfunction and its zzso
