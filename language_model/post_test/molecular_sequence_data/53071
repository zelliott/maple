zzso is a major component of the membrane zzso a structure found at the plasma membrane of most animal zzso zzso and the membrane skeleton have been proposed to stabilize cell zzso generate cell zzso or zzso specific membrane zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso develop slowly, and the adults are paralyzed and zzso However, the membrane integrity is not impaired in zzso animals, nor is cell polarity zzso Thus, zzso is not essential for general membrane integrity or for cell zzso However, zzso is required for a subset of processes at cell zzso In zzso the loss of zzso leads to abnormal zzso zzso In muscles, a loss of zzso leads to disorganization of the zzso zzso zzso in the dense bodies, and a reduction or loss of the zzso zzso These defects are consistent with zzso function in zzso proteins at cell zzso
