We describe here the role of zzso present in clones of zzso DNA that result in cell zzso and zzso formation by zzso zzso The zzso clones were obtained from zzso zzso bacteria resident in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso One of these zzso clones zzso was chosen for more detailed studies and a variety of genetic methods were used to zzso the region responsible for the zzso to an open reading frame of zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis with other zzso clones giving rise to the same zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso with the same modular zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence data assigned these zzso zzso to recently identified, but zzso zzso of zzso believed to be zzso dominant in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso is a modular protein containing putative zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso with a similar organization and functional properties to some zzso zzso that also zzso adhesive properties and zzso zzso We also show here that the cloned zzso result in the production of zzso DNA, which appears to be the key for zzso formation and zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso formation and cell zzso in gut zzso might occur via the concerted action of zzso zzso and the production of zzso DNA to serve as a zzso zzso
