The zzso zzso zzso cap zzso zzso is a zzso acid protein zzso by the essential zzso zzso To identify structural features of zzso required for zzso function, we introduced zzso zzso at 19 positions within a zzso acid region of similarity to the zzso domain of the zzso capping zzso Three new zzso lethal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso relationships were clarified by introducing conservative zzso at zzso zzso and zzso and at zzso (an essential zzso identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso were viable, whereas zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso side chains were critical at both zzso zzso was viable, suggesting that a basic zzso zzso zzso was zzso whereas zzso was viable, albeit slow zzso thus, an aromatic side chain was zzso The zzso zzso that were deleterious in zzso zzso zzso defects in zzso By studying the effects of zzso and zzso zzso we defined a fully active zzso domain of zzso from zzso 130 to zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso activity in zzso but essential for function in zzso This analysis allowed us to delineate a zzso of zzso proteins within the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, we identify a candidate zzso zzso gene zzso a putative cap zzso All zzso essential for zzso activity are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
