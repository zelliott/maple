zzso type I is an abundant component of the zzso zzso and due to its zzso constitutes a prominent target of zzso zzso in zzso modifications such as zzso and zzso These protein modifications involved in aging, zzso diseases and diabetes, are linked to elevated cancer zzso In this in zzso study, we investigated the impact of zzso and zzso collagen type I on the migratory behavior of the highly invasive zzso human zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso on modified zzso did not differ from that on native zzso The zzso collagen delayed the cell zzso time whereas the zzso one had no zzso The migration ability of zzso was studied by zzso single cell speed using zzso zzso strongly inhibited mean cell speed by zzso whereas zzso moderately affected it by zzso In addition, the influence of these collagen modifications on zzso and zzso organization was zzso On the zzso zzso zzso of cells revealed a dramatic loss of zzso stress fibers zzso zzso on the zzso zzso In these cells, zzso zzso was accompanied with a zzso of zzso and both proteins were localized at the rim of the zzso zzso the focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso collagen only induced a significant zzso zzso both collagen modifications provoked a differential zzso of zzso zzso state by zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that, in zzso collagen zzso and zzso may affect tumor cell zzso This suggestion is supported by clinical studies reporting less aggressive tumors in diabetic or zzso zzso zzso the impact of such zzso modifications has to be taken into account in order to better understand the link between aging, diabetes or zzso and cancer zzso
