Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a marine solar zzso and an inland salt lake in zzso Both had zzso cells that zzso in distilled water, stained zzso and formed zzso zzso They were zzso requiring at least 100 g zzso zzso and zzso g zzso zzso for growth at the optimum growth temperature of 37 zzso The major polar lipids of the two strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two major zzso zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Trace amounts of two unidentified zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of the two strains were zzso identical and showed zzso similarity to the most closely related members of the zzso zzso of the family zzso The zzso gene sequence similarity between strains zzso and zzso was zzso and these sequences showed zzso similarity to those of the most closely related members of the zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso value between strain zzso and strain zzso was zzso and the two strains showed low zzso zzso to members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso properties suggest that strains zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
