Our laboratory has developed testing methods that use real-time zzso and zzso analysis to enable the rapid identification of potential zzso zzso zzso zzso We describe a real-time zzso zzso that detects four zzso zzso genes zzso toxins A zzso and B zzso and the zzso toxin genes zzso and zzso as well as a zzso zzso that detects common deletions in the zzso gene in less than 4 zzso A subset of historical and recent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 31) was also analyzed by zzso gel zzso to determine the circulating North American zzso zzso types that have been isolated in New York zzso Thirteen different zzso types were found among the 31 zzso tested, 13 of which were zzso type 1 zzso To further assess the best approach to utilizing our conventional and molecular methods, we studied the populations of zzso zzso in patient stool specimens zzso zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso of individual stool specimens had zzso populations of zzso zzso when we compared the molecular characterization results for multiple bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular analysis of stool specimens gave results that correlated well with the results obtained with cultured stool zzso the direct molecular analysis was zzso zzso and less costly than the testing of multiple patient stool zzso
