The origin and evolution of the classical zzso fever zzso zzso that occurred in Cuba from 1993 to 1997 has been investigated by the analysis of zzso gene sequences from 15 representative viral zzso as well as the vaccine and the challenge strains used in this zzso In the zzso tree derived from these zzso the Cuban zzso were located in a defined cluster within the previously reported zzso zzso zzso This cluster was zzso although zzso from the live vaccine used in Cuba since zzso Two further groups were zzso One of them included the early viruses isolated in the western part of Cuba until 1996 and the strain zzso used for vaccine potency tests since zzso These results are consistent with the strain Margarita being the origin of the western zzso The viruses isolated from 1996 in eastern Cuba defined a zzso but independent zzso The level of sequence variation observed in this group does not exclude an independent origin for the eastern zzso
