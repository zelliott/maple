A novel gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso fatty acids specific zzso zzso was isolated and characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso zzso in zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein of 261 zzso acids that shared zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso and possessed a 44 zzso zzso region zzso and a zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso by its zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The zzso of LA to zzso and zzso to zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this zzso with zzso zzso required for the synthesis of zzso fatty acids resulted in the zzso of zzso acid zzso from LA and zzso acid zzso from zzso These results demonstrated that zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity and the alternative zzso zzso was zzso
