The solution zzso of synthetic zzso zzso zzso inhibitor II, a zzso zzso with 3 zzso bridges, has been studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure elements were zzso a zzso zzso Met zzso 9 and zzso zzso 27, a zzso zzso with zzso zzso and two tight turns zzso zzso 15 and zzso zzso zzso A set of zzso distance restraints deduced from two-dimensional nuclear zzso enhancement zzso and 13 zzso backbone zzso angles restraints were used as the basis of three-dimensional structure zzso including zzso bridges arrangement by using distance geometry zzso zzso for the 15 possible zzso linkage combinations lead to the proposal of the array zzso zzso zzso as the most probable structure for zzso zzso
