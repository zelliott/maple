The divergence of zzso zzso and close relatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been studied using comparative DNA sequence data from multiple nuclear zzso New data from the zzso and zzso regions, in conjunction with existing data from zzso and the Period zzso are examined in the light of various models of zzso The principal finding is that the three zzso present very different zzso with zzso indicating large amounts of recent gene flow among the zzso while little or no gene flow is apparent in the data from the other zzso The data were compared with predictions from several isolation models of zzso These models include no gene flow, and they were found to be incompatible with the zzso Instead the DNA data, taken together with other evidence, seem consistent with divergence models in which natural selection acts against gene flow at some zzso more than at zzso This family of models includes some zzso and zzso zzso models, as well as models of secondary contact and subsequent reinforcement of sexual zzso
