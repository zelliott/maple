The zzso family of zzso proteins are implicated in zzso zzso These include zzso zzso I, II, III, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso is involved in the formation of zzso zzso at the plasma zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso appear to be involved in transport from the late zzso compartment to zzso and in an zzso process, zzso In this study, we identified a novel human zzso named zzso protein zzso It resembled more closely zzso and zzso than zzso not only in the primary structure but also in the domain zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso suggesting that this protein plays a fundamental role in cellular zzso zzso analysis of cells expressing zzso zzso revealed that it showed a diffused zzso zzso pattern that was not superimposed on that of the marker protein for the zzso apparatus, zzso network, zzso zzso or zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is not involved in the formation of known coated zzso
