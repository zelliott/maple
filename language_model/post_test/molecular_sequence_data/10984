The zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that belong to the highly zzso zzso family of putative zzso zzso We previously identified two additional members of this family, zzso and zzso To investigate its biological function, we cloned the zzso gene and generated zzso carrying zzso identical to those found in highly zzso regions of other members of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso carrying a zzso identical to that in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso when integrated into the zzso of a zzso strain by gene zzso Northern analysis of zzso obtained from the zzso strain shifted to a zzso temperature revealed zzso of zzso zzso and excised zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso complexes showed that zzso zzso accumulated in zzso The results presented indicate that zzso encodes a zzso processing factor zzso involved in zzso of zzso after the release of mature zzso We have therefore renamed this gene zzso
