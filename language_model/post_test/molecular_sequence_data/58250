Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was originally identified as a zzso zzso factor zzso that binds to promoter sequences of milk protein genes and activates their zzso We have generated zzso zzso against zzso or zzso and show that both zzso are present in similar amounts at the protein level in zzso zzso of zzso pregnant, zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is very low in immature zzso rises sharply during late pregnancy, and declines rapidly during zzso Upon zzso zzso and zzso form zzso and zzso The induction of zzso zzso during late pregnancy zzso with the zzso zzso of milk protein zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso analysis, we demonstrated that the zzso activity detected during zzso is composed of both zzso and zzso but not of other zzso The hypothesis that zzso is directly involved in zzso cell differentiation was tested in zzso cycle and in transgenic mice with impaired zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells and milk protein gene expression during zzso in virgin female mice coincide with transient zzso zzso zzso zzso development and very low levels of milk protein gene expression in mice carrying the truncated form of the cell fate protein zzso correlated with reduced zzso and zzso zzso
