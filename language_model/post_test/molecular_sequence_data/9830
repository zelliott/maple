zzso a new member of the TRAIL zzso family, has been cloned and zzso zzso encodes a 299 zzso acid protein with 58 and zzso overall identity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression and quantitative binding studies show zzso to be a plasma zzso protein capable of high affinity interaction with the TRAIL zzso The zzso gene maps to human zzso zzso clustered with the genes zzso two other TRAIL zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso this zzso shows restricted zzso with transcripts zzso only in peripheral blood zzso and zzso The structure of zzso is unique when compared to the other TRAIL receptors in that it lacks a zzso domain and appears to be zzso Moreover, unlike zzso and zzso in a transient zzso system zzso does not induce zzso
