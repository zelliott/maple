zzso zzso wax zzso a traditional fermented food in zzso samples were collected at five time intervals from a fixed zzso zzso zzso cultures of zzso acid bacteria zzso were isolated from zzso samples, and the zzso were divided into classes by zzso and then groups by restriction zzso length zzso analysis and sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics identified two bacterial groups (A and zzso and showed that the majority of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso was the major zzso found during the initial zzso of zzso However, it was mostly replaced by zzso zzso after 5 days of zzso All isolated zzso were able to grow in MRS broth containing zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activities of the zzso were determined, and five of the zzso showed zzso activities against the indicator strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the main zzso present during the zzso of zzso This is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of zzso that exist in the zzso zzso zzso
