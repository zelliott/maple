zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation was shown to increase short circuit current zzso in immortalized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the bee zzso toxin zzso enhanced this zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso current increased immediately after zzso stimulation and was zzso zzso The zzso relationship was slightly inwardly zzso with a reversal potential of zzso zzso 2 zzso and the zzso ratio was 14, indicating high selectivity for zzso zzso relationships for zzso and zzso had zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, consistent with data previously reported for zzso channels in excitable cells and zzso Treatment of zzso with 50 zzso zzso completely blocked the effects of zzso on zzso channel zzso indicating that the zzso current was also zzso zzso Moreover, channel zzso was blocked by zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso regulation of channel zzso zzso experiments demonstrated expression of zzso for the zzso and zzso channels, but not zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with 20 zzso zzso produced a zzso increase in zzso zzso a zzso decrease in zzso zzso but no change in zzso zzso zzso This result correlated with a zzso increase in zzso zzso channel activity in the zzso zzso We speculate that SK channels provide a mechanism for rapidly sensing changes in zzso zzso near the zzso zzso evoking immediate zzso necessary for increasing the driving force for zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso
