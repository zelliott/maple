The full-length zzso clone of a novel zzso protein zzso was isolated from rat brain using zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso cells among various brain zzso zzso zzso was already detected in the zzso brain and then gradually increased to reach a peak within zzso weeks after zzso zzso expression in the brain decreased zzso to approximately zzso of the zzso level at 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids and was predicted to have two zzso regions and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because the sequence of zzso offered few clues to the possible function, we performed a zzso zzso pull-down zzso in zzso zzso and identified zzso one of the heat shock zzso as a zzso Observation of zzso cells expressing green fluorescent zzso or zzso zzso showed that zzso was localized in the zzso zzso domain where zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso To investigate a biological role for zzso we established zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect cell growth or zzso features but attenuated the zzso decrease in cell viability caused by serum deprivation compared with control zzso After 48 h of serum zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were resistant to the cell death induced by serum zzso These results suggest that zzso would have a relevant functional role in embryonic and zzso development of the zzso
