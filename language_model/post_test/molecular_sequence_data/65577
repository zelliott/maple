Human zzso zzso is a cell membrane protein that is zzso in several different types of human zzso In the present study we investigated the mechanisms that regulate the expression of zzso gene in cancer zzso We cloned a zzso zzso zzso region of the human zzso gene into a zzso reporter zzso and zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells and zzso colon cancer cells to test for promoter zzso zzso of zzso promoter in both cell lines was modulated by two zzso family members, zzso and zzso In particular, zzso significantly zzso zzso promoter activity, whereas a dramatic reduction in zzso promoter activity was observed with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Changes in the zzso promoter activity following zzso and zzso treatments correlated with changes in zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso and zzso zzso We also identified three zzso binding elements zzso within the zzso promoter and point zzso of zzso zzso significantly reduced response of the zzso promoter to both zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated binding of zzso to a zzso promoter DNA sequence containing zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso inhibited migration of zzso cells and zzso mouse zzso zzso cells by zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, these results suggest a differential zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso and colon cancer cells by two different members of the zzso zzso
