The mouse zzso zzso a model for absence zzso is characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso in zzso the gene zzso the alpha 2 zzso zzso calcium channel accessory zzso has been found to zzso the zzso zzso The alpha 2 zzso zzso is strongly expressed in zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso mice have abnormalities in their zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso in alpha 2 zzso results in the introduction of a premature stop zzso and predicts the expression of a truncated protein zzso by the first three zzso of zzso followed by 8 novel zzso zzso We show that both zzso and protein corresponding to this predicted transcript are expressed in zzso zzso and present in zzso zzso Whereas the alpha 2 zzso zzso increased the peak current density of the zzso channel combination when zzso in zzso zzso with the truncated zzso alpha 2 zzso protein reduced current density, indicating that it may contribute to the du zzso
