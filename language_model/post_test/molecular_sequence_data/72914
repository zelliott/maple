An zzso capture strategy involving use of zzso chain reaction was used to identify and map the mouse zzso of a human zzso zzso gene zzso zzso complementary to zzso zzso within zzso 4 and 5 of the human zzso zzso gene were used to amplify the corresponding segment from mouse zzso zzso zzso of the resulting mouse DNA zzso of approximately 1 zzso revealed that the zzso sequences at the ends of the amplified zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 4 and 5 of the human zzso zzso zzso An zzso restriction site zzso within zzso 4 was used to map the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso to mouse zzso 9 in a region that shares linkage conservation with human zzso zzso to which the zzso was recently zzso
