zzso zzso from zzso coli binds to the non-native states of many unrelated zzso and zzso structural features have been zzso As model zzso proteins of zzso we used seven artificial proteins zzso approximately 141 zzso each of which has a unique but randomly chosen zzso acid sequence and no propensity to fold into a certain zzso Two of them were zzso and the rest were soluble in 3 m zzso The soluble ones zzso with zzso in a manner similar to that of a natural zzso they zzso the zzso cycle of zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso folding of other zzso All seven artificial proteins were able to bind to zzso The results suggest that the secondary structure as well as the specific sequence motif of the zzso proteins are not necessary to be recognized by zzso
