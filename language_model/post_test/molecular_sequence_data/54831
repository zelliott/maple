zzso recognizing the complement of the middle of zzso zzso occur in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and zzso of animals with a zzso complementary to the middle of zzso zzso zzso not only zzso zzso zzso but also zzso zzso derived through an zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized by patient zzso however, are not restricted to the middle of zzso This prompted us to test for zzso that react with proteins complementary to the terminal regions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso of patients but zzso zzso in only zzso Ranked zzso and zzso zzso correlated in the zzso whereas there was no significant relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples from 3 patients' revealed that zzso and zzso zzso followed a similar pattern over zzso zzso samples from a fourth patient demonstrated an zzso response without concurrent zzso or zzso zzso zzso determination by mass zzso identified a zzso acid sequence on zzso that contained a common binding site recognized by zzso from three zzso This zzso sequence contains a zzso motif which was reported to be the basis for zzso of zzso zzso with zzso Why these zzso are detected in only zzso of the patients remains zzso The data reveal that it is not due to lack of inclusion of zzso regions of complementary zzso during zzso Instead, quite unexpectedly, the data demonstrate that patients' zzso react with a restricted zzso that exists in both zzso and zzso
