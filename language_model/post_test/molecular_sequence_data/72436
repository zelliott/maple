The zzso and zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors derived from snake zzso They are structurally very similar but differ in their specificity for zzso zzso and in their native zzso zzso While the zzso are zzso the zzso occur as zzso The crystal structure shows that there is a correlation in the distance between essential zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the distance between the zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso This has lead to an investigation of the critical interactions at the zzso interface of zzso zzso of zzso that the crystal structure indicates participate in zzso interaction were found to fall into two general groups: those that do not affect the zzso state or activity of zzso as single zzso and those that interfere with it to such an extent that the protein is no longer able to fold zzso In general, those zzso that fall into the latter group are found to be zzso in zzso and not found in zzso The results suggest that the extent of both the main zzso chain zzso hydrogen bond interaction and van der zzso interactions between zzso 49 and zzso 20 are required for zzso zzso These studies provide a basis for understanding why the zzso readily zzso in solution and the zzso do not and also suggest that there is a possible zzso between zzso formation and protein folding in zzso
