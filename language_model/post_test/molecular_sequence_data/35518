Analysis of gene expression patterns leads to functional understanding of biological zzso zzso real-time zzso has become the most commonly used technique for in-depth studies of gene zzso To zzso variation in specific gene zzso accurate and reliable zzso across different samples and zzso is zzso This can be achieved by selecting one or more suitable reference genes to compare the target zzso transcript zzso In the present work, we illustrate the first evaluation of potential internal control or reference genes across different zzso stages of eggplant for reliable zzso of transcripts by real-time zzso 

We have evaluated the stability in expression of six candidate reference genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a set of zzso representing six zzso stages of zzso The candidate genes were cloned from zzso and zzso by real-time zzso The expression data analyzed by three statistical methods zzso zzso and zzso identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the most stable and suitable reference genes in zzso This was further confirmed in four different zzso two representative lines of transgenic eggplant as well as in zzso infected zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been found to be appropriate for the zzso of real-time zzso data for gene expression studies in zzso
