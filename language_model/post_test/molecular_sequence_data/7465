Natural killer zzso cells zzso express several genes of the zzso zzso zzso which have been implicated in the regulation of zzso cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso is a type II membrane protein zzso by a unique gene of the zzso zzso zzso While zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes is limited to the structural motifs zzso in the zzso recognition domain, all of these genes are on human zzso 12, the zzso of mouse zzso 6, where genes of the zzso complex zzso and zzso are zzso An unexpected feature of zzso is the essential absence of a zzso domain, zzso that association with other receptors may be necessary for the function of this zzso
