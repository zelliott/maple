zzso zzso strains express a polar zzso in all culture conditions, and certain strains produce lateral zzso on zzso media or on zzso Although zzso lateral zzso have been described as a colonization factor, little is known about their organization and zzso Here we characterized the complete lateral zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso containing 38 zzso 9 of which zzso have been reported zzso Among the zzso and zzso structural genes we found a modification accessory factor gene zzso that is involved in formation of lateral zzso this is the first time that such a gene has been described for lateral zzso gene zzso All zzso lateral zzso genes were located in a unique zzso region, in contrast to zzso zzso in which the analogous genes are distributed in two different zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a loss of lateral zzso and reductions in adherence and zzso formation, but they did not affect polar zzso zzso Furthermore, we also cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso factor zzso zzso zzso of this factor suggested that it is involved in expression of both types of zzso
