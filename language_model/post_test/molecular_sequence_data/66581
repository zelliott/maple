The replication of many viruses is absolutely dependent on zzso zzso zzso cells also use this biological mechanism to induce programmed cell death in response to viral zzso zzso zzso for both viral and cellular zzso are therefore of vital zzso We have recently shown that the general zzso inhibitor zzso zzso not only zzso but also the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a zzso of zzso that zzso zzso zzso but that has no effect on zzso zzso This gain in specificity was achieved by replacing the zzso acid of zzso with zzso to generate zzso zzso was chosen because an zzso with zzso at the zzso position was a much better zzso than an zzso with an zzso zzso which is found at the zzso position of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the replication of zzso type 2 zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso however, zzso did not inhibit zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited in zzso the zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso by zzso zzso at zzso zzso However, much higher zzso of zzso were required to inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso zzso was much more susceptible to zzso by zzso than that of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso and zzso replication by targeting different reactions of the same zzso
