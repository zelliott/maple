Previously we reported a broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of modest potency that was derived from a human zzso zzso library by panning against the zzso zzso construct zzso This construct presents the zzso repeat of the zzso zzso as a stable, zzso zzso zzso that extends in zzso phase from the zzso bundle of zzso In this paper, zzso zzso was subjected to affinity maturation against the zzso zzso by targeted diversification of the zzso loop to generate a panel of zzso with diverse zzso zzso Three zzso zzso selected for further study, zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed significant increases in both potency and breadth of zzso against zzso zzso with envelopes of primary zzso from the standard zzso B and C zzso reference zzso The parental zzso zzso is zzso less potent in zzso than zzso format over the entire B and C panels of zzso zzso Of note is that the improved zzso activity of the zzso zzso relative to the parental zzso zzso was, on average, significantly greater for the zzso in zzso than zzso zzso This suggests that the increased zzso of the zzso for the target zzso in zzso format can be partially offset by kinetic and/or zzso advantages afforded by the smaller zzso zzso Indeed, the best zzso zzso zzso in zzso format ( approximately 50 zzso was comparable in zzso zzso potency to the parental zzso zzso in zzso format ( approximately 120 zzso across the zzso B and C reference zzso
