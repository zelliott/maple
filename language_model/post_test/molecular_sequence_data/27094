zzso purple acid zzso have been shown to be potentially involved in the regulation of plant cell zzso The aim of this work was to further investigate the function of one of these zzso in tobacco zzso zzso zzso using transgenic cells zzso the zzso The transgenic cells exhibited a higher level of zzso activity in their zzso The corresponding zzso zzso a cell wall exhibited a higher rate of zzso synthesis and cellulose deposition was increased in the walls of the transgenic zzso A higher level of plasma membrane zzso zzso activities was also measured in zzso extracts of membrane zzso from the transgenic line, while no zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis were performed on the products zzso in zzso by the plasma membrane zzso from the zzso and transgenic lines extracted with zzso and incubated with radioactive zzso The data showed that the zzso consisted of zzso and cellulose and that the amount of each zzso zzso by the zzso preparation from the transgenic cells was significantly higher than in the case of the zzso zzso The demonstration that zzso and cellulose zzso are activated in cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggests a regulation of these zzso zzso by a zzso process, as well as a role of zzso zzso in the regulation of cell wall zzso
