A novel zzso designated zzso Z zzso was identified based on its zzso to known zzso Northern zzso analysis shows bands of zzso and/or zzso zzso in all zzso zzso The major form of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso encodes a protein with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso In addition, three zzso were found that presumably arise due to alternative zzso zzso The zzso acid protein contains an zzso signal zzso zzso a zzso region that shows zzso zzso acid identity with a zzso domain found in zzso proteins and in type zzso zzso and then a zzso zzso domain with zzso zzso acid identity to zzso E and zzso The zzso acid form of zzso expressed in the zzso system zzso zzso zzso although the level of zzso activity was approximately zzso lower than either zzso E or D expressed using the same viral zzso The zzso activity is more active at neutral pH than at pH zzso and is inhibited by active zzso zzso of zzso In zzso zzso is a novel zzso that is active toward zzso with zzso basic zzso zzso
