The zzso step of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To understand the dynamics of zzso in plant development, we zzso analyzed the expression of zzso genes of zzso zzso of their zzso levels and the expression patterns of the zzso zzso gene fused to the regulatory sequence of each zzso gene revealed a specific expression pattern of each zzso The zzso expression patterns were as zzso zzso zzso precursor cell files in the root tip, leaf zzso zzso and immature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso immature seeds with highest expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso root zzso upper part of young zzso and fruit zzso zzso zzso zzso of the root zzso zone, zzso on young leaves, and some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso within 4 zzso zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso within 4 h in zzso zzso was zzso within 1 h after an application of nitrate to zzso zzso zzso The zzso by nitrate did not require de zzso protein zzso We also examined the expression of two genes for zzso zzso zzso and zzso which can also be involved in zzso zzso They were expressed zzso with highest expression in zzso zzso These findings are discussed in relation to the role of zzso in plant zzso
