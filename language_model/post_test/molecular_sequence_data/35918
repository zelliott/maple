We have zzso a zzso protein zzso from the zzso slime mold zzso zzso As shown previously zzso zzso Epstein, zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso in zzso this protein binds specifically to the double stranded zzso repeats that are found at the zzso of zzso zzso DNA from this zzso and also at zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso nuclear extracts by heat treatment at 90 degrees C followed by zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso The most zzso fraction contained two major protein bands of 10 and 7 zzso when analyzed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso In gel zzso zzso zzso migrated with a zzso radius of zzso zzso Along with the previously determined zzso zzso of zzso zzso this value implies a molecular weight of about zzso making zzso the smallest known zzso zzso
