A number of molecular studies of the zzso a zzso order of the red algae, have used the conservative zzso gene to investigate relationships within the zzso However zzso variation at this locus is low for closely related species, limiting resolution of recently zzso zzso In this study, we obtained zzso sequence data from specimens of the order from New Zealand that had been identified according to current zzso zzso We compared zzso analyses based on zzso with those based on zzso for the same zzso and also zzso zzso sequences of the New Zealand material with zzso sequences of zzso zzso from other parts of the zzso Our study shows that zzso has considerable potential as a marker for this group, being easily amplified and considerably more variable than zzso Combined analyses using both markers provide significant support for relationships at both zzso and terminal zzso of the zzso Our analysis supports the zzso of all three families currently defined in zzso the zzso zzso and zzso and indicates cryptic zzso in zzso and zzso
