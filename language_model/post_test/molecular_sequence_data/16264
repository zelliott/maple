zzso acid zzso zzso zzso forms an inhibited complex with the zzso and zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex yielded two radioactive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which core and secondary structure analysis revealed to be exposed, but which also comprised the zzso zzso This suggests that at least parts of the peptides containing these zzso are in the active zzso and that they are zzso close to the zzso zzso
