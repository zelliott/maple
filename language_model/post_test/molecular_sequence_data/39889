The zzso are a group of structurally complex zzso zzso about which we know very zzso They are found in association with complex microbial communities in the guts of zzso There are five recognized families of zzso molecular data have been acquired for four of zzso Here, we describe the first molecular data from the last remaining group, represented by zzso an zzso that is found exclusively in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from total gut DNA to describe zzso zzso zzso zzso We also zzso zzso zzso from manually isolated cells of the two most abundant and readily identifiable zzso the type species zzso zzso and the zzso contentious zzso zzso We zzso zzso trees including all five known zzso zzso in order to zzso the internal zzso of this poorly studied group, to resolve some outstanding issues of the zzso and identification of certain zzso species, and to investigate the evolution of character states within zzso Our analysis recovered strong support for the existence of the five zzso of zzso and consistently united the zzso containing zzso and zzso but was unable to resolve any further zzso branching zzso
