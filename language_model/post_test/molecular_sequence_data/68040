Here we describe a human zzso zzso virus type I zzso zzso patient from South India with a zzso progressive zzso zzso from which zzso has been isolated from peripheral blood zzso zzso pol and tax viral sequences were detected in DNA from fresh peripheral blood zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and liquid zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso products demonstrated a low copy number of zzso at the level of one viral copy per 10,000 fresh zzso A long-term zzso zzso line was established from zzso of this patient using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA from these cultured lines was amplified and portions of the zzso long terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso and tax regions were zzso (a total of zzso zzso The sequence data showed that the zzso associated with this patient was zzso zzso to zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis also confirmed the presence of full-length zzso These results indicate that zzso can be demonstrated in an zzso zzso patient from South India with a chronic progressive neurological zzso
