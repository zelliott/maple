zzso untranslated and partial core zzso region sequence of zzso C virus zzso in 21 zzso and 15 Indonesian zzso were amplified by zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso with the use of zzso primer sequences deduced from zzso zzso identified in other geographical zzso The zzso zzso are predominantly that of zzso type 1 and less of type 2 and 3 with the latter zzso currently not detected in zzso The zzso untranslated sequences are related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso States of America), zzso zzso (South zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When compared with the zzso zzso insertions are found within the zzso untranslated region of zzso zzso and not in the zzso There are zzso and Indonesian zzso that have sequences within the zzso untranslated region that differ slightly from each zzso zzso is observed in the core region of two zzso and one Indonesian zzso Finally, not all zzso zzso can be amplified with the zzso core sequence zzso when compared with the ease with which these zzso can be amplified with zzso untranslated region zzso zzso
