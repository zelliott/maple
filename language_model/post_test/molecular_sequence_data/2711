The zzso gene of zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso and zzso during zzso and for repair of DNA damage during zzso zzso The precise role of the zzso gene product in these processes is not zzso Most zzso zzso zzso can be explained by the proposal that the zzso gene product is involved in the search for zzso between interacting DNA molecules or zzso but there is no direct evidence for this zzso We present here the zzso sequence of the zzso locus and an analysis of the predicted zzso zzso zzso The zzso terminal region of the predicted protein contains zzso suggestive of a zzso zzso binding domain, most likely for zzso The remaining zzso zzso acids consist of two 250 zzso acid segments of zzso repeat sequence separated by 320 zzso zzso plus a short zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats occur in proteins such as zzso and intermediate filaments that form zzso coiled zzso One of the two zzso regions in zzso shows similarity to the zzso domain of rabbit zzso beyond that expected for two random coiled zzso zzso
