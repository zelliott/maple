zzso is an zzso zzso of human liver zzso with zzso sequence identity to zzso Unlike zzso it is a very poor testosterone zzso and zzso but a relatively better catalyst of zzso zzso largely at zzso zzso and 21 positions with negligible zzso zzso We reasoned that such differences in zzso zzso must be due to differences in the active site architecture of each zzso zzso Indeed, alignment of zzso zzso recognition sites zzso with the corresponding regions of zzso sequence revealed that of the 22 fully divergent zzso 4 reside in zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso we zzso these and other divergent zzso zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso of zzso and/or zzso Our findings of the influence of these zzso zzso of the zzso active site on its zzso of testosterone and three other established but structurally different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso These findings revealed that some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso not only improved the ability of zzso to zzso testosterone at the zzso and zzso positions, but also converted it into a robust zzso zzso zzso The latter in the case of zzso was accompanied by a shift from zzso to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was either relatively unchanged or negligible to zzso Together these findings attest to the unique zzso site fit of each zzso zzso
