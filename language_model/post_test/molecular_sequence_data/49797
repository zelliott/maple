zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso hormones with important functions in zzso zzso The receptors for zzso and zzso are zzso family B zzso coupled zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso domain is a major zzso of zzso selectivity of the zzso zzso However, the divergent zzso in zzso and zzso that determine specificity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain are not zzso Less is known about how the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso peptides for their ability to bind and activate the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was unable to bind and activate the zzso zzso Substituting the zzso zzso core domain with the zzso zzso core domain zzso zzso completely rescued the affinity and potency of zzso without compromising the affinity and potency of zzso Substituting zzso segment 1 zzso zzso zzso the third zzso loop and the zzso zzso of zzso A with the corresponding zzso zzso segments zzso the ability to distinguish zzso from zzso zzso results were obtained with the opposite zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determine specificity for the divergent zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso core domain is not a critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso core domain contains two or more zzso which strongly determine specificity for divergent zzso in the zzso zzso
