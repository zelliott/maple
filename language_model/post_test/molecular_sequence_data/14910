zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso pattern recognition zzso zzso and is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It senses a wide range of bacteria and viruses or their products, and plays a key role in inducing innate zzso In this report, zzso gene was cloned and characterized in zzso zzso zzso a fish species of highest commercial importance in the Indian zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso comprised of zzso zzso with a single open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 937 zzso acids zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso it comprised of one zzso recruitment domain zzso at zzso seven zzso rich repeat zzso regions at zzso and one zzso domain in between N and zzso zzso zzso was closely related to grass carp zzso zzso and exhibited significant similarity zzso and identity zzso in their zzso zzso zzso expression analysis of zzso and its associated zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso by quantitative real-time zzso zzso revealed their zzso expression in all embryonic zzso zzso zzso expression analysis of zzso showed its wide range of expression in all examined zzso highest was in zzso and the lowest was in zzso zzso expression of zzso was observed following zzso and zzso zzso exposure, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in various zzso was significantly enhanced by zzso exposure and bacterial infections, and was correlated with the zzso expression of zzso Together, these findings highlighted the important role of zzso in fish in response to zzso zzso
