We investigated the expression of zzso transcripts in zzso cells derived from zzso of zzso and normal zzso A reverse zzso zzso was used that allowed the simultaneous analysis of a range of zzso zzso zzso cells were found to contain the transcripts for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the first time we detected in bone cells the two other zzso zzso of zzso beta 2, and beta zzso Furthermore, we have also identified zzso for zzso and the novel zzso factor, zzso Using this sensitive technique it was not possible to detect zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The human zzso cell line zzso also showed a similar pattern of expression of these zzso to primary zzso cells, with the exception that zzso was also zzso zzso isolated from zzso bone showed essentially the same profile of zzso expression as normal bone except that zzso was also detected in two of four zzso The zzso profile of successive populations of cells harvested from one zzso culture at 9, 22, and 57 days showed a consistent pattern of zzso zzso demonstrating the zzso stability of the zzso cells in long-term zzso
