zzso are the first class of organisms in animal evolution with a nervous zzso The zzso zzso has two types of zzso cell, nerve cells and zzso Both differentiate from the same pool of zzso stem zzso Yet, the molecular regulation of neural differentiation in zzso is largely zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso factor gene zzso which acts as an early neural zzso gene in zzso We show, that zzso is expressed in the early zzso differentiation pathway, starting at the level of zzso stem zzso zzso of zzso is restricted to the zzso stages of zzso zzso acts before and possibly directly upstream of zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor gene zzso and of zzso an early zzso differentiation marker zzso zzso may determine stem cells to differentiate into zzso Our data are consistent with a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso by keeping committed zzso cells in the cell zzso A similar role has been demonstrated for zzso genes in zzso Our results suggest, that genetic zzso of neural development may be zzso from zzso to zzso indicating that the molecular regulation of neural development evolved only zzso
