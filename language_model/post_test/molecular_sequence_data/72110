zzso tissue zzso of zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso and are thus involved in a wide variety of zzso and zzso zzso By identifying zzso of a transcript detected within an zzso of the zzso zzso gene we have cloned the zzso zzso gene zzso which represents the first zzso member of the zzso gene zzso zzso analysis revealed an open reading frame of 210 zzso acids with zzso identity to human zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of sequence data from the zzso Centre demonstrated that the human zzso gene is zzso within zzso V of the human zzso zzso indicating that the zzso organization of zzso and zzso genes may be a general feature zzso in zzso We therefore speculate that the human zzso gene will be located in zzso V of the human zzso gene on zzso zzso and we present preliminary evidence that a human zzso gene is located near the zzso gene on zzso zzso
