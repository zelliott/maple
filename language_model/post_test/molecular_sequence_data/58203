To examine the zzso requirements for zzso zzso a zzso clone of flock house virus zzso zzso 2 was zzso into baby zzso kidney cells and transcribed to yield zzso that had terminal extensions of different lengths or that lacked internal regions of the zzso These zzso were tested for their ability to be zzso by zzso zzso that was provided by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso replication was inhibited by terminal zzso particularly those at the zzso end of the zzso despite the fact that these extensions were corrected during zzso zzso A zzso transcript with a zzso 3' extension was zzso to produce a zzso zzso that had the correct zzso end, showing that the zzso could select its correct initiation site from within a longer zzso A zzso zzso at the second position of the positive strand was an important zzso of template zzso zzso molecules with large internal deletions that amounted to almost 50% of the 1,400 zzso of zzso 2 zzso as efficiently as full-length zzso but only if they contained an internal region that lay between zzso 538 and zzso zzso spontaneous deletions of zzso 2 that arose during sequential zzso passages all zzso the same internal region of the zzso These results establish that both terminal and internal regions of zzso zzso 2 play essential roles in making the zzso a competent template for zzso
