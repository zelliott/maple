Two highly similar, zzso G beta zzso zzso were zzso from pig zzso zzso Both were zzso were composed of a 101 zzso protein and either a 120 zzso or a 117 zzso zzso zzso and were activated greater than zzso by G beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to clone zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is highly related to zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso is not substantially related to anything in current zzso The proteins were expressed in and zzso from insect and zzso zzso They bound tightly to one another, both in zzso and in zzso and in so doing, zzso amplified the effect of G beta zzso on the zzso activity of zzso from less than zzso to greater than zzso
