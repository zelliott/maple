A cloned egg drop syndrome zzso virus zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso gene has been identified and the complete zzso sequence of the zzso and partial zzso sequence of the zzso genes has been zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene has revealed zzso virus to be genetically more closely related to bovine zzso type 7 zzso and zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso than either of these two viruses are to other members of the zzso zzso or zzso virus is to an other member of the zzso zzso The three viruses share further similarities in that they have a high percentage AT content in their zzso and are characterized by having more compact zzso than other zzso The zzso gene from all three viruses contained the active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso bond to zzso zzso However, zzso found in all other members of the zzso zzso and thought to be involved in trafficking, was missing from the zzso of the zzso virus, zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso virus should be classified along with zzso and zzso in a separate zzso
