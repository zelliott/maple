We describe the use of the zzso chain reaction zzso technique to alter zzso and zzso signals surrounding a gene so as to achieve zzso in zzso zzso By changing the zzso site sequence preceding the zzso gene to match the consensus zzso coli signal and by adding a zzso zzso sequence immediately following the zzso the yield of zzso was increased about tenfold over that obtained from the natural zzso zzso zzso The addition of the positive zzso zzso sequence derived from the crystal zzso gene of zzso zzso downstream from the zzso gene further increased yields by twofold to a level of zzso of the total cellular zzso
