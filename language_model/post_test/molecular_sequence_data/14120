Three zzso zzso proteins shown to influence zzso accuracy in zzso zzso are zzso in structure and function with their zzso zzso One of these, zzso by zzso and zzso zzso is comparable to bacterial zzso The others, zzso by zzso zzso or, zzso and zzso zzso are zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso coli, certain zzso in zzso cause zzso translation or zzso resistance that can be zzso by other changes in zzso or zzso that reduce zzso zzso Using zzso and random zzso we show that different changes in zzso can have zzso influences on zzso accuracy or zzso sensitivity in zzso Certain zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso which is zzso from the zzso zzso cause varying levels of nonsense suppression or zzso zzso Other zzso found in the more zzso zzso portion, counteract zzso or zzso zzso sensitivity, mimicking zzso coli zzso Although zzso in these different parts of zzso have opposite affects on zzso accuracy or zzso sensitivity, additive zzso can be observed when opposing zzso are combined in the same zzso
