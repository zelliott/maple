zzso Collins zzso zzso is the most common of the human zzso zzso zzso Recently, a partial zzso zzso was identified and shown to contain zzso in zzso zzso Here we present the entire zzso zzso structure and the complete coding sequence of zzso zzso encodes a low complexity protein of zzso zzso zzso whose predicted protein structure reveals repeated motifs that mirror the organization of its zzso These motifs are shared with zzso trafficking proteins in other species and are predicted to be highly zzso by zzso zzso zzso with this, the full-length zzso protein sequence also contains putative nuclear and zzso zzso zzso Throughout the open reading frame, we detected an additional eight zzso in zzso families and several zzso We zzso that zzso results from defects in a zzso trafficking protein that is critically required during human zzso zzso
