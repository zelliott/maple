A zzso search for surface proteins of zzso zzso involved in zzso identified a putative zinc zzso zzso zzso shared high zzso acid sequence similarities with zzso zzso of zzso bacteria, but zzso had neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso Analysis of a family of zzso zzso the zzso proteins zzso in a zzso zzso demonstrated a global loss of surface expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was detected within the zzso The zzso zzso also failed to lyse with zzso a sign of lack of function of the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso normally located on the cell wall, was trapped in the zzso zzso with DNA and the transformation protein zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to the cell membrane during genetic competence was also not observed in the zzso zzso These results suggest a zzso dependent regulatory mechanism governing the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
