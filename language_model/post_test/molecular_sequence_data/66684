zzso zzso are stabilized by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which when suppressed in mice induce severe synaptic and behavioral zzso Here we show that mature zzso also contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares zzso and zzso zzso zzso with STOP zzso zzso in different zzso or cellular zzso zzso has zzso binding and zzso stabilizing zzso However, in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso principally stain the zzso zzso and zzso zzso material in zzso In cycling cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed at high levels but is otherwise principally visible at the zzso The zzso targeting of zzso depends on the presence of zzso zzso located within the zzso zzso domain, suggesting that zzso targeting may require zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and zzso which contain the zzso targeting sequences present in zzso also display distinct zzso zzso when expressed at low level in cycling zzso Thus zzso proteins of the STOP family have the capacity to associate with zzso material, which could be important for STOP synaptic zzso
