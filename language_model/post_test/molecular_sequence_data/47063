The structure of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso coli zzso has been determined using primarily zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso is composed of zzso repeating units with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was grown with zzso in the medium which resulted in an overall degree of labeling of approximately zzso in the sugar zzso and approximately 50% in the zzso zzso indicating some zzso dilution in the zzso The zzso of the zzso proved valuable since zzso assignments could be made on the basis of zzso zzso in zzso labeled zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso via zzso fragments was identified by zzso zzso The zzso at zzso is in zzso with fatty acid zzso Additional cultures with specifically labeled zzso or zzso zzso the direct incorporation of zzso as the building block for the zzso skeletons in the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso occurring via the zzso pool followed by zzso to give zzso building blocks labeled with zzso at the zzso zzso
