The zzso zzso zzso structural genes were isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the two zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the small and large zzso of the zzso respectively, form part of an zzso that contains at least one other zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence encodes a possible zzso zzso extension, not present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso which could be a cellular targeting zzso The zzso gene is downstream form, and zzso zzso by 4 zzso and encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene products display zzso to zzso sequences of zzso small and large zzso respectively, from other zzso The zzso gene lies 16 zzso upstream from a third open reading frame which could zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso aromatic zzso The significance of this possible third gene is not known at zzso
