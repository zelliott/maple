zzso is a major zzso resistance gene identified in cultivated African rice zzso zzso which zzso high resistance to the Rice yellow zzso virus zzso We mapped zzso in an approximately zzso zzso in which four genes have been zzso zzso of the candidate region in the resistant zzso zzso revealed a single zzso affecting a predicted zzso as compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso reference zzso This zzso was found to be a zzso deletion leading to a truncated and probably zzso zzso It affected a gene zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso known to be a defense mechanism zzso Only seven zzso zzso zzso showing this deletion were identified in a collection consisting of zzso zzso from three rice zzso All seven zzso were resistant to zzso which is an additional argument in favor of the involvement of the deletion in zzso In addition, fine mapping of a resistance quantitative trait locus in zzso zzso advanced zzso lines zzso a zzso zzso containing zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of the same gene may control both high and partial zzso
