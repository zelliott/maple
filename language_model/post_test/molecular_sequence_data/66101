A previous zzso analysis of zzso zzso genes identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene to be zzso early in zzso zzso zzso zzso Simon, zzso Le zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso was disrupted in order to determine its implication in zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso factor, since the zzso zzso was blocked during the colonization of tomato and bean leaves, giving zzso reduced in size by at least zzso Within the zzso binding domain zzso zzso shows significant structural similarities to zzso zzso binding proteins zzso zzso zzso function as zzso zzso but an analysis of the zzso content and the results of growth zzso experiments with the zzso strain indicated that zzso is zzso for zzso zzso The systematic identification of zzso proteins included in public databases showed that these proteins constitute a protein zzso present only in zzso zzso analysis showed that the ancestral zzso gene was duplicated in the common zzso of animals and zzso after the split from zzso Finally, we present evidence that the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso has further expanded exclusively in zzso especially in zzso zzso which contains three copies of the zzso zzso
