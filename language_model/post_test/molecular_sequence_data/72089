To identify molecular markers of cell differentiation in developing nervous zzso zzso zzso against chick zzso neural zzso were zzso One of them, zzso recognized a zzso regulated zzso present in several zzso of the zzso Data from zzso mass zzso and zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso protein indicated identity of the zzso with zzso The zzso material was always found as a unique zzso (Mr 71 zzso in zzso however zzso revealed the existence of several bands zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Interestingly some retinal cell types, as zzso exhibited an extremely significant decrease in the intensity of the zzso material during the final zzso of terminal differentiation while others, as some retinal zzso maintained the zzso when fully zzso Taken together these results indicate that zzso a protein susceptible of several zzso modifications as zzso and zzso at variable extent, may act differently in neural zzso cell zzso
