zzso mediates many of the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso agents upon salt and water transport in the zzso collecting zzso The present studies examined the role of zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso these zzso zzso is a zzso comprised of two regulatory zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso The four zzso zzso may be distinguished by their R zzso that have been designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso and zzso protection in both primary cultures and fresh zzso of rabbit cortical collecting ducts zzso zzso of cultured zzso grown on zzso supports were mounted in an zzso chamber, and combinations of zzso zzso that selectively activate zzso type I zzso zzso type II were tested for their effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso current zzso was significantly increased by the zzso type zzso analog pairs zzso plus zzso or zzso plus zzso In contrast the zzso type zzso zzso analog pair zzso plus zzso had no effect on zzso These results suggest zzso type II is the major zzso regulating zzso zzso transport in the rabbit collecting zzso
