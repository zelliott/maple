The zzso zzso protein is implicated in zzso regulation of at least five cellular zzso including zzso zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso of RB and truncated promoter zzso has defined a discrete element zzso control zzso zzso within the promoters of each of these genes as being necessary for zzso zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso form zzso complexes in zzso with three zzso unidentified nuclear proteins and zzso of their zzso site within the zzso zzso results in an zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Here, we demonstrate that one of the nuclear proteins that binds the zzso zzso and transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso in zzso is zzso and that zzso stimulates zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso is zzso by the transient zzso of RB zzso We conclude from these observations that RB may regulate zzso in part by virtue of its ability to functionally interact with zzso
