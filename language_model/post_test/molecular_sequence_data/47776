A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso which uses zzso zzso as the sole carbon zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso was achieved in high yield by zzso zzso and gel zzso The zzso was composed of a zzso protein with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was inactive but was activated by zzso with 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso then it zzso zzso transfer from zzso zzso or zzso to the following zzso zzso (in order of decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso in the native zzso existed as zzso which upon zzso was reduced to the zzso state and then was oxidized to zzso zzso During zzso the zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso states, being alternately zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso the zzso shows features in common with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso However, the failure of specific zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso to affect the zzso suggests significant zzso During zzso degradation by strain zzso the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso is probably zzso a hypothesis supported by the detection in cell extracts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities which provide a zzso route to zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso clusters with zzso zzso in the alpha subdivision of the zzso and is closely related to strain zzso a recently isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Costello, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of this zzso in bacterial populations in soil and zzso if zzso has important environmental zzso
