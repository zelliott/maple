Treatment of intact zzso with zzso zzso zzso causes irreversible zzso and chemical labeling of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso In rat zzso zzso also causes zzso of zzso to another protein in the membrane to give a product of 130 zzso on zzso gel zzso zzso is markedly reduced by those compounds that protect against irreversible zzso of zzso transport by zzso and enhanced by imposition of a pH zzso across the plasma membrane to recruit the zzso binding site of zzso to an zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso is via the same site on zzso as is responsible for zzso of zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso react with proteins of approximately 40 zzso zzso and 70 zzso on Western blots of zzso zzso and an additional band of 130 zzso after treatment of zzso with 100 zzso zzso The zzso protein that is zzso to zzso was zzso and shown to contain zzso zzso the apparent core molecular mass is 40 zzso zzso acid sequencing showed that the protein is the rat equivalent of the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso related to zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso zzso zzso zzso , and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implications of the specific interaction between zzso and this protein are zzso
