Novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso have been zzso and zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso was replaced by a zzso the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso was zzso by either zzso or zzso for specific radioactive labeling with zzso at either zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were tested for their ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in binding experiments and to inhibit zzso zzso zzso activity in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells, permanently zzso with zzso coding for rat zzso zzso type 1 zzso or human zzso zzso cells known to carry zzso functional human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) was found to bind with higher affinity to rat or human zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and exhibited higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A highly zzso zzso protein was identified with zzso when the zzso zzso compounds 1 or 2 were zzso linked to zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated with zzso by the finding that these zzso could be displaced from the zzso by their corresponding zzso form, but not other unrelated peptides such as zzso zzso zzso The observed molecular size of the zzso was in agreement with the size of zzso found in rat zzso zzso zzso but was significantly larger than the size of zzso found in rat zzso and zzso bulb zzso zzso
