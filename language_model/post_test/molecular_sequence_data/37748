The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso box zzso is a zzso zzso which we have previously implicated in deregulation of the zzso promoter in small cell lung cancer zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso of the zzso transcript, which is highly expressed in zzso The zzso was detected in both established cell lines and primary zzso cultures as well as in some primitive zzso tumor zzso It was present at very low levels in human brain zzso zzso tumors, and normal zzso zzso This human zzso zzso which is zzso zzso in zzso incorporates a zzso insert between zzso 5 and 6, introducing a stop zzso and predicting translation of a truncated zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso may antagonize repression of the zzso promoter and other zzso genes with zzso zzso elements in zzso Thus, zzso expression of this zzso zzso may be a key early factor in defining the neuroendocrine zzso of these zzso The zzso zzso zzso represents a specific clinical marker that could prove useful in detection of the majority of zzso
