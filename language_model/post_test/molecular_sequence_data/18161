Reduction of zzso in pea shoots caused the zzso of several zzso zzso zzso clones derived from three different zzso zzso which accumulate in wilted pea shoots were isolated, zzso and expression of the corresponding genes zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso 180 zzso acids of this protein were zzso to soybean zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was abundant in roots, and induced in shoots by dehydration, heat shock and to a small extent by zzso zzso plots indicate that the protein zzso by zzso zzso contains six potential membrane spanning zzso similar to proteins which form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid protein with high zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was more abundant in roots than shoots of control zzso zzso of pea shoots induced zzso zzso zzso levels whereas heat shock or zzso treatment did zzso zzso zzso zzso a 508 zzso acid protein with zzso zzso identity to several zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was induced by zzso of shoots but not roots and heat shock and zzso did not zzso zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso increased zzso by 4 h after zzso and this increase was not altered by zzso of shoots with zzso When wilted shoots were zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso declined to zzso levels within 2 zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso from pea shoots showed that zzso of the genes which zzso the three zzso zzso was induced within 30 zzso following reduction of shoot zzso One of the genes showed a further increase in zzso by 4 h after zzso whereas zzso of the other 2 genes zzso These results indicate that plant cells respond to changes in cell zzso by rapidly increasing zzso of several zzso Furthermore, the expression of the zzso genes varies with respect to the time course of induction and zzso of the zzso zzso
