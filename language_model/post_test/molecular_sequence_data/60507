Northern zzso analysis using zzso zzso probe revealed that two sizes of zzso zzso were expressed in human zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso To characterize these zzso we performed reverse zzso using total zzso from zzso cells, and amplified the coding region of zzso by zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso Two zzso fragments with different sizes were zzso One was identical to a known zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso a protein of 339 zzso zzso zzso with a calculated zzso of zzso The other zzso (1299 zzso contained an additional 245 zzso zzso 8 sequence in the open reading frame and zzso a protein of 348 zzso zzso zzso with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identical between zzso and the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein shared low zzso with zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein lacked PC zzso and zzso motif of zzso which is assumed to be important for the interaction with zzso In addition, Western zzso analysis revealed that the zzso protein was not detected in zzso cells and zzso Together, these observations suggest that alternatively spliced zzso zzso of zzso is zzso but its protein is hardly present in zzso zzso
