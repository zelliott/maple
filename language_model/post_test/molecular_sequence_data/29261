zzso zzso zzso expression by cancer cells may mediate zzso immune zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the timing and significance of zzso expression during the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression was studied by zzso in 170 zzso tissue sections representing the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to search for zzso zzso Analysis of survival was performed in patients with zzso 

A significant positive linear correlation was found between zzso expression and zzso progression throughout the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso A pattern of high zzso expression was detected in zzso of high grade zzso zzso of stage zzso zzso of stage III and zzso of stage IV zzso No significant differences were observed between zzso expression in the primary zzso and that in the corresponding liver zzso The specificity of zzso expression was confirmed at zzso For stage zzso zzso the 5 year survival was zzso in patients without, or with moderate, zzso zzso expression compared with zzso in those with high zzso zzso expression zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso expression may be involved in the development of zzso cancer and its zzso
