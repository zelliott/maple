zzso zzso is an organic zzso tolerant strain capable of degrading aromatic zzso Here we report the zzso zzso sequence zzso and its zzso zzso based on the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso encodes for at least 1751 zzso reactions that account for the known pattern of C, zzso P and S zzso by this zzso Based on the potential of this strain to thrive in the presence of organic zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso its zzso map can be drawn and a number of potential zzso reactions can be zzso This information may prove useful for adapting desired reactions to create value-added zzso This zzso potential may be realized via direct transformation of zzso or may require genetic engineering to block an existing pathway, or to zzso zzso and zzso as well as possibly requiring the recruitment of zzso from other sources to achieve the desired zzso
