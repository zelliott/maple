zzso zzso and zzso are two zzso zzso zzso that play critical roles in DNA zzso cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways downstream of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified for human zzso and zzso however, the sequences surrounding the zzso zzso appear zzso and consensus zzso motifs for the two zzso zzso remain zzso We have zzso zzso library analyses to develop specific, highly preferred zzso motifs for zzso and zzso The optimal motifs are similar for both zzso and most closely resemble the previously identified zzso and zzso zzso target sequences in zzso and zzso the regulation of which plays an important role in S and zzso zzso Essential zzso required for the definition of the optimal motifs were also zzso zzso of the peptides to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso and zzso revealed substantial differences between the two zzso zzso zzso modeling analyses of the peptides into the zzso zzso zzso were consistent with zzso zzso zzso defining zzso zzso The zzso zzso preferences were applied in a zzso search program, revealing novel targets that might serve as zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso
