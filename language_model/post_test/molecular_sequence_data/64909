zzso zzso high levels of zzso zzso in response to insect zzso This can adversely affect protein zzso in the insects, leading to reduced growth, delayed development and lowered zzso Colorado potato zzso overcomes this zzso mechanism by changing the composition of its zzso zzso The induced zzso zzso in the adapted gut sustain a normal rate of protein zzso either by zzso the zzso by zzso or by zzso to the zzso as a result of high zzso In this study zzso clones of zzso zzso in adapted guts were isolated by zzso zzso on the basis of zzso sequences previously determined for zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso can be classified into three groups: zzso A, B and zzso The zzso acid identity is more than zzso within and zzso between the zzso They share zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso K, zzso J and zzso zzso from different zzso zzso zzso predicts that zzso A, B and C follow the general fold of zzso zzso zzso from each group, however, differ in some specific structural characteristics in the zzso and zzso binding sites that could influence zzso interaction and thus, provide different mechanisms of resistance to zzso for the different zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that the zzso A and C, but not B, are induced twofold by potato plants with high levels of zzso zzso
