zzso zzso in zzso B zzso are associated with the zzso dominant zzso zzso and the zzso group of skeletal zzso zzso These zzso cluster in particular zzso protein zzso and act in a zzso zzso zzso In contrast the zzso disorder, zzso zzso syndrome, is zzso by the complete absence of zzso One cluster of zzso zzso zzso is found within the second of two zzso zzso zzso zzso that create a functional zzso domain zzso This zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso activity, a crucial aspect of zzso role of zzso zzso events with cellular scaffolding and zzso This study zzso the wild type zzso zzso and investigates the effects of two zzso zzso on the structure and function of the zzso zzso that could explain a zzso mechanism for the zzso zzso We have determined high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the human zzso B wild type zzso plus zzso and zzso zzso All three structures display the classic compact zzso zzso for the zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso in close zzso The conservation of zzso structure in the presence of these zzso shows that the compact zzso zzso is stable to the sequence zzso In solution the zzso zzso display reduced melting temperatures (by zzso degrees zzso as determined by differential scanning zzso zzso of the wild type and zzso zzso zzso binding activities via zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso zzso have increased zzso binding zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to the wild type zzso zzso of zzso zzso The increased zzso binding affinity of the zzso presents a zzso mechanism that zzso the zzso dominant zzso zzso disorders from those that arise through the complete loss of zzso zzso
