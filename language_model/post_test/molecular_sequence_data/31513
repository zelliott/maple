The marine zzso zzso currently comprises six species, some of which were zzso studied mainly due to their ability to produce secondary zzso The type strain of the type species, zzso zzso zzso has been deposited at several public culture collections zzso Based on differences in zzso profiles, we detected that the alleged zzso zzso type strains deposited at the Collection Institute zzso zzso Paris, zzso as zzso zzso and at the German Collection of zzso and Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso are not zzso To determine the identity of these zzso we conducted zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and internal transcribed zzso zzso sequence zzso as well as zzso zzso Based on the detailed zzso zzso gene zzso we showed that strain zzso zzso most likely zzso to the original zzso zzso type strain zzso In contrast, the zzso strain zzso zzso exhibits a much closer affiliation to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and should thus be allocated to this zzso The detection of the zzso of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso will influence future comparative studies within the zzso zzso
