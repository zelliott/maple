zzso analysis of late zzso membrane protein zzso in zzso zzso has uncovered a large number of genes (called zzso that are required for retention of zzso a model late zzso membrane zzso Here we describe one of the zzso zzso zzso that encodes a zzso protein similar to human sorting zzso a protein involved in trafficking of the zzso growth factor zzso In zzso cells containing a zzso zzso zzso the late zzso membrane proteins zzso and zzso were rapidly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was delivered to the zzso in zzso zzso in a manner independent of a block in the early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited defects in both zzso zzso and in sorting of a soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter zzso is apparently due to an inability to zzso the zzso Y sorting zzso zzso to the zzso since it is rapidly zzso in the zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso is distributed between a free zzso pool and a particulate fraction containing zzso transport zzso and possibly zzso but lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso pool of zzso zzso to an zzso zzso that accumulates in the class E zzso zzso These results support a model in which zzso is required for retrieval of membrane proteins from a zzso zzso compartment back to the late zzso zzso
