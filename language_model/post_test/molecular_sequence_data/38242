zzso is a novel gene that has high sequence zzso and similar gene structure to the tumor zzso gene zzso We zzso zzso in seven zzso zzso cell lines and a total of 63 human borderline and invasive zzso tumor zzso Loss of zzso at this locus was observed in 50% of invasive tumors but in none of the borderline zzso zzso expression of the gene was observed in the zzso tumor zzso zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso sequence zzso to the highly zzso region of zzso did not reveal any zzso When compared to the primary cultures of normal human zzso surface zzso cells and immortalized cell lines, four of the seven zzso zzso cell lines, zzso of the invasive tumors, and zzso of the borderline tumor zzso express elevated levels of zzso zzso Except for the zzso cell line, Western zzso analysis of the nuclear extracts prepared from the cell lines showed zzso levels of zzso zzso Our analysis also demonstrated the expression of a spliced zzso of zzso transcript with the omission of zzso 2 solely in the cancer cell lines and invasive tumor zzso This zzso zzso transcript would give rise to a truncated zzso protein without the zzso zzso zzso In zzso of the dominant negative zzso of the zzso truncated zzso of another zzso zzso zzso the expression of the truncated zzso zzso form in zzso tumors may play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso
