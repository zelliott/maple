The emergence and worldwide spreading of zzso zzso strains that shown to be resistant to traditional drugs is considered a very serious health problem, given the high mortality and morbidity rate of zzso In the search for new drugs against this zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso II zzso zzso have been classified as very promising targets for therapeutic zzso In this work, it is developed a cheap and zzso zzso zzso zzso for measuring zzso II activity in order to use it as a tool in the discovery of new zzso of this zzso In this zzso zzso II acts upon a zzso bound synthetic zzso zzso whose sequence comprises the zzso site zzso present in zzso zzso The zzso surface density is zzso by means of a classical zzso zzso In order to estimate the kinetic zzso of the system and to zzso both, zzso and zzso activity, it was used a model for the zzso of zzso zzso systems previously developed by our group, that fitted very well to the experimental zzso It was used zzso as a model inhibitor of zzso II and the resulting zzso relation agreed with the expected behavior for the zzso II pair under the employed experimental zzso
