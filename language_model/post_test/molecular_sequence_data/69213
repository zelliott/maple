The zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso complex of zzso coli are preceded by a gene zzso a putative zzso regulator, zzso (formerly designated zzso zzso tests and studies with zzso and zzso zzso zzso have shown that a zzso zzso zzso which increases zzso complex synthesis to the zzso level in the absence of zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso comparisons further showed that the zzso zzso affects a single site in the zzso gene leading to an zzso zzso zzso substitution in the zzso zzso The results support the view that synthesis of the zzso complex is regulated from the zzso promoter of a zzso zzso
