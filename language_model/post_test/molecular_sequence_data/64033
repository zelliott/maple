By introducing zzso zzso zzso it was shown that zzso that share sequences are zzso and that the translation step is severely zzso zzso This technique was demonstrated to be a very powerful tool for reverse zzso in zzso zzso However, studies have shown that zzso can be achieved in living zzso In this chapter, we used zzso zzso and zzso zzso as model animals to demonstrate zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso expression by zzso In order to silence the zzso we produced transgenic mouse lines that produce zzso that is driven by the zzso zzso It was demonstrated that the zzso zzso double stranded zzso could silence the zzso throughout the body of the mouse or rat and throughout the zzso
