The three-dimensional crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso has been solved by multiple zzso replacement and refined at zzso A zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso of 222 symmetry consists of a single zzso chain of about 500 zzso acid zzso and one zzso zzso The zzso belong to space group zzso with unit cell parameters a zzso b zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso A, and there is one zzso of the zzso per zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence has been tentatively determined by computer graphics model building and comparison with the known three-dimensional structure of beef liver zzso and sequences of several other zzso The atomic model has been refined by Hendrickson and zzso zzso zzso against zzso reflections between 8 A and zzso zzso The final model consists of zzso zzso atoms of the protein and zzso group, zzso water molecules and one zzso zzso The secondary and zzso structures of the bacterial zzso have been analyzed and a comparison with the structure of beef liver zzso has been zzso
