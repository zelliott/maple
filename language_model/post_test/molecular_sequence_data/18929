The zzso zzso factor zzso proteins are structurally similar scaffold proteins that mediate between members of the zzso zzso zzso family and downstream zzso molecules such as zzso in the immune zzso zzso Seven zzso have been identified, including zzso which is a unique member that zzso in many zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso commonly contain the zzso domain, which mediates interaction with target receptors and zzso As a first step towards zzso the molecular mechanisms of the zzso zzso pathway, the first crystal structure of the human zzso zzso domain with a zzso domain is reported at zzso zzso
