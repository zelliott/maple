This report describes the use of promoter trap lines from the model plant zzso zzso to clone regulatory sequences that mediate zzso reporter gene zzso zzso guard cells represent a highly differentiated cell type within the zzso of green zzso of higher zzso They control the zzso zzso in response to different zzso and environmental signals in order to zzso carbon fixation while minimizing water zzso We screened available promoter trap lines for zzso zzso of a zzso zzso reporter gene in order to obtain marker lines for zzso development and to gain access to regulatory pathways leading to gene expression which is restricted to this cell zzso From two lines identified we successfully cloned upstream regulatory zzso For one line, zzso promoter activity was confirmed by zzso the zzso zzso fused to the newly identified regulatory zzso into the zzso nuclear zzso However, DNA sequences downstream of the zzso zzso sites in the original promoter trap lines revealed no obvious coding regions in the corresponding orientation, indicating that we have probably identified zzso zzso being active in guard zzso
