zzso encodes two zzso surface zzso in humans, zzso C and zzso D zzso and zzso via initiation of translation at two start zzso on a single zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso uses zzso as a means of invasion into the human red blood zzso Here, we examine the molecular evolution of zzso among the zzso zzso and Lesser zzso and also the pattern of zzso at the locus in a global human zzso We find an excess of zzso divergence among species that appears to be caused solely by accelerated evolution of zzso in the human zzso Moreover, we find that the ability of zzso to zzso both zzso and zzso is a uniquely human zzso caused by the evolution of the zzso start zzso in the human zzso The pattern of zzso among humans is consistent with a zzso event at the zzso suggesting that positive natural selection affected zzso in the relatively recent zzso Because zzso is exploited by zzso zzso for invasion of the red blood cell, we zzso that selection for evasion of zzso zzso has caused accelerated evolution of zzso in humans zzso to other zzso and that this positive selection has continued to act in the recent evolution of our zzso These data suggest that malaria has played a powerful role in shaping molecules on the surface of the human red blood zzso In addition, our examination of zzso reveals a novel mechanism of protein zzso zzso of untranslated region zzso sequence following the formation of a new start zzso In the case of human zzso the ancestral protein zzso continues to be produced through leaky zzso Because leaky translation is a widespread phenomenon among genes and organisms, we suggest that zzso of zzso sequence may be an important source of protein zzso
