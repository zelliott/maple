zzso is a member of the zzso zzso factor family that appeared enriched in the zzso germ line of sea urchins zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that zzso is involved in germ line determination in this zzso We found two zzso forms of zzso that share the same zzso domain, but vary in the zzso zzso zzso Both forms of the zzso protein are present in the egg and in the early zzso and their zzso accumulate to their highest levels in the small zzso and adjacent zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a dramatic decrease in zzso zzso and protein levels as well as a loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso positively regulates zzso at the zzso level and is essential for zzso potential in this zzso
