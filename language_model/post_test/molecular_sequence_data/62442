Spinal muscular zzso zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from zzso loss of the zzso zzso To investigate zzso functions, we undertook the zzso zzso screens and identified zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso P and zzso zzso zzso to interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso between human zzso and zzso was validated by in zzso binding zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso are necessary and sufficient for binding to zzso zzso efficiency between zzso and zzso with zzso in the zzso domain is zzso or reduced and correlated with severity of zzso zzso zzso results indicate that zzso is zzso distributed throughout the zzso with higher concentration observed in the zzso However, in response to stress, zzso forms zzso and redistributes zzso into punctuated zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest a possible functional association of zzso with zzso P and zzso zzso zzso
