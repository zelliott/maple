We have developed a generic procedure to purify proteins expressed at their natural level under native conditions using a novel tandem affinity zzso zzso zzso The TAP tag allows the rapid zzso of complexes from a relatively small number of cells without prior knowledge of the complex zzso activity, or zzso Combined with mass zzso the TAP strategy allows for the identification of proteins interacting with a given target zzso The TAP method has been tested in zzso but should be zzso to other cells or zzso
