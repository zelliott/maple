By screening the expressed sequence tag zzso database, we identified transcripts of two new human genes that are zzso within a long terminal repeat zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The first zzso termed zzso is represented by two zzso clones and one zzso zzso all of which have a zzso zzso as their 3' zzso The gene has an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso acids with three zzso zzso and is expressed primarily in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Seven small zzso clones from several different zzso were found for the second zzso termed zzso As with zzso all zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso as the zzso zzso Three types of alternatively spliced zzso transcripts that could zzso proteins of 76, zzso or 153 zzso acids were zzso Interestingly, the zzso for two of these transcripts continues into the zzso For both zzso and 3, no major human transcripts that zzso a zzso zzso signal were zzso Analysis of zzso from zzso which lacks the zzso at these zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso and 3 genes use other zzso zzso This study demonstrates that ancient zzso insertions have assumed gene regulatory functions during the course of human zzso
