DEAD box zzso zzso use the energy of zzso zzso to unwind zzso zzso regions or to disrupt zzso zzso A minimal zzso zzso comprises nine zzso motifs distributed over two zzso zzso The zzso domain contains all motifs involved in zzso zzso namely the zzso the DEAD box, and the zzso as well as the SAT zzso which has been implicated in the coordination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We present here the crystal structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso Upon binding of zzso the zzso adopts a partially collapsed or zzso zzso that is still connected to the DEAD box zzso and the DEAD box in turn is linked to the SAT motif via hydrogen zzso This network of interactions communicates changes in the zzso zzso to distant parts of the zzso The affinity of zzso is comparable to that of zzso and zzso zzso that the binding energy from additional zzso zzso is directly converted into zzso changes of the entire zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain forms a zzso in the crystal similar to that seen in another zzso zzso It is possible that this mode of zzso represents the zzso architecture in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
