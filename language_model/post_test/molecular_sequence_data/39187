zzso interactions can be regulated by protein modifications such as zzso Some of the zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso B zzso zzso have been discovered and these sites are implicated in the regulation of viral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present report, the zzso form of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by protein zzso C in zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso facilitated zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso was zzso at zzso by zzso This was further confirmed using a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibited the zzso and, as a result, the in zzso zzso core assembly was not facilitated by zzso In addition, when either zzso or zzso was zzso into zzso cells, few zzso zzso zzso assembled into zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso although the same level of total zzso was expressed in both zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso core assembly through zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso
