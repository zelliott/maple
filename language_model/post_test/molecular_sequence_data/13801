zzso C virus zzso requires reverse zzso chain reaction zzso or zzso DNA signal amplification zzso to be detected in patient zzso Although conventional methods of zzso isolation are employed for samples of serum, zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso whole blood is generally considered an zzso source of zzso because of abundant zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we adapted a procedure for zzso isolation from whole blood, zzso and zzso that yields zzso template suitable for zzso zzso zzso isolation required less than 2 zzso and zzso sequences were easily detected in sample volumes of 50 zzso whole blood or zzso and in less than 1 zzso zzso zzso Following the addition of blood to zzso zzso zzso was stable in the mixture when incubated for at least 7 days at room temperature prior to zzso zzso zzso of whole blood zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso from individuals with chronic zzso suggests that zzso zzso can be more reliably detected in whole zzso Three of 15 zzso zzso positive patients zzso had zzso zzso present in whole blood but simultaneously obtained plasma samples were zzso Two of the zzso zzso negative individuals with chronic zzso contained zzso zzso in whole blood, yet one of these patient's plasma was negative for viral zzso The zzso method of zzso zzso is useful for detecting zzso zzso in whole blood and blood zzso and provides a practical method of measuring plasma and zzso zzso zzso from clinical zzso
