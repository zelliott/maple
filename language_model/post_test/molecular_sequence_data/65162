We are using the zzso zzso of zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso as a model to investigate smooth muscle zzso zzso We previously identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso site zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that regulate zzso of the zzso central alternative zzso Here we show that zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso proteins bind to the zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso with a zzso zzso construct increase zzso of the central alternative zzso zzso proteins do not enhance zzso when the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso indicating that zzso are necessary but not sufficient for zzso The zzso specifically binds zzso and zzso zzso supporting a model in which both zzso and zzso proteins binding to their zzso are required for the recruitment of the zzso complex to a weak zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso cell line zzso reduced the zzso of the central alternative zzso of the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 3' alternative zzso and the zzso alternative zzso were zzso suggesting that zzso proteins regulate a subset of smooth zzso alternative zzso zzso Finally, reduced zzso binding and reduced expression of the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso smooth muscle around zzso coincided with the switch from zzso inclusion to zzso zzso suggesting that loss of zzso and zzso zzso activity may play a role in the zzso switch in zzso zzso
