We have cloned the zzso zzso a new zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso library prepared from a human brain zzso cell zzso zzso analysis reveals that this message is zzso expressed in human brain, but is also found at a low level in human fetal liver and adult liver and muscle zzso Although previous studies have suggested that the major zzso of zzso found in all fetal zzso is the brain type, our data show that the zzso zzso in fetal liver zzso zzso is the adult liver zzso The protein sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of the brain zzso zzso is zzso zzso acids long compared with zzso and zzso zzso acids for the liver and muscle zzso zzso the greater length of brain zzso is entirely due to an extension at the far zzso portion of the zzso The muscle and brain zzso share greater identity with regard to zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso composition than either do with the liver zzso suggesting a closer evolutionary relationship between zzso Spot zzso zzso of the brain zzso zzso to zzso human zzso zzso and Southern zzso analysis of zzso hybrid cell line DNA reveals that the exact zzso of the newly cloned zzso maps to zzso 20, but that a slightly less zzso gene is found on zzso 10 as zzso The liver and muscle genes have previously been localized to zzso 14 and 11, zzso This suggests that the zzso genes evolved by zzso and zzso of a common ancestral zzso leading to divergence of elements controlling gene expression and of structural features of the zzso proteins that zzso zzso functional zzso
