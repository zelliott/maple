zzso DNA and zzso DNA clones corresponding to the chicken alpha 1 zzso collagen gene were isolated and zzso These zzso DNA clones covered zzso base pairs of the zzso and zzso 624 zzso acids of the triple zzso region plus the entire zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a major band of approximately zzso zzso and a minor band of approximately zzso zzso A combination of Northern zzso and in zzso zzso analyses showed that, in addition to its presence in cartilage, this zzso also is present in a wide variety of chicken zzso embryonic zzso including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, zzso and skin, but was not detected in zzso Type II collagen zzso has also been detected at low levels in these same zzso Also, similar to the zzso for the alpha 1 chain for type II zzso the alpha 1 zzso collagen zzso is detected in limb zzso prior to zzso and differentiation of the core zzso into zzso
