We describe an example of incomplete zzso and variable zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso two genetic properties classically associated with zzso in more complex organisms, such as green plants and zzso We show that the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso of this zzso present zzso in their zzso that cannot be attributed to fluctuations of the genetic background or the zzso zzso of the knockout strains derived from independent zzso zzso or from a single zzso zzso and cultivated under standard growth conditions may or may not present impaired zzso When impaired, zzso exhibit a range of zzso Environmental conditions control zzso to a large extent and zzso to a low zzso Restoration of functional zzso transport by zzso expression of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso or strongly diminishes the growth zzso These data show that incomplete zzso and variable zzso can be an intrinsic property of a single zzso zzso zzso They also show that such zzso in the expression of a zzso zzso can be promoted by a phenomenon not obviously related to the well-known zzso structure zzso zzso zzso zzso They provide a framework to understand human zzso with similar zzso
