zzso zzso between the zzso region of the S protein of zzso B zzso zzso and known fusion peptides from zzso and zzso led us to propose that this region might be equally involved in the initial zzso steps of zzso In fact, we showed that a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso region of the S protein of zzso had zzso properties and was able to induce zzso fusion adopting an extended zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1996, zzso We describe zzso studies on the interaction of peptides derived from the zzso region of the S protein of duck zzso zzso and zzso zzso B viruses zzso zzso with zzso These peptides were able to induce to a different extent zzso zzso zzso and leakage of internal zzso contents from both neutral and zzso charged zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso of zzso zzso indicated that both peptides become inserted into the zzso core of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso zzso adopts an extended zzso in the presence of zzso whereas the zzso zzso displays a high content of zzso zzso zzso these results extend our previous findings obtained for human zzso B virus to other members of the zzso family and suggest that this region of the S protein is important in the initial steps of the zzso zzso
