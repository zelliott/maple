zzso the evolution of ecological specialization is important for making zzso about the origins of zzso Members of the zzso marine zzso zzso zzso exhibit a variety of diets and the ability to capture prey is linked to a zzso comprised of zzso zzso termed zzso We identified zzso transcripts from zzso zzso a species of zzso that uniquely zzso exclusively on zzso and compared its zzso duct zzso to that of four other zzso species to determine whether a shift to a specialized diet is associated with changes in the zzso composition of this zzso We also examined the secondary structure of predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso transcripts of zzso zzso to identify zzso that may be linked to specialization on zzso We identified seven distinct zzso sequences from zzso zzso that appear to represent transcripts of seven distinct zzso zzso levels and the diversity of zzso expressed by zzso zzso are considerably less than those of other zzso Moreover, gene products of two transcripts exhibited unique secondary structures that have not been previously observed from other zzso These results suggest that transition to a specialist diet is associated with reduction in the number of components expressed in zzso of zzso and that diverse zzso of zzso are maintained in species with a broad dietary zzso
