An apparent zzso zzso of zzso suggests a zzso with their natural zzso However, the exact species or subspecies zzso of African green zzso zzso is uncertain because current zzso schemes rely on zzso zzso while more definitive genetic data are zzso In this study, the zzso protein involved in tissue type recognition was genetically cloned and zzso from zzso zzso from all zzso species, including zzso green monkeys zzso zzso trees were constructed that also included zzso zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and humans consistently clustered zzso Monkeys within the zzso zzso formed a separate cluster which included zzso zzso supporting its grouping as a member of zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso were genetically more closely related to Asian zzso than to other African species, which might explain why zzso are more susceptible to infection by the zzso group than to infection by zzso or zzso and why zzso on the other hand, are highly susceptible to zzso zzso Based on zzso genetic data, zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed separate zzso with zzso grouping closely with zzso The branching order of the zzso species was related to that of their respective zzso zzso zzso The study suggests a strong correlation between zzso zzso and the zzso of the host species to infection by a specific zzso and supports the assumption of a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso sequencing is suggested as a relevant method for genetic determination of zzso zzso
