zzso to multiple sclerosis zzso is associated with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that major zzso complex class zzso presentation of central nervous zzso zzso is important in the disease zzso zzso specific for defined zzso complexes may therefore be valuable tools for studying zzso presentation in zzso We have used zzso display technology to select zzso zzso from zzso mice zzso with zzso molecules zzso with an zzso zzso basic protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of one clone zzso demonstrated that both zzso and the zzso zzso were required for zzso Furthermore, zzso labeled zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes when zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso 2 zzso by two zzso that expressed human zzso T cell zzso Analysis of the structural requirement for zzso binding demonstrated that the two major zzso anchor zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso part of the zzso in particular zzso zzso zzso and zzso were important for zzso Based on these results, the zzso was used to determine if the zzso zzso complex is presented in zzso zzso The zzso stained zzso in zzso zzso in particular zzso but also in some cases zzso zzso zzso of zzso was only observed in zzso cases with the zzso zzso but not in cases that carried other zzso These results demonstrate that zzso molecules in zzso zzso present a zzso zzso and suggest that zzso rather than zzso are the zzso zzso in these zzso
