zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are key zzso in the cells protection against zzso zzso Thus, zzso play a major role in the protection of zzso organisms against zzso zzso Three zzso zzso were previously identified by zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows an zzso effect to an zzso drug and alleviate zzso inside tumor cells lines zzso zzso melanoma zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To extend the characterization of zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso a zzso approach was applied involving two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso zzso From zzso sequence data obtained by mass zzso and sequences zzso zzso were defined and a zzso zzso of zzso was amplified by zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame coding for 152 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high identity zzso with sequences of zzso zzso from other plant zzso zzso analysis was achieved by a protein zzso structural zzso
