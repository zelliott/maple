zzso zzso DNA fragments complementary to selected regions of the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned into zzso coli zzso zzso One of the zzso plasmids zzso with a 87 zzso insert representing the central region of the zzso zzso zzso 88 to zzso was used after zzso by zzso translation for detecting zzso by zzso zzso The molecular probe was almost as sensitive as the one carrying the full zzso zzso copy zzso detecting down to 20 zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of infected zzso The specificity of the test was high; no signals were created by extracts from healthy plants or plants infected with a variety of common potato zzso The probe is potentially useful in studies on mixed infections of potatoes with different zzso and in selection of certified seed zzso
