We mapped the zzso copy of the zzso gene and examined its zzso zzso and zzso We found that: zzso zzso maps to the zzso portion of zzso zzso 16, consistent with previous mapping of the human zzso gene to the Down syndrome critical region on zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso to the cell nucleus, zzso the potential of controlling the expression of other zzso zzso The zzso protein can zzso in a zzso system, in zzso with the presence of a zzso zzso motif noted in the original zzso In particular, its expression pattern in frontal brain zzso during zzso zzso its zzso zzso and its ability to interact with other proteins all suggest that this protein remains a good candidate to mediate some of the zzso effects of Down zzso
