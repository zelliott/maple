The zzso organization of the zzso zzso II zzso gene from rat and mouse was investigated and compared with their human zzso The genes share a common core structure consisting of five zzso interrupted by four zzso but the mouse and rat gene reveal individual additional zzso A unique zzso spliced zzso is present in the zzso region of the rat zzso which most probably has arisen de zzso by point zzso in zzso sequences of the zzso zzso In the mouse zzso zzso a novel zzso boundary has been created due to the presence of an additional DNA segment, which simultaneously provides a zzso site and a zzso stretch leading to an alternatively used zzso of increased zzso Our data suggest that, in contrast to most other zzso zzso the zzso pattern of the gene coding for zzso is in dynamic zzso
