zzso white syndrome zzso is characterized by rapid tissue loss revealing the white underlying skeleton and affects zzso zzso however, reports of zzso agents are zzso zzso were collected from healthy and diseased zzso and seawater around American Samoa and bacteria associated with zzso characterized using both zzso and zzso methods, from coral zzso and tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene clone libraries derived from coral tissue were dominated by the zzso and zzso distances calculated between the clone libraries showed that those from diseased zzso were more similar to each other than to those from healthy zzso zzso zzso genes from 78 zzso coral zzso zzso also revealed a distinct zzso of bacterial zzso into healthy and diseased zzso zzso identified as zzso were further characterized by zzso sequence zzso revealing that whilst several zzso zzso were found to be associated with zzso zzso a recently described species, zzso zzso was prevalent amongst cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso with zzso had a different zzso than normal zzso as found by zzso zzso whether a microbial shift occurs prior to disease outbreaks will be a useful avenue of pursuit and could be helpful in detecting zzso signs of coral disease prior to manifestation of zzso
