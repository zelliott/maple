zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods have been used to characterize the structure of zzso zzso zzso in a partially folded state using zzso zzso zzso This state is formed by the zzso of the protein in zzso zzso zzso water zzso and is characterized by substantial zzso secondary structure in the absence of extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments have allowed the sequential assignment of zzso for all but 2 of the 126 main chain zzso nitrogen atoms and of the majority of main and side chain zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso chain was characterized by analysis of the pattern of zzso H alpha chemical shift zzso zzso H zzso constants, and hydrogen exchange zzso These zzso parameters are highly complementary and are consistent with a model for the zzso state in which six regions of the zzso chain are substantially ordered in zzso zzso The structure in different regions however, shows different levels of zzso Five of the zzso exhibit significant protection of zzso zzso against exchange with zzso and are located in regions of the zzso which are zzso in the native zzso By contrast, zzso structures of greater flexibility are observed both as extensions to the zzso zzso and as a zzso structure in the region of the zzso which forms the zzso part of the zzso in the native zzso No specific structural preferences are detected in regions corresponding to the long loop and to the zzso part of the zzso of native zzso A combination of local features of the zzso chain, including the predicted zzso of zzso for zzso formation and for their participation in zzso and zzso zzso capping zzso allows the zzso behavior of the zzso chain of zzso zzso to be rationalized for this partially folded zzso The analysis implies that the zzso structures are a result of interactions which are local to the zzso zzso zzso and the highly persistent zzso structures, give insight into species which form early during zzso
