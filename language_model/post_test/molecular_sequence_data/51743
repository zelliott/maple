A beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sharing zzso zzso with the rat beta 4 zzso has been cloned from a human zzso cell zzso The gene zzso the human beta 4 zzso is expressed in association with the alpha 3 gene in zzso and zzso lung zzso cell zzso zzso experiments and zzso binding zzso confirm that these neuroendocrine tumor cell lines express functional zzso zzso zzso We suggest that these receptors might play a crucial role in the control of neurotransmitter and hormone zzso from zzso human zzso
