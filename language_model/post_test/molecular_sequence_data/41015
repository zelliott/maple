zzso is a candidate tumor zzso that zzso to a zzso region zzso This locus is frequently lost in a number of zzso and consistent loss of zzso through loss of zzso and decreased zzso and protein expression has been observed in tumors and cell zzso zzso of zzso into cells resulted in significant suppression of in zzso tumor growth and zzso of the zzso zzso Further, zzso was observed to zzso to the nucleus and zzso of zzso However, the mechanisms regulating its zzso zzso have not been zzso 

An in zzso import zzso demonstrated that zzso requires zzso machinery for active nuclear zzso Using sequence zzso and prediction zzso four putative nuclear zzso signals zzso were zzso zzso deletion zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins confirmed the functionality of three of these zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and full-length zzso defined the minimal functional regions within each zzso Further characterization revealed that zzso and zzso were critical for both the rate and efficiency of nuclear zzso In addition, four basic clusters within zzso and zzso were independently capable of zzso zzso The zzso occupancy of zzso revealed a complex balance of rapid zzso shuttling but low zzso mobility, suggesting zzso may play functional roles in both zzso In support, targeting to the zzso compartment was dependent on the presence of zzso as depletion of total zzso or zzso resulted in a zzso shift of zzso 

These results identify the minimal sequences required for the active targeting of zzso to the nucleus and zzso Further, this work characterizes the relative contribution of each sequence to zzso nuclear and zzso zzso the zzso constituents that participate in this zzso and suggests a functional role for zzso in both zzso Taken together, these results identify the requisite protein zzso for zzso zzso the zzso that drive this zzso and suggest zzso may function in both the nucleus and zzso
