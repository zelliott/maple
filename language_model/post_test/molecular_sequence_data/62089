The ability of zzso zzso zzso to adhere to zzso receptors and zzso in diverse host zzso is an important zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso surface zzso which are referred to as zzso and are zzso by zzso zzso The zzso regions of zzso contain multiple zzso zzso zzso that are referred to as zzso zzso zzso Here, we analyze the adhesive zzso of an Indian zzso zzso field zzso zzso which binds zzso but does not bind zzso This is a unique zzso zzso because zzso zzso strains that bind zzso described thus far usually also bind zzso Moreover, binding to both receptors is thought to be important for zzso zzso under zzso The zzso binding population of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells under flow despite poor binding to zzso We have also identified an expressed zzso zzso zzso which mediates the zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso of different regions of zzso on the surface of zzso cells followed by binding zzso demonstrates that the zzso binding domain maps to the zzso domain of zzso zzso comparison with two previously identified zzso binding zzso of zzso which also map to zzso zzso suggests that diverse zzso zzso zzso use a structurally zzso domain to bind zzso It thus appears that functional constraints may place limits on the extent of sequence diversity in zzso zzso of zzso
