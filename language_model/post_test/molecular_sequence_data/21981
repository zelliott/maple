zzso of the zzso expressed type 2 zzso zzso zzso which mediates the principal actions of zzso occurs at multiple zzso The goal of the current study was to determine whether the human B2 zzso region zzso has effects on gene zzso with particular focus on the variable number of tandem repeats zzso zzso portion of the zzso and its zzso zzso elements zzso When inserted downstream of the zzso coding region of the zzso zzso the zzso reduced reporter gene activity by zzso compared with zzso alone zzso zzso P zzso zzso an effect that was not appreciably affected by zzso of the zzso zzso The negative regulatory effects of the zzso region were position and orientation dependent and strongly positively correlated with the number of tandem repeats in the zzso region zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso With respect to zzso quantitative zzso revealed that the zzso zzso level was zzso of that of promoter control zzso zzso zzso whereas the number of zzso transcripts was zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of the zzso was increased zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cells with the zzso construct increased zzso of the native B2 zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso supporting an zzso B2 zzso capacity of the zzso In conclusion, these results identify novel zzso effects of the zzso region to act as a potent negative regulator of zzso gene expression and support the notion that the zzso B2 zzso may impact zzso zzso zzso
