Since zzso zzso is known to zzso to the external face of the plasma membrane when the cell membrane becomes zzso we decided to focus our attention on zzso as a target zzso for gene zzso In this paper, the novel zzso zzso was zzso zzso and characterized for its zzso zzso zzso simultaneously exhibited both characters as a DNA carrier and a sensor probe for active zzso which seemed to be triggered by structural changes in the presence of zzso This is a very unique character among zzso zzso and it is believed that zzso could be used for selective gene zzso
