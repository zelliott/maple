The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso continuous division of infected bovine zzso zzso zzso of differentiation markers and a loss of proliferation occur upon treatment with zzso zzso that zzso factors actively maintain the altered status of the infected zzso The factors that induce this unique transformation event have not been zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso that are located in the infected zzso nucleus have been zzso to function as zzso of host cell zzso In this study differential zzso display and zzso analysis were used to identify altered zzso and zzso expression profiles in a bovine zzso cell line zzso zzso with zzso One of the genes identified by differential display was found to zzso an zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso gene and the gene zzso its zzso zzso zzso were expressed at a low level in zzso zzso zzso However, infected cells were zzso to induction of elevated zzso expression by zzso or type 1 zzso while zzso cells showed no induction when treated with zzso zzso of the zzso system may be of relevance to the establishment of the transformed infected host cell, as zzso is associated with resistance to zzso infection by zzso stimulation of the immune response and terminal differentiation of zzso zzso
