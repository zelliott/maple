Among zzso only 2 zzso zzso and zzso are known to contribute to zzso from zzso and zzso is a specialist that uses zzso zzso However, zzso strains so far have mainly been isolated from zzso zzso despite the fact that it is zzso not only in zzso zzso zzso and freshwater zzso but also in marine zzso based upon extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated an zzso zzso designated strain zzso from a tidal flat zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso and zzso genes revealed that the isolate belongs to the zzso zzso Unlike the other known zzso species, this isolate grows at zzso zzso of zzso to zzso M, with an optimum concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso using real-time zzso detected the zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso in the marine zzso and relative abundance ranged from zzso to zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the number of zzso organisms increased with increasing depth and was much higher than that of zzso organisms, suggesting that zzso zzso contribute to zzso metabolism to a greater extent than previously thought in marine zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first report on marine zzso species, and based on zzso and characteristic studies, the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this novel species, with type strain zzso
