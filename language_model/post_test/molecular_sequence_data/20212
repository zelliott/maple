zzso zzso are present on the surface of all plant zzso zzso 18 and 19 comprise the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and consist of an zzso signal zzso a classical zzso domain interrupted by a small zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso anchor addition zzso zzso and zzso expression patterns and zzso zzso of zzso were studied and compared to other zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in roots, flowers and stems and zzso expressed in zzso and zzso High zzso promoter activity was closely associated with vascular zzso and high in young zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso parallel signature sequencing zzso data were also examined and showed largely consistent zzso profiles of zzso On the protein level, zzso was most abundant in roots and flowers, moderate in zzso zzso and zzso and low in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was localized to the plasma membrane and to zzso zzso following zzso of tobacco cultured cells expressing a green zzso protein zzso fusion zzso zzso of zzso on the plasma membrane was further confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso These expression and zzso data further our understanding of zzso and provide a molecular basis to approach and decipher its zzso
