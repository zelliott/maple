zzso protein zzso zzso plays a central role in maintaining the energy balance of organisms under zzso and environmental zzso Here two zzso alpha zzso gene transcripts (named zzso and zzso from zzso zzso were isolated and gene expression was characterized by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was zzso expressed during zzso zzso stages as well as in response to zzso such as zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in adult zzso decreased under heat zzso but not in a zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, the transcript sharply decreased in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Under zzso stress, however, the zzso level in adults first declined and then increased with prolonged zzso In the case of zzso the gene expression in adults decreased and was zzso after day zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression was too low to be detected without zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis, moreover, indicated zzso alpha zzso was present in multiple copies in the zzso zzso Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso level sharply decreases in zzso carrying zzso zzso and this indicates the possibility that zzso is involved in determining the zzso mode in zzso
