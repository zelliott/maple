All the cells of the zzso system derive ultimately from a single zzso stem cell through processes of commitment and zzso The stem cell is also likely to be capable of extensive self zzso Many factors which potentially control these processes have been identified and zzso both in zzso and in zzso We discuss the nature of the zzso stem cell and also the factors which have been identified as potential stem cell zzso We also draw parallels from zzso stem cell differentiation to derive a model of intrinsic determination of the zzso stem zzso The possible role of zzso regulators, such as zzso containing zzso are discussed in the context of differentiation commitment of the zzso stem zzso
