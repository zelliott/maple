zzso arrest plays a role in regulating the expression of a number of zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously identified two prominent arrest sites at the zzso end of the zzso zzso one in the first zzso and one in the first zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the functional characterization of the zzso 1 arrest site, located 137 to 145 zzso downstream of the cap zzso We have determined, using gel zzso that the zzso 1 arrest site is a stable zzso zzso II pause site and that the zzso zzso factor zzso promotes zzso at this zzso Additionally, the sequence zzso for the pause are located within a zzso zzso encompassing this site zzso to zzso and can direct zzso arrest in an zzso manner in the context of the zzso and zzso major late zzso zzso point zzso in this region increase or decrease the relative pausing zzso We also show that the sequence zzso for zzso arrest can function when placed an additional 104 zzso downstream of their natural zzso
