Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso serves to target G zzso receptors for zzso via zzso pits and that its zzso function is regulated by zzso at the plasma zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso an zzso essential for many zzso transport zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact in zzso and that these proteins can be zzso from zzso zzso complex formation exhibits a zzso dependence with zzso zzso interacting with the zzso bound form of zzso In contrast to the zzso interaction, however, the zzso state of zzso does not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells significantly enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso with a zzso zzso zzso that mimics a zzso zzso form of zzso and that acts as a dominant negative with regards to zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The demonstration of zzso complex formation and the functional consequences of zzso zzso suggest a zzso unappreciated role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso
