There are well-established differences in the expression of zzso neutral zzso among human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express several types of these compounds, whereas mature zzso cells are deficient in such zzso The zzso basis for this is zzso zzso zzso studies were done to determine whether different classes of zzso zzso by cell zzso contained beta zzso activity zzso zzso beta zzso This zzso zzso in the synthesis of Type 2 chains in zzso by catalyzing the following two zzso zzso Gal beta zzso beta zzso zzso zzso + zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gal beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso + zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso The first reaction may be the key step in the zzso zzso of zzso structures in human zzso zzso extracts from several cell lines representative of both zzso and zzso zzso at varied stages of maturity, were zzso with zzso for the presence of beta zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso cells contain this initiating beta zzso activity, whereas zzso cells do zzso This is consistent with our zzso zzso zzso results which show that all zzso cell lines express neutral zzso zzso and zzso cells do zzso Our findings suggest that the presence of the initiating activity only in zzso cells is a regulatory factor in the expression of neutral zzso zzso in human zzso We also tested both zzso and zzso cell lines for the presence of zzso beta zzso activity zzso zzso above) by using zzso as an zzso Our results show that an zzso activity is expressed by all zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activities were distinguished by several zzso metal zzso zzso pH zzso and kinetic zzso In conclusion, our results indicate the presence of two beta zzso activities in human zzso one that zzso the initial reaction and is found only in the zzso lineage and one that zzso the zzso reaction and is found in both zzso and zzso zzso
