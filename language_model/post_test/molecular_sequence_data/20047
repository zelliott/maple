The zzso relationships within the zzso were assessed using zzso sequences with the aim of testing several hypotheses proposed to explain the origin of zzso diversity zzso zzso and museum zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and control region zzso zzso were obtained from 15 localities throughout the main South American rivers for 21 of the 28 extant zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso is zzso and comprises three major zzso The zzso analyses of these zzso allowed the identification of five zzso events, extensive zzso and four lineage zzso suggesting the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso patterns are consistent with the prediction made by the museum hypothesis that lineages from the zzso shields are older than those from the zzso of the zzso The zzso events zzso here match the distribution of the zzso and several zzso zzso events are identified, thereby matching the predictions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso clock zzso of the control region sequences indicates that the main lineages differentiated from their most recent common zzso at 9 million years ago in the zzso zzso and the present rate of diversification is the highest reported to date for large carnivorous zzso The present results emphasize that an interaction among zzso zzso changes, and zzso created opportunities for zzso in the zzso at different zzso and geographical zzso
