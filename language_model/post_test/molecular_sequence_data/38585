We report a new tandem mass zzso approach for the improved identification of zzso from zzso zzso using zzso zzso The approach involves the zzso of several species simultaneously in a single experiment and provides both increased speed and zzso The data analysis makes use of the known fragmentation pathways for zzso and highly accurate mass zzso for both the set of parent zzso and their zzso The accurate mass information makes it possible to attribute most fragments to a specific parent zzso We provide an initial demonstration of this zzso tandem zzso approach using an zzso mass zzso with a mixture of seven zzso zzso using infrared zzso from a CO2 zzso The peptides were added to, and then successfully identified from, the largest zzso database yet available zzso zzso which is equivalent in complexity to that for a specific differentiated zzso cell zzso Additionally, since only a few zzso fragments are necessary to zzso identify a protein from an appropriate database, it is anticipated that the zzso zzso method will allow the more rapid identification of complex protein zzso with zzso separation of their zzso produced zzso
