We have cloned zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons show that the level of protein sequence identity between the zzso is as low as zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso are as zzso related to each other as to the remaining zzso zzso Based on the observation that zzso an electron transfer component of the zzso zzso zzso system, can be replaced by zzso from other zzso zzso systems, we have developed three zzso host strains for the functional analysis of the novel zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso were equipped with zzso Delta B, which encodes all proteins necessary for growth on zzso zzso zzso to zzso except a functional zzso zzso The third host was an zzso knockout zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is no longer able to grow on zzso to zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso except the zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed at least one of the three hosts to grow on zzso
