zzso zzso zzso zzso play a vital regulatory role in a wide range of biological zzso and zzso from viruses have been implicated in pathogen evasion of the host zzso zzso For the first time, we report a functional zzso gene from zzso that may function in this zzso This zzso named zzso has been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent of human zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso experiments indicate that zzso is expressed only by zzso zzso which are the zzso zzso zzso zzso A survey of the greater than 14,000 expressed sequence tags zzso from B zzso deposited in zzso shows that greater than zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso libraries zzso to zzso Despite its abundance in the zzso stage, zzso has not been found in any other point in the life zzso The predicted protein zzso by zzso contains zzso zzso acids with a putative signal zzso zzso to zzso zzso protein react specifically with a zzso native protein in zzso zzso zzso is one of the largest of the 93 known zzso due to a 22 zzso acid zzso extension, and contains the zzso zzso signature zzso Outside these regions, levels of zzso are low, and only a distant relationship can been seen to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene contains 6 zzso 2 of which appear to be shared by both zzso zzso The B zzso zzso have an extended and zzso 3' zzso site and are relatively large compared with C zzso A panel of zzso zzso zzso were screened and zzso protein was found to specifically inhibit zzso activity of human zzso zzso G and human zzso zzso but not a range of other zzso zzso It is possible that zzso could function as a zzso zzso in the blood environment of the zzso zzso in protection from human immunity and thus may be a good candidate for protective zzso
