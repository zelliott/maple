We tested the zzso probability grid zzso Carlo zzso methodology to determine optimal zzso of zzso by applying it to predict the low energy ensemble for two peptides whose solution zzso structures are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Type II zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involves importance zzso local random stepping in the vicinity of a current local zzso and zzso sampling criteria for acceptance or rejection of new zzso Internal coordinate values are based on zzso zzso angle probability zzso (from analysis of high-resolution protein crystal zzso Important features of zzso are: zzso Each zzso step selects the zzso angles zzso zzso zzso from a discrete grid that are then applied directly to the zzso The zzso angle increments can be taken as S zzso 60, 30, 15, 10, or 5 degrees, depending on the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso probability function zzso in conjunction with zzso sampling to accept or reject new zzso For each zzso we found close agreement with the known structure for the low energy zzso ensemble located with zzso This suggests that zzso will be useful for predicting zzso of other zzso
