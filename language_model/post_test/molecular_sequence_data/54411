zzso sensitive labels constitute a new, attractive tool for monitoring zzso zzso zzso derivatives are of particular interest because they undergo zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso showing dual zzso highly sensitive to environmental zzso To overcome the drawbacks of the previously developed label for sensing zzso interactions based on zzso zzso a series of zzso labels based on zzso have been zzso As compared to zzso the new labels display higher sensitivity of the ratio of their two zzso bands zzso to zzso polarity and zzso donor ability, as well as higher zzso quantum yields in zzso Moreover, they show higher zzso values of their zzso group, allowing their application at neutral pH without interference of zzso zzso To illustrate the applications of these labels, we zzso coupled them to the zzso of the zzso zzso that zzso to the basic domain of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso did not modify the zzso acid zzso properties of the zzso zzso of zzso of varying zzso zzso and zzso to the labeled peptides induced dramatic change in the zzso ratio of their two zzso zzso This change indicated that the level of probe zzso in the zzso complexes decreases in the following order: short zzso zzso long zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso The level of probe zzso was related to the ability of the probe to stack with the DNA bases or base pairs in the various zzso The changes in the zzso ratio upon interaction of the labeled zzso peptides with DNA were about zzso larger with the new zzso as compared to the parent zzso label, in line with the higher sensitivity of the new zzso to the zzso One of these labels, presenting the most compact zzso showed the highest sensitivity, probably due to its optimal stacking with the DNA zzso Thus, the new zzso labels appear as improved highly sensitive tools to zzso monitor the binding of peptides to zzso and zzso zzso
