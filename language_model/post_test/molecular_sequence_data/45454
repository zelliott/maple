zzso zzso zzso zzso library screening resulted in the cloning of four zzso 1 zzso zzso to as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso and two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited high zzso acid sequence identity with the four zzso 1 zzso Specifically, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, both zzso zzso and zzso are unusual in that each has a zzso zzso tail, an zzso and the common zzso motif zzso at the zzso zzso zzso one and two on the complementary transcript of zzso zzso are separated by a 150 zzso zzso beginning at zzso of the predicted sequences for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, examination of the approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso clone indicated the inclusion of an insert of 1120 base pairs zzso beginning at zzso zzso of the predicted zzso zzso and zzso zzso open reading frames zzso Further, the zzso sequence of zzso zzso contained multiple stop zzso and showed no significant zzso to other known sequences as determined by a search of the zzso zzso Thus, the focus of this paper will be zzso zzso zzso zzso To substantiate that an zzso is retained in the full-length zzso two types of zzso zzso fragments for zzso zzso were generated by zzso and analyzed on Northern zzso The products generated were a mixture of zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso zzso that retained the zzso presumably are derived from a zzso zzso that has not undergone zzso Although the significance of such zzso zzso in zzso has not yet been zzso future studies of such zzso may serve to broaden our knowledge concerning established zzso mechanisms as well as to focus attention on zzso concepts about gene product zzso
