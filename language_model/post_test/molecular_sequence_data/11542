We have previously assigned the zzso causing zzso zzso zzso to zzso by genetic linkage and fluorescent in zzso zzso analysis, and identified zzso events which position the gene zzso to zzso We report here the extension of a zzso artificial zzso zzso to span the 860 zzso zzso immediately zzso to this marker, which includes the zzso and zzso zzso reported to flank the zzso zzso and the construction of a high resolution zzso zzso initiated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso library screening strategies have resulted in the isolation of a candidate gene which zzso the zzso boundary of the zzso critical zzso The gene spans a zzso zzso greater than 220 zzso with at least two of the coding zzso located zzso to the zzso zzso zzso is complex, with multiple transcripts detected in a variety of zzso and evidence of alternative zzso and zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence for the zzso zzso transcript reported here shows a marked zzso to the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proposed to function within the zzso cycle, suggesting a potential role for the human zzso in signal zzso zzso no evidence for zzso has been detected in this transcript, the sequence represents only one of the shorter alternatively spliced species identified by Northern analysis and direct zzso This gene remains a strong candidate for zzso
