zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the assembly of a structurally diverse group of peptides by the zzso zzso zzso All zzso known to date are exclusively type I modular zzso that consist of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso carrier protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso for individual zzso zzso Although several A and zzso zzso have been demonstrated to function zzso zzso in trans has been successful only between zzso and their zzso A zzso 

We have identified within the zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene that encodes a discrete zzso zzso We zzso the zzso gene in zzso coli, zzso the zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso can be efficiently modified into zzso either in zzso or in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso in type I zzso zzso lacks its zzso A domain and can be zzso by zzso an A domain from a completely unrelated type I zzso 

zzso represents the first characterized type II zzso The zzso type II zzso like the zzso zzso of type I zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso but is zzso distinct in that it can be zzso by an A domain from a completely unrelated type I zzso Our results provide for the first time the genetic and zzso evidence to support the existence of a type II zzso which might be useful in the zzso manipulation of zzso proteins to generate novel zzso
