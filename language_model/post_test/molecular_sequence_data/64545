Most published data on zzso resistance is generated from in zzso or in zzso studies of zzso B zzso However, this zzso is associated with zzso of zzso infections worldwide, and it is essential to explore zzso zzso of drug zzso One potential cause of the differences between zzso is the synonymous zzso usage at key resistance zzso 

We investigated the zzso sequences at drug zzso sites, for all major Brazilian zzso zzso C, and zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso group zzso 

We identified a change at positions 151 and 210 of the zzso region in zzso zzso such that the emergence of these key zzso analogue resistance zzso required an extra zzso change in zzso zzso compared with zzso B and zzso The clinical significance of position 210 was confirmed within a large Brazilian database, in which we identified a lower prevalence of the zzso zzso in zzso F1 virus, compared with zzso B virus, in patients matched for zzso zzso An inverse relationship between the zzso and zzso zzso was also zzso 

The findings of the present study illustrate an important mechanism by which a zzso may determine genetic routes to resistance, with implications for treatment strategies for populations infected with zzso zzso zzso
