During productive infection, human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at three distinct start sites that are zzso zzso Two of the start sites, the zzso and the zzso are active at early times, whereas the middle start site is active only at late times after zzso The zzso early viral gene product is essential for viral DNA zzso The zzso gene product from the late viral promoter affects primarily viral gene expression at late times after infection rather than viral DNA synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso early viral promoters have a zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso late viral promoter has a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso sequence is required for the zzso of late viral zzso The zzso boxes that surround the middle zzso element did not affect the zzso or the start site of zzso late zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso element with a zzso zzso sequence did not affect the zzso of zzso or the zzso start site, but it did induce an alternative transcript at late times after zzso The data indicate that a zzso zzso box is used at late times after zzso zzso
