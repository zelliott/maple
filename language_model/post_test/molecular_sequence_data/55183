zzso C virus zzso of zzso zzso is the most prevalent worldwide, and the least responsive to zzso zzso A combination therapy with two zzso zzso has shown promising results in patients with zzso but the prevalence of drug-resistant zzso before treatment is not known in the Japanese zzso 

To detect zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso patients infected with zzso 

zzso zzso were determined in the 362 zzso patients infected with zzso who had not received zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in 15 of the 307 zzso patients, who had been zzso and zzso zzso predominated over zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso and/or zzso were detected in 33 of the zzso zzso patients, and zzso zzso predominated over zzso zzso One of the 239 zzso patients, who had been examined for zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso regions, possessed zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso or zzso were frequent in our zzso study population, but double zzso with possible resistance to both drugs were zzso Since single zzso did not result in treatment failure in a previous pilot trial combining zzso and an zzso zzso larger trials of this drug regimen appear warranted in the Japanese zzso
