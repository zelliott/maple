Mass zzso techniques for the identification of proteins either by zzso acid sequencing or by correlation of mass spectral data with sequence databases are becoming increasingly sensitive and are rapidly approaching the limit of detection achieved by the zzso of proteins in gels or, after zzso on zzso Here we present a technique for the sensitive zzso of proteins zzso onto zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso conditions for such proteins to achieve optimal recovery of zzso The technique is based on the deposition of zzso silver on the zzso zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso on the membrane were recovered at high yields and were compatible with analysis by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso This simple and rapid zzso silver zzso procedure allowed the zzso of less than 5 zzso of protein in a band and thus approached the sensitivity of silver zzso in zzso We demonstrate that this method allows the detection of zzso amounts of zzso proteins and their identification by zzso liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso
