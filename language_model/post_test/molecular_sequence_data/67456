zzso diversity in zzso zzso is zzso However, ecological processes underpinning their evolutionary diversification in association with other zzso groups are still zzso zzso and zzso among zzso zzso that reproduce on zzso presents an opportunity to investigate the ecology of a zzso system that includes zzso Here we estimate the zzso species specificity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that attacks the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the interactions between zzso and the zzso species present in a forest patch of Uganda in context with populations in Southern zzso zzso networks are zzso to examine zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso approaches used to zzso putative species zzso zzso appraisal and putative species zzso by molecular and zzso techniques are zzso zzso demonstrate that a zzso zzso zzso population is able to reproduce on at least four zzso species present in a zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso have relatively broad zzso species ranges compared to zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not recruit on all available host plants present in the forest census area and suggests an important ecological consequence in zzso fitness zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The extent to which zzso zzso zzso exert influence on the zzso zzso must consider the fitness consequences imposed by the ability to interact with zzso of multiple zzso and zzso zzso species, but not equally across space and zzso
