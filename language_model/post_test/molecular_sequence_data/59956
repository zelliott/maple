zzso breast tumor zzso cells express zzso a major zzso zzso that binds zzso zzso components at its zzso domain and interacts with the zzso zzso zzso at its zzso zzso In this study, we have determined that zzso and zzso zzso are physically associated in zzso and that zzso zzso displays zzso activity, which can be inhibited by zzso toxin zzso zzso In addition, we have identified a 160 zzso zzso zzso as one of the downstream targets for zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso with zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso of certain cellular proteins including the zzso domain of zzso Most importantly, zzso of zzso by zzso enhances its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso We have also constructed two zzso zzso zzso that zzso for proteins consisting of zzso zzso acids zzso as the zzso active form of zzso containing the zzso domain zzso also the zzso zzso and 173 zzso acids zzso as the zzso form of zzso containing the zzso domain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain into zzso cells promotes zzso associated membrane zzso and zzso This membrane zzso can be blocked by zzso zzso and zzso D (a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso form of zzso by zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso domain zzso effectively zzso zzso zzso behavior zzso membrane zzso and tumor cell zzso These findings support the hypothesis that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso interaction and zzso zzso signaling required for zzso function and zzso tumor cell zzso
