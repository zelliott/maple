zzso zzso zzso were performed to characterize interactions between the leader of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso From zzso a host for zzso three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with multiple binding sites within the leader zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso binds with low zzso whereas zzso interacts specifically with viral zzso The expression of the proteins is not induced upon virus infection, as there is no difference in the protein pattern between healthy and infected cell zzso In a cellular zzso zzso and zzso remain in the high-speed zzso whereas zzso zzso with zzso A possible involvement of these proteins in the translation of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso
