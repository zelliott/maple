zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso zzso factor that mediates certain cellular responses to low oxygen tension, iron zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso Upon exposure to the above conditions, zzso alpha is zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso the zzso complex binds zzso zzso zzso zzso and activates zzso of target zzso As a first step in developing genetic models to study the biology related to cellular zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso alpha zzso determined the zzso expression of its zzso functionally analyzed its protein product, and characterized its promoter and its zzso zzso A comparison between the zzso and human zzso alpha protein sequence reveals zzso zzso and zzso identity in the zzso zzso and variable zzso zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrate that in adult mice, the zzso alpha zzso is expressed at high levels in zzso heart, brain, zzso and zzso with moderate expression in liver, zzso zzso and lung and much lower expression in skeletal muscle zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that the zzso of the zzso zzso alpha is transcribed in two forms, a major zzso species and a minor zzso zzso both are present in all zzso zzso The zzso alpha promoter is zzso rich, does not have a zzso element near its zzso start site, and does not respond to zzso or zzso The zzso alpha structural gene is composed of 15 zzso The zzso junction sites within the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso alpha gene are highly zzso with respect to a number of previously characterized members of the zzso zzso However, unlike other zzso zzso where the variable domain is zzso by 2 zzso the variable region of the zzso alpha gene is zzso by 7 zzso Furthermore, most of these zzso junction sites in the variable region are zzso with that of zzso zzso a recently cloned zzso zzso protein (also known as zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso along with zzso zzso represents a new zzso of the zzso zzso
