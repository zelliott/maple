zzso are zzso that perform zzso photosynthesis like zzso The initiation of transcription, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso of gene regulation in zzso The zzso factor of the zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the recognition of a promoter zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the primary zzso factor, zzso is essential for cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors show significant sequence similarity with the zzso factor but are zzso In this study, we have used zzso modeling to construct a three-dimensional model of zzso zzso zzso zzso and all group 1 and 2 zzso zzso According to the models, the overall three-dimensional structures of group 1 and 2 zzso factors are similar, the zzso and zzso factors being the most similar zzso In addition, we have constructed a complete set of group 2 zzso factor double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All double zzso grow well under standard conditions, but differences are observed in stress zzso The transition from lag phase to exponential growth is slow in the zzso strain, and all strains lacking the zzso factor were found to be sensitive to bright zzso Furthermore, all group 2 zzso factors were found to be involved in zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso
