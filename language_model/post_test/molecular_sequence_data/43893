zzso zzso zzso I zzso is one member of a class of zzso zzso found in a variety of organisms that are all capable of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes zzso leads to zzso of its zzso partner, zzso zzso zzso In this study the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso was zzso Northern analysis has shown that regulation is at the level of zzso transcription, the start site for zzso has been identified, and it is preceded by a zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso mobility shift zzso show that there is a putative regulatory protein in zzso zzso that binds specifically upstream of the zzso zzso That protein is not zzso A zzso sequence was identified as a putative binding site, and zzso of that sequence completely eliminates binding of the putative regulatory zzso A zzso reporter gene was placed under control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter and introduced into wild type and zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso activity was enhanced zzso in the zzso zzso relative to the wild zzso zzso of the zzso sequence reduced the zzso levels in the zzso strain to those of the wild type, demonstrating that zzso regulates zzso through the zzso and that the reaction is an zzso rather than a zzso The identified zzso is approximately 50% identical to the zzso binding site upstream of zzso coli zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may have a zzso regulatory system and that the function of zzso might be to specifically zzso that zzso
