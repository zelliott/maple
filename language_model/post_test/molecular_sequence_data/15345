zzso zzso are important regulators of growth and proliferation in zzso Their functions have been zzso zzso from insects to zzso although the sequence conservation is limited to a few short zzso Here, we analyze the requirement for the most highly zzso zzso called zzso boxes 2 and 3 zzso and zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso for the biological activity of the single zzso zzso protein in the animal in zzso We find that a zzso zzso lacking the zzso retains very little activity, whereas zzso zzso carrying a deletion of zzso have a moderately increased ability to promote growth and zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso output and the biological activities of zzso zzso though, zzso without zzso retains enough activity to partially rescue the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Thus, although zzso and zzso are highly zzso in evolution, loss of either domain has comparatively mild consequences on zzso activity in zzso
