zzso is an intriguing gene frequently isolated by differential screening in laboratories from different areas of molecular biology, since it is zzso in numerous cases of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and zzso While the dramatic increase of zzso expression in injured zzso is well established, the molecular basis of the gene induction remains zzso In this study, we have focused our attention on the only DNA region strictly zzso between zzso gene zzso promoters from different zzso zzso We show that this zzso DNA element is specifically recognized by the zzso zzso factor and can mediate zzso zzso in transient expression zzso zzso the avian zzso zzso promoter, zzso at the level of this element, no longer zzso zzso zzso These findings provide a possible explanation for the high sensitivity of zzso expression to environmental changes and allow the zzso of zzso as an zzso version of zzso zzso
