zzso switching from zzso to zzso is less common in zzso C zzso infection than in zzso B for reasons that are zzso We have examined sequential virus samples from a zzso zzso child who had evidence of zzso zzso 

To examine zzso envelope evolution towards zzso zzso zzso sequences were correlated with zzso characteristics determined by entry zzso as well as the ability to use alternative zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The value of a zzso predictor based on zzso sequences was also zzso 

zzso sequences revealed 3 distinct zzso virus lineages and only some members of one lineage evolved to use zzso These lineages also had diverse alternative zzso patterns including the ability to use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso switching was associated with extensive and rapid sequence divergence in the zzso region in addition to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso within the C2 region resulted in low predictability of a zzso zzso zzso algorithm, and highlighted the importance of zzso and zzso sequences in zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the evolution to zzso switching in zzso C infection requires more zzso than other zzso and this contributes to the reduced zzso of zzso zzso
