The zzso protein 1 zzso of the influenza A virus and the zzso zzso which is also known as nuclear export zzso play important roles in the infectious life cycle of the zzso The objective of this study was to find the degree of conservation in the zzso proteins and to identify zzso sites of functional or structural importance that may be zzso as potential drug target zzso The analysis was based on zzso zzso acid sequences for the zzso protein and zzso sequences for the zzso zzso The degree of conservation and potential binding sites were mapped onto the protein structures obtained from a combination of zzso available structure fragments with predicted zzso zzso In addition to high conservation in protein regions of known function, novel highly zzso sites have been identified, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso Using the zzso binding site prediction algorithm, several highly zzso binding sites were found, including two zzso close sites on the zzso zzso which could be targeted with a zzso zzso that would interfere with zzso zzso zzso Altogether, this work reveals novel universally zzso zzso that are candidates for zzso interactions and provide the basis for designing universal zzso zzso
