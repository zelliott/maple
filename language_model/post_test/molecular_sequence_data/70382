The structural gene zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been localized both on zzso DNA and the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso portion of the gene for zzso factor G zzso and the gene for zzso factor Tu zzso zzso of the predicted zzso sequence of zzso zzso with the zzso sequences from zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso showed that the zzso zzso shares a high degree of sequence zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with the zzso zzso Unlike the situation in zzso coli, the zzso gene of zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso being adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso Since a similar organization could be observed in zzso of zzso zzso and in all zzso so far zzso this probably represents the ancestral zzso
