To study the zzso variations of a zzso B virus zzso isolate in a patient zzso with human zzso virus type 1 zzso who developed severe zzso and died of zzso 

Two blood samples were collected, the first one during the zzso phase of zzso infection, and the other, 3 years later, few months before the death of the zzso Both samples were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions were zzso amplified and zzso 

The zzso isolate belonged to zzso zzso cluster zzso A number of unique zzso acid zzso were found in the surface zzso gene and the overlapping zzso coding region of zzso zzso derived from both zzso However, these zzso reflected natural variations rather than zzso of clinical zzso The zzso stop zzso zzso zzso was present in both zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso derived from the second, but not first sample, showed two zzso core zzso zzso one and 103 zzso in zzso zzso 

This is the first report of an zzso isolate from zzso F with core internal zzso Our results suggest an association between specific core zzso and the severe zzso developed by the zzso
