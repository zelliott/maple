Although their role in cell division is essential, zzso evolve rapidly in animals, plants and zzso Unlike the complex zzso of plants and zzso the point zzso of zzso zzso can be readily zzso to distinguish amongst the possible explanations for fast zzso zzso 

Using DNA sequences of all 16 zzso from 34 strains of zzso zzso and population zzso data from zzso zzso I show that zzso in both species evolve 3 times more rapidly even than selectively zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso seen in multiple zzso populations suggest that rapid zzso evolution does not result from the repeated selective sweeps expected under zzso zzso I further show that there is little evidence for zzso or gene conversion within zzso although there is clear evidence for zzso in their immediate zzso Finally I show that the zzso spectrum at zzso is consistent with the pattern of spontaneous zzso elsewhere in the zzso 

These results indicate that rapid zzso evolution is a common phenomenon in zzso zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that rapid zzso evolution does not result from the zzso effect of gene conversion, but from a zzso increase in the zzso rate, perhaps arising from the unusual zzso structure at zzso in zzso and other zzso
