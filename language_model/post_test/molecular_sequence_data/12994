zzso zzso strains grown under iron zzso conditions produce zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso which have been shown to play a major role in iron zzso Recent studies performed with zzso zzso from zzso zzso suggest that this surface protein is a potential vaccine zzso In order to further evaluate the zzso of zzso it was essential to develop a zzso expression system to generate high amounts of zzso zzso zzso is produced in zzso as a precursor with a signal zzso whose zzso follows a zzso step on a zzso zzso which is the first zzso acid in the mature zzso When produced in zzso coli with its natural signal zzso a high amount of zzso (about zzso of total cell zzso was zzso However, most of the protein was zzso precursor and only a small fraction was mature zzso In order to zzso the maturation of the zzso the natural signal sequence was replaced by several zzso coli zzso signal zzso zzso levels and maturation of the precursor were highly variable depending on the signal zzso zzso With one of these, an efficient maturation and a high amount of mature zzso zzso were obtained (about zzso of total cell zzso A large-scale production process was then established for this zzso zzso zzso
