By searching the expressed sequence tag zzso data base, we identified partial zzso sequences zzso a novel human zzso zzso We determined the complete zzso sequence that encodes a highly basic zzso of a total 98 zzso acids with 20 to zzso identity to other human zzso zzso We termed this novel zzso from zzso zzso as zzso (see zzso The zzso zzso was most strongly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed as a fusion protein with the Flag tag zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso protein fused with the zzso form of alkaline zzso zzso was zzso By zzso expressing five zzso zzso receptors zzso to 5) and five orphan zzso zzso was found to bind specifically to an orphan zzso zzso Only zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso normal T cell expressed and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso zzso transient calcium zzso and zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso at high zzso By zzso hybrid and radiation hybrid zzso the gene for zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso where the genes for zzso zzso are zzso Taken together, zzso is a highly specific zzso for zzso which is known to be expressed in activated B and T zzso and strongly zzso in B cells infected with zzso virus and T cells infected with zzso 6 or zzso zzso and zzso may thus play roles in migration and zzso of normal zzso as well as in zzso of zzso infected with these zzso We propose zzso to be designated as zzso
