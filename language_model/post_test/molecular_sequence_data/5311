Three nonsense zzso and an unusual initiation zzso were located within the putative coding region of the zzso gene of zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso prepared from transcripts revealed extensive zzso zzso The unusual initiation zzso zzso was changed to zzso and three nonsense zzso were converted into sense zzso In total 15 C zzso of the zzso DNA were replaced by U zzso in the zzso zzso while 14 U zzso were replaced by C zzso This is the highest number of editing events for a zzso zzso reported so zzso zzso editing was also shown in a zzso clone where 23 sites were edited but six sites remained zzso representing the existence of premature zzso The expected two-dimensional structure of the zzso shows the existence of a sequence complementary to every editing site, which can produce continuous base pairing longer than 5 zzso suggesting that zzso in the double strand is the site zzso for zzso editing in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with other zzso genes suggests that the mechanism arose in the first land plants and has been reduced during zzso
