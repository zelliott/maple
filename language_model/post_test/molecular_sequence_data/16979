zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are expressed in many different cell types where they perform a variety of functions including cell volume regulation, zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso channels are thought to be regulated by zzso however, whether zzso act directly on the channel is zzso Using zzso channels zzso expressed in zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso channels are zzso inhibited zzso by the zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso zzso of zzso channel current by zzso is abolished by zzso of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the putative zzso region of the zzso Evidence for direct zzso of the zzso channel by zzso was further demonstrated using zzso fusion zzso The major site of zzso was found to be zzso zzso however, other zzso were also zzso We conclude that zzso channels can be directly regulated by the zzso zzso zzso The mechanism appears to involve direct zzso by zzso of a zzso locus in the zzso region of the channel, the site at which zzso is thought to zzso zzso of zzso channels by protein zzso may be an important mechanism regulating cell zzso
