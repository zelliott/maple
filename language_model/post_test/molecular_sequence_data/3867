Open reading frame zzso which is located immediately upstream of the zzso zzso gene zzso was genetically and zzso demonstrated to code for a second zzso zzso zzso of photosynthesis gene expression in zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso has its own promoter but that a significant proportion of zzso expression is promoted by zzso zzso of zzso zzso transcripts through zzso zzso of zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso during zzso growth to a level similar to that of disruption of zzso Like that reported for zzso zzso zzso of reporter gene expression indicated that disruption of zzso resulted in a two- to zzso increase in zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso However, unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and does not zzso repress zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analysis with zzso zzso indicates that zzso does not bind to a zzso promoter probe but does bind to the zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso protein that targets genes partially overlapping a subset of genes that are also controlled by zzso We also provide evidence for cooperative binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter zzso
