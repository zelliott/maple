The zzso of zzso by zzso D zzso results in the production of zzso acid and zzso An zzso that uses an zzso zzso was developed to measure this activity in zzso and zzso preparations from zzso zzso A zzso factor markedly enhanced zzso activity in zzso and was essential for zzso gamma zzso stimulation of an enriched preparation of zzso The factor was zzso to zzso from bovine brain zzso and identified as a member of the zzso Factor zzso zzso of small G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be a better zzso of zzso activity than was the zzso zzso zzso proteins have been implicated recently as factors for regulation of zzso zzso zzso The current finding suggests that zzso activity plays a prominent role in the action of zzso and that zzso may be a key component in the generation of second zzso via zzso zzso
