The zzso zzso is essential for zzso DNA inversion of the type IV zzso DNA segment in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows significant zzso with the zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso but, surprisingly, zzso contains none of the zzso zzso acid motifs of the zzso zzso or zzso families of zzso zzso zzso zzso may mediate zzso zzso by a novel zzso To begin to determine how zzso may assemble a synaptic zzso structure for DNA zzso and strand exchange, we have characterized the interaction of zzso with the DNA inversion region of zzso zzso zzso shift and zzso protection zzso competition and zzso rate zzso and zzso studies indicate that zzso binds two distinct recognition zzso One recognition zzso found at multiple sites within and outside of the zzso segment, is bound by zzso zzso with high zzso The second recognition sequence is located at the zzso zzso sites at the ends of the zzso zzso zzso interacts with this sequence as an zzso with apparent low zzso A model is proposed for the role of the different zzso binding sites of the zzso zzso inversion region in the formation of an active zzso
