zzso diseases are associated with profound zzso zzso which is affected strongly by genetic zzso The zzso machinery could be one such zzso system, through a mechanism involving zzso motifs and their interaction with a complex repertoire of zzso zzso zzso in zzso motifs and changes in levels of zzso factors can result in different zzso zzso Changes in the level of normal transcripts or in the relative pattern of different zzso zzso affect disease zzso leading to zzso zzso Here, we discuss the zzso machinery in terms of its significance in disease severity and its potential role as a genetic zzso
