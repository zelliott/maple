The zzso sequence of the zzso strain of human zzso virus type 3 zzso was determined from a series of 14 overlapping zzso clones and was compared to that of the previously zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso Overall, there were 630 zzso zzso differences between the two zzso zzso zzso comprised the zzso zzso in contrast to zzso which constituted the zzso of the zzso zzso This was accounted for by a single zzso deletion in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso Four zzso zzso were found in the leader region at the 3' end of the viral zzso at positions 24, 28, 42 and 45, whereas no differences were found in the 44 base trailer zzso All of the zzso start and stop signals and zzso sequences were zzso between the two viruses with the exception of the zzso stop signal of the zzso zzso gene where there was a zzso zzso between bases 7 and zzso A comparison of all of the zzso differences in the 3' and zzso zzso regions of each gene showed a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The 3' zzso regions of the zzso zzso and M genes were completely zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso gene in which zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso regions of each gene and ranged from zzso for the zzso zzso zzso gene to zzso for the M zzso An analysis of the zzso acid differences in each open reading frame revealed that of all the zzso the coding region of the M gene was the most highly zzso zzso zzso acid zzso while the zzso zzso gene was the most variable zzso zzso acid zzso As these two viruses are wild type zzso these differences in zzso and zzso acid sequence are compatible with efficient replication in zzso
