Most zzso zzso zzso are zzso with zzso formed between zzso surfaces, in the central channel, and by zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso interactions reveals an important cohesive role for the zzso This is reflected in the crystal structure of zzso zzso displaying a zzso organization in zzso grown in alcohol solution, where only zzso swapping interactions between zzso are retained from the usual zzso zzso zzso of a suggested hinge zzso destabilize human and zzso coli zzso without preventing zzso zzso zzso formation was, however, prevented in the human zzso by zzso the zzso before the swapping zzso The molecular shape of full-length zzso in solution reveals the zzso and variation in flexibility of zzso and zzso zzso
