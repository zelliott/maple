zzso persists concerning the origin of insulin in the central nervous zzso While there has been convincing evidence in zzso to demonstrate the presence of zzso insulin zzso conventional zzso have failed to detect the same in whole brain zzso Here we employed zzso and sensitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso in attempts to detect insulin I and II zzso in rat brains obtained from different zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not detect insulin I or insulin II transcripts in fetal (13 to 21 day zzso or adult zzso zzso while detecting low amounts of insulin I transcripts in other zzso zzso such as the rat zzso zzso and fetal liver previously shown to express insulin II, failed to detect insulin I in brain at any age zzso zzso II zzso was detected by zzso in zzso zzso and adult rat zzso just as in zzso zzso fetal and adult zzso We conclude that while the duplicated insulin I gene is not zzso the ancestral insulin II gene is expressed in zzso zzso and adult rat zzso Our observations support the concept of de zzso brain insulin II synthesis beyond the zzso stage of embryonic zzso
