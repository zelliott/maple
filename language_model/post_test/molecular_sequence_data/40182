The Aurora zzso a family of zzso regulators, have received much attention as potential targets for novel zzso zzso Several Aurora zzso zzso have been described including zzso which prevents zzso zzso zzso checkpoint function and zzso zzso zzso cells exit zzso without dividing and lose zzso Because zzso zzso both Aurora A and B, we set out to determine which zzso are due to zzso of which zzso Using molecular genetic approaches, we show that zzso of Aurora B zzso activity zzso zzso Furthermore, a novel zzso compound, which is 100 times more selective for Aurora B over Aurora A in zzso zzso identical zzso zzso zzso of Aurora B zzso activity zzso a zzso zzso zzso indicating that Aurora B is an attractive zzso drug zzso Using molecular genetic and zzso approaches, we also probe the role of Aurora A zzso zzso We show that simultaneous repression of Aurora A plus induction of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso another novel zzso zzso which is 20 times as potent against Aurora A compared with zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of a drug-resistant Aurora A zzso reverts this zzso demonstrating that Aurora A zzso activity is required for zzso zzso in human zzso Because small zzso zzso of Aurora A and Aurora B yields distinct zzso our observations indicate that the zzso may present two avenues for zzso drug zzso
