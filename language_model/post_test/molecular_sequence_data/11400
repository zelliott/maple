zzso gel zzso was used to study the expression of zzso proteins in adherent cells of human T zzso cell line, zzso The adherent cells grown in zzso on a culture plate decreased the amount of proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of 17,000 and zzso zzso The proteins were identified to be zzso for the zzso protein and zzso for the 17,000 protein by zzso their zzso zzso The amount of proteins was increased in zzso cells grown in floating mass to a comparable level of zzso cells which grew in floating mass throughout the zzso The adherent cells decreased their growth rate as compared with the cells in the floating zzso These results suggest that the zzso of human T zzso cells zzso their zzso and proliferation via a zzso decrease in the amount of zzso and zzso
