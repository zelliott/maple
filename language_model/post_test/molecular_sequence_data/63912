To detect the expression of zzso X gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso tract zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso and to analyzed the relationship between zzso infection and zzso of zzso tract zzso thereby to zzso the possible role of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso by appropriate restriction zzso zzso zzso was obtained through gel extraction zzso The zzso DNA zzso for zzso zzso were prepared by a random prime zzso The expression of zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso specimens from 71 cases of zzso tract zzso and 39 specimens of zzso zzso adjacent to cancer by in zzso zzso The correlations between zzso zzso expression and zzso parameters were statistically zzso in 71 cases of zzso duct zzso 

zzso of 71 zzso specimens had zzso zzso zzso expression with a positive rate being zzso Only 7 of 39 specimens of zzso zzso adjacent to cancer had weak zzso zzso zzso with a positive rate being zzso and all these positive signals were found in the zzso zzso zzso No significant correlation was found between zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso but a strong positive correlation was found between zzso zzso and protein zzso 

There is a high frequency of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso tract zzso zzso infection and its gene integration might play a role to certain extent in the development of zzso tract zzso
