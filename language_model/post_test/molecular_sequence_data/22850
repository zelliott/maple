Although central to much biological research, the identification of species is often zzso The use of DNA zzso short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the zzso has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and zzso However, the effectiveness of DNA zzso for identifying specimens in zzso tropical zzso is zzso Here we show that zzso c zzso I DNA zzso effectively discriminate among species in three zzso families from Area de zzso zzso in northwestern Costa zzso We found that zzso of the 521 species recognized by prior zzso work possess distinctive zzso c zzso I zzso and that the few instances of zzso sequence overlap involve very similar zzso We also found two or more zzso clusters within each of 13 supposedly single zzso zzso between these clusters and zzso and/or ecological traits indicates overlooked species zzso If these results are general, DNA zzso will significantly aid species identification and discovery in tropical zzso
