A zzso zzso zzso for human zzso zzso 8 is described which encompasses the entire coding sequence as well as 33 and 250 base pairs of zzso and zzso region, zzso The level of zzso 8 zzso in various fetal zzso and zzso of different zzso ages was determined as were the effects of zzso on zzso 8 zzso in primary cultures of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso was abundant in fetal small zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, and zzso zzso of zzso 8 zzso in zzso increased slightly during zzso zzso suppressed zzso 8 zzso in primary cultures of zzso whereas the zzso analog increased zzso levels in zzso cells, revealing differential regulation of this zzso in normal and transformed zzso zzso
