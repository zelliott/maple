A structural model of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been built based upon zzso analysis, sequence zzso zzso zzso and energy zzso The model has a single zzso zzso and a zzso domain folded around zzso attached zzso zzso Physical zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso have been made to test aspects of the zzso zzso at either 280 or 295 zzso yields zzso with an zzso maximum at 334 zzso and a quantum yield of zzso relative to zzso The model places one zzso zzso of the two zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso domain and the second zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso ring of zzso is within 5 A of the zzso zzso and is expected to be highly zzso via resonance energy transfer to the zzso In contrast, zzso is at the start of the putative zzso zzso and could be located a considerable distance from the zzso zzso theory assigns a distance of 42 A from zzso to the zzso This distance is important in adjusting the relative positions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the ultraviolet region indicate increased zzso content of zzso zzso zzso c compared to zzso zzso c in support of an zzso zzso zzso The zzso strength dependence of zzso zzso for zzso zzso indicates an overall negative charge that is consistent with a calculated zzso of zzso However, the charge distribution specified by the model indicates a surface for electron exchange that is different from the classical front face used by zzso zzso zzso
