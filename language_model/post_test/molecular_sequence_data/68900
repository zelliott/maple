The Y zzso located gene zzso zzso determining region Y zzso was identified in the search for the zzso zzso determining factor zzso zzso for evaluating zzso as a candidate for zzso included the finding of zzso in zzso in the zzso of patients with failed zzso development zzso females or zzso zzso zzso and the production of female to male sex reversed mice transgenic for the mouse zzso of zzso zzso Since the initial use of zzso females in the proof of zzso identity, many more patients have been zzso using different techniques and more zzso zzso A total of 11 zzso in zzso have now been zzso all in the zzso zzso region of the zzso and all in patients with apparently complete zzso zzso Surprisingly, three familial zzso zzso have been identified, where the zzso is either fertile male or sterile zzso zzso Estimates of the proportion of zzso females zzso for zzso average at approximately zzso zzso for the low frequency of zzso zzso in zzso sex reversal could be the presence of zzso in regions of zzso not yet discovered, the occurrence of zzso that give the same zzso perhaps in genes close to zzso in the zzso determining pathway, or incorrect diagnosis of complete zzso zzso
