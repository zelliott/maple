Acute respiratory failure is a common complication in patients with zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso To zzso the role of zzso abnormalities in acute lung injury in zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on the pulmonary vascular injury in rat induced by zzso zzso When administered zzso zzso (5 zzso body zzso significantly increased the zzso of zzso zzso in lung 30 zzso after zzso zzso the pulmonary vascular zzso and the serum level of zzso and zzso degradation products zzso zzso zzso increased and remained elevated for several zzso Neither zzso alone, zzso plus zzso III, or zzso zzso factor zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso generation, prevented zzso vascular injury 6 hours after zzso administration, whereas these substances significantly inhibited the increase in serum zzso zzso at that zzso zzso pulmonary vascular injury was significantly attenuated in rats with zzso zzso or treated with zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso although zzso did not inhibit the zzso increase in serum zzso zzso Thus, activated zzso play a more important role than zzso abnormalities in the zzso of zzso pulmonary vascular injury in an experimental rat model of zzso
