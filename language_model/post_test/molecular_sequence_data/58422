The zzso protein from zzso zzso is a 77 zzso zzso zzso protein that belongs to the family of zzso receptors and may have potential as a vaccine zzso zzso between the zzso gene from three different zzso strains and a published zzso one revealed that the region from zzso 350 to 390 displays pronounced sequence zzso In a model for the zzso of zzso in the outer zzso this region zzso to loop 7, the longest of the predicted 13 zzso zzso zzso of four out of a total of eight zzso zzso zzso to synthetic peptides corresponding to loop 7 showed that their zzso are located zzso The zzso genes from five additional zzso strains were cloned and zzso in this zzso zzso comparisons showed different degrees of zzso
