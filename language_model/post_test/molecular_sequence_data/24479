zzso of zzso box genes has previously been localized to the infected cells of alfalfa zzso zzso root zzso These genes represent the first putative zzso factors to be identified in zzso and are hypothesized to be involved in a signal zzso zzso initiated by the zzso zzso The eventual zzso of specific target genes defines pertinent characteristics of this zzso differentiated zzso In this study, we identify a third zzso zzso box zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso activity of its protein product is dependent on the presence of a second zzso box zzso zzso Despite previous results to the contrary, both genes are expressed in the early stages of flower development, further strengthening the premise that zzso zzso programming may capitalize upon existing zzso zzso
