zzso zzso interaction analysis zzso has been applied to triplex formation between zzso zzso zzso were zzso on the zzso surface of a zzso chip and subsequently zzso to their complementary zzso zzso triplex formation was observed when a suitable zzso zzso was injected over the zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso on the chip surface was able to capture a DNA duplex by triplex zzso The presence of zzso increases the rate of association between the third strand and zzso duplex, but at elevated zzso zzso zzso association is zzso A preliminary kinetic analysis of triplex formation at pH zzso by an zzso third strand containing zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso for the association and zzso rate zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
