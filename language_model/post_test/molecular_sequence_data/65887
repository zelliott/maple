To express and purify the extra cellular full-length human zzso zzso 

The zzso gene zzso was amplified from the human liver zzso library by zzso The resulting product was cloned into zzso zzso and zzso Then the confirmed zzso zzso was cloned into zzso zzso zzso and then transformed into zzso zzso where it was induced to express protein by zzso 

The zzso gene was cloned by zzso and a zzso zzso DNA zzso was shown on the zzso zzso The cloned gene was zzso and demonstrated to have the same sequence as that of human zzso gene in zzso Then zzso zzso gene zzso was induced by zzso and a 24 zzso zzso zzso protein was tested on zzso 

Human zzso gene is successfully cloned and its zzso proteins are zzso
