Studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso differentiation are frequently performed using cell lines established from zzso In this study we have used mouse zzso zzso cells that undergo zzso differentiation in response to zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso activities decline and zzso of the zzso gene product zzso is lost, leading to the appearance of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The loss of zzso activity is due to a decrease in zzso abundance whereas loss of zzso activity is caused by strong association with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and concurrent loss of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso differentiation can be induced by zzso of zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso activity leading to loss of zzso zzso is the major zzso for zzso zzso
