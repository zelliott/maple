zzso and zzso liver zzso and zzso are characterized by the massive zzso of zzso droplets zzso in the zzso of zzso Although zzso are ubiquitous and dynamic zzso found in the cells of a wide range of organisms, little is known about the mechanisms and sites of zzso zzso To examine the participation of these zzso in the zzso disorders of zzso zzso we used a combination of mass zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of flight and zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis to study the composition of zzso zzso from rat liver after a partial zzso Fifty proteins were zzso zzso zzso protein was the most abundant, but other proteins such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso In addition, we identified protein associated with zzso droplets I zzso zzso named Associated with zzso protein 1), a novel protein widely expressed in liver and kidney corresponding to the product of zzso zzso Our results show that, upon zzso loading of the cells, zzso zzso from the zzso zzso into nascent zzso and indicate that zzso may be targeted to the initial zzso deposits that eventually form these zzso Moreover, we used zzso expression studies to view other processes related to these zzso such as zzso zzso and to analyze zzso zzso In conclusion, here we report the composition of zzso zzso and describe a novel bona fide zzso protein that may provide new insights into the mechanisms and sites of zzso zzso
