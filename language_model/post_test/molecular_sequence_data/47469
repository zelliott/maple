In an attempt to identify the target gene of specific zzso involving zzso band zzso in benign zzso zzso tumors, we have used two cell lines derived from benign zzso tumors showing zzso with zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso mapping studies with zzso and zzso clones located in a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso 19 abnormalities mapped within a zzso segment covered by a single zzso zzso zzso of part of this zzso clone allowed us to establish the zzso sequence and the zzso structure of a candidate gene located in close vicinity to the zzso The gene that we tentatively refer to as zzso zzso in zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zinc finger protein coding zzso From our results we have concluded that in the two cell lines investigated the breaks have occurred either within the zzso untranslated region of zzso or in its close zzso zzso By Northern zzso analyses two transcripts of about zzso zzso and 5 zzso were detected in normal zzso tissue as well as in other normal zzso zzso An additional zzso transcript was found only in zzso zzso In contrast to all normal zzso both cell lines with zzso aberrations expressed larger transcripts of approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso From the close vicinity to the zzso region, the expression patterns of the zzso and its type, we consider zzso a strong candidate target gene of the specific zzso aberrations in benign zzso zzso
