The protein products of two zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso display a remarkable sequence zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso zzso by gene zzso The gene zzso coding for one of these proteins was cloned in an zzso expression zzso downstream of a zzso The resulting zzso protein zzso was expressed at high level and zzso to zzso by metal affinity zzso on zzso followed by zzso zzso on zzso The zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso in zzso in zzso transcripts of several zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the known zzso zzso zzso zzso of broad zzso no other zzso in zzso molecules are modified by the cloned zzso zzso zzso The disruption of the corresponding gene zzso in zzso which has no significant effect on the growth of zzso cells, leads to the complete disappearance of the zzso formation activity in a zzso zzso These results allow the formal identification of the protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso as the only zzso responsible for the formation of zzso which is almost universally zzso in zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso zzso protein was shown to be similar to that of the native protein present in zzso cell zzso Chemical mapping of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso strain carrying the disrupted gene reveals that the same gene product is responsible for zzso formation in zzso of both cellular zzso
