zzso bacteria from the zzso zzso drive oil degradation in the largest environment on zzso the cold and deep zzso Here we report the zzso sequence of zzso zzso and show that compared with zzso zzso paradigm of zzso zzso zzso zzso has a larger zzso that has witnessed massive zzso zzso We identify an array of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also show that at low temperatures, the main zzso machine zzso functions as a single zzso barrel that uses larger proteins as zzso compared with the classical zzso structure observed at higher zzso With 11 protein crystal structures, we further report the largest set of structures from one zzso zzso The most common structural feature is an increased content of zzso zzso charged zzso compared to their zzso zzso Our findings are relevant in the context of microbial zzso mechanisms and the development of strategies for zzso zzso in cold zzso
