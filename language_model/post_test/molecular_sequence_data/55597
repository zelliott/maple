zzso is a rare, zzso zzso zzso storage disease, resulting from a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is zzso clinically by progressive mental and motor zzso growth zzso coarse zzso and often zzso infections, but the course of the disease is zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso has been mapped to the short arm of zzso 1 at position zzso and has been called zzso Two zzso causing disease have been described zzso a zzso change in zzso 8 giving rise to a zzso in frame zzso stop zzso and a deletion of at least two zzso from the 3' end of the zzso In this paper we present evidence that a zzso zzso transition in the first position of the zzso zzso site of zzso 5 of zzso is the disease causing zzso in a 9 year old child of zzso related zzso A new zzso pattern was detected in the patient by Southern zzso of zzso DNA using zzso restriction and a zzso zzso zzso The patient was zzso for this zzso Three zzso with zzso activity below the normal reference range and both parents were zzso This pattern was not detected in 26 other zzso patients and has not been found in any zzso The zzso was zzso by a combination of restriction mapping using different zzso zzso single stranded zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso regions amplified by the zzso chain reaction, and by direct sequencing of the amplified zzso A view of the nature of the zzso its zzso with the disease zzso and its absence in controls, it is probable that the zzso zzso site zzso causes zzso in this zzso
