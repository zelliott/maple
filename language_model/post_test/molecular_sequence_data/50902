To identify zzso peptides containing zzso class I binding regions, different studies have been zzso These include the detection of interactions between zzso peptides and zzso zzso molecules in zzso zzso the measurement of zzso zzso assembly in the presence of zzso added to cell zzso and the detection of zzso of zzso zzso by competition between peptides on target zzso To date, the zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso are from the zzso zzso zzso and Pol proteins and they are identified using synthetic peptides of 12 to 20 zzso zzso The search for a correlation between known zzso zzso zzso and the results of zzso interaction zzso reveals that: zzso most of the peptides that are positive in the assembly zzso contain a zzso zzso motif but the correlation between these positive peptides and the zzso zzso is not zzso zzso a high proportion of zzso zzso are included in the peptides positive in zzso binding and in zzso of zzso zzso although these tests do not allow us to predict zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso motif is not systematically included in zzso zzso zzso this observation raising the possibility that other sequences are involved in zzso zzso
