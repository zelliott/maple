Cell lines that no longer require zzso zzso 3 zzso for growth were isolated from an zzso cell line that possesses characteristics of early zzso zzso Unlike the parental cells zzso these zzso transformed lines zzso zzso zzso zzso were rearranged at the zzso locus and formed tumors upon injection into zzso zzso The zzso and zzso expression resulted from the zzso of an zzso A particle zzso zzso into the 3' untranslated region of the zzso zzso This region contained zzso sequence motifs that have been associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts from the zzso transformed cell lines had a longer zzso than similar transcripts isolated from either zzso zzso T cells or the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso rate of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso gene expression by zzso zzso stability, and this mechanism can contribute to the zzso transformation of the zzso zzso
