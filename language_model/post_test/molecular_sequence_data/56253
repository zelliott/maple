zzso DNA sequences have been instrumental in the development of DNA zzso for many different zzso Isolation of such DNA zzso has generally been accomplished by differential screening of zzso libraries with total zzso DNA zzso In the current work, a rational design strategy is presented for the development of zzso zzso based upon repeated sequence zzso A repeated sequence family present in the zzso of zzso zzso designated zzso has been amplified from various samples of zzso DNA using zzso DNA sequence analysis of the resulting zzso products demonstrated that the sequences may be arranged into clusters within which the individual sequences are identical or nearly zzso zzso among the cluster consensus sequences have been exploited to explain the zzso of previously isolated zzso based zzso and to develop two new zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso specifically to zzso zzso zzso zzso products, while the second zzso specifically to zzso zzso products from the closely related bovine zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso have been used to characterize zzso zzso larvae isolated from wild caught infected flies in West zzso Because repeated sequence families are a common feature of most zzso including those of zzso this method should be zzso to the rational design of zzso zzso for other zzso zzso
