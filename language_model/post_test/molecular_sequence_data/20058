zzso zzso zzso 2 is required for zzso synthesis in activated zzso zzso in the zzso gene may account for the large zzso zzso in baseline zzso activity, zzso efficacy and side effects in transplant recipients receiving zzso zzso zzso the objective of this study was to identify and functionally characterize zzso zzso 

DNA samples from 152 solid organ transplant patients were screened at zzso and zzso junctions of the zzso genes by zzso amplification followed by zzso direct DNA zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso and transformed to an zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso coli zzso zzso were zzso to zzso and the zzso activity was measured by reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Nine genetic zzso were identified in the zzso zzso with zzso of the rarer zzso ranging from zzso to zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was identified, and the kinetic zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso was decreased to zzso of the zzso The Ki for zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso was comparable with the zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not change zzso 

zzso has low genetic diversity, but the zzso zzso zzso has a significant impact on zzso zzso zzso zzso This novel functional zzso may be one of the factors contributing to the zzso difference of baseline zzso zzso zzso activity as well as drug efficacy and adverse events in transplant zzso
