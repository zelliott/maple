zzso is a zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso 5 in the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso Random zzso experiments have suggested that zzso is essential zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (in zzso To investigate the requirement for zzso at this position, we constructed and studied the properties of a set of ten position 78 zzso zzso All of these zzso have decreased zzso activities and are expressed at significantly lower levels than wild zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso proteins are rapidly zzso in the zzso the zzso examined had zzso of zzso zzso whereas the zzso protein has a zzso of greater than 10 zzso The rapid degradation of position 78 zzso is not suppressed by zzso that affect known zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso could be zzso in a zzso strain and was zzso This zzso has full DNA binding activity in zzso suggesting that its folded structure and ability to form active zzso are similar to those of wild zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 degrees zzso is less zzso stable than wild type zzso zzso 55 degrees zzso zzso studies show that this instability contributes to but is not the main cause of its rapid zzso degradation and also suggest that zzso proceeds from the zzso forms of proteins containing the zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not appear to introduce a new zzso site for cellular zzso nor does the zzso enhance zzso to zzso such as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
