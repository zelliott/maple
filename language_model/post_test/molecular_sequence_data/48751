zzso zzso zzso zzso has two major zzso zzso and zzso which may alternate among zzso zzso The zzso gene is responsible for the conversion between the two zzso In this study, we surveyed the sequence zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso strains in China over a zzso zzso period in which zzso shifts occurred among epidemic zzso 

Various zzso events including single zzso short zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso introducing an intact zzso could overcome the zzso by converting the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso suggesting the effects of these zzso on the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso were recognized in the zzso strains among zzso zzso dominant epidemic years which were separate from the zzso dominant zzso Three distinguishable zzso sites in zzso between the classical and the El zzso zzso strains were identified and could serve as zzso zzso 

Our results provide a comprehensive picture of the zzso gene zzso among the zzso zzso zzso strains in different epidemic zzso which could be further used as the tracing markers in zzso analysis and dissemination surveillance of the epidemic zzso
