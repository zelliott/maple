zzso cell nuclear factor zzso zzso is an orphan member of the nuclear zzso zzso and functions as a zzso of gene zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso mouse zzso and is required for normal mouse embryonic zzso In adult mice, zzso transcripts are predominantly expressed in zzso cells and growing zzso of the zzso To extend this observation to the protein level, we generated and characterized a specific zzso against zzso Using this zzso we found that zzso protein was exclusively present in zzso zzso cells of the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso protein was present in the zzso of zzso from primary to zzso zzso zzso protein was also present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso protein in adult mouse zzso indicates that zzso may play a role during zzso Our results also show that zzso in early zzso is a maternal protein and could be involved in the regulation of zzso gene expression and zzso embryonic zzso
