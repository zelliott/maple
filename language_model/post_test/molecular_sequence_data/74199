Twenty-five zzso strains capable of producing zzso acid zzso were isolated from fermented locust bean products manufactured in the zzso area of zzso To clarify the zzso of these zzso zzso zzso analyses based on sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso genes were zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso indicated that ten zzso were clustered in the same group of zzso zzso Another ten zzso were located in the cluster of zzso zzso and the remaining zzso were identified as zzso zzso (three zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trees based on the partial sequences of zzso and zzso genes were similar to the zzso based on zzso zzso zzso Thirty-four strains in 27 species belonging to the zzso zzso and its neighbors were also investigated for PGA zzso It was found that PGA was produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Except for zzso zzso the above zzso species are very closely related in zzso indicating that zzso zzso strains constitute a zzso
