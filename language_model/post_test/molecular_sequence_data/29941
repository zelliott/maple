This report describes a model for the structure of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso gene zzso sequences were determined for zzso strains of the three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso 1 proteins were then compared in order to identify zzso features of these zzso zzso regions in the zzso two-thirds of zzso 1 sequence share characteristics with the zzso zzso of other cellular and viral zzso Most of the zzso one-third of zzso 1 sequence is predicted to form an zzso coiled zzso like that of zzso The middle one-third of zzso 1 sequence appears more zzso it is predicted to form a large region of zzso that is followed by a region which contains two short zzso coiled coils separated by a smaller region of zzso The two zzso regions are each proposed to form a zzso sandwich like that suggested for the rod domain of the zzso fiber protein zzso zzso Green, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Russell, zzso zzso Martin, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The remaining zzso one-third of zzso 1 sequence is predicted to form a structurally complex zzso zzso A model is suggested in which the discrete regions of zzso 1 sequence are ascribed to zzso regions seen in zzso electron zzso images of the protein zzso zzso zzso Fraser, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fields, and zzso zzso Steven, zzso zzso zzso zzso
