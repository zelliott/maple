zzso play important roles in the zzso development of the zzso system in zzso but their function in adult zzso zzso has not been zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso expression of nuclear zzso receptors was examined in adult zzso Several zzso acid zzso zzso were identified in zzso zzso from adult zzso mice by zzso and DNA sequence analysis, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, a previously unidentified mouse zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso in zzso 7 was zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso preparations are active in the zzso of zzso acids from zzso and zzso These results indicate that components of the zzso signal zzso system are expressed in adult zzso zzso and may play important roles in gene regulation in this unique tissue where zzso zzso cells are continuously zzso
