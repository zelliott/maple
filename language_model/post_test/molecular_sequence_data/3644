We have used zzso chain reaction zzso and DNA sequencing techniques to confirm the zzso of seven (six alpha and one zzso novel candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes identified in the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso they most closely resemble the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences of the new zzso zzso with those described previously in zzso zzso reveals five zzso (four alpha and one zzso which resemble the zzso group of zzso To date, this highly divergent zzso zzso group is unique to zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso member of the zzso group of zzso to be zzso Two new members of the related zzso zzso group of zzso have also been shown to be zzso making the zzso zzso group the largest in zzso zzso zzso in the alpha zzso second zzso region zzso which contribute to the channel lining show variations with implications for channel zzso For example, in zzso the highly zzso zzso zzso of zzso is replaced by zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations have been used to generate molecular models of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the novel zzso enabling identification and display of zzso and protein interface zzso The number and diversity of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the identification of related zzso zzso only found in zzso zzso to date, suggest that at least some of these zzso may contribute to zzso in zzso
