zzso bacteria zzso and zzso toxic low molecular weight compounds as zzso zzso These microbial toxins play essential roles in the zzso of bacteria in various zzso and are emerging as targets for zzso zzso zzso a zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso has been known to be the key factor in rice grain rot and zzso in many field zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso was identified from zzso zzso zzso thereby providing a possible zzso strategy for zzso plant zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso in the zzso form and in complex with zzso along with the results of a functional zzso The overall structure of zzso is similar to those of the zzso oxygen zzso zzso of zzso despite the lack of apparent sequence zzso The active site is located at the end of the zzso channel, 9 zzso in zzso and contains a zzso zzso interacting with one zzso zzso two zzso zzso and three water molecules in an zzso zzso In the complex, zzso binds in the zzso active site, specifically the zzso shell by replacing a zzso water zzso A functional analysis indicated that zzso zzso the degradation of zzso in a manner dependent on zzso zzso and the reducing agent zzso These results provide the structural features of zzso and the early events in zzso
