The zzso from bacterial zzso P zzso P zzso specifically recognizes the zzso stacked T zzso and the zzso stem of a zzso zzso This recognition is zzso primarily through zzso zzso At least four zzso groups in the T zzso region have been implicated as direct contacts with zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 92, zzso zzso of six single zzso zzso zzso zzso and two base zzso of the zzso zzso interaction in zzso on zzso binding zzso and the chemical step of the reaction zzso have been determined using a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Our results show that at least five functional groups in the T zzso of zzso directly participate in P zzso zzso They include the zzso groups of zzso 54, 56, 61, and 62 and possibly the zzso group of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso 54, 61, and 62 are positioned within the same minor groove due to stacking of the reverse zzso zzso pair on the zzso zzso pair in the T zzso This groove is extended to the zzso group of zzso through the zzso structure of zzso We use the term zzso zzso to describe alignment of functional groups through zzso folding of an zzso The binding also includes the zzso of zzso zzso which is not located in this zzso zzso Assuming zzso these five interactions can contribute zzso zzso or zzso in binding but only zzso zzso or approximately zzso in chemistry at 37 degrees zzso The P zzso binding site for the T zzso includes at least the previously identified zzso as well as the zzso in zzso zzso P zzso The zzso and zzso data from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso P zzso suggest that zzso may be zzso to zzso 56 in zzso These results show how the highly structured T zzso region in a zzso zzso is bound by the zzso zzso P zzso This is among the first examples of how a zzso zzso structure can be recognized by another zzso through zzso zzso
