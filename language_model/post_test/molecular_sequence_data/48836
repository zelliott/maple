A zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from marine sand in a zzso on the western coast of South zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 25 zzso at pH zzso and in the absence of zzso zzso trees based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso fell within the zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso forming a coherent cluster with the type strain of zzso zzso with which it exhibited the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity value of zzso zzso zzso of sequence similarity to the type strains of the other species of the zzso zzso and the other species used in the zzso analysis were zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : 0 zzso zzso : 0 and zzso : 0 zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids were zzso and one unidentified zzso zzso were zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso and the mean zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was 13 zzso zzso zzso properties, together with zzso and genetic zzso revealed that strain zzso is separate from other species of the zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
