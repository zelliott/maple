zzso plays a critical role in the development of zzso immune responses and in the zzso of inflammatory and zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso production in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso production by studying the role of the zzso protein zzso zzso and the key zzso factors involved in human zzso production in zzso zzso zzso A role for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso regulation in a zzso zzso cell line was demonstrated by using specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso factors regulating zzso gene transcription, extensive deletion analyses of the zzso promoter was zzso The results revealed the involvement of a sequence encompassing the zzso site, in addition to that of zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso was confirmed by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Studies conducted to understand the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso gene zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso factors as revealed by zzso reporter and gel mobility shift zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso may inhibit zzso production in zzso human zzso cells by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
