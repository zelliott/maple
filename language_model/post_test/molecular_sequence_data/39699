Marine zzso zzso enriched for zzso zzso zzso communities utilizing zzso and zzso were used to provide the first comparison between zzso probing zzso of zzso fatty acids zzso and DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at low zzso zzso zzso were used over a zzso incubation to follow and identify carbon flow into different members of the zzso Limited changes in total zzso and bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso profiles over 7 days suggested the presence of a stable bacterial zzso A broad range of zzso were rapidly zzso zzso 12 zzso in the zzso slurry but this changed with time, suggesting the presence of an active zzso population and later development of another population able to zzso zzso zzso The identity of the major zzso was unclear as zzso zzso were common zzso zzso zzso highest zzso and there was little difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso Seemingly zzso a readily zzso zzso resulted in widespread incorporation consistent with the higher extent of zzso zzso 10 zzso into zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso were similar to each other and to those that developed in the zzso slurry after 4 zzso These were more zzso with zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso possibly indicating the presence of zzso or zzso zzso bacteria zzso and sequences related to these zzso were in the zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene library also contained sequences closely related to zzso but these were the zzso zzso zzso as well as a broad range of zzso zzso In contrast, analysis of zzso bands from zzso demonstrated that the candidate division zzso and zzso were actively assimilating zzso zzso zzso gel zzso also confirmed the presence of zzso in the zzso from the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso originally found in deep subsurface zzso is more widely distributed in marine sediments and provides the first indication of its zzso incorporation of zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso can be used together in a zzso system, with low zzso of zzso and overlapping incubation times (up to 7 zzso to provide zzso although not zzso information on carbon flow and the identity of active members of an zzso zzso zzso
