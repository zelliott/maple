zzso zzso zzso channels mediate direct zzso communication and play an important role in many zzso zzso Six zzso zzso to form a zzso and two zzso dock together zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be important for the zzso but the molecular mechanisms behind the zzso and formation of zzso channels are not zzso Recent developments in atomic zzso structure and functional studies on a series of zzso zzso revealed that E1 and zzso are likely to play different roles in the zzso zzso interactions at the zzso zzso including hydrogen bonds, are predicted to form between zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment analysis on the zzso zzso zzso indicate that the E1 domain is important for the formation of the zzso channel and the zzso domain is important in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso forming or equivalent zzso in both E1 and zzso zzso are zzso hot spots for zzso human zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso can assist us to develop novel strategies in rescuing the zzso zzso zzso
