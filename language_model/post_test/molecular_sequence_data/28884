zzso bacterial communities of two transgenic potato lines which produce T4 zzso for protection against bacterial infections were analyzed in comparison to communities of zzso plants and transgenic controls not harboring the zzso zzso zzso samples were taken from young, zzso and zzso plants at two field sites in three consecutive zzso The communities were characterized in a zzso zzso zzso methods included zzso plate counts, determination of species composition and diversity based on fatty acid analysis of zzso and community level zzso zzso zzso analyses were based on zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene fragments amplified from zzso DNA using zzso specific for zzso zzso or zzso or zzso Several bands of the zzso patterns were further characterized by sequence zzso All methods revealed that environmental factors related to season, field site, or year but not to the T4 zzso expression of the transgenic plants influenced the zzso zzso For one of the T4 zzso zzso no zzso in the zzso communities compared to the control lines was zzso For the other, differences were detected at some of the zzso between the zzso community structure and those of one or all other zzso which were not attributable to T4 zzso production but most likely to differences observed in the growth characteristics of this zzso
