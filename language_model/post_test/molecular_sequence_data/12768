Human zzso zzso virus zzso is the zzso agent of the zzso disorder progressive zzso zzso zzso In zzso the cellular zzso of zzso has been shown to be very narrow, and replication appears to be essentially restricted to zzso To investigate the detail cellular zzso of zzso we employed zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso cells, and several zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso adapted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso transformed African green monkey kidney cell line) were used as zzso zzso zzso infection it could be confirmed that the virus proliferated in zzso but not in zzso and zzso cells as measured by zzso zzso However, after zzso of zzso adapted zzso it could be shown that virus could replicate not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the regulatory region of zzso adapted zzso was shown to be active in zzso and zzso cells, but inactive in zzso zzso The result suggests that nuclear zzso factors are also zzso of zzso cell zzso in zzso in addition to specific cellular zzso
