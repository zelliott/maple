The expression of J chain and zzso chain genes has been investigated during human fetal zzso by the zzso chain reaction performed on liver zzso With this technique, we have been able to detect expression of J chain and zzso chain in a single zzso zzso zzso section of fetal liver zzso J chain expression reached a maximum at 16 weeks of gestation but was clearly zzso in the liver at the 6th zzso Although not zzso at the 6th week, zzso chain zzso became readily zzso at 7 weeks of zzso These results indicate that J chain expression precedes that of zzso chain by at least one zzso zzso our results imply that J chain is the first zzso zzso expressed during the zzso and differentiation of B cells in the fetal zzso
