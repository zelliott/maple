A novel zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a lake zzso and characterized using a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso positive, zzso zzso and produced zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso formed a zzso zzso with the closest relative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an association that was supported by a zzso value of 74 % in the zzso tree and also recovered with the zzso zzso However, the low level of zzso zzso allowed the strain to be differentiated from its closest zzso Moreover, strain zzso could also be differentiated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso species showing high zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso should be classified as a new species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
