zzso a region in central Italy, is known for its extensive volcanic areas that make a significant contribution to the zzso zzso contamination of freshwater zzso even though some degree of As water pollution may be caused by human zzso The information available on indigenous zzso zzso in aquatic environments of zzso is, however, still zzso In this study, we describe new bacteria that are resistant to zzso toxicity and were isolated from the surface waters of Lake zzso and the Sacco River, two groundwater systems in zzso as well as from bottled natural mineral water from the same zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis for the zzso strains in lake and river waters points to a prevalence of zzso and zzso while zzso zzso and zzso are represented to a lesser zzso By contrast, solely zzso were isolated from groundwater zzso The presence of zzso was documented exclusively in bottled mineral zzso In addition, we conducted a DNA zzso study on the gene zzso zzso an zzso zzso membrane protein pump related to zzso resistance, for all the zzso bacterial zzso A zzso analysis was carried out on the newly zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso in the present study as well as on an additional zzso zzso zzso we obtained previously from Lake zzso from the zzso and from a well in zzso Romano located in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the zzso diversity of zzso bacteria in underground water was very limited if compared with zzso and zzso zzso Lastly, our molecular data support the hypothesis that the horizontal gene transfer of zzso in zzso freshwater environments is not limited to zzso zzso but also occurs between bacteria that are distant from an evolutionary viewpoint, thereby indicating that such genetic events may be considered a source of microbial resistance to zzso
