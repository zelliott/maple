Human zzso B zzso is present in plasma as two separate zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a single gene on zzso 2, and a single nuclear zzso is edited and processed into two separate zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso codes for zzso and the second zzso which codes for zzso contains a premature stop zzso generated by a single base substitution of zzso to zzso at zzso zzso which converts the translated zzso zzso coding for the zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso in zzso to a premature zzso stop zzso zzso Two zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were zzso containing the complementary sequence to the stop zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and sequence analysis of zzso clones in two independent human small zzso zzso libraries established that zzso zzso zzso contained both the zzso zzso that codes for zzso and the zzso zzso containing the premature zzso stop zzso which codes for zzso Investigation of zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso libraries by zzso with the zzso and zzso synthetic zzso as well as by zzso sequencing revealed that liver zzso zzso also contains both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso containing the stop zzso The combined results from these studies establish that both human zzso and liver contain the two distinct zzso zzso an zzso that codes for zzso and an zzso zzso that contains the premature stop zzso which codes for zzso The premature zzso stop zzso is not tissue specific and is present in both human liver and zzso
