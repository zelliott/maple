zzso are a recently described family of peptides that play an important role in innate zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso exhibit a broad spectrum of zzso activities against bacteria and zzso Three families have been identified so far in zzso zzso zzso and zzso presumably derived from a common ancestral zzso A long-term study on the evolution of these zzso families among primates has been undertaken to zzso zzso the degree of zzso zzso zzso the genetic mechanisms responsible for the zzso of these zzso and zzso the possible role of different environmental factors in their zzso zzso sequences have been obtained from great and lesser apes, several African and Asian zzso monkeys and one New World zzso A comparison of rates of synonymous and zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution indicates that the zzso zzso 1 gene evolved under a pattern of random zzso substitution as predicted by the neutral theory of molecular zzso These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso 1 gene has diversified in response to changes in the microbial species to which a given host is zzso zzso of zzso zzso have yielded some insights about the pattern of molecular evolution of the gene among zzso zzso and great apes present high levels of sequence zzso differing in only one zzso acid zzso in the mature zzso Compared with these zzso zzso and zzso exhibit zzso zzso acid zzso some of which increase the net charge of the active zzso
