The zzso gene of zzso zzso contains in its untranslated leader region a zzso zzso which is spliced in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus of a zzso gene zzso defective in zzso still causes zzso of growth in transgenic tobacco zzso zzso of zzso zzso is required for efficient expression of the zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso is required for efficient in zzso translation of the zzso zzso In contrast, expression of a zzso gene zzso with the zzso initiation zzso replaced by zzso does not cause any zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso acid zzso at positions 37 and 40 of the zzso coding region were isolated as zzso zzso in zzso plants transgenic for the zzso zzso However, when expressed in tobacco under the control of the zzso promoter, they cause a zzso zzso reduced in the zzso of its zzso The molecular characterization of zzso zzso might be useful for understanding the zzso function of the zzso zzso
