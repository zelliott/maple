zzso as the zzso B virus zzso is not directly zzso for the infected zzso it is generally presumed that viral clearance and liver cell injury during viral zzso are due to a zzso response to zzso zzso zzso presented by zzso class I zzso We have previously examined the peripheral blood zzso response to two zzso zzso zzso in patients with acute and chronic viral zzso one of which is restricted by zzso whereas the other is zzso restricted by zzso and zzso In this study, we defined the zzso zzso response to the zzso B surface zzso zzso by using a panel of zzso synthetic peptides containing the ideal zzso binding motif zzso Several novel aspects of zzso zzso and zzso are evident from this zzso First, the peripheral blood zzso response to zzso zzso is remarkably zzso and zzso in most patients with acute zzso Indeed, zzso zzso specific for as many as four envelope zzso and one zzso zzso were found to be present simultaneously in individual patients with acute viral zzso Second, zzso zzso are not zzso in the peripheral blood in a minority of patients with acute zzso nor have we detected a zzso response in any of the patients with chronic zzso that we have studied thus zzso Although the cellular and molecular basis for zzso zzso remains to be determined, the data suggest that it may contribute to viral zzso Third, the diversity and the specificity of the zzso response is determined in part by the coding sequence of the viral zzso present in each infected zzso Indeed, the apparent zzso of some acutely infected patients to at least one zzso zzso zzso actually reflects infection by a viral zzso that contains a critical substitution in one of the anchor zzso within the zzso Finally, at a fundamental level, the data suggest that the presence of the zzso motif in a zzso may not be sufficient for zzso and the capacity of a zzso to bind the class I zzso does not guarantee that it will be zzso
