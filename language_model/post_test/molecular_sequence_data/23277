We identified Ras zzso protein 3 zzso as a zzso exchange factor expressed in blood vessels via an embryonic stem zzso zzso gene trap screen to identify novel vascular zzso zzso is expressed in embryonic blood vessels, zzso in mature adult vessels, and zzso in newly formed vessels during pregnancy and zzso This expression pattern is consistent with an zzso function for zzso Although a zzso zzso in zzso did not affect zzso zzso was zzso in response to vascular zzso growth factor zzso stimulation of human zzso vein zzso cells, placing zzso regulation downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso mimic the second zzso zzso zzso in zzso both protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso blood vessels exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent extensive zzso zzso that resulted in the formation of large zzso sheets rather than properly zzso zzso This response to zzso was completely dependent on the presence of zzso as zzso vessels were zzso to the zzso Taken together, these findings show that zzso zzso is zzso in response to zzso stimulation and that zzso functions as an zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in a zzso whose stimulation zzso normal zzso This suggests that zzso activity may exacerbate vascular complications in diseases characterized by excess zzso such as zzso
