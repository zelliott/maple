A role of the nuclear zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso pathways involving other nuclear receptors is zzso Indeed, zzso is a negative regulator of zzso by binding to overlapping response elements shared with various nuclear zzso including the zzso zzso receptors and the zzso orphan zzso alpha zzso Here, we show that zzso is expressed in primary human zzso and that its expression is induced by synthetic zzso for the liver X receptors zzso which control cholesterol zzso zzso and the immune response in zzso zzso binds to a specific response element in the human zzso promoter, thus inducing zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso does not influence zzso or zzso cholesterol zzso However, zzso zzso zzso the induction of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso by short interfering zzso results in enhanced zzso expression upon zzso zzso zzso mobility shift, zzso zzso and transient zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso human zzso promoter activity by binding as a zzso to a zzso site overlapping with the zzso response element site in the zzso zzso These data identify zzso as a new zzso target zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a negative zzso feedback loop, but not cholesterol zzso gene zzso
