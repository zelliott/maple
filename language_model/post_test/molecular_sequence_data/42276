zzso and zzso are known to undergo significant modifications in their zzso and zzso metabolism in response to chemical factors, in particular changes in the shape, movement, zzso activity and zzso These phenomena often involve an increase in zzso and cellular zzso activity, usually expressed in zzso zzso Once zzso the cells can move quickly towards the source of the zzso where they produce and release great amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study has examined the ability of surfaces of selected zzso to influence zzso zzso and zzso The surface of two films derived from zzso acid derivatives were compared with that of zzso The two zzso acid zzso despite having a similar chemical structure, were shown to interact with human zzso in different zzso A zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the whole population of zzso to take up a zzso zzso zzso and to move with a zzso similar to that of zzso cells on a glass zzso In contrast, only zzso of the examined cells on the surface of zzso acid zzso zzso were polarized and their mean speed was only slightly higher with respect to that found with zzso cells on zzso Moreover, while on the zzso zzso and on glass a correlation between zzso zzso zzso the shape of the zzso and cell speed was found, the zzso zzso did not show any zzso
