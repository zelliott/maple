A combined experimental and zzso approach was used to understand the mechanism of zzso selectivity of a series of zzso zzso Six pairs of fused ring zzso derivatives were zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed in guinea pig zzso zzso zzso activity was determined in zzso or zzso guinea pig zzso zzso and zzso and zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and electronic properties were calculated for each zzso Although the parent compounds were selective for the zzso the zzso zzso displayed selectivity for the zzso because of a decrease in zzso accompanied by an increase in zzso The zzso zzso displayed little or no activity at the zzso The role of the zzso in enhanced zzso is likely interaction with a zzso site in the zzso The diminished zzso of the zzso zzso is a result of the loss of the zzso oxygen as the zzso center, which we have previously determined to be important for recognition of the zzso
