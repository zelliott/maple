We have examined the zzso regulation of the rabbit zzso heavy chain zzso beta gene by using zzso zzso zzso To analyze the activity of the zzso HC beta promoter in a zzso background, cultured zzso from zzso chick embryonic breast muscle were zzso with a zzso gene containing zzso base pairs of the promoter region fused to the gene for zzso zzso zzso As indicated by the transient expression of zzso zzso the activity of the promoter in zzso cultures increased at least zzso following differentiation and was selectively inhibited when zzso was blocked with zzso Furthermore, zzso protection experiments showed that the in zzso zzso HC beta zzso initiation (or zzso site was zzso in the zzso skeletal muscle cells and also that the regulation of the zzso promoter was similar to the induction of the zzso skeletal zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso promoter is regulated in a zzso and zzso zzso By creating progressive zzso deletions of the promoter, we showed that only the region extending zzso base pairs upstream from the cap site is necessary for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this region indicated that the positive regulation in differentiated skeletal muscle is zzso by at least two distinct elements within the zzso region of the zzso HC beta zzso
