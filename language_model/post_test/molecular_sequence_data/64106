The zzso fungus zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that causes economically important losses in a wide variety of zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso growth on zzso media and zzso asexual development producing three kinds of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are formed from zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso with thick walls are formed zzso from zzso or by the modification of zzso zzso Here we describe zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso obtained by zzso integration zzso zzso analysis of zzso identified the affected zzso zzso which encodes a protein with similarity to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are presumed zzso regulators involved in zzso in these zzso The zzso zzso and zzso strains lack normal zzso and zzso and form zzso zzso cells directly from zzso by zzso zzso These zzso however, exhibit normal zzso growth and zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was verified using strains expressing the zzso fluorescent protein zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso encodes a zzso regulator required for the correct differentiation of zzso cells for development of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
