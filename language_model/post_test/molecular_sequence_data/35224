zzso sequence of zzso zzso hypersensitive element zzso zzso is known to fold in zzso and subsequently serves as a zzso zzso Cellular zzso protein zzso a highly zzso zzso protein with multiple biological functions, could bind to zzso zzso zzso region, specifically to the single strand zzso zzso 

In the present study, a variety of methods, including zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso CD, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso and zzso were applied to investigate the mechanism for the role of zzso in regulating zzso zzso 

We found that human zzso specifically bound to the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso region both in zzso and in zzso and subsequently promoted the formation of zzso zzso could induce a transient decrease followed by an increase in zzso zzso in zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was responsible for the increase of zzso zzso 

Based on above experimental results, a new zzso involving zzso related zzso interaction, for the regulation of zzso zzso was zzso 

These findings indicated that the regulation of zzso zzso through zzso zzso region might be governed by mechanisms involving complex zzso zzso and suggested a new possibility of zzso as a potential zzso target based on zzso biological function in zzso zzso
