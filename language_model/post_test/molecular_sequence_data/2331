Prior studies have demonstrated that a small proportion of blood zzso from patients with human zzso zzso infection express only the viral zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rice, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso The present studies demonstrate that the zzso genes of zzso are transcribed in zzso cells zzso zzso only after zzso of the cells with zzso zzso of the zzso genes is from an upstream zzso zzso region containing several different repeated sequence zzso zzso plasmids were constructed with just a single copy or three copies of a synthetic zzso sequence of either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso repeat elements upstream of the minimal zzso promoter sequence to drive expression of the indicator zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso or zzso motifs in the zzso region were found to be important in zzso the effect of the zzso However, the zzso activity detected with the zzso repeat was always significantly higher than that found with the zzso zzso There was an additive effect by multiple copies of the zzso or zzso repeat sequences on gene zzso The zzso repeat contains a sequence identical to that described for a zzso zzso zzso response element, and plasmids containing only this sequence and the minimal promoter sequences upstream of the zzso gene respond to agents which increase zzso zzso zzso zzso response elements are present in the zzso zzso region and are associated with the zzso repeat zzso It is proposed that zzso of zzso results in expression of the zzso genes of zzso in part via the zzso of cellular zzso factors which interact with the zzso and zzso motifs in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso repeat is the major contributor to the strength of this zzso zzso zzso
