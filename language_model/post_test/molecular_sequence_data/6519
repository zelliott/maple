It was recently reported that the mouse zzso contains an zzso cluster formed by three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in order from the zzso to the 3' end of the zzso These three genes exhibit close structural zzso zzso and zzso are abundant in bone, but zzso is expressed in zzso zzso especially in kidney and zzso Previous studies using transgenic mice carrying diphtheria toxin zzso gene linked to the rat zzso zzso promoter have revealed that the zzso promoter is active not only in zzso but also in zzso In this study, reverse zzso chain reaction was used to study the expression of these three genes in mouse zzso (including zzso Here we report for the first time that mouse zzso is extensively transcribed in male zzso zzso including seminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play a role in differentiation and/or maintenance of male zzso zzso
