Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso cells express the zzso growth factor zzso however, there is a large decrease in the expression of this gene when zzso cells zzso In addition, it has been shown that differentiation of mouse zzso zzso cells reduces the expression of a reporter gene under the control of both the putative human zzso promoter and an zzso element that is located in the third zzso of the zzso zzso Given the low degree of sequence similarity between the human zzso gene and the zzso zzso gene upstream of the zzso start site, it was unclear whether human sequences mimic fully the regulation of the zzso gene in mouse zzso To address this question, we have examined the expression of gene zzso containing various regions of the zzso zzso gene in two mouse zzso cell lines and one mouse embryonic stem zzso cell zzso Our results demonstrate that the mouse zzso zzso region, like the human zzso zzso region, cannot support expression of the reporter zzso In both zzso cell lines and the zzso cell line, expression of the reporter gene is elevated zzso to zzso by the addition of a zzso region taken from the third zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we provide evidence that zzso binding proteins are involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso this study has identified regions upstream of the zzso start site that appear to regulate the expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso cells and in zzso zzso
