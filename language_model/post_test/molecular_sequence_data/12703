zzso peripheral blood zzso exist in a resting state both in zzso and when maintained in culture, exhibiting low translation rates consistent with their zzso zzso Previously we have shown that zzso of these zzso cells with either zzso zzso or zzso A leads to a rapid increase in the rate of protein synthesis and zzso of initiation factor zzso alpha zzso zzso Kay and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now show that neither the early enhanced translation rate nor the early increased zzso of zzso alpha requires the activity of the 70 zzso form of zzso protein zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso gamma is zzso in response to cell zzso an event which is correlated with zzso of zzso alpha and enhanced zzso complex zzso In these studies, zzso focusing and zzso analysis of zzso alpha indicate that zzso of zzso alpha following cell zzso reflects a modest increase in zzso zzso zzso by the enhanced activity of zzso alpha zzso and zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso In the resting cell, zzso alpha is associated with zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso following acute stimulation with zzso zzso there is a zzso decrease in the amount of zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with extracts containing activated or zzso zzso protein zzso resulted in a small increase in zzso of recovered zzso and a modest release of zzso alpha from the zzso alpha zzso These data suggest a possible role for zzso in the regulation of zzso complex formation and the rate of translation in primary zzso
