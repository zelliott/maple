The intact zzso sequence zzso as well as its zzso carrying an zzso core zzso zzso of zzso zzso were prepared by means of zzso synthesis employing zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso zzso as building zzso It was concluded that the zzso structure had little influence on further zzso zzso in zzso synthesis and the zzso zzso zzso was sufficiently stable to the zzso zzso zzso conditions used to release zzso from the supporting zzso The paper also describes an efficient route leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso which was prepared in seven steps for an overall yield of zzso from zzso units 5, 6, 7 and zzso
