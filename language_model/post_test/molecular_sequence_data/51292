zzso of the identity, synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is of importance because zzso present at the zzso cell surface may be zzso significant zzso receptors that could mediate zzso or zzso functions and/or cell zzso This paper presents data that show that a previously identified zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso by human peripheral zzso is actually comprised of three different zzso One of these is related to a novel 15 zzso zzso isolated from human zzso and which is zzso by B zzso zzso zzso contains at least six zzso zzso for which the zzso activity is independent of the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso 15 zzso zzso does not appear to be zzso related to previously characterized zzso zzso It is zzso from zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso on zzso Western zzso analyses and zzso experiments with metabolically zzso cells showed the presence of the 15 zzso zzso in peripheral zzso and in zzso zzso B zzso zzso The 15 zzso zzso yielded zzso fragments of approximately zzso and approximately zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso These fragments were partially zzso and 12 zzso were zzso A similarity search of the zzso zzso protein data base did not reveal a relationship of the 15 zzso zzso to known zzso including zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
