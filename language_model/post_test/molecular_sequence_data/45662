An zzso point zzso was identified in the zzso zzso type 1 zzso gene zzso symbol, zzso in a family with the zzso form of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso creates a new zzso zzso site in zzso 7 of the zzso zzso In addition to low levels of normally spliced zzso product of the zzso zzso the patient samples contained also an zzso spliced zzso with a 165 zzso zzso of zzso 7 (from position zzso to zzso inserted between zzso 7 and zzso The abnormal transcript contained a premature stop zzso and was zzso as revealed by Northern zzso zzso We defined that zzso zzso generated a consensus binding motif for the zzso factor zzso zzso which most likely favored zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, it activated a cryptic zzso site causing the inclusion between zzso 7 and 8 of the 165 zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is most likely explained by the generation of a de zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, to rescue zzso expression in the patient's zzso we designed an zzso zzso modified zzso complementary to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was able to rescue zzso expression and restore the zzso protein level in the patient's zzso through skipping of the zzso zzso The use of zzso demonstrated that the lack of zzso was caused by the generation of a new zzso zzso Furthermore, this technique will lead to new approaches to correct zzso site zzso that cause human zzso
