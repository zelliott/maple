zzso zzso is the zzso agent of infectious zzso an important respiratory disease of zzso zzso sequencing analysis showed that zzso zzso strain zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso with strong similarity to the zzso zzso of other members of the zzso Four zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in this zzso The zzso gene encodes the structural zzso zzso zzso which has a predicted molecular mass of about 250 zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso neither of which has been found in other zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed in zzso coli showed neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and sequencing analysis revealed that the zzso gene was present in all strains and field zzso of zzso zzso examined in this zzso zzso collected from chickens exposed to zzso zzso exhibited strong zzso to the zzso zzso which suggests that zzso is zzso This is the first report of the identification of an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The gene products of this zzso may be related to disease zzso and potentially represent a useful vaccine target of zzso zzso
