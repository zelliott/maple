To understand the role of zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso action, we produced a full-length zzso zzso and examined its effect on the zzso effect of zzso We also studied zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zzso injection of zzso significantly increased cumulative food intake and body weight in a zzso manner in zzso The zzso zzso of food intake and body weight was reversed by zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso mice and zzso in lethal yellow zzso mice zzso zzso with zzso A single zzso injection of zzso reversed the increased zzso zzso levels in zzso mice but not in zzso zzso In control mice and zzso mice, zzso zzso expression was zzso during zzso when plasma zzso zzso were zzso No significant increase in zzso zzso expression was noted during zzso in control mice and zzso mice treated with zzso This study provides the first direct evidence that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso action, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is shown to increase zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso production, our data suggest that its action via the zzso zzso system is determined by the balance between the levels of its zzso and zzso zzso and zzso
