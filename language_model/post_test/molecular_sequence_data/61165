We have zzso the zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso from the fruit fly, zzso zzso The predicted zzso designated as zzso shows high similarity to the previously identified zzso zzso zzso The two proteins were expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso by zzso affinity zzso either from inclusion bodies or from the bacterial zzso Both zzso were zzso zzso and attained zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The activity and the rate of zzso of zzso but not zzso could be activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A truncated form of zzso lacking the zzso unique zzso region, has also been expressed and zzso Although it lacked the zzso acid long putative zzso segment, its zzso by zzso was similar to that of the full-length zzso zzso The zzso undergo zzso zzso in a zzso manner which was shown with zzso to run parallel with zzso zzso Moreover, fully zzso zzso lacked the characteristic zzso phase indicating the requirement for zzso upon zzso of this zzso form in zzso The analysis of the mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso seems to corroborate the zzso model of zzso zzso
