In this study, the effects of zzso produced by six bacteria on zzso growth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein content and zzso zzso in zzso zzso were investigated in zzso and zzso liquid zzso The results showed that zzso with zzso zzso zzso partly enhanced the growth of zzso zzso after zzso with zzso biomass increase for zzso and zzso for zzso compared to zzso which lacked zzso The maximum enhancement for zzso were found to be confined to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso A significant decrease in zzso content indicated that zzso zzso in zzso zzso was alleviated by zzso Besides, zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities also displayed obviously decrease in zzso zzso compared to zzso treatment, while zzso activity did not present significant zzso zzso level in zzso zzso treated by zzso increased from zzso to zzso for zzso and from zzso to zzso for zzso compared to zzso zzso the present work suggests that microbial zzso can reduce the toxicity of metals to zzso and then alleviate heavy zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso
