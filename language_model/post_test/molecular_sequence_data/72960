zzso zzso of zzso and some zzso bacteria have an zzso requirement for zzso acid zzso an essential constituent of the cell wall of these zzso In environments deprived of zzso for example zzso zzso they will undergo zzso This was previously exploited to develop vaccine strains of zzso zzso and cloning zzso containing zzso as an in zzso zzso zzso As a first step for development of such systems for zzso zzso the zzso gene from zzso strain zzso was cloned by a combined approach of zzso amplification from zzso DNA, construction of zzso and by zzso of an zzso coli delta zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso contained the zzso 47 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose product showed similarity to the zzso proteins from zzso zzso By zzso zzso was localized to a zzso zzso DNA zzso which in an zzso coli zzso expression system strongly expressed a 40,000 Da zzso The zzso acid sequence was deduced from the DNA zzso A comparison of the zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso revealed greater than zzso identity, demonstrating the zzso nature of zzso in zzso bacteria, and defined the zzso consensus sequence zzso as a possible signature zzso zzso delta zzso zzso were zzso They were zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso probably is naturally zzso and does not contribute to the zzso zzso By zzso the zzso gene was mapped to between coordinates zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
