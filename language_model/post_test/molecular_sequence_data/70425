In an attempt to investigate possible binding zzso of the tumor necrosis factors zzso we have previously zzso a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso In this report, we describe the synthesis and biological activity of another zzso zzso corresponding to human zzso zzso The design of these zzso peptides is based on their high sequence zzso with corresponding fragments of human zzso or zzso Similar to zzso the zzso zzso zzso displayed low in zzso zzso against human zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso peptides zzso and zzso were then tested for the induction of zzso zzso production from human peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso in zzso At low zzso the zzso levels induced by these zzso peptides were similar to that of zzso zzso However, the zzso production by zzso stimulation was zzso increased and reached that of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the fragments corresponding to human zzso and zzso zzso may represent certain binding zzso of the tumor necrosis factors that elicit zzso zzso
