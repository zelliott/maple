We report the molecular cloning of zzso from the embryonic mouse zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows it to be a zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso and chick zzso The mouse zzso gene maps to zzso 1, outside the zzso linkage group of zzso genes on zzso zzso zzso is expressed throughout the entire period of neural development and zzso levels are zzso regulated in both the embryonic and the zzso central nervous system zzso In adult mice, zzso expression is restricted to the zzso with highest levels in the zzso In the developing eye, zzso zzso is found only in the neural zzso It is expressed by all retinal zzso from E11 zzso but becomes progressively restricted to zzso in the inner zzso and developing zzso cell layers zzso In the adult zzso it is confined to zzso of cells in the zzso and to zzso cells in the inner part of the inner nuclear zzso This expression pattern suggests a role for zzso in mouse retinal development, particularly in the formation and maintenance of the zzso
