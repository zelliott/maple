We have demonstrated previously that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso regulated by zzso zzso interactions zzso zzso and Gross, zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now demonstrate that an zzso zzso which possesses sequence zzso to and chemical, physical, zzso and zzso similarities with zzso zzso specifically interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and represents the putative protein regulatory element identified in previous zzso Multiple independent lines of evidence document the association between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including 1) the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which migrate as a zzso complex during gel zzso zzso 2) the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso which zzso to a complex comprised of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) the demonstration that the zzso zzso zzso acts as a specific and zzso affinity zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, 4) the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity utilizing chicken zzso skeletal muscle zzso zzso 5) the specific release of zzso zzso from zzso after formation of a zzso complex comprised of zzso zzso of zzso and 6) the selective zzso of the zzso of zzso homogeneous zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso these results demonstrate the highly specific association of a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggest a novel zzso mechanism underlying the coordinated regulation of zzso and zzso previously observed in zzso and in other zzso zzso
