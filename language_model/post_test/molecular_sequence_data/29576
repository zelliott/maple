We have previously reported that zzso markedly increase and zzso (such as zzso block zzso zzso and protein expression in some breast cancer cell lines, but not in others, and that this increase is the consequence of increased zzso from the first, zzso zzso promoter of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso protection and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso we now demonstrate that zzso factor protein complexes are formed on the zzso first promoter at a composite regulatory element containing overlapping binding sites for zzso zzso zzso factors, and the zzso zzso zzso Competition studies indicate that zzso factor proteins bind the zzso site and the zzso element zzso and both zzso and zzso proteins are involved in zzso complex zzso The complexes differ in quantity and zzso zzso in the different breast cancer cell lines studied depending on whether the promoter responds to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso activity of this promoter and lack of zzso stimulation when the zzso site was zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso regulate zzso from the zzso first promoter and that differences in recruitment of the various components are responsible for cell specific repression and zzso of this gene in breast zzso cell zzso
