The physical properties of zzso C virus zzso particles were determined by zzso on zzso zzso zzso density zzso We report that zzso two populations of zzso particles were found in the zzso of patients with chronic zzso infection zzso high density zzso zzso and at low density zzso zzso zzso virus particles with high density values were associated with zzso and zzso virus particles with low density values accumulated base changes within a zzso region zzso of the zzso envelope domain of the zzso zzso The results indicate that base changes within the zzso of zzso lead to the zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso these findings imply that persistent zzso infection is established as a consequence of sequence variation in the zzso envelope zzso
