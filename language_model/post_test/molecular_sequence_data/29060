The zzso nuclear factor 3 zzso head zzso family contains a large number of zzso factors that recognize divergent DNA sequences via a winged zzso binding zzso zzso proteins show a broad profile of DNA zzso in which one DNA sequence can be recognized by more than one zzso protein and each individual zzso protein has several DNA binding zzso In this study, zzso zzso methods were used to study the structures of the DNA binding domain of a zzso winged zzso protein zzso and its DNA zzso The structural comparison of winged zzso proteins zzso and Genesis and their DNA complexes indicates that even two highly zzso zzso family members can adopt different local structures when they contact an identical DNA binding zzso while one of these two zzso proteins seems to adopt only slightly different structures on different DNA binding zzso
