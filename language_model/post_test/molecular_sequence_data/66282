The restricted expression of zzso in the anterior zzso is regulated via an active zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of this zzso loop, however, remained zzso Here we show that the activity of a zzso zzso promoter zzso containing a consensus zzso binding site at position zzso to zzso is zzso by zzso zzso factors of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso is bound to the zzso site on the zzso Thus, regulation of zzso by zzso zzso is directly controlled by binding to and zzso a consensus zzso binding site within its own zzso
