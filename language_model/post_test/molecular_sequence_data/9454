zzso zzso zzso catalyze with high efficiency the zzso zzso of carbon dioxide, an essential reaction for many biological zzso such as photosynthesis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso which are one of the most common types of zzso and are widespread in zzso possess zzso fundamental for acquisition of zzso zzso Recently, in the marine zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso naturally using zzso in its active site, has been isolated and zzso in a new CA class, namely zzso This zzso which consists of three repeats zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that can spontaneously exchange zzso or zzso at its active zzso presumably an zzso advantage for zzso that grow fast in the zzso environment of the surface zzso In this paper we completed the characterization of this zzso reporting the X-ray structure of the last zzso zzso in its zzso form, and presenting a model of the full length protein obtained by zzso zzso zzso show that zzso has a quite compact not zzso structure, characterized by two zzso linked zzso and zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso zzso The three zzso arrangement shows that most of the zzso zzso of the three repeats are located at the interface regions and that the active sites are far from each other and completely accessible to the zzso Finally, a detailed zzso study of zzso repeat in both zzso and zzso bound form has been performed with zzso and zzso zzso The results have been compared with those previously reported for other CA classes, namely zzso and zzso and correlated with the structural features of these zzso
