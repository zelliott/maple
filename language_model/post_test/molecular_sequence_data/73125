zzso zzso of zzso C leads to its zzso binding to DNA, forming zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso C has been attributed to zzso formation, whereas zzso are assumed to cause zzso We have developed a zzso technique to measure zzso C DNA zzso Using this technique, we have measured zzso formation in the shuttle zzso zzso zzso and have determined zzso induced by zzso zzso The shuttle zzso zzso was incubated with zzso C under conditions favoring zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was then zzso in human zzso cells, rescued in bacteria, and analyzed for zzso in the zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso One major zzso zzso zzso was observed by zzso and was characterized as a zzso of zzso When zzso was exposed to zzso activated zzso C, increases in zzso levels and zzso frequency were found to be related to zzso C zzso The majority of the zzso involved single zzso with base zzso making up zzso of the total zzso zzso Of the base zzso zzso were zzso and zzso were zzso with nearly zzso of all base zzso involving zzso base zzso zzso either as single bases or large zzso also involved zzso base pairs the majority of the zzso The observed bias of zzso at zzso and the formation of a zzso zzso zzso involving zzso suggests that zzso formation may be responsible for the zzso
