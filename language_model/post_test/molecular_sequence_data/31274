Computer analyses of zzso acid sequences in the human zzso zzso zzso envelope zzso revealed that zzso zzso in the viral protein can be predicted on the basis of the physical properties of zzso acids in the zzso zzso Relatively high values of surface zzso flexibility, and zzso were used as markers for zzso of putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso envelope with those reported zzso indicate that computer analyses are able to predict zzso zzso This study shows the usefulness of computer programs for the prediction of the zzso zzso in the zzso envelope zzso
