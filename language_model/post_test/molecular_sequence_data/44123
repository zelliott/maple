zzso transport of zzso is essential for zzso gene zzso However, how zzso is exported from the nucleus is mostly zzso To zzso the mechanisms of zzso zzso we took a genetic approach to identify zzso the products of which play a role in that zzso From about 1000 temperature zzso zzso or zzso zzso we identified five zzso zzso that are defective in zzso zzso transport by using a zzso zzso with an zzso as a zzso These zzso accumulate zzso zzso in the zzso when shifted to a zzso zzso All five zzso are tightly linked to the zzso growth zzso are zzso and fall into four different groups designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, each group of zzso has a differential zzso pattern of zzso zzso in the zzso at the zzso temperature, suggesting that they have defects at different steps of the zzso transport zzso zzso of a zzso fluorescent protein fusion suggests that zzso and zzso have defects also in nuclear protein zzso Among the isolated zzso only zzso showed a zzso in zzso zzso We cloned the zzso and zzso genes and found that they zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso and the zzso zzso E1 involved in zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is essential for cell zzso and zzso zzso with green fluorescent protein was localized in both the nucleus and the zzso This is the first report suggesting that the zzso system plays a role in zzso zzso
