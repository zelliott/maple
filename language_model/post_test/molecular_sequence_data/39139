The zzso zzso data suggest slight differences in the structures around the zzso for the internal Schiff base and the zzso external Schiff base (both largely zzso and a large difference for zzso portion of the zzso external Schiff zzso zzso of zzso or zzso increase delayed zzso and zzso to zzso energy zzso zzso of zzso exhibits a splitting of the zzso zzso the result of two distinct zzso likely zzso and zzso zzso Nonetheless, the zzso Schiff base zzso differs from either the internal or external Schiff base zzso All of the zzso zzso data are consistent with zzso changes reflecting zzso of zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso It is important to remember that the structural changes are zzso The native structure zzso Schiff zzso is active site open, while the zzso zzso zzso zzso external Schiff zzso is active site zzso The trigger for the zzso change from open to closed as one goes from the internal to external Schiff base is the occupancy of the zzso zzso of the active site zzso et zzso zzso Associated with this, as observed in zzso profiles, zzso changes in zzso and zzso changes in zzso enhancement upon binding zzso or zzso is an zzso group with a zzso in the range zzso zzso on the zzso state of the zzso group, structural changes likely occur that also reflect a zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, the minimal zzso cycle can likely be pictured as shown in zzso zzso The changes may be pH dependent, and the open zzso for the internal Schiff base and the zzso Schiff base are not identical zzso as expected because of the increased stability of the zzso
