The regulation of zzso zzso zzso gene expression during zzso was studied in zzso with a zzso model zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated relatively high levels of zzso zzso in mouse zzso with intermediate levels in lung and zzso and very low levels in heart and zzso No zzso zzso could be detected in liver, gut, zzso brain, or skeletal zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso increased the zzso levels of zzso zzso in most zzso zzso The greatest induction zzso was observed in the lung at 1 hour after zzso The cellular zzso of zzso zzso was assessed by in zzso zzso In control mice, zzso zzso was detected primarily in zzso zzso of the lung and zzso of the zzso and zzso although a specific signal was also present in other cell zzso In general, zzso cells lacked zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso by zzso was apparent within 30 minutes and was localized to tissue zzso zzso and zzso cells lining arteries and zzso At later times (1 to 3 hours), specialized zzso cells present in gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also positive for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso by zzso may facilitate the zzso and migration of zzso during zzso
