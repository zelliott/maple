zzso zzso strains with strongly zzso activity to mulberry bacterial blight zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from mulberry zzso we identified the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso 

zzso plate method was used to separate the zzso from healthy mulberry zzso after strict surface zzso zzso zzso were screened out through zzso zone zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso and zzso characteristics and zzso zzso sequence zzso The conditions of zzso and medium composition were zzso through single factor and zzso zzso 

In total 77 zzso strains have been isolated from healthy zzso zzso showed strong and stable zzso activity to mulberry bacterial zzso The zzso cultural, zzso and zzso characteristics zzso indicated that zzso belongs to zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence zzso analysis reveals that zzso appeared a sister lineage to zzso zzso The zzso culture conditions of strain zzso were liquid volume 20 zzso in 100 zzso zzso 170 zzso at 28 degrees C, zzso size of zzso for 5 d with a medium of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at initial pH of zzso 

The zzso zzso strain zzso to mulberry bacterial blight was identified as zzso zzso zzso strain shows stronger zzso action to mulberry bacterial blight under zzso zzso zzso
