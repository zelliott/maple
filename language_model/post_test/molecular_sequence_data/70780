The entry of zzso virus zzso into human cells is zzso by the initial attachment of the viral zzso zzso to the complement regulatory protein zzso Two zzso one each within zzso short consensus repeats zzso 1 and 2, are responsible for this zzso However, little is known about the regions within zzso zzso needed for a zzso zzso zzso To better define the zzso interaction, we took three zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and zzso scanning zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the closely related zzso virus zzso zzso were generated and tested for cell surface expression and the ability to zzso zzso red blood cells zzso zzso with the N zzso of zzso were tolerated as zzso zzso could be replaced with zzso zzso up to zzso position zzso However, both larger swaps with zzso and a small zzso zzso replacement at the C zzso aborted zzso zzso zzso scanning with 51 overlapping peptides derived from three zzso zzso regions showed one zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso acids zzso blocked zzso of African green monkey zzso zzso and inhibited zzso infection of Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing human zzso zzso scanning zzso mapped sites on the zzso zzso that were not required for trafficking to the cell surface or function in zzso as well as a novel site required for zzso interaction, zzso acids zzso
