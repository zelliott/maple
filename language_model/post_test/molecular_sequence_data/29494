The human eye anomaly zzso is normally caused by zzso zzso of zzso Several cases of zzso are, however, associated with zzso zzso that leave the zzso gene zzso We have identified and characterized a novel zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso of zzso zzso analysis, including zzso zzso show this gene to consist of 10 zzso with an unusually large final zzso spanning zzso zzso in human and 18 zzso in zzso This zzso is disrupted by each zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript, zzso a zzso acid zzso is expressed in all cell lines zzso The zzso mouse zzso is broadly expressed in mouse zzso zzso is highly zzso from zzso to fish, with some regions of the protein showing conservation to zzso zzso and zzso The possible role of zzso in zzso was zzso Using a transgenic mouse model, we show that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cases is not due to the zzso loss of zzso zzso
