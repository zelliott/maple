Two regions of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in the total DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying one of these regions was previously cloned and shown to contain a zzso gene zzso et zzso 1988) now referred to as zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and an overlapping zzso zzso zzso fragment, containing the second region of zzso were zzso and a DNA region of zzso zzso was zzso It contained four complete open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two truncated zzso zzso and zzso Five zzso were transcribed in the same direction in the order of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assigned from their similarity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso and zzso were expressed only under zzso conditions, whereas no zzso zzso was detected under the same zzso A DNA probe containing zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso as detected by a Northern zzso zzso A zzso start site was localized 87 and 88 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso of zzso This site is zzso 21 zzso upstream, by the sequence zzso already found at the same position in several zzso zzso zzso zzso was too small to zzso zzso This was confirmed by the fact that another zzso start site was localized 85 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso of zzso
