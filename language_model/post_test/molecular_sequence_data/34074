zzso zzso a novel zzso isolated from the medicinal plant zzso zzso contains a zzso knot commonly found in toxins and plant defense zzso The optimal zzso folding of a zzso knot encased in the circular zzso backbone of a zzso poses a zzso Here we report a systematic study of zzso of the zzso folding of zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso with a net charge of zzso The linear precursor of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso by solid phase zzso was zzso zzso by a zzso zzso to form the circular backbone and then subjected to zzso folding in a zzso zzso system under 38 different zzso Of the zzso conditions zzso the nature of the organic zzso appeared to be critical, with the use of zzso zzso zzso the highest yield zzso The zzso connectivity of the folded zzso was identical to that of the native form as determined by partial acid zzso The use of such a high alcohol concentration suggests that a partial zzso may be necessary for the zzso folding of a zzso with the inverse orientation of zzso side chains that are zzso to the zzso face to permit the formation of the interior zzso core in the zzso zzso We also show that synthetic zzso B1 is an zzso exhibiting minimal zzso zzso in the zzso range against both zzso and zzso zzso
