DNA zzso was used in the identification of 89 commercially important freshwater and marine fish species found in Turkish zzso A total of 1765 DNA zzso using a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso c zzso zzso I gene were generated for 89 commercially important freshwater and marine fish species found in Turkish zzso These species belong to 70 zzso 40 families and 19 orders from class zzso and all were associated with a distinct DNA zzso Nine and 12 of the zzso zzso clusters represent the first species records submitted to the zzso and zzso databases, zzso All zzso zzso (except sequences of first species zzso were matched with reference sequences of expected species, according to zzso zzso Average zzso zzso of the data set were calculated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Average zzso genetic distance among individuals were estimated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and within order, zzso Kimura zzso genetic distance values were found to increase with zzso zzso For most of the species zzso in our data set, there is a zzso zzso and an overlap in the zzso gap exists for only two zzso zzso trees were drawn based on DNA zzso and all the specimens clustered in agreement with their zzso zzso at species zzso zzso of this study supported DNA zzso as an efficient molecular tool for a better monitoring, conservation and management of zzso
