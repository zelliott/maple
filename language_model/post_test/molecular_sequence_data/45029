In the present study we report the full coding sequence of rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the partial coding sequence of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso The tissue distribution of all zzso was zzso and the zzso expression profiles of zzso to zzso and zzso between late zzso and zzso maturation were zzso In addition, in zzso hormonal regulation by the zzso steroid zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso We observed that besides zzso which was only found in liver, zzso to zzso and zzso were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso was also detected in liver, zzso zzso skin, and zzso whereas zzso to zzso and zzso exhibited a wider tissue zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was strongly zzso during the zzso period, whereas zzso exhibited a limited zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were zzso during zzso zzso zzso regulation data indicated that all zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are regulated under zzso stimulation at a concentration that induced zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso to -5 transcripts are regulated by zzso and zzso Together, our observations strongly suggest that during final zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and -5 occurs in the zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas an zzso of zzso and zzso occurs in zzso layers or zzso tissue in response to zzso zzso
