An unusual zzso element was discovered in an isolate of the zzso fungus zzso zzso The zzso exists predominantly as zzso molecules of about 625 zzso with complementary strands present at a ratio of approximately zzso zzso mobility and zzso zzso indicated that the element was zzso The zzso appeared to be an autonomous element, since zzso zzso DNA did not contain zzso zzso Standard methods for virus zzso yielded no evidence for zzso of the zzso or for other virus particles in the isolate bearing the zzso The zzso contained zzso and zzso tracts at its zzso and 3' zzso respectively, with a central region that had a zzso content of zzso and lacked obvious zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso at about 200 copies per nucleus, while one-third resided in a zzso but zzso zzso zzso inheritance was observed in sexual zzso with a few zzso The zzso was not widely distributed throughout the species and had little effect on growth or zzso The data suggest that the zzso is best characterized as a novel linear zzso zzso
