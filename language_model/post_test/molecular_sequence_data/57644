zzso by zzso zzso causes a variety of changes in skeletal muscle cells including the zzso of zzso and decreased expression of muscle specific zzso Potential cellular processes leading to these changes were zzso In synchronized muscle infections, zzso was incorporated into infected cell zzso from zzso days post zzso zzso zzso were zzso integrated into the infected cell up to 60 days post infection and appear to originate from differentiated skeletal muscle zzso present at the time of zzso These zzso were further shown to contain a mean DNA content of approximately zzso indicating that the zzso zzso reflects DNA synthesis and subsequent long-term suspension of the infected cell in the cell cycle at zzso Associated with these changes, muscle specific gene transcripts were reduced to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the infected cell compared to normal zzso zzso levels of the muscle zzso regulatory factors zzso zzso and Id were reduced to zzso 10, zzso 1, and increased approximately zzso respectively, in the infected cell compared to normal muscle, indicating zzso zzso of muscle zzso DNA synthesis in the infected cell may represent the initiation event which leads to expression of this infected cell zzso
