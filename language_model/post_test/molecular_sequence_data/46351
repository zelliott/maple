Here, we report on the first completely zzso zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from feces of a zzso infant, was shown to strongly adhere to zzso zzso cells and has potent zzso activity in zzso and in zzso The zzso sequence will provide new insights into the biology of this potential zzso zzso and allow for the characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial zzso
