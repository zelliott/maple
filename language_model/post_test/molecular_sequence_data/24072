More than 25 different zzso zzso have been described in laboratory rats, yet the molecular basis for these zzso has not been determined for most of these zzso Their similarity to the zzso zzso zzso described in mice suggests a possible role for the zzso gene in the formation of rat zzso zzso though whether zzso is responsible for these rat zzso has yet to be zzso zzso in order to understand the basis for the rat zzso zzso and their relationship to the zzso zzso we determined the zzso organization of the zzso gene and subsequently analyzed the coding sequence in four zzso rat zzso Analysis revealed that the first two zzso of the zzso zzso and human zzso gene were fused in the rat zzso while the rest of the gene showed strong evolutionary zzso Despite their designation as zzso no zzso within the coding sequences were identified, indicating that the zzso zzso in all four zzso rat strains are not zzso with zzso
