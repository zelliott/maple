Four zzso zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained after a fusion of zzso cells of mice zzso with zzso bacteria and mouse myeloma cells of the zzso zzso zzso binding properties and specificity of the zzso were studied in bacterial zzso tests, passive zzso and its zzso passive zzso tests, passive zzso and its zzso passive zzso and zzso tests zzso and zzso Three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and were active in all tests used, while zzso zzso did not zzso bacteria but revealed a high zzso in the zzso zzso It was found that the zzso reacted with zzso and zzso strains from zzso E zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as from zzso C zzso and zzso F and S thus showing that the zzso zzso possesses more than one zzso one of which is represented on the zzso zzso of the zzso from the zzso groups zzso According to the known chemical the most probable recognized zzso consists of zzso with zzso to the next zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
