This report describes the structure, function, and tissue distribution pattern of rat zzso zzso organic zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso was isolated from a rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso is zzso zzso long and codes for a protein of zzso zzso zzso Its zzso acid sequence bears high zzso to human zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso When expressed zzso in zzso cells, rat zzso mediates zzso and zzso transport of the zzso organic zzso zzso The zzso interacts with a variety of structurally diverse organic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso interacts with rat zzso with a very low zzso However, the transport of zzso via rat zzso is not evident in the presence or absence of zzso We conclude that rat zzso is a zzso organic zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts are present in a wide variety of zzso in the zzso principally in the liver, zzso zzso brain, heart and zzso In zzso zzso shows the distribution pattern of the transcripts in the brain zzso zzso and zzso kidney zzso and zzso with relatively more abundance in the zzso zzso heart zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso
