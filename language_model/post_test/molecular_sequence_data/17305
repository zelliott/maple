The prion protein zzso zzso zzso forms zzso zzso in zzso and this sequence is speculated to be involved in the formation of zzso zzso by the zzso folded zzso protein zzso found in zzso zzso It is shown here by incubation experiments in water using zzso T zzso as a fluorescent probe for zzso formation that changes in zzso charge, zzso state and zzso zzso lead to large changes in zzso forming zzso zzso of this zzso zzso formation is zzso by a charged zzso and is strongly inhibited by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso are shown to zzso zzso zzso in a process dependent on the nature of the charged groups on the zzso zzso
