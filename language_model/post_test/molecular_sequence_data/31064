The cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso strong zzso expression in zzso We have previously defined two zzso within this zzso that can zzso different zzso expression patterns throughout zzso We show here that the upstream domain zzso has a modular zzso It contains at least five zzso that are able to zzso distinct expression patterns when fused to the downstream domain zzso When fused to a minimal promoter only three of the five zzso give any expression in the early stages of plant zzso zzso of the expression patterns zzso by the zzso alone, in combination with the downstream domain or in combination with other zzso provides evidence for synergistic interactions among zzso within the zzso zzso
