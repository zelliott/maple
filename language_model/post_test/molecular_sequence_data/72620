The surface array protein zzso of zzso fetus strain zzso is zzso by seven zzso zzso genes clustered on the zzso zzso The spontaneously arising zzso strain zzso produces no zzso and carries an approximately zzso zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism underlying the loss of zzso zzso we analyzed the region containing the zzso zzso and the zzso We constructed a physical map of the zzso cluster region by aligning the clones that contain zzso zzso These analyses demonstrated that all zzso zzso were located within a limited region of about 50 zzso of zzso DNA of strain zzso The zzso deletion was located within this cluster and was zzso zzso in zzso The deletion occurred between two zzso zzso and resulted in the formation of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the upstream regions and the zzso regions of all zzso zzso revealed a high degree of zzso However, only one zzso zzso contained a putative promoter zzso This promoter sequence was located in the deleted zzso Thus, the deletion of the promoter appears to be responsible for the loss of zzso expression in zzso
