The zzso coli protein zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family of putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso so called because they share the highly zzso motif zzso together with several other zzso zzso We have investigated zzso expression under conditions where an zzso promoter is zzso In this context, translation initiation does not occur at the previously identified zzso but at an upstream, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso initiation zzso to zzso virtually zzso zzso zzso suggesting an unusual translation initiation zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso we have zzso zzso quantities of zzso to zzso and shown that the zzso protein zzso zzso in an zzso zzso This zzso activity is interesting in that, unlike that of other DEAD box proteins investigated to date, it absolutely requires a specific bacterial zzso which we have identified as zzso zzso This observation is particularly significant since zzso will bind other zzso and DNA, but will only zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso
