zzso patterns differ widely among the classical type zzso I) of zzso alcohol zzso For the rabbit zzso the possibility of zzso has been reported but structural evidence is zzso This system was now studied at both the zzso and protein zzso Ten zzso zzso coding for zzso alcohol zzso were isolated from a rabbit liver zzso library using a human DNA zzso as zzso The zzso spanned zzso zzso including the entire coding zzso All clones coded for the same zzso and Northern blots identified a single zzso corresponding to about zzso zzso zzso of two protein forms zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and structural analysis revealed zzso segments identical in zzso acid zzso zzso direct protein analyses and Northern blots show the presence of only one primary translation zzso The data suggest that zzso alcohol zzso like the zzso zzso is not as zzso rich as it may appear zzso and that secondary modifications contribute substantially to zzso alcohol zzso zzso The active center of the rabbit zzso suggests similarities to the horse zzso human zzso and rat zzso structures, compatible with a steroid zzso activity shown zzso Typical zzso properties were established by direct analysis and confirmed by structural properties zzso for zzso zzso zzso for ethanol zzso zzso The zzso versus species differences mark the zzso of zzso alcohol zzso versus class III and suggest a zzso between rapid zzso differences and frequent zzso zzso
