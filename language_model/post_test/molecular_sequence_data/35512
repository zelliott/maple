zzso amendment zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso is a management practice used in zzso to improve zzso availability and recover soil zzso especially in zzso forest zzso However, whether this amendment can lead to modifications of the soil characteristics and an improvement in tree growth, and its impact on the soil bacterial communities, especially the mineral zzso bacterial communities, remains poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the short-term impact of a mineral amendment on the zzso and functional structure of the mineral zzso bacterial zzso To do this, a zzso of four-year old oak zzso zzso trees amended with or without zzso zzso was established in the experimental forest site of zzso which is characterized by an zzso soil and a low availability of calcium and zzso Three years after amendment, soil samples were used to isolate bacteria as well as to determine the soil characteristics and the zzso zzso of these soil microbial zzso Based on a zzso for zzso the zzso of zzso zzso we demonstrate that the bacterial zzso coming from the zzso bulk soil were significantly more efficient than those from the amended bulk zzso No difference was observed between the bacterial zzso coming from the amended and zzso zzso zzso the zzso analyses revealed a dominance of bacterial zzso belonging to the zzso zzso in both zzso Overall, our results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso into soil impacts the distribution and the efficacy of mineral zzso bacterial communities coming from the soil but not those coming from the zzso
