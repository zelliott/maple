zzso is included within the zzso zzso a cluster of six genes originally identified in zzso In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the zzso gene and its zzso multiple zzso zzso of the most abundant zzso and zzso sequence shows that the zzso is spread over a region of approximately zzso zzso and consists of five zzso separated by four zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso region zzso the zzso of the zzso gene revealed the presence of a processed zzso of human zzso protein zzso followed by zzso zzso Only 110 zzso separate the zzso start site of zzso and zzso gene and the zzso direction is zzso Earlier studies defined the 110 zzso region essential for promoter activity of zzso Here, we show that this region stimulates zzso with a slightly different efficiency in both zzso The zzso promoter lacks an identifiable zzso box and is characterized by a zzso island that extends through the first zzso into the first zzso of both zzso These features are characteristic of zzso genes and are consistent with the wide tissue distribution observed for zzso zzso zzso encodes three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso which result from alternative zzso Two protein products, zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso of zzso between the full-length zzso or zzso and the green fluorescent protein zzso allowed to zzso both proteins in the zzso
