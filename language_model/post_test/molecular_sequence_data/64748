To isolate and characterize bovine lens zzso activity that zzso the zzso bond in zzso zzso 

The zzso activity in young bovine lens zzso was measured using the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso was monitored by zzso zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by means of several zzso zzso An zzso zzso digest of the zzso zzso was analyzed by using zzso zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso was determined with zzso and its zzso zzso fragments isolated from aged bovine zzso were tested for their zzso to degradation by a newly identified zzso 

zzso zzso zzso activity was localized mainly in the outer zzso of the zzso A characterization study showed that the zzso zzso was zzso and metal zzso zzso mass zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso analysis of an zzso zzso digest matched the protein sequence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically at zzso and zzso at zzso Basic or zzso zzso acids at zzso and zzso positions in the zzso were preferred over zzso zzso zzso activity was also inhibited by zzso levels of zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso and zzso (3 zzso zzso The zzso fragments obtained from aged bovine zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso 

This study shows the presence of zzso in the bovine zzso Its unique zzso specificity and regulation of its activity by zzso and zzso suggest that zzso has an important role in zzso zzso in the zzso
