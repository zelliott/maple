A zzso library was constructed using zzso isolated from the zzso of chickens which had been treated with zzso This library was screened with a zzso probe complementary to mouse zzso zzso and eight chicken zzso zzso clones were zzso All of the zzso clones contained zzso sequences zzso to regions of the longest zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter contained an open reading frame of 189 zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence indicates a protein of 63 zzso acids of which 20 are zzso zzso zzso acid composition and partial zzso acid sequence analyses of zzso chicken zzso protein agreed with the zzso acid composition and sequence deduced from the cloned zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons establish that chicken zzso shares extensive zzso with zzso zzso but is more closely related to the zzso than to the zzso zzso from various zzso The zzso sequence of the coding region of chicken zzso shares approximately zzso zzso with the consensus sequence for the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of chicken DNA indicates that the chicken zzso gene is not a part of a large family of related zzso but rather is likely to be a unique gene zzso In the chicken liver, levels of chicken zzso zzso were rapidly induced by metals zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was present in low levels in embryonic liver and increased to high levels during the first week after zzso before decreasing again to the zzso levels found in adult zzso The results of this study establish that zzso is highly zzso between birds and zzso and is regulated in the chicken by agents which also regulate expression of zzso zzso zzso However, in contrast to the zzso the results suggest the existence of a single zzso of zzso in the zzso
