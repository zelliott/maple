Gene zzso is thought to provide raw material for functional divergence and zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a duplicated gene of the zzso in fish zzso but its function has remained zzso Here we reveal that zzso zzso zzso zzso display a downward tail zzso and have zzso zzso Then, we demonstrate that zzso contributes to a divergent function in zzso through zzso pathway, because zzso zzso reduces target gene expression of zzso zzso and also zzso slow muscle development and neural tube patterning through zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso display defects in heart and visceral organ zzso and, some zzso zzso zzso markers expressed in left side are zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso duplicated zzso contributes to a divergent function in zzso through zzso zzso and maintains the common function for zzso asymmetry zzso
