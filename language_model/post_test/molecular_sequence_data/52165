The surface zzso protein of zzso zzso was isolated, zzso and zzso The zzso protein is the major protein of the cell, with an apparent molecular mass of 46 zzso in sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso electron zzso with zzso zzso against the isolated zzso protein was used to confirm the surface location of this zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the intact zzso protein and its zzso peptides were zzso The gene of the zzso protein was amplified from the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso according to the zzso zzso acid zzso as zzso The zzso chain reaction fragments containing the entire zzso gene and its regulatory regions were zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed one open reading frame with a capacity to zzso a protein of zzso zzso From the regulatory region of the zzso two subsequent promoters and a zzso binding site, showing typical features of zzso consensus zzso were zzso The coding region contained a characteristic zzso signal zzso of 30 zzso zzso zzso of the signal zzso results in a zzso of 435 zzso zzso which is in excellent agreement with the size of the zzso protein determined by zzso The size and the zzso end analyses of the zzso transcripts confirmed the zzso nature of the zzso zzso and the functionality of the two promoters zzso
