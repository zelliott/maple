The kidney plays an essential role in regulating zzso and acid zzso A major site for these regulations is in the collecting zzso In the present study, we report the primary sequence of a novel alpha zzso of the zzso gene family, which we isolated from the urinary zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso equivalent of the zzso collecting zzso The zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids which shares approximately zzso identity with the alpha 1 zzso of the zzso zzso and approximately zzso identity with the alpha zzso of the zzso gastric zzso When zzso in zzso zzso with a beta zzso isolated from the same zzso library, the zzso is able to transport zzso (a zzso zzso inward, and hydrogen outward, leading to zzso of the zzso compartment and zzso of the external zzso The novel zzso has a unique pharmacological profile showing intermediate sensitivity to both zzso and zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso zzso is a member of a new zzso motive zzso zzso The zzso zzso is expressed in the urinary tract but not in the stomach or the zzso This zzso may be one of the molecules involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso the transport of these zzso across urinary zzso and therefore regulating their urinary zzso
