Plant zzso zzso peptides have diverse roles in plant growth and zzso Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of five new zzso genes from the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike typical plant zzso peptides that contain a single zzso zzso four of the five zzso genes zzso zzso proteins with multiple zzso zzso These zzso genes were found to be specifically expressed within the zzso zzso zzso cell of zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role for their zzso proteins in plant zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso those of plant zzso zzso and zzso proteins could rescue the zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed within zzso A short root zzso was observed when synthetic zzso peptides were zzso applied to roots of zzso or potato similar to the zzso of zzso genes in zzso and potato zzso zzso These results reveal that zzso zzso zzso proteins with either single or multiple zzso motifs function similarly to plant zzso proteins and that zzso signaling components are zzso in both zzso and potato zzso Furthermore, our results provide evidence to suggest that the evolution of multiple zzso motifs may be an important mechanism for generating functional diversity in zzso zzso proteins to facilitate zzso
