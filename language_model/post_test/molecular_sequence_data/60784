Experimental allergic zzso zzso the principal animal model of multiple zzso is genetically zzso To date, 13 zzso zzso have been identified in the mouse by whole zzso scanning using an zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two quantitative trait zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso 11 were identified by classical zzso linkage analysis and zzso zzso Both zzso were reported to be associated with severity and duration of clinical zzso zzso was subsequently shown to be a unique locus controlling the development of zzso zzso zzso In this study, composite zzso mapping resolved zzso into two linked zzso zzso at zzso zzso is associated with disease severity, and zzso at zzso zzso associated with the duration of clinical zzso Additionally, composite zzso mapping significantly refined the locations of zzso zzso and zzso thereby zzso systematic candidate gene screening by zzso sequencing of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were not seen in zzso and zzso zzso candidate genes for zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso sequence zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were excluded as candidates for zzso However, multiple sequence zzso resulting in significant zzso acid zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso Given the role of zzso in zzso these sequence zzso are promising candidates for zzso a locus associated with severity of clinical signs and zzso to the zzso less severe zzso zzso form of zzso
