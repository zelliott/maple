Nuclear hormone receptors zzso are important regulators of development and metabolism in animal zzso They are characterized by the ability to regulate gene expression in response to the binding of small zzso zzso hormones, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains zzso sequences that share zzso to zzso and insect zzso a surprisingly large number compared with other zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso are zzso and are referred to as supplementary nuclear receptors zzso that are thought to have originated by zzso of an ancient zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report on the function of zzso a member of a zzso of 18 zzso zzso zzso that share zzso domain sequence zzso zzso is expressed from at least two zzso generates at least three zzso and is zzso in zzso body wall, and sex muscles as well as in a subset of zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso or a zzso with an zzso region zzso results in late embryonic and early zzso arrest with defects in zzso and zzso The zzso loss of function zzso includes irregular development of body wall muscle cells and impaired movement and coordination resembling zzso zzso zzso joins the list of zzso zzso zzso that regulate development and suggests that members of extensive zzso zzso family have acquired varied and novel functions during zzso
