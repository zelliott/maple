As in many other zzso zzso bacteria, the zzso type III zzso system is essential for the zzso of zzso zzso on host zzso The expression of most of the type III zzso genes previously isolated from zzso zzso is zzso with those of zzso genes by an zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to isolate type zzso zzso zzso we screened zzso genes in zzso zzso Using a zzso system, we isolated 30 novel zzso zzso zzso genes outside the zzso gene zzso Most of the zzso genes contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif in their putative promoter zzso Seven zzso genes zzso zzso of known type III zzso and type zzso proteins found in other animal and plant zzso Four zzso known zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, six zzso genes zzso two types of zzso repeat zzso zzso Products of the remaining genes did not show any significant zzso to known zzso We also identified two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso downstream of zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso but not zzso was required for both the zzso and ability to induce hypersensitive reaction on zzso We show that a zzso zzso zzso still produces zzso zzso on the cell surface although it shows a typical zzso zzso on zzso
