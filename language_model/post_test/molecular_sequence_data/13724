For better understanding of the role of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in the brain, the expression of zzso zzso was studied in the mature rat brain at both protein and zzso levels, by zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, Northern zzso in zzso zzso and zzso It was shown that zzso mature rat brain contained substantial zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso significant amounts of two sizes of transcripts zzso zzso widely, and zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso were expressed in the brain, and zzso the transcripts were localized in ubiquitous zzso by in zzso zzso with the strongest signal in zzso zzso cells, which distribution almost corresponded with that of the zzso zzso The abundant zzso zzso of the transcript and zzso as well as the zzso expression of the zzso reported elsewhere, suggests the role of the growth factor in zzso cells as a zzso regulatory and/or zzso agent acting by zzso loop or by zzso to zzso zzso However, there was an apparent zzso in part, in the distribution between transcripts and zzso that is, transcripts were expressed intensely in the intermediate zzso lobe with only a scattered zzso and the opposite situation was observed in the accessory zzso nerve and zzso zzso zzso This might suggest that zzso zzso is transported or zzso in these zzso
