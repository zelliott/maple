Transfer of a zzso containing zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso expands the host range for zzso to include the perennial tropical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments with a series of zzso established that zzso and its associated zzso promoter from zzso are sufficient to zzso this extended zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso contains its own copy of zzso including upstream zzso zzso Although both zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the reading frames are zzso between the two zzso there are gaps within the promoter region and the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso the deduced zzso protein of zzso is shorter than its counterpart from zzso and the distance between the zzso and the initiation zzso is zzso A 36 zzso deletion encompasses the extreme right border of the zzso zzso and extends into the upstream leader zzso zzso zzso with both zzso confirmed that the promoter from zzso is zzso and that the zzso from zzso is zzso These observations were zzso by Northern analysis with a zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso gave an intense zzso but those of zzso yielded only a weak trace of zzso zzso fragments with zzso to zzso of zzso are present in 17 of 35 tested zzso including several representatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso lack this zzso We conclude that a genetic zzso in expression of zzso accounts for the inability of zzso to zzso zzso and that diverse zzso may have evolved alternative mechanisms to zzso this zzso zzso
