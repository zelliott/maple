During zzso zzso the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso The solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain reveals a novel zzso fold consisting of a left-handed zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso domain binds an zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso repeats and three zzso zzso zzso whereas a single zzso repeat is insufficient for zzso zzso that show strong chemical shift zzso upon zzso binding cluster in two zzso Both zzso zzso side chains contact the zzso zzso One of the zzso binds in the region with the strongest chemical shift zzso formed by the two zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain fold resembles the structure of an zzso zzso domain in bacterial zzso factors zzso zzso in zzso
