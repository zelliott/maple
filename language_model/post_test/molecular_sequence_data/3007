We used zzso difference analysis to discover new genes with specific expression in zzso zzso Among other zzso we identified zzso zzso a member of the short chain alcohol zzso family to be zzso during zzso to zzso cell zzso Originally cloned from zzso zzso cells zzso zzso was exclusively expressed in zzso zzso cells within the zzso zzso The presence of different transcripts in zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and various zzso could be traced back to alternative zzso and alternative promoter zzso We describe here the complete zzso organization of zzso including two alternative promoter zzso a zzso promoter which was induced by the zzso zzso inhibitor sodium zzso in several other cell types, and a second upstream promoter which was specifically active in zzso zzso zzso Its exclusive usage in zzso zzso cells makes the alternative zzso promoter an interesting target to study zzso gene zzso
