zzso fragments zzso that bind specifically to particles of cucumber mosaic zzso zzso were obtained from a library which encodes a diverse array of synthetic zzso fragments, each displayed on the surface of zzso zzso After four rounds of selection and enrichment, several clones were obtained which produced zzso that bound specifically to zzso particles of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA resulted in the same restriction pattern for all zzso The zzso sequences of three of the clones showed that they belonged to the human zzso family and that they had a zzso determining region loop of 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso by these clones reacted with particles of zzso in sap from infected plants in zzso In zzso tests, soluble zzso preparations reacted with zzso coat protein extracted from zzso preparations of zzso zzso belonging to either zzso I or II and also with protein extracted by zzso treatment of seeds harvested from naturally infected zzso zzso The results demonstrate the zzso and potential zzso of zzso zzso methods in plant zzso
