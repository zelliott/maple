The cloned zzso for rat zzso zzso was found to contain a zzso open reading frame which zzso a zzso acid protein sharing zzso identity with the human zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the rat zzso zzso zzso as a single species of zzso zzso is expressed abundantly in the zzso and zzso High levels of expression were also observed in the stomach, zzso heart, zzso liver, and skeletal zzso Low but significant expression was also seen in the brain and zzso Furthermore, the regional distribution and cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso were examined by in zzso zzso analysis of rat tissue zzso The definitive signals for the zzso were localized in smooth muscle cells of the zzso zzso and zzso and in the cells of the zzso tunic surrounding the zzso zzso which are characterized as smooth muscle zzso Besides smooth muscle cells, signals were also detected in the zzso of the heart zzso lung zzso cells and kidney inner zzso zzso and zzso zzso
