Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso We show that zzso is zzso and zzso by the zzso and that zzso stability is regulated by a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activity, which is required for zzso zzso We also define a zzso acid sequence found in both zzso and the zzso regulatory protein zzso which, upon zzso targets both proteins for zzso zzso of a single zzso within the zzso targeting sequence prevents zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso targeting sequence of zzso may be zzso
