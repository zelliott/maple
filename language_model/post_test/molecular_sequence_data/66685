zzso of zzso zzso or zzso with the zzso zzso complex zzso class I zzso is critical for the development and function of zzso T zzso Although the crystal structure of zzso complex revealed that two zzso zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso with one zzso engaged in more extensive interaction than the other, the details of the interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso remained zzso The zzso zzso of mouse zzso and zzso are similar in the size, shape, and surface zzso potential of their zzso regions, suggesting that their interactions with zzso could be very zzso Indeed, we found that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were functionally inactive as zzso could form an active zzso with zzso zzso zzso as a zzso or zzso zzso We also identified zzso zzso that could form active receptors with zzso zzso but not with zzso This observation is consistent with the notion that the zzso zzso may replace either zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we showed that both zzso and zzso zzso were unable to completely block the zzso activity of zzso zzso We propose that zzso binds to zzso in at least two distinguishable zzso
