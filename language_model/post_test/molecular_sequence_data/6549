We have investigated the in zzso efficacy of a systemic gene transfer method, which combines a zzso delivery system zzso zzso with zzso zzso DNA plasmids to effect long-term expression of a zzso in zzso A single zzso injection of a zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso gene as a marker was administered with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene and its product were found in all mouse zzso tested as determined by zzso analysis and zzso zzso activity was also detected in all zzso tested and was present in zzso liver, zzso and heart up to 3 months zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso tested zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso showed long-term zzso zzso We found that these zzso zzso zzso zzso in lung 2 weeks zzso zzso indicated that zzso expression in specific zzso depended on the promoter element used, zzso zzso dose of DNA per injection, and route of zzso
