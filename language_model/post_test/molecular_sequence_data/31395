We studied DNA sequences zzso to zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of 30 patients with neurological disorders in zzso where zzso is highly zzso The regions of zzso amplified by means of zzso chain reaction zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our system specifically detected zzso sequences only from zzso cells and was sufficiently sensitive to detect one zzso copy per zzso zzso All zzso cases were zzso including 4 cases of tropical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one case each of zzso zzso zzso and multiple sclerosis zzso The zzso rate of patients, excluding 4 zzso cases, was zzso zzso which is similar to the zzso of the adult population in the zzso The data suggest that multiple sclerosis is not associated with zzso zzso
