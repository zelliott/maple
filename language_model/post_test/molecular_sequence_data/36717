zzso zzso has been used to probe zzso acid zzso proposed to be critical in zzso by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is zzso in all known zzso The zzso constant of a zzso zzso towards zzso acid zzso was reduced to zzso of wild type activity, while its zzso and stability against zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited almost normal activity but altered zzso zzso Replacement of zzso with Ala led to a zzso decrease of activity without markedly affecting zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed normal zzso function but impaired stability in zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso group of zzso is directly involved in zzso probably by favorably interacting with a transition state or zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso both putative target sites of the zzso zzso are functionally less zzso
