zzso zzso genes play essential roles in flower development, but whether and how they work with floral organ identity genes remain less zzso Here, we describe interactions of the rice zzso zzso zzso gene zzso with other rice floral zzso genes in flower zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso specifies the identity of the three inner whorls and floral zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was shown to define zzso development and floral zzso by interacting with zzso zzso and control the zzso and floral zzso identities together with the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the transcript levels of six zzso zzso and zzso genes were reduced in zzso at the early flower zzso stage, suggesting that zzso is a key regulator of early flower zzso Moreover, zzso can directly bind to a putative regulatory motif on zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed zzso similar to that of zzso These results suggest that zzso is a key player in specifying flower development via interacting with other floral zzso genes in rice, thus providing new insights into the mechanism by which flower development is zzso
