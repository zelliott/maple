To locate transient zzso aberrations on a selected pepper zzso and determine the tracing efficiency of different zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with an acute dose of zzso zzso zzso and zzso aberrations were zzso by different zzso methods zzso silver zzso for zzso organizer regions zzso positive zzso organizing regions or zzso fluorescent zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A rearranged zzso carrying two zzso organizing regions zzso induced by zzso radiation was detected in the zzso with the occurrence of a small zzso exchange between a zzso of pair zzso 1 and another zzso of pair zzso 3, both carrying active zzso in short arms and associated zzso A zzso negative zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a zzso zzso confirming a zzso zzso between two zzso 

The use of zzso in zzso allowed us to develop and identify a pepper line with structural zzso between two zzso zzso We zzso that all the zzso techniques employed in this research were efficient in the search for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the most suitable in those cases of transient zzso whereas fluorescent zzso and FISH were appropriate for zzso zzso
