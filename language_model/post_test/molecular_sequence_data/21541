zzso zzso zzso zzso form a zzso of proteins covering abroad spectrum of different biological zzso Here we describe the zzso characterization of zzso the first zzso from the sugar cane zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to inhibit bovine zzso by the formation of the zzso complex zzso demonstrated by zzso and mass zzso zzso We also have determined the zzso site at the zzso center loop, by the analysis of the zzso released from de zzso of zzso zzso we investigated the zzso expression of zzso in different stages of zzso zzso zzso Thus the specificity of zzso in addition with its zzso coding being transcribed through all zzso of the zzso can suggest a possible role in defense mechanism by regulating the action of zzso zzso zzso zzso
