The design of zzso with new functions and properties has long been a goal in protein zzso Here, we report a strategy to change the zzso activity of an existing protein zzso This was achieved by simultaneous incorporation and adjustment of functional elements through zzso zzso and substitution of several active site zzso followed by point zzso to fine-tune the zzso Using this approach, we were able to introduce zzso activity into the zzso zzso scaffold of zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely lost its original activity and, instead, zzso the zzso of zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus increasing resistance to zzso coli growth on zzso by a factor of about zzso
