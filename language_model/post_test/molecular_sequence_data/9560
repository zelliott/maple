zzso zzso zzso is the most common genetic lethal disorder in zzso zzso in zzso trigger the most common form of MD, zzso and its zzso zzso Becker zzso zzso is the closest zzso and has been shown to compensate for the loss of zzso in human disease animal zzso However, the structural and functional similarities and differences between zzso and zzso are less zzso Both proteins interact with zzso through their zzso zzso domain zzso In this study, we examined the zzso stability and zzso of zzso zzso and compared with that of zzso Our results show that zzso zzso has zzso properties similar to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso has decreased zzso and zzso stability, unfolds faster, and is zzso more susceptible to zzso which might account for its decreased in zzso zzso compared to zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso to a lesser extent compared with zzso zzso contrary to the general behavior of proteins in which decreased stability enhances protein zzso Despite these differences in stability and zzso both proteins exhibit deleterious effects of zzso When zzso zzso zzso analogous in position to the zzso zzso zzso were generated, they behaved similarly to zzso zzso in terms of decreased stability and the formation of zzso zzso indicating a possible role for zzso zzso in disease zzso
