zzso repetitive sequences are frequently involved in zzso and zzso zzso events in the zzso zzso mechanisms involved in zzso zzso events are strand exchange, promoted by DNA pairing between highly zzso zzso repeats, and subsequent strand zzso zzso zzso sequences might play a more active role in zzso processes in the zzso We describe a novel zzso zzso deletion zzso encompassing the zzso and zzso genes and zzso in a zzso of zzso zzso This deletion appears similar, although not zzso to the previously described zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of both the zzso and zzso deletion zzso clearly indicate that the mechanism leading to these zzso deletions involves zzso between the highly zzso zzso arranged zzso repeats at both parental sides, which are normally 33 zzso zzso zzso of zzso positions along the zzso consensus sequence indicate the involvement of a zzso core sequence in two out of five zzso zzso This sequence has been identified by others as a possible hotspot of zzso These findings zzso the idea that zzso repeats stimulate zzso events not only by zzso zzso but also by providing binding sites for zzso zzso
