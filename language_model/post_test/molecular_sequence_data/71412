To identify genes zzso during the process of zzso cell differentiation of airway zzso cells, differential display was used to compare zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso cells cultured under conditions that zzso zzso cell zzso Several partial complementary zzso zzso were identified whose expression was regulated zzso with zzso cell zzso One of these, zzso detected a zzso zzso transcript of approximately 6 zzso when used as a probe on Northern blots of zzso from zzso cultures but was zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso of overlapping clones obtained by a modified rapid amplification of zzso ends procedure generated a complete zzso sequence that exhibited no significant zzso to sequences in zzso indicating that zzso is a novel zzso Southern analysis demonstrated that zzso exists as a zzso zzso zzso contains a long open reading frame predicted to code for a protein of zzso 200 zzso Several putative functional motifs are present in the zzso including a zzso zzso domain, three nuclear zzso signals, a consensus zzso and a zzso region, suggesting that zzso has a unique zzso zzso was zzso in heart and liver samples, but was expressed in brain and zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expression was zzso and appeared to be highest in zzso and round zzso During differentiation of zzso cells, the expression of zzso closely paralleled that of an zzso zzso heavy zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the differentiation or function of zzso cells in the zzso
