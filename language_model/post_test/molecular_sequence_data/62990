We developed an zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso dengue specific memory T cells zzso by a primary dengue virus zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso of volunteers who received experimental live attenuated zzso DEN vaccines were zzso with zzso zzso zzso cell culture zzso from all four DEN zzso zzso T cell zzso to previously identified zzso class II peptides were equivalent to zzso of the responses using virus infected cell zzso in two zzso zzso responses to DEN were detected from zzso to zzso zzso T zzso The highest zzso response was zzso by zzso from the zzso zzso We detected zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso responses from all zzso This zzso is suitable for measuring DEN specific zzso T cells in human zzso from large population studies where donor zzso is unknown or highly zzso
