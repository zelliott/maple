The zzso tumor zzso protein zzso by the zzso larvae, zzso gene of zzso zzso forms high molecular mass complexes consisting predominantly of zzso zzso To determine whether zzso can zzso in the absence of other binding factors, we analyzed the size of in zzso zzso zzso by gel zzso and found that zzso is always recovered in a high molecular mass form, demonstrating that zzso can zzso on its zzso Previous studies have revealed that zzso may contain three zzso zzso To more accurately delineate these zzso we have generated a series of 32 zzso proteins made of defined portions of zzso fused to protein A, which behaves as a zzso zzso and determined the level of zzso of the fused zzso This study allowed us to map three discrete zzso zzso each of approximately 50 zzso acid zzso in zzso These zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso are located between zzso acid zzso 160 and zzso 247 and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Further analysis showed that the zzso and zzso zzso can bind to themselves and to each zzso We also mapped a domain in zzso between zzso acid zzso 377 and zzso which strongly reduces the degree of zzso of zzso proteins containing zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso examination of zzso stained zzso proteins showed that protein A fused with either the domain zzso or the domain zzso forms discrete structures consistent with the formation of zzso complexes, whereas protein A fused to a zzso binding domain of zzso appeared zzso Our results indicate that zzso alone is able to build zzso structures forming a network with which other proteins zzso As revealed by the zzso zzso resulting from the zzso of the zzso zzso the organization of the zzso network and its association with other proteins play critical roles in the control of cell zzso
