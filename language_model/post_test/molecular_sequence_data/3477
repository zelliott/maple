zzso genes are created by zzso from zzso zzso of expressed zzso The estimated amount of processed copies of genes in the human zzso is zzso Some of these might be zzso with the expected pattern for zzso zzso but some others might be an important source of new zzso We have studied the evolution of a zzso zzso processed gene zzso described in humans and believed to be a zzso We zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and obtained zzso data for human coding zzso We found evidence that zzso likely produces a functional zzso as an example of addressing functionality for human processed zzso First, the open reading frame was intact despite many deletions that occurred in the 3' untranslated zzso Second, it appears that the gene is zzso Finally, zzso and zzso variation for zzso was not consistent with the neutral model proposed for zzso suggesting that a new functional zzso gene has zzso zzso acid divergence was significantly higher than synonymous divergence in zzso zzso supporting positive selection acting in this zzso This role of selection was further supported by the excess of rare zzso in a population genetic zzso zzso is located in a region of very low zzso therefore, it is conceivable that the rapid fixation events in this newly arising gene may have contributed to a selective sweep of variation in the zzso
