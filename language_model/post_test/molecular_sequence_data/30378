zzso of zzso zzso type b zzso to human zzso cells is zzso by zzso which are zzso filaments that extend outward from the bacterial cell zzso zzso from zzso strain zzso were zzso and the primary structure of the major zzso zzso was zzso zzso of overlapping peptides showed the mature protein to be comprised of 196 zzso acids and to have an Mr of zzso The zzso terminal sequence was found to be zzso with the sequence previously reported for zzso strain zzso and also to have significant zzso to zzso of other zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso had two zzso zzso in the zzso terminal portion of the protein which were separated by 40 zzso zzso 21 and zzso a motif found in other bacterial zzso The data show that zzso zzso has structural features common to other bacterial zzso
