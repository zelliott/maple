A zzso zzso was zzso and cloned from zzso bodies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso degrade zzso zzso a unique and essential component of zzso cell zzso The complementary DNA of zzso includes an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso an 18 zzso acid signal zzso and the zzso zzso acid mature zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso is a member of zzso zzso family 30, and highly similar genes are broadly zzso among zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and was highly specific toward zzso zzso It is known that the cell walls of zzso bodies of zzso are zzso after harvesting by means of zzso zzso The transcript level of zzso gene zzso was significantly increased in zzso bodies after zzso Moreover, zzso showed zzso activity against the cell wall components of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is responsible for the degradation of the cell wall components during zzso body zzso after zzso
