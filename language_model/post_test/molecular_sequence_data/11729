The zzso supply of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been reported to be a major limitation to zzso growth in zzso We aim to improve the protein quality of forage for zzso by introducing into alfalfa zzso genes zzso a zzso stable, sulfur zzso zzso protein from sunflower zzso Four gene zzso were transferred to Australian commercial zzso of alfalfa using zzso zzso transformation and selection with zzso zzso zzso of the sunflower seed zzso zzso region by addition of the coding information for an zzso zzso zzso retention signal was found to greatly increase the level to which the sulfur zzso zzso protein accumulated in the leaves of transgenic alfalfa zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter and two zzso plant gene promoter regions were compared for their ability to direct high-level expression of the introduced genes in alfalfa zzso The highest expression of sunflower seed zzso was found in zzso bearing a gene incorporating the promoter from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso small zzso The highest level of sunflower seed zzso found in transgenic alfalfa leaves was estimated to constitute zzso of soluble leaf zzso This level of zzso of the foreign protein would be predicted to supply an extra 40 zzso of sulfur zzso acids daily to sheep fed the modified zzso Published studies in which zzso growth rates were significantly increased employed supplementation of approximately 1 to 2 g of sulfur zzso acids zzso
