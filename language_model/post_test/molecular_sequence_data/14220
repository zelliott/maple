zzso to zzso track, and modify proteins in living cells are central for understanding the spatial and zzso zzso of life inside zzso Although fluorescent proteins have proven to be extremely useful for in zzso studies of protein function, their utility is inherently limited because their spectral and structural characteristics are zzso These limitations have spurred the creation of alternative approaches for the chemical labeling of zzso We report in this work the use of zzso resonance zzso transfer zzso zzso split zzso for the zzso labeling and zzso zzso zzso of proteins in living zzso We have successfully employed this approach for the zzso zzso labeling of the DNA binding domain zzso of the zzso factor zzso using several human cell zzso Moreover, we have shown that this approach can be also used for zzso proteins to control their cellular zzso and potentially alter their biological zzso
