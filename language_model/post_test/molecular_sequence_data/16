The mature cotton zzso zzso zzso fiber is a single cell with a typically thickened secondary cell zzso The aim of this research was to use zzso zzso and chemical techniques to investigate the possible occurrence of previously overlooked zzso of zzso during secondary cell wall formation in cotton zzso Relative quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction analysis showed that zzso and zzso were predominantly expressed among seven gene zzso only zzso was zzso during secondary wall formation in cotton zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso belonged to Class I and was proposed to have a major role in zzso zzso and zzso belonged to Class III and was proposed to have a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparison showed that the zzso binding sites of zzso were highly zzso with high similarity and identity to bona fide zzso alcohol zzso The zzso binding site of zzso is different from zzso This difference was confirmed by the different zzso activities observed with the zzso Cell wall zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and chemical analyses confirmed that zzso compounds were bound to the cell walls of mature cotton zzso Our findings may suggest a potential for genetic manipulation of cotton fiber properties, which are of central importance to zzso cotton processing and textile zzso
