zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new technique allowing simultaneous introduction of multiple zzso zzso into zzso DNA by leveraging two existing ideas: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pairs of zzso zzso results in zzso exponential amplification of linear fragments of DNA zzso zzso yet zzso zzso These products are amenable to zzso zzso which efficiently assembles them into a zzso zzso zzso Because the technique relies on zzso zzso zzso zzso is additionally amenable to other relevant DNA modifications such as insertions and zzso Here we provide a detailed description of the zzso zzso concept and highlight its versatility by applying it to three experiments currently intractable with standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has the potential to become widely used for zzso zzso
