zzso zzso is the first step in zzso a key process in the global nitrogen cycle that results in the formation of nitrate through microbial zzso The increase in nitrate availability in zzso is important for plant nutrition, but it also has considerable impact on groundwater pollution zzso to zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso are more abundant in zzso than their well-known bacterial zzso We investigated the abundance of the gene zzso a zzso of the key zzso zzso zzso zzso in 12 pristine and agricultural zzso of three zzso zzso zzso gene copies of zzso zzso were up to zzso more abundant than bacterial zzso zzso High amounts of zzso zzso including zzso correlated with the abundance of zzso zzso gene zzso Furthermore, reverse zzso quantitative zzso studies and complementary DNA analysis using novel zzso zzso technology demonstrated the activity of the zzso in zzso and supported the zzso dominance of zzso over bacterial zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso may be the most abundant zzso organisms in soil zzso on zzso
