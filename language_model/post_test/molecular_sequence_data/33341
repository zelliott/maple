The B4 resistance zzso gene cluster is one of the largest clusters known in common bean zzso zzso zzso It is located in a peculiar zzso environment in the zzso region of the short arm of zzso 4, adjacent to two zzso blocks zzso We zzso 650 zzso spanning this locus and zzso 97 zzso 26 of which zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed between the zzso B4 locus and corresponding regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The notable exception was the zzso zzso which were completely absent in these zzso The origin of the zzso zzso sequences was investigated through zzso analysis, which reveals that, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are shared among zzso zzso (4 and zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso zzso was derived from zzso sequences from another zzso the zzso zzso through an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the soybean zzso zzso zzso data enables us to date more precisely this event and also to zzso that a single zzso moved from the zzso to the B4 zzso Moreover, we identified a new zzso satellite zzso referred to as zzso specific to the zzso zzso present both between zzso sequences and in the two knobs identified at the B4 R gene zzso The zzso repeat is present on most zzso zzso indicating the existence of frequent zzso zzso events in zzso zzso zzso Our results highlight the importance of zzso zzso in R gene zzso
