We have detected DNA binding activity for a synthetic zzso containing an zzso consensus sequence in nuclear extracts from human zzso Changes in the levels of zzso zzso binding activity were examined in nuclear extracts from freshly isolated human zzso from zzso that had been cultured under conditions that allowed the maintenance of a zzso zzso on plastic dishes coated with the zzso zzso zzso and from zzso induced to zzso into zzso cells by passage in zzso culture on plastic zzso It was observed that zzso binding was zzso greater in nuclear extracts from zzso zzso than in nuclear extracts from either freshly isolated zzso or from cells cultured in zzso The zzso binding activity was specific, since it was zzso by zzso zzso but not by zzso or zzso The addition of a zzso zzso against zzso to nuclear extracts from freshly isolated zzso or to extracts isolated from zzso cultured in zzso decreased the binding of zzso by approximately zzso However, when the same experiment was carried out with nuclear extracts prepared from cells cultured on zzso zzso plates, only a very slight zzso of zzso binding was zzso When fragments of the zzso promoter containing putative zzso binding sites amplified by zzso chain reaction were zzso it was found that the amounts of zzso complex formed with nuclear extracts from zzso zzso were zzso greater than the amounts formed with nuclear extracts from freshly isolated zzso or from cells cultured in zzso zzso of DNA binding activity by zzso experiments demonstrated that nuclear extracts from zzso cells contained approximately zzso greater zzso specific binding activity than nuclear extracts from zzso The direct role of zzso in type II collagen gene zzso was demonstrated by zzso experiments of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Schneider line zzso cells that lack zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso binding activity in human zzso and of differences in zzso DNA binding activity between differentiated and zzso zzso
