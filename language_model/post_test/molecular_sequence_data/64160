zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in regulating the zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso and zzso C as well as by binding directly to proteins that control the processes of zzso zzso zzso filament zzso zzso zzso zzso and bundling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kirschner, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso Three related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso and appear to play distinct roles in zzso zzso Here we have identified a fourth member of this family by searching the human zzso and zzso data zzso This new zzso which we have designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed at relatively high levels in brain and zzso zzso of zzso expressed in zzso cells contain zzso zzso activity, but this activity is not affected by zzso in zzso that zzso other type I zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso can be explained by the ability of zzso to zzso with other type I zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso resulted in zzso increase in total zzso zzso zzso without a significant net increase in total zzso When zzso with zzso green fluorescent protein zzso fusion construct of the zzso zzso domain from zzso zzso zzso zzso localized in zzso zzso structures, suggesting an unusual zzso site of zzso zzso Finally, expression of zzso induced the reorganization of zzso from predominantly stress fibers to predominantly zzso and zzso similar to those observed previously in cells infected with the zzso pathogen zzso or zzso with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as a scaffold to zzso and regulate type I zzso zzso and the synthesis of zzso
