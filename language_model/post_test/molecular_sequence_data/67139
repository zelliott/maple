Because impaired cellular zzso activities are linked to many diseases, such as cancer, zzso zzso and infection, internally zzso fluorescent peptides have recently been developed as tools for analyzing the zzso of these zzso Here we report convenient and cost-effective approaches for the selective zzso zzso assembly of such zzso peptides for zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups were zzso and selectively attached during synthesis to zzso groups of internal zzso zzso was then tested by zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All peptides proved to be appropriate zzso of the zzso tested and of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso we describe an innovative and cheap method to develop completely functional zzso fluorescent peptides that are usable in specific detection of individual zzso in particular zzso in both in zzso and in zzso zzso
