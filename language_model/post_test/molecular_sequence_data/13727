A zzso torpedo electric lobe zzso library was screened for the zzso zzso zzso by functional expression in zzso A zzso zzso was isolated that induced a component of zzso zzso that was zzso sensitive and inhibited by the substitution of zzso for sodium at low zzso zzso However, zzso zzso by both injected and zzso zzso were characterized by high affinity constants, suggesting that zzso could be affecting a native zzso zzso Indeed, zzso sensitive zzso zzso could also be induced by zzso of zzso zzso with a protein zzso C zzso zzso By sequence analysis and zzso the zzso produced by injection of zzso zzso was identified as a soluble 24 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Full length zzso was, however, ineffective in the functional zzso The zzso zzso by zzso zzso to the second protein zzso zzso domain of torpedo zzso and like other soluble C2 domain zzso was capable of zzso zzso to zzso Its action on zzso zzso in zzso was, however, abolished by the addition of calcium in the presence of a calcium zzso These results suggest that the interaction of certain C2 zzso such as the zzso domain of zzso with more specific targets may be zzso in the presence of calcium due to its zzso to membrane zzso
