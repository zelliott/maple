The zzso zzso domain protein zzso zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso zzso factor White zzso Complex and controls light response and zzso in zzso Blue light converts zzso from the dark state into the light state zzso with zzso zzso Upon return to zzso conditions, zzso very slowly reverts back into the zzso dark state zzso To better understand the nature of the zzso changes that are the basis for the zzso switch in zzso we used hydrogen exchange mass zzso to probe zzso accessibility of backbone zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that all structural elements of zzso except for the zzso region exchange according to the rare zzso mechanism indicating a zzso unfolding with rather slow zzso zzso Interestingly, the unfolding zzso of different elements were not identical but varied from 400 to zzso zzso also exchanges according to the zzso zzso albeit with a halftime of zzso Surprisingly, the zzso interface showed very little protection suggesting a rapid zzso zzso
