After treatment of zzso cells, a zzso zzso line, with tumor necrosis factor zzso a nuclear zzso zzso zzso factor is rapidly induced as identified by gel shift mobility zzso using the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso or zzso zzso genes as a DNA zzso When induction was carried out under conditions of increased or decreased zzso which zzso with altered zzso gene zzso nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated, but the abundance of the zzso complex observed remained zzso Also zzso of zzso B as a function of time following zzso treatment did not reveal a correlation between the abundance of the zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso cells resistant to zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor still became fully activated by zzso although the zzso gene was only marginally zzso In conclusion, discrepancies between the abundance of the activated zzso zzso factor and the zzso zzso production upon treatment with zzso indicate that zzso additional zzso zzso and/or zzso regulating zzso is zzso necessary for fine regulation of the level of zzso gene expression in response to zzso zzso
