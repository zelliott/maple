zzso injury to the zzso surface provokes an inflammatory response that is zzso in part, by zzso zzso zzso Recent studies indicate that a zzso zzso zzso zzso identified as zzso is involved in the production of these zzso which exhibit potent inflammatory and zzso zzso We have isolated and cloned a zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso and demonstrated that the zzso zzso is induced by zzso in zzso and in zzso To further understand the molecular regulation that zzso the synthesis of these potent inflammatory zzso in response to hypoxic injury, we isolated and cloned the zzso promoter zzso zzso libraries constructed from rabbit zzso zzso zzso DNA were used as templates for primary and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso of the zzso region of the zzso promoter was isolated, zzso zzso and analyzed by computer software for the presence of known zzso zzso Analysis of the promoter sequence revealed the presence of consensus DNA binding sequences for factors known to activate gene zzso in response to zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso reporter zzso zzso containing different lengths of the zzso promoter zzso demonstrated zzso zzso in rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso revealed a marked induction of nuclear binding activity for the labeled zzso probe from the zzso promoter in nuclear extracts of cells exposed to zzso This binding activity was due to zzso binding to the zzso zzso probe as shown by competition with excess zzso probe for the zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso The nuclear binding activity of zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso promoter was also enhanced in response to zzso suggesting that these zzso factors contribute to the hypoxic induction of zzso zzso The results of this study provide the first molecular zzso explanation for the induction of zzso and, zzso the production of inflammatory zzso in response to hypoxic zzso Further studies are needed to fully evaluate the molecular regulation of this gene during zzso
