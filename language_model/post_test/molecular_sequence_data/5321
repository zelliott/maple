The mouse zzso determining gene zzso is expressed in zzso cells of the zzso male zzso as a linear transcript, zzso a zzso factor containing an zzso zzso In the adult mouse zzso zzso expression occurs in zzso and zzso germ zzso The mouse zzso zzso locus is characterized by two arms of a large zzso zzso zzso a unique region that, between an zzso and a donor zzso site, contains a single zzso zzso the zzso zzso In germ cells from the adult mouse zzso zzso zzso is a circular zzso which is generated by an zzso zzso event that zzso the zzso zzso zzso Thus, a circular zzso is spliced out starting from a large linear zzso precursor containing both arms of the zzso zzso which pair and generate a large zzso zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction and an zzso protection zzso we have now mapped the zzso end of this precursor zzso in the zzso arm of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and in zzso zzso with nuclear extracts from adult germ cells further confirm that a region immediately zzso upstream of two zzso initiation sites of the precursor zzso contains a promoter sequence in which two consensus zzso binding sequences are specifically recognized by nuclear factors present in adult germ cells but not in zzso zzso We also show that the linear precursor of the zzso circular transcript and its zzso product are specifically expressed not only in adult germ cells but also in male zzso zzso between zzso and zzso days zzso immediately after the expression of the linear transcript starting from the unique zzso
