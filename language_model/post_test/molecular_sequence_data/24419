The treatment of Alzheimer's disease zzso remains a major challenge because of the incomplete understanding of the triggering events that lead to the selective zzso characteristic of zzso zzso Here we describe a new transcript of synaptic zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that is zzso at zzso level in zzso by zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso In comparison to zzso this new zzso encodes for the same protein but it has an zzso zzso region zzso that contains several zzso zzso zzso elements which are probably involved in zzso regulating of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso expression appears to be involved in processes of zzso zzso
