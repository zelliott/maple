A zzso zzso yellow, zzso zzso strictly zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from seawater of the Bay of zzso India, and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that strain zzso zzso showed highest similarity to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed less than 96 % similarity to members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso zzso formed a zzso separate from members of closely related zzso The zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of strain zzso zzso differed from those of members of closely related zzso The major fatty acid in strain zzso zzso was zzso : zzso and the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso zzso an unknown zzso an unknown zzso and an unknown zzso The zzso zzso type was zzso The zzso DNA zzso content zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso was significantly different from those of members of closely related zzso On the basis of its zzso zzso and zzso characteristics as well as our zzso analysis, we conclude that strain zzso zzso is a member of a novel zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
