The zzso and zzso genes zzso closely related nuclear zzso We found that the zzso protein from human tumor cell lines appears as four closely zzso zzso bands zzso to zzso in sodium zzso zzso zzso This and the recent finding that the zzso protein is zzso from two zzso initiation sites located in the first and second zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso King, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Anderson, and zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 1988) prompted us to study the molecular basis of the zzso protein zzso zzso by alkaline zzso reduced the four zzso bands to a zzso with an zzso mobility corresponding to the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When expressed zzso in zzso cells, an zzso deletion construct lacking the first zzso produced zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the first zzso of the zzso gene is zzso Furthermore, zzso deleted of up to two thirds of zzso coding zzso still retained the capacity to produce a zzso of zzso suggesting distinct zzso zzso for the two zzso zzso The zzso primary structure of the zzso protein was studied by zzso point zzso of the zzso end of the long open reading frame and by zzso zzso of the two zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso are initiated from two alternative zzso zzso zzso located 24 base pairs apart at the zzso end of the second zzso Both of these zzso are zzso and localized to the nucleus even when expressed zzso Interestingly, DNA zzso zzso the zzso gene are often found in the zzso region between the two zzso zzso initiation sites and correlate with the loss of the longer zzso zzso Thus the close spacing of the two zzso initiation zzso could explain the relative resistance of the zzso gene to similar modes of zzso zzso
