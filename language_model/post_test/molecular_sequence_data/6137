zzso is a zzso viral DNA zzso inhibitor active in zzso and in zzso against human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso of zzso resistant to zzso were selected by in zzso passage in increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso was evident at the levels of both zzso replication and reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso strains with distinct zzso were hypersensitive to zzso zzso zzso and zzso but had unchanged zzso to zzso and zzso The reverse zzso of zzso strains had unique zzso zzso zzso or zzso the third being associated with six zzso zzso Introduction of these zzso into zzso zzso by zzso zzso confirmed their role in zzso zzso In the three-dimensional structure of the reverse zzso zzso these zzso acids are located close to the template strand of the template primer and far away from the putative zzso binding site, suggesting that the mechanism by which zzso becomes resistant to zzso is zzso zzso resistance is thus likely to be zzso through an altered interaction of the zzso zzso with the template strand of the template primer which zzso the geometry of the zzso active site and thereby decreases zzso zzso
