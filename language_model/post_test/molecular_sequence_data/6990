zzso in man is zzso by a single zzso zzso located on zzso zzso In this study, the zzso start sites and major DNA promoter elements controlling the expression of this gene have been characterized by structural and functional zzso Immediately upstream of the first untranslated zzso of the gene are zzso sequences containing consensus binding sites for several zzso factors, including zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso studies and zzso protection analyses of zzso isolated from human zzso zzso cells reveal that two closely spaced zzso cap sites are located at a consensus zzso zzso element similar to that found in the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes shows that removal of three bases of this zzso sequence reduces promoter activity by zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies and transient zzso of a series of zzso deletion zzso of the zzso promoter linked to a zzso reporter show an zzso site at zzso to be essential for promoter zzso zzso zzso protein protects this site from zzso zzso during in zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso consensus binding site, located between the zzso box elements and the zzso is protected by zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso experiments, zzso a mobility shift with zzso protein and zzso cell zzso and fosters zzso of zzso by zzso as measured by transient zzso in mouse and human cell lines and in in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso of human zzso and mouse zzso zzso
