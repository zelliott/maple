A gene zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was isolated by an zzso screening approach and zzso The zzso chain containing deduced 220 zzso acids has a predicted molecular mass of 24 zzso It has high similarity to zzso the first zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso The zzso sequence presents the property of cell wall zzso by containing a putative zzso signal zzso and potential zzso zzso zzso However, absence of a zzso signal sequence suggested that this protein is zzso The zzso transcript was present specifically in the zzso zzso zzso The transcript was completely absent in the mold phase and zzso The fusion protein produced in zzso coli was Western zzso with zzso zzso human zzso and zzso of the patients' zzso were positive in the zzso None of the zzso obtained from patients with zzso zzso zzso or zzso tested zzso These results suggest that zzso can be used as a marker in a zzso zzso
