The zzso zzso promoter is rapidly and zzso activated with other zzso including zzso tumor necrosis factor, and zzso growth factor, as well as zzso zzso and agents that increase zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated zzso regulatory elements and zzso factors responsible for zzso zzso gene zzso Studies on the zzso deletion zzso of the human zzso gene suggested that the zzso element was mapped within the zzso promoter region zzso to zzso which was zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified two types of nuclear factors that bound to this region, one zzso and the other zzso These two factors recognized a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, three copies of this zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to the zzso zzso zzso promoter, indicating that a zzso symmetry sequence was an zzso element in the zzso zzso
