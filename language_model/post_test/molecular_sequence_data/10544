The zzso zzso protein zzso is an essential element in sugar transport by the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso fishing, using surface zzso zzso was used to show the binding of zzso to a zzso protein in extracts of zzso zzso the protein was subsequently identified as zzso zzso zzso The high affinity zzso constant approximately zzso zzso zzso interaction was also demonstrated in zzso mobility shift experiments by zzso gel zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso regulates the zzso state of zzso zzso zzso binding increases zzso activity to zzso of the level in control zzso zzso analysis of coupled zzso zzso shows that the binding of zzso to zzso causes a decrease in the zzso for zzso and an increase in the zzso for zzso indicating a mixed type zzso The zzso effect of zzso coli zzso on zzso coli zzso activity is zzso and the zzso form of zzso activates zzso more than does the zzso zzso Replacement of specific zzso acids in zzso results in reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were established to be zzso This novel mechanism for the regulation of zzso provides the first evidence directly linking zzso coli zzso to the regulation of zzso zzso
