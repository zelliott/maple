Comparisons of zzso protein zzso zzso and type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structures with each other and also with other proteins reveal structural and functional similarity between the two zzso and proteins of the zzso zzso fold zzso This suggests that these zzso are zzso zzso The structure of zzso which clearly resembles both zzso and zzso provides a link between the two proteins and establishes that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso share the same zzso The functional implications of the proposed zzso are zzso
