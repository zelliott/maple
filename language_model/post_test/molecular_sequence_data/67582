Certain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to facilitate zzso zzso transfer from zzso zzso zzso to zzso but structural evidence on how this process promotes zzso transfer is zzso Here we report the structure of the human zzso zzso domain from zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso The structure reveals extensive zzso donor zzso interactions with zzso and both zzso of the zzso domain zzso that stabilize the zzso body and zzso tail of zzso zzso that disrupt these zzso interactions or zzso zzso reduce zzso binding affinity and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the donor zzso consistent with the zzso zzso zzso Our results provide structural insights into how zzso zzso zzso recruit zzso and zzso the donor zzso zzso for zzso
