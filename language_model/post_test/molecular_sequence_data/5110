Remarkably high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the brains of zzso fish when compared to the zzso of the same fish, or to the brain or zzso of other zzso Northern analysis using a full-length zzso zzso from a goldfish brain library indicates high accumulated levels of zzso zzso in the brain but fails to detect zzso zzso in the zzso The possibility of different brain and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso zzso using zzso zzso led to the isolation of a 243 zzso zzso zzso zzso with approximately zzso of zzso and zzso acid replacements when compared to the brain zzso Southern analysis with zzso zzso indicated two distinct zzso zzso and this was confirmed by zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were identified in a second, zzso fish species zzso evidence that two genes are not caused per zzso by zzso in zzso zzso analysis of different zzso with zzso zzso showed high levels of the brain zzso zzso and much lower levels of the zzso zzso in neural zzso with high zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso expressed low levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The data imply that the expression of two zzso genes in goldfish is controlled by distinct regulatory zzso Further studies are required to determine whether the two genes lead to functionally distinct zzso
