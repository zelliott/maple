A single chain zzso zzso fusion protein was expressed and zzso from bacterial inclusion bodies following cloning of the genes zzso the variable region of the heavy chain and light chain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the rat zzso zzso The latter zzso zzso zzso zzso through the brain zzso zzso wall in zzso which makes up the zzso barrier zzso therefore, the zzso zzso zzso and its single chain zzso analog may act as brain drug delivery zzso in zzso zzso of zzso drugs to the zzso zzso is facilitated by production of the zzso fusion zzso The zzso of the zzso single chain zzso zzso fusion protein was zzso as the product both bound zzso and the rat zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso based on zzso and brain zzso analyses in zzso zzso The attachment of zzso to the zzso single chain zzso zzso fusion protein resulted in zzso of isolated rat brain zzso in zzso fluorescent zzso In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that genetically engineered single chain zzso zzso fusion proteins may be used for zzso zzso delivery to the brain using zzso zzso transport systems such as the zzso zzso
