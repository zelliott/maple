This article presents the identification and characterization of the zzso gene of zzso zzso and the zzso characterization of the protein zzso activity that it zzso zzso of the zzso gene product suppresses zzso zzso of the poll zzso 17) zzso which encodes DNA zzso zzso zzso and suppression can be achieved either by expressing zzso from a zzso zzso or by zzso zzso of zzso Gene disruption of zzso indicates that it is not an essential zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein with a zzso consensus zzso By deletion analysis and zzso zzso we demonstrate that the complete and active zzso consensus domain is required for zzso A zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso in bacteria, can be zzso in an active form with zzso affinity beads or by zzso Thus, other protein zzso of zzso are not required for its zzso In zzso protein zzso zzso show that zzso can zzso and can zzso zzso as an zzso zzso The zzso of the suppressed zzso cells indicates that zzso suppression is inefficient and does not restore the zzso zzso zzso suppression requires zzso function, but zzso does not affect zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not enhance the expression of the zzso zzso zzso may function by zzso and partially stabilizing zzso DNA zzso perhaps during DNA repair, because zzso zzso cells are caffeine zzso
