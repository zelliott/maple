The zzso zzso is a unique organ for the study of zzso zzso zzso of laboratory animals such as the mouse allow for the determination of the exact stage of pregnancy, which cannot be achieved with human zzso In this study, neutral zzso were isolated from mouse zzso strain zzso zzso from day 10 to day 18 of zzso and were separated by high performance thin layer zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso at day 10 of zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in decreasing zzso as well as four unidentified zzso On day 12, the zzso composition changed with the disappearance of the unidentified spots and the appearance of an zzso positive zzso similarly to the zzso zzso no further changes occurred between days 12 and 18 of zzso The identity of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso was established by binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso separated on high performance thin layer zzso plates, and by the reaction of the isolated zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The appearance of the zzso zzso at day 12 of gestation coincided with the day of final maturation of the mouse zzso and subsequent zzso of growth, suggesting a possible role of the zzso during embryonic zzso
