The zzso are a group of zzso zzso and subsequently zzso modified zzso The structural modifications introduced during maturation are the formation of two zzso zzso and one zzso bond accompanied by zzso The two zzso bonds are introduced by one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso 1997) and the zzso bond is formed by a second such zzso which shows strong zzso to the zzso introducing the zzso zzso Action of these two zzso gives zzso an overall zzso zzso Further maturation of the zzso is achieved by leader zzso zzso and zzso zzso Members of this group have been isolated and characterized by zzso methods exclusively from the zzso specifically the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of two genes zzso zzso zzso proteins has made it possible to study the zzso reaction in zzso and to define the minimal sequence requirements for zzso in the zzso region zzso the structural zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene cluster of zzso in zzso coli and analysis of the cell mass of the zzso host has allowed the analysis of motifs in the leader zzso important for zzso zzso
