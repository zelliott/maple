zzso proteins such as zzso zzso undergo zzso folding zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso before zzso Studies in zzso have suggested that zzso folding depends on the zzso zzso unfolded proteins accumulate in the zzso triggering cellular stress zzso Here, human zzso cells zzso zzso were used to model effects of cellular zzso supply on zzso of zzso zzso one zzso zzso and cellular stress zzso zzso were cultured in media containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 5 zzso representing severely zzso moderately zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso in humans, zzso Transport rates of zzso were increased in severely and moderately deficient cells compared with cells cultured in zzso zzso this increase was not sufficient to prevent zzso depletion of zzso as judged by zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was greater in severely deficient cells than in other zzso Nevertheless, severely deficient cells zzso normal amounts of zzso into the zzso space, zzso by increased zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso cells responded to zzso zzso of zzso with increased expression of genes zzso zzso zzso E1 and X zzso zzso consistent with cellular zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso may cause cellular stress by zzso of unfolded proteins in human zzso
