zzso nuclear zzso zzso core protein A1 is a major component of zzso zzso 40 S zzso We describe the structure of an active A1 gene and report on the partial characterization of the A1 gene zzso About 30 zzso sequences are present per zzso human zzso 15 such sequences were isolated from a human zzso DNA zzso Many corresponded to zzso of the processed type but by applying a selection for actively transcribed regions we isolated an active A1 zzso The gene spans a region of zzso zzso zzso zzso and it is split into ten zzso that zzso the 320 zzso acid zzso of the zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from the zzso sequences is identical with that deduced from zzso and reported for the zzso One zzso exactly separates the two structural zzso that constitute the zzso Each of the two zzso zzso in protein A1 is zzso by one zzso Experimental evidence indicates that the A1 gene can zzso for more than one protein by alternative zzso The gene is preceded by a strong promoter that contains at least two zzso boxes and two possible zzso binding sites, but it lacks a zzso zzso
