zzso stimulating factor zzso is used worldwide to prevent zzso caused by high-dose zzso It has limited stability, strict zzso and storage requirements, and because of poor oral zzso must be administered by injection (typically zzso Thus, there is significant interest in developing zzso with improved pharmacological zzso We used our zzso zzso zzso screening method to improve the zzso characteristics of zzso zzso these properties can make a zzso more zzso enhance its shelf life, or make it more amenable to alternate delivery systems and zzso It can also affect clinically important features such as zzso zzso in the buried core were selected for zzso to minimize changes to the surface, thereby maintaining the active site and limiting the designed zzso potential for zzso Using a structure that was zzso modeled from bovine zzso core designs of zzso zzso were completed, corresponding to zzso sequences zzso The optimal sequence from each design was selected for zzso characterization and experimental zzso each had 10-14 zzso The designed proteins showed enhanced zzso zzso of up to 13 degrees C, displayed zzso zzso improvements in shelf life, and were biologically active in cell proliferation zzso and in a zzso mouse zzso zzso studies in monkeys showed that subcutaneous injection of the designed zzso results in greater systemic exposure, probably attributable to improved zzso from the subcutaneous zzso These results show that our zzso method can be used to develop improved pharmaceuticals and illustrate its utility as a powerful protein design zzso
