The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes an inhibitor of zzso zzso a zzso factor that plays a crucial role in the establishment of zzso gene expression during zzso The zzso protein can probably also inhibit a closely related zzso factor zzso G, which determines the later phase of zzso zzso We have isolated two new zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso behaves like the previously described zzso zzso in that it mainly affects the activity of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso seems to be impaired mainly in its ability to inhibit zzso zzso All three zzso zzso are clustered in the zzso coding region of zzso suggesting that this region of the protein interacts with the zzso zzso The extreme zzso part of zzso may be specifically concerned with the regulation of zzso G zzso
