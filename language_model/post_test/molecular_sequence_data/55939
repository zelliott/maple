The kinetic characteristics of zzso from bovine liver and zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and Jack bean were studied using five zzso zzso zzso All the zzso released by zzso zzso had high extinction zzso in the visible region of the zzso zzso amounts of zzso zzso were found with each of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but this was not a significant problem if the correct zzso conditions were zzso The zzso attached particularly tightly to the active zzso of zzso coli zzso resulting in low zzso zzso The data suggest that the chemical properties of the zzso portion of the zzso distant from the zzso oxygen do not affect the zzso specificity and the zzso zzso can be attributed to interactions not involving the zzso zzso When the product of the maximum observed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is calculated for each zzso the relative merits of the zzso for the zzso of each zzso can be zzso The zzso from zzso and bacterial sources zzso the zzso most zzso indicating that they may be of particular value in areas of molecular biology and zzso
