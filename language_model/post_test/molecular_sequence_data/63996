The aims of the current study were to collect zzso zzso zzso zzso from farmed and wild zzso zzso zzso and to identify and zzso those zzso that zzso resembled zzso zzso an enteric pathogen of zzso The isolation rate of zzso zzso was high from both farmed zzso zzso and wild zzso (78 zzso In wild zzso it appeared that zzso zzso were more likely to be found in migratory birds zzso analysis: zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso than in zzso sampled in a public zzso zzso cultures of putative zzso zzso were obtained from 22 zzso All five zzso from farmed zzso and ten randomly selected zzso with this zzso were used for further zzso All zzso from farmed zzso and two of the zzso from wild zzso were zzso for the zzso gene of zzso zzso Two zzso from farmed zzso were selected for zzso field gel zzso zzso and randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso These zzso clustered with the type and reference strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis performed on 11 of the strains showed that they were all closely related to each other and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of the zzso zzso had zzso zzso sequences that were identical to those of zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso previously isolated from common zzso zzso zzso To zzso the zzso from farmed zzso and two zzso from wild zzso were classified as zzso zzso based on the fact that they could not be differentiated by any of the applied methods from type, reference and field strains of zzso zzso The remaining zzso could not be assigned zzso to any of the presently recognized zzso zzso These results point to a broader host spectrum of zzso zzso than is generally zzso and to the presence in zzso of strongly zzso and zzso zzso that possess many, but not all, of the currently recognized characteristics of zzso zzso
