Two important limitations still exist for the characterization of protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the buffer choice zzso the buffer must provide an adequate zzso separation without zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the frequent generation of zzso zzso fragments during the zzso protein zzso In this work, a new approach is used to solve these difficulties, namely a theoretical model that relates the zzso behavior of peptides to their zzso The effectiveness of this procedure is demonstrated by the fast zzso of good zzso conditions for analyzing the peptides obtained from an zzso protein hydrolysate in a single zzso This strategy can provide useful information for helping to characterize zzso fragments from protein zzso
