zzso proteins from zzso are potential targets for exploitation as vaccines to control zzso zzso in this work we tested the hypothesis that zzso proteins from geographically distant zzso zzso zzso populations are highly divergent due to the pressure exerted by the host immune zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries were prepared from zzso zzso zzso from zzso and recently zzso flies of the same species from zzso 

zzso and zzso analysis resulted in the identification of the most abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso proteins were identified by zzso tree zzso Moreover, comparative analysis between the zzso of these two different populations resulted in a high level of protein identity, including the predicted zzso class II zzso zzso from all these zzso zzso 

These data zzso the hypothesis that zzso proteins from geographically distinct populations of the same zzso zzso species are highly zzso They also suggest the potential for using the same zzso components in a potential zzso zzso zzso
