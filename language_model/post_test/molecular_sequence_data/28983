A variety of surface receptors zzso diverse cellular responses have been shown to recruit tumor necrosis factor zzso factor zzso zzso zzso However, a few zzso zzso proteins that serve as downstream targets or regulators of zzso function have been zzso In search of new zzso molecules that bind zzso we carried out a zzso zzso zzso library screening with an zzso segment of zzso as the zzso A novel human zzso zinc finger family protein was identified, which when zzso with zzso led to a suppression of zzso zzso of zzso B and zzso zzso zzso This novel protein was designated zzso (for zzso zinc finger zzso zzso expression also inhibited the signaling of zzso zzso zzso of zzso B), which together with zzso has been shown to be essential for zzso Furthermore, the expression level of zzso appeared to be regulated during the differentiation of human peripheral blood zzso into zzso More significantly, zzso of zzso into the zzso cell line zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso of this cell zzso Our findings suggest that the novel zinc finger protein zzso may play a role during zzso differentiation by modulating zzso signaling zzso
