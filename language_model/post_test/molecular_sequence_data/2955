The zzso zzso in several species zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The steroid binding domain is confined to a region of 30 zzso while the zzso domain has the size of zzso 10 zzso A 40 zzso zzso containing both the DNA and steroid binding domain displayed a higher DNA binding activity than did the intact 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso the major part of the human zzso zzso was zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso but still lacks part of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso was about zzso in the DNA binding domain and 50% in the steroid binding zzso The present data provide evidence that the zzso zzso belongs to the zzso of zzso responsive zzso regulators and consists of three distinct zzso each with a specialized zzso
