A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso strain A3, was zzso The product of this zzso gene is zzso zzso acids in length with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The protein was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to apparent zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to form zzso and showed a broad optimum pH range from zzso to zzso This zzso also showed an absolute requirement for zzso or zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a maximum activity at 30 zzso and maintained activity over a temperature range of zzso zzso zzso was generally zzso losing 70 % of its activity when subjected to heat treatment at 50 zzso for 6 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso strain A3 zzso showed zzso lower K zzso values when compared with values derived from other bacterial zzso zzso The highest k zzso zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso which is much higher than values published for zzso zzso coli zzso indicating that the zzso strain A3 zzso possessed excellent zzso activity at low zzso zzso these characteristics suggest that the zzso from the zzso strain A3 is a new zzso zzso In addition, this is the first report characterizing the zzso properties of a zzso from a zzso zzso
