zzso analysis of the zzso end of the zzso zzso gene has identified a difference in two strains of laboratory mice, zzso zzso at the Oak Ridge National zzso and the strain used for the sequence listed in the zzso data zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in the zzso sequence but absent from the zzso zzso Thus, there are two different zzso regions for the TM gene in zzso Southern zzso and zzso chain reaction analyses on other mouse strains demonstrated the presence of this zzso sequence in five out of ten strains zzso Northern zzso analyses demonstrated that there were differences (up to zzso in the zzso levels of TM zzso among the zzso However, TM zzso levels did not correlate directly with the presence of the zzso DNA upstream from the TM zzso This is in contrast to other zzso (the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso element is known to affect levels of zzso zzso While the zzso zzso does not appear to have an effect on TM zzso under normal conditions, it is possible that zzso levels altered by factors like zzso and tumor necrosis factor are affected by the zzso zzso
