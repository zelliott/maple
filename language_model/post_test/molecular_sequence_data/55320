Experimental conditions or the presence of interacting components can lead to variations in the structural models of zzso However, the role of these factors in zzso selection is often omitted by in zzso methods to extract dynamic information from protein structural zzso zzso of small zzso considered building blocks for larger zzso structural models, can substantially differ in the context of a larger zzso This limitation is more evident in the case of modeling large zzso zzso complexes using structures of the individual protein zzso Here we report an analysis of variations in structural models of proteins with high sequence zzso These models were analyzed for sequence features of the zzso the role of scaffolding segments including interacting proteins or affinity tags and the chemical components in the experimental zzso zzso features in these structural models could be rationalized by zzso selection events, perhaps induced by experimental zzso This analysis was performed on a zzso zzso of protein structures from different zzso zzso The zzso correlations that we note here suggest additional features that could be incorporated by in zzso methods to extract dynamic information from protein structural zzso
