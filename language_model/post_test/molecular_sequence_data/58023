The three-dimensional structures of bovine plasma zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso group zzso a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso protein prepared in zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso group zzso a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso have been solved at zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso The final zzso R factors are zzso for zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso The model for the bovine zzso is quite similar to that of the human zzso with which it exhibits zzso sequence zzso The root mean square zzso between the zzso in the two proteins is zzso zzso The zzso binding site is almost completely zzso The zzso that surround the opening of the zzso are also particularly zzso in contrast with the presence of several zzso in parts of the zzso zzso opposite the opening of the zzso that binds zzso Despite the fact that zzso bovine zzso was prepared and zzso using procedures completely different from those used to obtain the zzso human zzso the zzso differences between zzso and zzso forms of zzso are almost identical to those found previously between the same forms of human zzso They mainly involve a few zzso in the region extending from zzso acid zzso 32 to zzso zzso similar differences are very likely to exist between zzso and the zzso occurring zzso A not yet identified electron density, different in shape and orientation from retinol, also occupies the central cavity of the zzso in the zzso zzso as found for zzso human zzso The functional consequences of the zzso change induced by the removal of zzso on the interaction between zzso and zzso coupled with the conservation of the entrance zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso are consistent with their participation in molecular zzso
