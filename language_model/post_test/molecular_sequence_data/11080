We have previously reported that bovine zzso contains zzso zzso binding receptors and zzso zzso zzso and zzso production in the bovine zzso The present study investigated 1) whether bovine zzso vein and artery contain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein and 2) whether zzso can regulate the formation of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso vein zzso but not the zzso artery, contained zzso zzso zzso transcript essentially identical to that found in the bovine corpus zzso The zzso vein zzso also contained a zzso zzso zzso protein that bound to rat zzso zzso zzso in Western zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso expressed in the zzso vein from cows in zzso compared with cows in zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso vein with zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso concentration as determined by Western zzso using an zzso to zzso seminal zzso zzso The increase in zzso was zzso in cows in zzso compared with zzso and zzso phase zzso zzso of zzso zzso vein or artery zzso with zzso or zzso (a zzso zzso zzso caused increased production of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso caused a significant increase in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso P zzso zzso N zzso 9 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso P zzso zzso N zzso 6 zzso but had no effect on zzso production by the zzso zzso increased zzso production by both zzso vein and artery zzso but had no effect on zzso production in either zzso zzso of steroids zzso zzso or zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso to the zzso vascular zzso had essentially no effect on zzso zzso In zzso bovine zzso vein from zzso cows expressed the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso of the zzso may have zzso significance as zzso zzso zzso and increases zzso release in the zzso zzso The zzso stimulation of the zzso and its zzso at zzso zzso may serve to increase the amounts of zzso reaching the zzso corpus zzso either directly by increasing zzso production or indirectly by increasing the blood flow to the zzso
