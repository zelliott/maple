zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso zzso and steroid derivatives in zzso plants following stresses imposed by wounding and pathogen zzso To better understand this complex step in zzso zzso zzso we isolated three classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a potato zzso library using a probe derived from an zzso zzso zzso The potato zzso had extensive zzso in portions of the protein coding regions but had low zzso in the 3' untranslated zzso zzso gel zzso analyses using zzso zzso showed that zzso was strongly induced in zzso tissue by zzso but the wound induction was strongly suppressed by treatment of the tissue with the zzso zzso zzso acid or by zzso with an incompatible or compatible race of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso also accumulated in response to zzso but in contrast to zzso these zzso were strongly enhanced by zzso acid or zzso zzso with a compatible race of zzso zzso resulted in similar patterns in zzso gene expression of zzso and zzso except that the magnitude and rate of the changes in zzso levels were reduced relative to the incompatible zzso The differential regulation of members of the zzso gene family may explain in part the previously reported changes in zzso zzso activities following wounding and zzso zzso The suppression of zzso and the enhancement of zzso and zzso transcript levels following zzso treatment or zzso with the incompatible race parallel the suppression in steroid and stimulation of zzso zzso observed in earlier zzso The results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that there are discrete organizational channels for zzso and zzso zzso in potato and other zzso zzso
