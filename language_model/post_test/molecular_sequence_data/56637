zzso is a major zzso protein of bone regulated by zzso D3 zzso and is believed to be expressed only by differentiated zzso We introduced a zzso human zzso gene promoter zzso zzso zzso fusion gene into the germ line of zzso zzso of tissue extracts from these transgenic mice demonstrated that the expression of zzso was restricted to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue sections using zzso zzso localized the production of zzso protein to zzso and maturing zzso Previous studies via transient zzso into zzso cells have identified a vitamin D response element approximately 500 zzso zzso of the zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso As a consequence, regulation of the zzso was examined in zzso transgenic lines for sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso was created using a low calcium diet supplemented with zzso zzso for 7 days and was restored in experimental mice by injection of 25 zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso The low vitamin D3 diet decreased zzso activity zzso in extracts from zzso zzso and brain compared to that in mice maintained on a normal diet, while zzso supplementation restored and enhanced zzso activity over control zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is sufficient to direct zzso zzso gene expression in mice in addition to the unexpected zzso expression in brain zzso
