We develop a sequence based zzso model to incorporate a mean field estimate of the orientation dependence of the zzso chain that gives rise to specific hydrogen bond pairing to stabilize zzso and zzso We illustrate the success of the new protein model in capturing zzso measures and folding mechanism of proteins L and zzso Compared to our previous zzso model, the new model shows greater folding zzso and improvements in zzso of protein zzso as well as predicting correct trends for kinetic rates and mechanism for proteins L and zzso We believe the model is broadly zzso to other protein folding and zzso zzso zzso and does not require experimental input beyond the zzso description of the native zzso Even without zzso zzso information, it can also serve as a zzso protein model for more exhaustive zzso search strategies that can bridge back down to atomic descriptions of the zzso zzso
