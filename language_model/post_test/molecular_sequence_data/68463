An electron transport regulatory zzso zzso has been isolated and characterized from the zzso respiratory zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso shows a high degree of identity to both the zzso of zzso coli zzso and the analogous protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso The four active zzso zzso of zzso are zzso in zzso and the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso of the two proteins are zzso Further, zzso zzso zzso is able to complement an zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to zzso there is no recognizable zzso box upstream of the zzso zzso Gene replacement zzso zzso of zzso were deficient in growth on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the regulation of the corresponding zzso zzso However, the zzso were all positive for reduction of and growth on nitrate and zzso indicating that zzso is not involved in the regulation of these two zzso Southern blots of zzso zzso DNA with use of zzso as a probe revealed the expected zzso bands and a second set of zzso signals whose genetic and functional properties remain to be zzso
