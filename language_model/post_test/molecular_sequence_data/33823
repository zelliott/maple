Five bacterial zzso zzso were selected from a wide pool of zzso zzso collected from traditional Egyptian dairy products on the basis of their zzso activities against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These 5 zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso amplification and zzso The zzso activity of the two strains was not affected by treatment of the cell free culture zzso with zzso but their activities disappeared completely when zzso with zzso K, zzso and zzso The zzso substance was stable over a wide range of pH zzso and was active after heating at 100 zzso for 10 zzso zzso yield in two strains reached a maximum zzso zzso at the end of the exponential phase (6 zzso and remained stable until the end of 24 zzso period when the medium reached pH zzso zzso production of zzso was obtained when growing the bacterial cells at temperatures ranging between 30 and 37 zzso zzso production was unaffected when the bacterial cells grew under severe conditions of pH zzso and in high salt zzso zzso Thanks to zzso gene amplification the zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso could be identified as zzso A and B structural zzso while the zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso could be identified as zzso P and zzso structural zzso which can be classified into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso amplification demonstrated that the two studied strains did not contain zzso factors zzso zzso A and B, ace, zzso and zzso These two strains were sensitive to most of the tested antibiotics but were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso was also resistant to zzso
