We previously reported that the zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protects mice against zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso B6 does zzso Both zzso are specific for an zzso fraction isolated from the cell surface of zzso zzso but their zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the surface locations of both zzso and obtained structural information regarding the zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic analysis of zzso zzso zzso forms showed that zzso zzso is displayed rather zzso over the entire cell surface, whereas zzso B6 appears to have a zzso zzso Both zzso were essentially zzso with the surfaces of zzso forms of the zzso indicating that neither zzso is expressed on the surfaces of these zzso For isolation of the zzso zzso the zzso fraction consisting of cell surface zzso was subjected to mildly zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso and was zzso into zzso and zzso portions by size exclusion zzso zzso blocking experiments showed that the zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of the zzso and that the B6 zzso is located in the zzso zzso The B6 zzso appeared to be zzso because it was stable to heat zzso and zzso treatments but was destroyed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso from the size exclusion column in two zzso Mass zzso analyses showed that one fraction contained material with the size of a zzso and that the other was a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso response zzso tests of the zzso indicated that the zzso zzso is associated with the zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso analysis of the zzso yielded data consistent with a zzso zzso The fine structure of the B6 zzso is under zzso Information derived from these investigations will be useful both in understanding protective versus zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso and in improving zzso vaccine zzso
