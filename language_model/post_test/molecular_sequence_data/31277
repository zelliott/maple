zzso cells infected with zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as a source of the large zzso of the viral zzso zzso zzso to investigate the binding of the large zzso and small zzso zzso in the active zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso with zzso zzso complex from wild type zzso infected cells resulted in the formation of a complex between zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the complex between the zzso and zzso zzso is dynamic and zzso zzso occurs during zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso can be formed the large zzso of zzso zzso and the small zzso of zzso
