We report genetic abnormalities of protein C gene in a male infant who developed zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of all zzso in protein C gene in this family revealed two zzso The first zzso derived from the mother, was a deletion of one of four consecutive G at zzso number zzso in zzso IX which would result in a frame shift zzso and completely change zzso acid sequence from zzso in the zzso region of protein zzso The second zzso derived from the father, was a single zzso zzso from G to A in the zzso zzso to zzso at zzso number zzso in zzso III, which would result in a substitution of zzso for zzso acid zzso This change would be responsible for the reduced zzso protein C levels of the patient and the father, estimated by a zzso zzso which recognizes the zzso in a zzso manner zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormal protein C from the father's plasma showed a normal zzso activity and a change in the zzso zzso We detected the above zzso in his family members using two zzso one was a creation of new restriction zzso sites using zzso zzso and the other was single zzso primer zzso Both methods are rapid and useful for the diagnosis of prenatal protein C zzso
