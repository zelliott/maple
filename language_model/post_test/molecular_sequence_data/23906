This is the first report describing the cloning and characterization of zzso carrier zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of 123 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso shows zzso identity and zzso similarity to the human zzso domain present in the human zzso protein zzso and zzso identity and zzso similarity to the human zzso zzso by zzso The presented structural models of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso reveal remarkable similarity with two of the structurally known zzso the zzso domain of human zzso and the rabbit zzso zzso The zzso models in both forms have a similar zzso zzso tunnel, which is extremely suitable for zzso zzso zzso showed in zzso transfer activity of zzso zzso from donor zzso to zzso zzso The transfer of zzso was almost completely inhibited after addition of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol showed a moderate to marginal ability to lower the zzso transfer rate, and the single chain zzso acid and zzso A did not affect transfer at zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is accumulating in most plant zzso zzso carrying fusion genes between green fluorescent protein and zzso were transformed with particle zzso to onion zzso zzso The results from analyzing the zzso indicate that zzso is localized to zzso
