The function of zzso novel human genes can be efficiently addressed in genetic model zzso From a collection of genes expressed in the zzso visual system, zzso expressed in zzso were identified and one similar to a novel human gene was chosen for further zzso The results reported here characterize the zzso zzso gene and demonstrate that a similar gene is expressed in the human zzso The zzso and human zzso sequences are 50% zzso and they share an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sequence indicates that it zzso to the gene zzso of the zzso zzso and predicts a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generated to a predicted zzso zzso recognize an zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso 4 copies of a repeat associated with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso function first discovered in zzso which may interact with the plasma zzso These results therefore show that zzso zzso is expressed in fly zzso cells, demonstrate that a zzso human gene is expressed in human zzso and suggest that a zzso analysis of the zzso gene would be zzso
