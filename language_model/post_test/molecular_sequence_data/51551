To overcome the problems of zzso specificity associated with conventional zzso zzso we developed a sandwich zzso zzso zzso for intact human zzso zzso For this zzso we used zzso to the zzso and zzso regions of zzso that were raised against an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso of zzso and serum from patients with zzso failure, zzso by zzso zzso facilitated direct demonstration of the region specificity of this zzso A preliminary study of serum zzso zzso in patients with zzso failure further confirmed this zzso showing lower positive rates obtained by this method than by conventional zzso The zzso data of zzso with bovine and rat zzso by the sandwich method indicated its species zzso These studies demonstrate the superior specificity of this sandwich zzso compared with conventional zzso and thus confirm its potential diagnostic zzso
