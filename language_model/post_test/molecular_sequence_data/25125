We have isolated and analyzed the genes zzso the human and rat gastric zzso zzso zzso The complete sequence of the human zzso including zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso end of the rat zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso The human gene contains 22 zzso Its zzso organization is identical to that of the zzso zzso except that zzso 6 zzso to a fusion of zzso 6 and 7 of the zzso zzso The zzso initiation sites of both the human and rat genes were determined by primer extension and zzso zzso protection zzso zzso of the zzso regions of the human and rat genes revealed three extended regions of high sequence zzso one of which includes a potential zzso box and other basic promoter elements beginning about 30 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso Other zzso zzso including possible response elements for zzso and zzso which are known zzso zzso of acid zzso are located up to 2 zzso zzso to the zzso initiation zzso
