Human zzso repeat binding factor 2 zzso is a protein that plays an important role in capping human zzso to protect them from DNA damage repair zzso The ineffectiveness of zzso may be linked to aging and zzso We report the use of zzso zzso interactions by mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso and selective zzso of zzso zzso to study the interaction of the zzso domain and zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso By increasing the resolution of zzso to the zzso level, we localized the changes in zzso zzso of zzso as a function of varying amounts of a model zzso From these experiments, we determined the affinity constant for binding to DNA, which is within a factor of 3 of the previously reported zzso zzso zzso exchange revealed portions of the protein that have contacts with the zzso backbone of DNA, whereas zzso disclosed the decrease in zzso accessibility of regions containing zzso zzso and zzso which must be involved in interactions with the DNA major and minor zzso These complementary approaches of zzso zzso exchange and selective side chain modification can be employed effectively to pinpoint and zzso zzso in particular zzso zzso
