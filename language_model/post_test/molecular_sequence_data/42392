The positions of the zzso bonds of zzso a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The existence of three zzso bonds in the native toxin was demonstrated by mass zzso and the lack of zzso with a zzso zzso The assignment procedure involved a combination of zzso zzso of the native toxin and sequence analysis of both intact and in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is shown to be a useful procedure in sequencing of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the intact, zzso toxin indicated that no zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is seen for the first zzso in a zzso pair, but that the zzso of zzso which can be detected at 313 zzso is seen at the position of the second zzso By sequencing zzso zzso zzso fragments, the three zzso linkages in zzso could be assigned as zzso zzso and zzso
