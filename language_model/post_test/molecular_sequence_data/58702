We have used the zzso zzso system to identify proteins that interact with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We screened a human B cell zzso library with full-length G alpha zzso and isolated four positive zzso one of which expressed the zzso zzso zzso of a previously zzso zzso acid zzso zzso A full-length clone was isolated from a zzso cell zzso zzso The deduced protein contains 10 zzso repeats, and thus we named it zzso Computer analysis indicates that zzso is a mosaic protein with seven repeated sequences of about 40 zzso in length at its zzso end, and four repeated sequences of about 34 zzso at its zzso zzso Each of the two repeat regions shows substantial similarity to proteins found in other zzso zzso analysis of human zzso showed that the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso The specificity of interaction between G alpha zzso and zzso was confirmed by an in zzso binding zzso using zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso system can identify novel zzso such as zzso that interact with G alpha zzso As a mosaic zzso zzso shows similarity with portions of proteins from many species and thus may define a new protein zzso
