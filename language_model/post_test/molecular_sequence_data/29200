Following productive V gene zzso the functional zzso genes in the B zzso of man and mouse are subjected to two further types of genetic zzso zzso zzso a zzso but largely zzso zzso process, leads to a change in constant region of the expressed zzso zzso zzso introduces multiple single zzso zzso in and around the rearranged V gene segments and zzso affinity zzso However, in chicken and rabbits (but not man or zzso an additional zzso gene conversion, is a major contributor to V gene zzso It has been demonstrated recently that both switch zzso and zzso are zzso in mice and humans lacking zzso a B zzso protein of unknown molecular zzso Here we show that disruption of AID in the zzso chicken B cell zzso leads to a failure to perform zzso V gene zzso Thus, AID is required for all three zzso gene modification programs zzso conversion, zzso and switch zzso and acts in the initiation or execution of these processes rather than in bringing the B cell to an appropriate stage of zzso
