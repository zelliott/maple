The complete zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso from the plasma of the zzso zzso zzso has been determined by sequential zzso degradation analysis of zzso fragments derived by zzso fragmentation and chemical zzso of the reductive zzso zzso zzso fragments were separated by zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences were determined by zzso degradation and zzso zzso The zzso zzso plasma zzso is a zzso protein consisting of zzso zzso acids and four zzso bonds, one of which was found to be zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso plasma zzso with the sequences of other proteins reveals that the zzso zzso zzso has a structure consisting of a zzso zzso a zzso sequence and a zzso zzso zzso The above zzso acid sequence was verified by zzso cloning of this zzso Three zzso clones that have single zzso zzso the zzso precursor were isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences in the three zzso clones contain the same sequence of the mature zzso zzso and the same putative signal zzso In addition, it was demonstrated that this zzso can enhance zzso by zzso zzso zzso Thus, the plasma zzso is constructed into an zzso structure via zzso zzso bonds and plays a role in the biological defense of zzso zzso as a defense zzso
