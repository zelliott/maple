zzso proteins zzso are zzso proteins among insects that are thought to be involved in innate zzso In zzso the zzso family is composed of 6 genes named zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso expression pattern and roles of these genes in the host defense of zzso zzso zzso genes are clustered in 3 distinct zzso 1 of which is specific to zzso Most zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed in zzso can be induced in the fat body, and are expressed in specific regions of the zzso This expression pattern is consistent with a role in innate zzso However, we find that zzso zzso and zzso are not strictly required in the body cavity to fight several bacterial and zzso zzso One possibility is that zzso zzso act zzso or that their absence can be compensated by other components of the immune zzso zzso may thus provide a subtle selective advantage during zzso zzso they may be required in host defense against specific as yet unidentified natural pathogens of zzso
