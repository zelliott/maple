zzso is a fundamental energy source for both zzso and zzso The balance between zzso zzso and storage is integral for proper energy zzso and defects are associated with several diseases, zzso type II zzso In zzso the zzso factor zzso is a major component in zzso zzso while its zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso contain five zzso zzso regions zzso that affect their cellular zzso and zzso zzso While zzso has been shown to affect zzso function, the mechanisms controlling zzso response of both zzso and zzso remain zzso By incorporating sequence analysis techniques, structure predictions, and functional zzso we zzso data surrounding zzso family proteins into a zzso accurate, and general model involving the zzso and two additional zzso that determine zzso and zzso zzso zzso Paramount, we identified a zzso motif within the zzso region of zzso family proteins and propose that this motif interacts with the zzso form of zzso In addition, we discovered a putative nuclear zzso box in zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences that reveals a potentially novel interaction with nuclear zzso These interactions are likely involved in altering zzso and zzso zzso to form an active complex and induce zzso of genes involved in zzso metabolism and zzso
