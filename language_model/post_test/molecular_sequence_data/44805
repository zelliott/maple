zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses an zzso zzso in zzso with peas zzso zzso but, unlike all other characterized zzso bacteria, cannot express it in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso described in other species was shown to have been zzso in zzso zzso by zzso of zzso and deletion zzso zzso zzso of zzso structural genes zzso originates from a zzso type promoter zzso A regulatory region located in the zzso to zzso region was essential for promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in zzso zzso and zzso coli cells expressing the zzso zzso nitrogen fixation regulator zzso and in zzso coli cells expressing zzso zzso zzso This zzso required direct interaction of zzso with the essential zzso to zzso regulatory zzso However, no sequences resembling known zzso sites were found in or around this zzso zzso zzso was also observed in zzso zzso bean zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso hosts was also absolutely dependent on the zzso zzso and on integration host zzso zzso zzso related to integration host factor were identified in zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso is structurally and functionally similar to nitrogen fixation zzso The requirement to coordinate zzso zzso production and zzso zzso in zzso might be the reason for the loss of zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso control of zzso gene zzso This evolutionary acquired control would ensure regulated synthesis of zzso zzso in the most common zzso environment for zzso the zzso zzso
