zzso is the principal early zzso of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso The zzso protein stimulates viral zzso and binds as a zzso to zzso zzso repeats zzso zzso the zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso To define zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso we first constructed a series of zzso zzso to the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso promoter only upon zzso linkage to zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 to 118 were sufficient for zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso required for zzso interaction, we tested a series of zzso zzso for zzso binding by using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso of zzso zzso other than the zzso zzso domain eliminated zzso zzso Of 14 zzso zzso only zzso and zzso failed to bind the zzso either as zzso or as zzso with functional zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso also failed to compete with zzso zzso for DNA binding and suggested a zzso in zzso zzso with loss of zzso zzso within a zzso repeat zzso zzso to zzso at the zzso C zzso abolished zzso binding and demonstrated that this zzso domain is required for DNA zzso These data confirm that zzso contains zzso zzso for zzso and zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, they support a model wherein zzso zzso by zzso involves zzso DNA binding that contributes to zzso stimulation by interaction with components of the zzso zzso zzso
