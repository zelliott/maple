Three zzso zzso zzso directed against the regulatory domain of the protein zzso C gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to display distinct properties with respect to zzso gamma zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso Parker, zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso which act as potent zzso of the zzso zzso activity, can no longer bind zzso gamma in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding is not influenced by zzso Due to this functional relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso sites, we sought to zzso the zzso zzso with respect to the functional sites of zzso zzso For this purpose, several deletions were introduced at the zzso end of the zzso gamma zzso and the zzso proteins were expressed in zzso zzso The determination of the zzso of the deleted zzso gamma proteins shows that the zzso acid zzso essential to the binding of zzso and zzso are directly adjacent to the second zzso zzso these are contained in the sequences at positions zzso and zzso zzso In addition, various deletions around the C1 region of the regulatory domain allowed the identification of the second zzso motif as a functional binding site for zzso zzso These deletion studies thus demonstrate that the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are distinct from the zzso zzso This suggests that the binding of zzso and zzso zzso induce zzso changes in the regulatory domain of zzso which are thus responsible for the loss of the zzso and zzso zzso of the native zzso In this zzso state, zzso gamma zzso its ability to interact with the zzso zzso zzso By using synthetic zzso the zzso zzso was localized to the sequence zzso in the zzso variable zzso This indicates that the flexibility of the zzso region, which zzso the zzso of the regulatory domain, may not be necessary for the zzso zzso of zzso In view of these results, we propose that zzso zzso by its zzso results in zzso changes which allow the zzso to bind zzso zzso
