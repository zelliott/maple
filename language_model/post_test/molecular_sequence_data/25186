An zzso repair deficient zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso lacking DNA zzso activity for removal of zzso zzso was transformed by a zzso zzso DNA library and clones selected which survived zzso on medium containing the zzso agent zzso zzso Three distinct zzso clones were identified which were able to suppress the zzso sensitive zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed common DNA fragments present in all three clones spanning 2 zzso of zzso zzso DNA from this region was zzso and zzso for possible translation of zzso with any zzso to either the zzso or the zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso One open reading frame of 296 zzso acids was identified zzso a putative protein with significant zzso to zzso DNA containing the open reading frame was zzso in zzso coli expression zzso and cell extracts zzso for zzso DNA zzso zzso It appeared that such activity was expressed at levels sufficiently high for zzso zzso The molecular weight of the zzso protein was determined by zzso to be 35,000 zzso in good agreement with the zzso value calculated from the zzso The zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso as well as zzso from zzso zzso treated DNA, confirming the related nature of this zzso to the zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso
