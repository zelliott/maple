Using an zzso for rat zzso zzso we investigated the organ distribution of peptides that increase zzso in rat zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in the zzso zzso and zzso By analysis with reverse phase high performance liquid zzso zzso three major zzso of activity were observed in zzso zzso The first peak was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the second peak was zzso zzso zzso zzso The third peak of activity was isolated from zzso zzso By analysis with a gas phase zzso and with an zzso acid zzso this zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso levels in a zzso manner; however, zzso did zzso These results suggest that not only zzso and zzso but also zzso and zzso act upon zzso as well as vascular zzso
