To investigate the effects of zzso in the zzso cassette zzso A1 ( zzso gene on the zzso zzso cholesterol zzso level and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we performed association zzso zzso analysis identified 14 zzso in the promoter region of zzso After considering linkage zzso three zzso in the promoter region and 11 zzso from the zzso database were determined in zzso subjects recruited from the zzso zzso representing the general population in zzso We evaluated the association between the zzso zzso and zzso level adjusted not only for standard factors, but also for genetic factors including zzso and zzso zzso Of the 14 zzso tested, the zzso ( zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso were significantly associated with the zzso level in the zzso zzso We could zzso that the zzso zzso was influential in another set of subjects ( zzso zzso However, the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso in subjects with zzso ( zzso was not different from that in the control population ( zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso has a significant effect on the zzso level in the general Japanese population, but not on the zzso of zzso
