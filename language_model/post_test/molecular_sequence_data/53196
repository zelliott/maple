In order to identify zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against virulent zzso zzso R strain were produced in zzso zzso zzso was selected for its abilities to inhibit both growth and metabolism of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso recognized a membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 120 zzso The corresponding zzso designated the zzso zzso was cloned from an zzso zzso zzso DNA expression library and zzso The zzso gene is a zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and is localized downstream of the zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso To assess the characteristics of zzso zzso all 10 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which zzso a zzso in the zzso species, were replaced with zzso zzso and zzso zzso viruses zzso harboring the altered zzso gene were zzso One of the zzso zzso was improved to express zzso protein on the cell surface in which the signal zzso of zzso protein was replaced with one from zzso disease virus zzso These results should provide the impetus to develop a vaccine based on zzso protein which can induce zzso with both growth zzso and zzso activities using a zzso zzso
