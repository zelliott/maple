zzso hormones mediate a wide variety of zzso and zzso events in insects, yet little is known about the zzso of insect steroid hormone zzso Here we describe the zzso dare zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso plays a key role in the synthesis of all steroid zzso zzso zzso of dare undergo zzso arrest during the second zzso zzso or at the second zzso zzso and dare zzso of intermediate severity are delayed in zzso These defects are rescued to a high degree by feeding zzso larvae the insect steroid hormone zzso These data, together with the abundant expression of dare in the two principal steroid zzso zzso the ring zzso and the zzso argue strongly for a role of dare in steroid hormone zzso dare is the first zzso gene shown to zzso a defined component of the steroid hormone zzso cascade and therefore provides a new tool for the analysis of steroid hormone zzso We have explored its role in the adult nervous system and found two striking zzso not previously described in zzso affected in steroid hormone zzso First, we show that mild reductions of dare expression cause abnormal behavioral responses to zzso zzso indicating a requirement for dare in sensory zzso Then we show that dare zzso of intermediate strength result in zzso widespread zzso of the adult nervous zzso
