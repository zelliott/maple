A human zzso zzso family zzso has recently been identified on zzso 7 that contains a single complete open reading frame zzso zzso an envelope zzso We have identified zzso zzso families on human zzso DNA using a zzso panel in our previous zzso In order to identify additional families, we examined zzso DNA derived from cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Five zzso fragments of a zzso family were newly identified and zzso They showed a high degree of zzso sequence similarity zzso to that of the other zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fragments showed no zzso and termination zzso by zzso or point zzso in clones zzso zzso and zzso The ratio of synonymous to zzso zzso indicated that negative selective pressure is acting on zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso gene sequences could be associated with an active zzso in human cancer cells zzso zzso zzso
