As a result of the expression of a single open reading frame composed of the coding sequence for a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso protein with a zzso zzso and a zzso sequence zzso 7 zzso zzso with a zzso zzso an active zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso produced in the transformed zzso coli cell in addition to an overproduction of the zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso zzso has similar zzso and zzso values in both zzso and zzso activities to those of the natural counterparts, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso did not show an apparent channeling transfer of zzso (the intermediate zzso between the zzso discrete zzso and zzso active sites, the zzso efficiency of the zzso and zzso reactions in the artificial zzso was better than that in the separated zzso as shown by a decrease in the intermediate concentration at the steady state in the coupled zzso
