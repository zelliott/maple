zzso is a common protein modification with a significant role in many vital cellular processes and human diseases, making the characterization of zzso zzso structures important for understanding cell biology and disease zzso zzso analysis of protein zzso by tandem mass zzso of zzso promises zzso zzso of zzso zzso something that detached zzso and zzso zzso analyses cannot zzso However, successful zzso of direct zzso analysis by tandem mass zzso remains a zzso In this work, we consider zzso techniques for the analysis of zzso data acquired from zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso We implement a zzso strategy that takes advantage of the properties of zzso fragmentation zzso of zzso matching the zzso zzso to zzso pairs from protein sequences and zzso structure zzso zzso we also propose a novel false discovery rate zzso technique to estimate and manage the number of false zzso We use a human zzso standard, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso enriched for zzso using zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso to demonstrate our zzso strategy and evaluate its zzso Our software, zzso zzso assigned zzso identifications to 246 of the zzso at a false discovery rate of zzso identifying 42 distinct zzso zzso pairs at each of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by analyzing zzso zzso identifying 136 zzso zzso zzso at a false discovery rate of zzso representing 15 distinct zzso on at least three of the four zzso zzso zzso The software, zzso is available for download from zzso zzso
