We have cloned the three rows zzso zzso by a combination of zzso zzso and P element zzso We describe zzso of zzso zzso for zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein appear to be sufficient to allow 14 rounds of zzso in zzso zzso for zzso zzso However, a small percentage of cells in zzso zzso stage zzso zzso sink into the interior of the zzso as if they have failed to divide zzso Following zzso all cells complete zzso 14 zzso All cells become delayed at zzso 15 with their zzso remaining aligned on the zzso in a zzso zzso even though both zzso A and B have both been zzso As zzso B degradation occurs at the zzso transition, subsequent to the zzso integrity checkpoint, the delay induced by zzso at the zzso locus defines a later point in zzso zzso zzso in the cells of zzso zzso do not undertake zzso zzso but remain at the zzso zzso zzso they zzso A subset of zzso go on to replicate their DNA but there is no further zzso zzso
