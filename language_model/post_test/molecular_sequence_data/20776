In this study, we applied laser capture zzso and a zzso approach to identify novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from pooled zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and differential proteins were identified by mass zzso zzso of the differential protein zzso 18 in the above two zzso as well as 4 zzso cell lines was determined by Western zzso zzso was also performed to detect the expression of zzso 18 in 62 cases of primary zzso 28 cases of zzso and 20 cases of cervical zzso zzso zzso and the correlation of its expression level with zzso features and clinical outcomes were zzso zzso and in zzso cell invasion zzso were used to check the correlation between the expression of zzso 18 and invasive ability of zzso 

zzso differential proteins between the zzso and zzso were zzso The expression level of zzso 18 in the two types of zzso was confirmed by Western zzso and related to differentiation degree and zzso potential of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso was observed in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas significant zzso 18 zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso versus primary zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso 18 zzso was significantly correlated with poor zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso 18 zzso was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage zzso zzso zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso and regional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and distant zzso zzso zzso zzso And zzso zzso 18 expression by zzso significantly decreased in zzso invasive ability of zzso zzso Furthermore, survival zzso showed that patients with zzso 18 zzso had a poor prognosis zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso hazards zzso showed that WHO zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distant zzso zzso zzso zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso and zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with the prognosis of zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distant zzso zzso zzso zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso and zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso zzso 

The data suggest that zzso 18 is a potential zzso for the differentiation and prognosis of zzso and its zzso might play an important role in the zzso of zzso
