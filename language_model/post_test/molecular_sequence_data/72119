Although zzso deer zzso zzso are one of North America's best studied zzso no information is available concerning zzso diversity at any locus of the major zzso complex in this zzso Using the zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso zzso analysis, and DNA sequencing techniques, 15 zzso zzso 2 zzso were identified among 150 zzso deer from a single population in zzso zzso These zzso represent a single locus and exhibit a high degree of zzso and zzso acid zzso with most zzso acid variation occurring at positions forming the zzso binding zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso acid zzso unique to zzso deer zzso zzso were zzso with 19 of these occurring at zzso forming contact points of the zzso binding zzso zzso higher rates of zzso than synonymous zzso were detected among these zzso zzso In contrast to other studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be playing a significant role in the generation of zzso diversity at this locus in zzso zzso To examine evolution of zzso deer zzso zzso within zzso we performed a zzso analysis of all published red deer zzso zzso deer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso tree clearly shows a zzso persistence of zzso lineages among these zzso Moreover, this zzso tree provides insight into evolution of zzso zzso lineages within zzso and may aid in assignment of red deer zzso zzso to specific zzso
