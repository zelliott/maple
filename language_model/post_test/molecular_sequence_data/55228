zzso zzso regulates many cellular zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains tandem zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso is known to bind zzso but molecular details of zzso binding affinity and linkage selectivity by zzso remain zzso Here we report that zzso binds zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso chains with zzso of zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso zzso analysis of qualitative and quantitative binding data reveals that zzso is more important than zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso prefers binding to linear and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso However, zzso recognizes the three zzso zzso with similar affinities with zzso of zzso zzso unlike zzso of zzso Taken together, our data suggest differential zzso roles of the two zzso binding zzso in zzso
