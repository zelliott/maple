We have characterized zzso family proteins in adult zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso proteins from the zzso The liver zzso showed comparable zzso activities to those of zzso zzso Furthermore, we isolated five zzso zzso from a zzso liver zzso These zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso form a family consisting of at least zzso and tandem repeat types based on their domain structures, like the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited a high sequence identity zzso with each other at the zzso acid level and were most similar zzso zzso to human zzso From their sequence similarity and ubiquitous tissue zzso zzso and zzso both seemed to be zzso zzso of zzso zzso Three tandem zzso zzso were newly zzso Two of them, zzso and zzso seemed to be zzso to human zzso and zzso respectively, judging from their high sequence similarities zzso zzso However, zzso seemed to be a novel zzso zzso of zzso of zzso were analyzed by northern zzso In addition to adult zzso either of three tandem zzso zzso were expressed in whole zzso Moreover, zzso acid sequence analysis of liver proteins indicated that zzso zzso and zzso are produced as abundant zzso in the adult zzso
