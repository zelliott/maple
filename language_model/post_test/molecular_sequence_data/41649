zzso were the major components of wheat storage proteins and determine the zzso properties of zzso zzso In this work, 19 new full-length zzso genes were isolated from various zzso and zzso zzso zzso characterization showed that a specific zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in the rich zzso domain and zzso zzso domain, zzso Based on the sequence features of both zzso a new zzso system for zzso gene family was established, in which zzso were classified into two types zzso I and zzso with each consisting of two zzso An uneven distribution of different types and groups of zzso genes was exhibited among 11 zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that types I and II genes zzso at about 14 zzso while the divergence of 4 zzso group genes occurred at around 10 zzso almost zzso The zzso genes from zzso and B zzso displayed a different zzso expression pattern during grain development, and rapid increasing of zzso zzso and proteins occurred at zzso zzso In addition, zzso variations of zzso zzso among zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The A zzso and its related zzso zzso zzso and zzso had fewer CD zzso than other zzso suggesting that these zzso might be valuable gene resources to remove CD toxic peptides for wheat quality zzso
