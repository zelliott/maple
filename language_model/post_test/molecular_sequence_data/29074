zzso maintenance of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso proteins that are components of the zzso complex, necessary for sister zzso zzso These proteins may also function in DNA zzso Here we report that zzso is a component of the DNA damage response network that functions as an zzso in the zzso zzso checkpoint zzso zzso associates with zzso and is zzso in response to zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso Using mass zzso we established that zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso of zzso is required for zzso of the zzso checkpoint in response to zzso We also discovered that the zzso of zzso by zzso is required for the zzso of zzso establishing the role of zzso as an zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also involved in the zzso checkpoint zzso but this zzso is intact in zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso is a separate branch of the zzso checkpoint pathway, distinct from the zzso zzso zzso this work establishes the zzso branch, and provides a molecular basis for the zzso checkpoint zzso in zzso zzso
