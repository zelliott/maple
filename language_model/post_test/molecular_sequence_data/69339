The zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein that functions in the maintenance of iron zzso by zzso regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso Little is known concerning how factors other than iron may zzso the activity of this central regulator of cellular iron zzso We present evidence indicating that zzso of the zzso by protein zzso C zzso could provide a mechanism for regulation of zzso zzso zzso rat liver zzso was zzso by zzso up to zzso zzso of zzso of protein with zzso the modified zzso zzso zzso was also the zzso in the zzso in intact zzso The zzso of zzso for the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping identified one major zzso plus several other peptides with lesser amounts of zzso zzso peptides of the zzso containing zzso 138 zzso zzso and zzso 711 zzso zzso were zzso by zzso In zzso 60 cells, addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within 30 zzso and increased high affinity zzso zzso binding activity zzso After 90 zzso the level of zzso had increased further, and high affinity zzso zzso binding activity had increased zzso above the zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso was not altered in cells treated with zzso for 30 or 90 zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso Taken together, our studies begin to define a novel mechanism by which hormones, growth factors, and other agents may regulate cellular iron zzso through specific zzso of the zzso
