A method is described for the identification and relative zzso of zzso using accurate mass tags zzso generated by zzso zzso on a zzso instrument in conjunction with stable isotope labeling using zzso zzso zzso were used for putative zzso zzso followed by confirmation of zzso identity by tandem mass zzso For a combined set of 58 zzso peptides from bovine serum zzso zzso and human zzso a mean mass measurement accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This subset of zzso peptides was used to measure zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso using a method for calculating zzso ratios from overlapping zzso zzso arising from zzso of zzso zzso and zzso labeled zzso The model zzso acid zzso was used to calculate a representative molecular formula for zzso and zzso the contributions of naturally occurring zzso solely as a function of zzso molecular zzso The method was tested against simulated composite zzso zzso where zzso molecular weight, zzso ratio, zzso ratios, and number of sulfur atoms were zzso Relative errors of zzso or less were incurred when the zzso ratios were less than three, even for peptides where the number of sulfur atoms was zzso or zzso These data demonstrate that for zzso discovery, it is advantageous to label the zzso representing the disease state with zzso and the method is not sensitive to variations in zzso zzso This approach allows a comprehensive differentiation of expression levels and tentative identification via zzso followed by targeted analysis of zzso and zzso peptides using tandem mass zzso for applications such as the discovery of disease zzso
