The interaction between protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso was stable in zzso zzso or zzso zzso acid indicative of a zzso zzso Here we isolate the zzso zzso and demonstrate that zzso of zzso binds zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso to Ala, zzso or zzso abolished zzso binding to zzso as did reduction of the zzso zzso of the toxin with zzso The abolition of zzso binding increased the zzso for toxin zzso of zzso by zzso to zzso The zzso binding of zzso to protein zzso zzso explains the failure to detect this toxin zzso in suspected cases of zzso zzso
