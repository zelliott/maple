zzso of zzso zzso in zzso involves a negative feedback mechanism requiring the protein zzso Here we show that a similar mechanism exists in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso genes requires a specific zzso zzso zzso The efficiency of the zzso event reflects cellular zzso levels creating the zzso feedback zzso As shown here, the zzso zzso gene and several newly identified zzso genes from different zzso also require a zzso zzso event for their zzso Twelve zzso around the zzso site are identical between zzso and the zzso zzso The core element for this zzso is likely to have been present in the last common zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
