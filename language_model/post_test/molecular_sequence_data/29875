zzso zzso cells provide a system for studying the regulation of the expression of regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso cells contain zzso zzso two zzso zzso previously designated zzso and zzso and C zzso When the cells are treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and either 20 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha content declines zzso because of a large decrease in the zzso value for the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso expression is zzso but the amount and rate of synthesis of zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso and Rubin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso to zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso When zzso levels are elevated in zzso cells the abundance of the zzso zzso beta zzso increases zzso in parallel with the rate of zzso beta zzso synthesis indicating that zzso control is zzso Other R and C zzso are not markedly zzso Surprisingly, the rate of zzso initiation of the zzso beta gene and the stability of zzso beta zzso are not altered during zzso beta zzso Rather, the induction of zzso beta zzso is associated with the zzso of major zzso zzso and minor (4 zzso zzso beta zzso in the zzso It appears that the zzso zzso system alters a nuclear zzso such that either the proportion of zzso beta zzso that are processed to mature zzso and are exported to the zzso is greatly increased or the nuclear precursors are zzso Thus, regulation is exerted at a zzso zzso In order to establish directly a zzso role for C in zzso beta induction and to rule out artifacts introduced by the use of drugs such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso containing C alpha zzso under the regulation of the zzso zzso I zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso caused the zzso of zzso C zzso and the selective induction of zzso zzso
