The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso channel with a binding pocket for zzso acid zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We combined evolutionary analysis, structural zzso and experimental testing to study zzso of zzso zzso assembly and channel zzso We estimated the zzso probability of selection pressure at zzso acid zzso sites measured as zzso and built a comparative structural model, which identified several polar zzso under strong selection pressure at the zzso zzso that may form zzso hydrogen bonds or salt zzso At three selected sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions had strong effects on zzso zzso zzso and zzso We next examined the role of a predicted zzso salt bridge for zzso pair zzso The zzso zzso where the positively charged zzso is replaced by a zzso charged zzso yielded a partially zzso zzso and lacked membrane surface zzso The membrane surface expression was rescued by the double zzso zzso where positive and negative charges are zzso although the zzso zzso was zzso The single zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited diminished activities and altered kinetic profiles with fast recovery zzso suggesting that zzso salt bridge perhaps zzso the open state of the zzso zzso Our results emphasize the functional importance of highly zzso polar zzso at the zzso zzso in zzso zzso receptors and demonstrate how the integration of zzso and experimental approaches can aid discovery of functionally important zzso
