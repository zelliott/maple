The human RON and its mouse zzso zzso are members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that the RON gene is zzso in human breast zzso As cat zzso zzso have been proposed as a suitable model for aggressive human breast cancer, we identified the zzso zzso gene and studied its expression in cat zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were found highly zzso to the zzso and RON gene zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and RON zzso zzso zzso transcript was detected by zzso in cat lung and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso skin zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso analyses were carried out with an zzso that recognized both the human RON and mouse zzso zzso This zzso specifically detected a 135 zzso zzso protein and stained zzso zzso zzso archival zzso These data show that the pattern of expression and distribution of the zzso protein in zzso zzso cancer could be superimposed on that of the RON zzso in human breast cancer and suggest that these zzso zzso are a suitable model to test innovative approaches to therapy of aggressive human breast zzso
