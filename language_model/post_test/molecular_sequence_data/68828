A basic protein with a relative molecular mass of 19 zzso has been identified and isolated to purity from zzso partially zzso human zzso zzso Several criteria prove that this is the unique zzso zzso which was previously thought to be a zzso zzso zzso primary structure sequencing demonstrates zzso with human seminal zzso and zzso From the sequence and zzso data with zzso against basic seminal zzso zzso we propose that this zzso protein is a product of zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was not found among seminal plasma proteins and may be protected from further zzso into zzso peptides by its association with the zzso zzso zzso data indicate its zzso in the nuclear zzso with preferential concentration at the zzso zzso zzso
