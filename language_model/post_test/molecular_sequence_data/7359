We designed a zzso zzso zzso system for zzso species and used it to make zzso in and around a zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was constructed with a gene for zzso resistance that is expressed and zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso region from zzso zzso cloned in a zzso zzso was used as a target for zzso A series of 19 independent zzso insertions spanning the cloned region were zzso Four zzso clones in and around zzso were introduced by transformation into zzso zzso where each was found to replace zzso zzso DNA with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso containing a zzso zzso upstream of zzso grew on zzso as a nitrogen zzso Two zzso with insertions in zzso and one zzso with an zzso downstream of zzso did not grow on zzso The zzso zzso replacement technique should be generally zzso in the zzso for studying the effects of genetic zzso in zzso
