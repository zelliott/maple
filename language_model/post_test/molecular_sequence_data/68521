We have isolated and characterized zzso clones derived from a zzso regulated zzso rat zzso zzso zzso protein gene called zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso clones were also identified in zzso libraries from adult male zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts are at least zzso more abundant in the zzso zzso than in the zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso transcripts and proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso duct cells, and in the type III zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso distribution is similar to that described by Ball and colleagues zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Johnson, zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso identified proteins of zzso 20,000 in zzso 16,000 in zzso and 22,000 and 16,000 in zzso zzso The zzso 20,000 zzso and 22,000 zzso proteins represent zzso forms of a zzso 16,000 zzso suggesting that these zzso proteins arise by zzso modification of a common zzso
