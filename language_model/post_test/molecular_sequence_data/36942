It has been proposed that those plants which contain zzso zzso surrounded by more than two zzso have arisen through secondary zzso zzso zzso evidence confirms this proposal, but the nature of the zzso and the number of zzso remain zzso Whether zzso arose from one type of zzso zzso or multiple types is the subject of some zzso In order to try to resolve this question, the zzso gene content and arrangement has been studied from a zzso zzso Most of the gene clusters common to zzso zzso and zzso are preserved and zzso genes which are not found on the zzso zzso of land plants have been zzso Together with previously published zzso analyses of zzso zzso the present data support the notion that the type of zzso involved in the initial zzso was from within the zzso zzso and that an early divergence giving rise to the green plant lineage and the zzso lineage resulted in the differences in zzso gene content and sequence between these two zzso Multiple secondary zzso events involving a zzso (probably zzso zzso and different hosts are hypothesized to have occurred zzso giving rise to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
