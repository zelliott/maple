The Orange zzso gene is responsible for the zzso of zzso in zzso We isolated the Or gene zzso from storage roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed its function in transgenic zzso zzso The zzso gene has an open reading frame in the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso acid protein containing a zzso zinc finger zzso zzso was strongly expressed in storage roots of zzso zzso zzso it also was expressed in leaves, zzso and roots of zzso with alternatively colored storage zzso zzso zzso increased in response to zzso stress, with gene expression reaching maximum at 2 h after zzso Two different zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which contained seven extra zzso zzso were transformed into zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso The transgenic zzso were easily selected because they developed a fine orange zzso The expression levels of the zzso zzso and genes involved in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso transgenic zzso were similar, and both zzso displayed higher expression levels than those in zzso zzso The contents of zzso zzso and total zzso in zzso transgenic lines were approximately 10, 6, and 14 times higher than those in zzso zzso zzso The transgenic zzso zzso exhibited increased zzso activity and increased tolerance to salt zzso Our work shows that the zzso gene may be useful for the zzso development of transgenic zzso plants that accumulate increased zzso contents on marginal agricultural zzso
