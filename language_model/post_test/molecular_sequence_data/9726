zzso factors zzso are approximately zzso zzso zzso proteins initially identified by their ability to stimulate zzso toxin zzso activity and later recognized as critical components in zzso zzso transport and zzso D zzso zzso domain protein 1 zzso is a member of the zzso family that differs from other zzso by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that this extension acts as a zzso protein for the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso Moss, zzso and Vaughan, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 93, zzso Both zzso binding and zzso zzso are necessary for zzso function of zzso zzso zzso and the rates of zzso exchange and zzso activity are critical in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso domain of zzso was faster than from zzso itself (both proteins zzso in zzso zzso Using deletion zzso it was demonstrated that the 15 zzso acids directly preceding the zzso domain were responsible for decreasing the rate of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso it was shown that zzso zzso acids in this region were particularly important in stabilizing the zzso form of zzso It is suggested that, like the zzso segment of zzso the equivalent region in zzso located between the zzso protein and zzso zzso may act as a zzso zzso zzso
