Several strains isolated from the zzso zzso zzso were characterized on the basis of diverse zzso zzso and symbiotic zzso These novel strains formed two groups closely related to zzso zzso according to their zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso designated as the type strains of these two groups, presented zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in their zzso zzso gene sequences with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso In spite of these high similarity values, the analysis of additional zzso markers such as zzso and zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that strains zzso and zzso represented two separate novel species of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso as their closest zzso zzso differences among the novel strains isolated from zzso and zzso zzso were found regarding the zzso of carbon sources and zzso zzso All these differences were zzso with zzso zzso analysis which revealed zzso genetic zzso between strains zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, between these strains and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes of strains zzso and zzso were zzso divergent from those of zzso species that zzso zzso zzso was not zzso by the novel zzso zzso Based on the zzso and zzso data obtained in this study, the new strains represent two novel species for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
