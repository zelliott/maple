The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso sequences are often associated with other repetitive zzso forming arrangements which have been called zzso zzso zzso mosaic zzso It is estimated that the zzso coli zzso carries approximately zzso zzso whose biological role is at present zzso We have identified a family of zzso consisting of two zzso zzso sequences zzso a 35 zzso zzso segment which carries a zzso DNA bend and a binding site for zzso the integration host factor of zzso We estimate that the zzso zzso harbors approximately 100 copies of this zzso which we name zzso zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed by gel zzso and by zzso the in zzso interaction of zzso with individual zzso and shown that the protein binds strongly and specifically to their zzso We have also demonstrated binding of zzso to the zzso population of zzso using a new approach which combines two-dimensional zzso and Southern zzso zzso elements are at the end of zzso units, and thus define a new class of zzso zzso zzso implications for zzso structure and DNA zzso are zzso
