zzso in fatty acid metabolism are involved in the zzso of insulin resistance and the related zzso hypertension, and zzso zzso The fatty acid transport proteins zzso are implicated in facilitated cellular zzso of zzso fatty acids zzso thus potentially regulating zzso zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso zzso in the zzso gene with respect to associations with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso variables and markers of insulin resistance in zzso healthy, middle-aged Swedish men and to evaluate possible mechanisms behind any associations zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso had significantly lower body mass index and, correcting for body mass index, significantly lower zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, insulin zzso and zzso model assessment index compared with common zzso A three-dimensional model of the zzso protein based on structural and functional similarity with zzso zzso revealed that the variable zzso 209 is exposed in a region potentially involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, the model indicated functional regions with respect to zzso transport and zzso A zzso activity and membrane zzso These findings propose zzso as a candidate gene for the insulin resistance syndrome and provide a structural basis for understanding zzso function in zzso transport and zzso
