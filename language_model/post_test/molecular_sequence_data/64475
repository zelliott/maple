Alternative zzso of zzso is an important mechanism for the generation of zzso protein zzso Unfortunately, the contribution of alternative zzso to protein diversity is currently not well understood because many full-length zzso sequences have yet to be zzso In this report, we describe the use of zzso to identify and clone 279 novel alternatively spliced zzso from 114 well-known drug target zzso Our findings demonstrate the existence of many novel alternatively spliced zzso transcripts and suggest that many more genes undergo functionally significant alternative zzso than previously zzso
