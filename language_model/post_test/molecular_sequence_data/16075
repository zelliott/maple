A novel DNA zzso in zzso coli was zzso It is the smallest natural isolate zzso zzso found so zzso In the presence of zzso zzso it grows as a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso to previously identified zzso this zzso displays sequence zzso only to parts of the zzso viral and complementary strand zzso In the absence of zzso this DNA replicates zzso The only gene zzso of the zzso encodes a zzso zzso which is essential for autonomous zzso The host rep gene required for replication of zzso DNA zzso is zzso zzso replication mechanisms are thus involved during growth as defective zzso or as autonomous zzso
