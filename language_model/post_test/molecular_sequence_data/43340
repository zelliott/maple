The human zzso virus type 2 zzso strain zzso can efficiently use the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a primary zzso to enter zzso zzso We have zzso expressed zzso on mink lung zzso and zzso kidney CCC cells zzso restrictive to zzso zzso and have shown efficient fusion, entry, and replication of zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso sites on zzso zzso and zzso or zzso of CCC or zzso cells expressing zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso increased fusion and entry by zzso zzso of portions of the N zzso of zzso resulted in a 3- to zzso decrease in zzso infection by zzso and complete zzso of zzso fusion by both zzso and another zzso strain, zzso These data suggest that the zzso domain of zzso is involved in but is not essential for the efficient fusion of zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso did not significantly affect entry by zzso indicating that zzso zzso through this domain does not play a significant role in entry by zzso
