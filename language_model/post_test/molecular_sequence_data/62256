zzso occurring zzso in the regulatory zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso can result in pronounced pathological changes that may stem from increases in muscle zzso levels, making it critical to understand the zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso In this study we cloned the mouse zzso zzso and revealed that there are two zzso start sites, which result in a long form, zzso zzso and a short form, zzso zzso zzso is the zzso form in mouse and is specifically expressed in mouse skeletal muscle at the protein zzso In skeletal muscle, zzso shows higher levels of expression in zzso white zzso muscle zzso zzso compared with zzso red zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso whereas zzso is zzso in zzso muscle, a zzso zzso muscle with predominantly type I zzso zzso can zzso with both alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in mouse zzso anterior muscle in zzso has no effect on zzso and zzso zzso expression and does not alter zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso significantly increases zzso zzso and activity by approximately zzso The increase in zzso activity is not associated with zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso of zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso zzso functions in the regulation of zzso zzso activity, but it is not associated with changes in muscle zzso zzso
