zzso zzso is a zzso protein that binds to zzso zzso zzso within certain zzso and causes zzso of those zzso Mice deficient in zzso develop a profound inflammatory syndrome with zzso arthritis, zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso is zzso extensively in intact zzso However, limited information is available about the identities of these zzso zzso We investigated the zzso sites in human zzso from zzso zzso cells by zzso and zzso zzso A number of zzso sites including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein identification zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso in the human protein significantly increased zzso gel mobility zzso to be zzso whereas zzso at the other sites had little effect on its gel zzso zzso and in zzso zzso studies showed that zzso proteins containing multiple zzso were still zzso and all were able to bind to zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso showed a similar zzso zzso of zzso among the various zzso zzso zzso and zzso are predicted by motif scanning to be potential sites for protein zzso A, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 (both zzso and zzso zzso The present study has identified multiple zzso sites in the zzso protein zzso in zzso cells and should provide the molecular basis for further studies on the function and regulation of zzso in controlling zzso zzso
