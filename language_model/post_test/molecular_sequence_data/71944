The sequence data zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1998) of a newly discovered zzso DNA virus, zzso virus zzso showed that it did not have the terminal structure typical of a zzso zzso of the complete zzso structure was necessary to understand the nature of zzso We obtained a zzso amplified product from serum samples of four zzso carriers by an zzso zzso long zzso targeted for zzso zzso zzso to zzso and 1 to 216 of zzso The sequence of a clone obtained from serum sample zzso was compared with those registered in zzso The complete circular zzso zzso contained a novel sequence of 113 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in between the known zzso and zzso arms, forming a zzso zzso stretch zzso content, zzso at zzso zzso to zzso We found a zzso stretch zzso zzso to zzso with an zzso similarity to chicken anemia virus zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso a zzso zzso A putative zzso site was located at zzso zzso to zzso followed by a zzso box at zzso 85 to 90, the first initiation zzso of a putative zzso at zzso 107 to zzso the termination zzso of a putative zzso at zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso signal at zzso zzso to zzso The arrangement was similar to that of zzso Furthermore, several zzso and zzso binding sites and an zzso site were arranged around the zzso region in both zzso and zzso The data suggested that zzso is circular and similar to zzso in its zzso organization, zzso that zzso is the first human zzso
