During early pregnancy in zzso zzso zzso from the corpus zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso act on the zzso to regulate genes important for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The use of the zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso has demonstrated the critical role of zzso zzso in regulation of zzso survival and zzso A custom zzso zzso array was used to identify zzso in gene expression of zzso from Day 14 zzso pregnant, and zzso zzso zzso 1) and from zzso zzso treated with zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso and control proteins or zzso zzso zzso In study 1, expression of 47 genes was more than zzso different between Day 14 pregnant and zzso zzso whereas 23 genes was different between Day 14 zzso and zzso zzso In study 2, 70 genes were different due to zzso alone, 74 genes were affected by zzso in a zzso manner, and 180 genes were regulated by zzso in a zzso zzso In each study, an approximately equal number of genes were found to be activated or zzso in each zzso zzso genes increased by pregnancy and zzso and/or zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased by pregnancy and zzso and/or zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Identification and analysis of these zzso responsive genes will help define zzso pathways critical for zzso support of zzso zzso survival, growth, and zzso
