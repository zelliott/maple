zzso repair zzso and replication errors zzso occur in approximately zzso of sporadic zzso zzso zzso zzso in several cancer zzso zzso especially in their zzso repeats, are seen in zzso zzso In a survey of zzso breast cancer genes in zzso cancer, we analyzed the entire coding sequence of zzso and zzso in 51 zzso tumors, of which 12 were zzso Seven zzso zzso were identified in six zzso of the zzso tumors, but none in zzso zzso A novel base pair deletion at a zzso tract in zzso zzso 2, causing an zzso zzso deletion of zzso 3, was observed in four tumors, one of which contained a second, zzso zzso zzso Two tumors exhibited zzso zzso at zzso tracts in zzso and zzso zzso 11, both predicted to result in premature translation zzso Whereas most zzso in zzso and zzso are known to affect the more zzso regions interacting with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso this is the first demonstration of a zzso zzso zzso that specifically zzso the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our results suggest that zzso zzso in zzso to some extent zzso may zzso a growth advantage in zzso zzso zzso
