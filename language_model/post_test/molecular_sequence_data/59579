We now zzso key issues that we have investigated and highlight additional areas that need to be zzso We are interested in two basic aspects of the zzso pathway, those occurring in the brain, involving the synthesis of zzso and those occurring in the zzso involving signaling by zzso We have a long-term interest in the activity and regulation of the zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso With respect to human disease, it is interesting that, despite the primal role played by zzso in zzso zzso no zzso in the zzso gene have yet been identified in association with growth zzso Focusing on the downstream signaling components of the zzso pathway, we now know quite a lot about the structure of the zzso zzso and about some aspects of the signal zzso pathways that mediate the actions of zzso With respect to human disease, we have found that in an animal model, the little zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso results in zzso zzso and a dwarf zzso and there are ongoing attempts in several laboratories to try to identify similar zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in patients with isolated zzso zzso zzso there is also substantial interest in whether zzso zzso in this zzso might be identified in patients with zzso zzso zzso We are also interested in whether there are additional receptors that might mediate some of the zzso actions of zzso Finally, a major direction we are taking in the laboratory at the present time is toward understanding the zzso zzso and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
