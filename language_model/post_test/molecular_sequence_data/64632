The zzso zzso syndrome zzso is an aggressive zzso zzso caused by the fusion of diverse partner genes to zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso The partner proteins promote zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a manner analogous to zzso in chronic zzso zzso Here, we describe the identification of a new zzso fusion gene in a patient who presented with zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with an acquired zzso zzso FISH analysis and Southern zzso confirmed that zzso was zzso Using zzso zzso we identified part of a novel zzso zzso at zzso band zzso that was fused to zzso 9 of zzso is predicted to be translated into an zzso zzso protein containing zzso zzso but no other recognizable zzso The presence of the zzso gene was confirmed by zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso These data further support the central role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
