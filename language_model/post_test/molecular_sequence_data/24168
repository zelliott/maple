The zzso zzso acid and zzso signaling pathways respond to environmental stimuli and in order to understand how plants adapt to zzso and zzso stresses it is important to understand how these pathways interact each zzso In this paper, we report a novel zzso zzso and zzso factor 3 zzso unites these zzso zzso which functions as an in zzso zzso zzso in zzso binds to the zzso box, an element responsive to zzso zzso as well as to zzso a zzso element that responds to dehydration, high salt and zzso zzso of zzso in tomato is mainly induced by zzso zzso cold, salt or zzso zzso expression of zzso in transgenic tobacco significantly activated expression of zzso genes that contained the zzso box, resulting in enhanced tolerance to zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
