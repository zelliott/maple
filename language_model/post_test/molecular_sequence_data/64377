The retrieval of zzso DNA zzso sequences from four zzso fossils from Germany, Russia, and Croatia has demonstrated that these individuals carried closely related zzso that are not found among current zzso However, these results do not definitively resolve the question of a possible zzso contribution to the gene pool of modern humans since such a contribution might have been erased by genetic drift or by the continuous influx of modern human DNA into the zzso gene zzso A further concern is that if some zzso carried zzso sequences similar to zzso humans, such sequences may be erroneously regarded as modern zzso when retrieved from zzso Here we address these issues by the analysis of 24 zzso and 40 early modern human zzso The zzso preservation of four zzso and of five early modern humans was good enough to suggest the preservation of zzso All four zzso yielded zzso sequences similar to those previously determined from zzso individuals, whereas none of the five early modern humans contained such zzso zzso In combination with current zzso data, this excludes any large genetic contribution by zzso to early modern humans, but does not rule out the possibility of a smaller zzso
