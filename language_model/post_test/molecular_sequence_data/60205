zzso A, an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso is expressed most abundantly in zzso cells and in cells of zzso zzso In order to study its role in normal and pathological conditions we have prepared and characterized zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso Two high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested for binding to free and zzso zzso A and to a zzso zzso consisting of 61 zzso acid zzso of zzso A and 37 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized not only free zzso A but also zzso A in complex with zzso The zzso were further tested for their zzso against zzso A and B isolated from different zzso zzso On the basis of sequence similarity and zzso structure of human zzso A we have prepared three zzso - zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso with the zzso was zzso The binding affinities of zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower, indicating zzso two zzso acids are part of the zzso A zzso recognized by zzso The binding of both zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso was comparable to zzso zzso zzso
