A zzso zzso has earlier been isolated from the seeds of zzso zzso in our laboratory by conventional protein zzso zzso We now established conditions to bind the zzso on zzso gel in the presence of zzso M ammonium zzso in zzso zzso pH zzso It can be specifically zzso with zzso M zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso binds to Con A, zzso zzso and has an apparent native molecular weight of 120 zzso 5 zzso In zzso under reducing conditions, it zzso into two zzso of molecular mass zzso 31 and 29 zzso Among a number of zzso tested for zzso activity of the zzso zzso was found to be a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso specifically reacted with the zzso zzso in Western zzso analysis and zzso an zzso raised to the isolated 31 zzso zzso show zzso with both the zzso zzso terminal sequences of both the zzso are zzso The zzso zzso is stable up to 40 degrees C with a pH optimum of zzso The zzso has a high content of zzso zzso acids and lacks zzso zzso zzso Chemical modification of the zzso with zzso zzso indicates the possible role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
