zzso with the zzso virus zzso is a strong zzso factor in the development of zzso zzso zzso Many viral gene products including zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso although the de zzso control of these viral zzso remains largely zzso The recent discovery of zzso viral zzso zzso in zzso zzso has prompted us to examine the zzso zzso zzso Using large-scale cloning analysis on zzso zzso cells, two novel zzso zzso now named zzso and zzso were zzso These two zzso zzso are abundantly expressed in most zzso zzso We found two zzso variations in the primary transcript of zzso which we zzso confirmed to augment its zzso in zzso and thus may underline the high and consistent expression of zzso in zzso zzso More importantly, we determined that the zzso zzso membrane protein 2A zzso is the putative target of zzso zzso is a potent zzso viral zzso that is recognized by the zzso T zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso may permit escape of zzso cells from host immune zzso Taken together, we demonstrated that two newly identified zzso zzso are highly expressed in zzso zzso sequence variations on the prevalent zzso strain in our locality might contribute to the higher zzso expression level in our zzso zzso Our findings emphasize the role of zzso in modulating zzso zzso which may facilitate zzso zzso by evading the host immune zzso
