The cellular architecture of zzso is one of the most complex known within zzso zzso systematic schemes have thus been constructed through extensive comparative zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso and of its internal zzso derivatives (the zzso as well as of the architecture of the oral zzso In recent years, a consensus was reached in which the zzso was divided in eight classes as defined by Lynn and Corliss zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) in zzso Anatomy of zzso zzso zzso New zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso By comparing partial sequences of the large zzso zzso zzso and by using both zzso and zzso construction methods zzso by zzso we examine the zzso relationships of 22 species belonging to seven of these eight zzso At low zzso levels, the traditional grouping of the species is generally zzso At higher zzso levels, the branching pattern of these seven classes is resolved in several deeply separated major zzso Surprisingly, the first emerging one contains the zzso and is strongly associated with a zzso but deeply separated from zzso The zzso the zzso and the zzso separate later in a zzso zzso hindering the resolution of their order of zzso These results show a much more ancient origin of zzso than was classically zzso indicating that zzso abundantly zzso oral zzso do not zzso to zzso zzso traits as previously zzso They also suggest the occurrence of a major zzso explosion in the evolutionary history of the zzso yielding five of the eight classes of the zzso These classes appear to differ essentially according to the zzso architecture used to shape and sustain the cellular zzso (a process of essential zzso and zzso importance in zzso
