The assembly and zzso of transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso is dependent upon zzso interactions between their zzso and mature zzso Despite the importance of this interaction, little is known regarding the underlying regulatory zzso In this study, the binding interface between the zzso and mature zzso of the zzso zzso was characterized using in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso near the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified that, when zzso to zzso disrupted zzso assembly and zzso It is zzso that these zzso mediate zzso by interacting zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the outer convex surface of the mature zzso zzso modeling indicated that these mature zzso are located at the interface between two zzso of the zzso and that their side chains form a zzso packing zzso zzso of these zzso likely zzso the zzso of this region, thereby zzso zzso interactions with the zzso A similar zzso interface was identified spanning the zzso and mature zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of key zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso across this interface was disruptive for the production of both zzso A and zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso reduced its ability to zzso or inhibit the activity of, zzso zzso Conservation of the identified zzso motifs in the zzso and mature zzso of other transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso suggests that we have identified a common zzso zzso governing zzso zzso
