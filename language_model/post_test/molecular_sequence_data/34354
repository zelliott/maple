zzso group zzso zzso plasmids have received recent attention for their broad host range and ability to zzso resistance to multiple zzso zzso Due to the potential spread of zzso resistance zzso zzso from zzso pathogens to human zzso the dissemination of these plasmids represents a public health zzso In this study, four zzso zzso plasmids isolated from zzso coli were zzso and zzso including zzso from commercial dairy cows, pigs and zzso in the zzso and zzso These plasmids were initially selected because they either contained the zzso and zzso genes zzso for zzso and zzso resistance, respectively, and/or the zzso gene zzso for extended spectrum zzso zzso Overall, sequence analysis revealed that each of the four plasmids retained a remarkably stable and zzso backbone zzso with differences observed primarily within their accessory regions, which presumably have evolved via horizontal gene transfer events involving multiple zzso zzso of these plasmids with other available zzso zzso sequences further defined the core and accessory elements of these plasmids in zzso coli and zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso lineage appears to have derived from an ancestral zzso zzso type harboring zzso and zzso accessory zzso Evidence is mounting that zzso plasmids are widespread among enteric bacteria of production animals and these emergent plasmids have flexibility in their acquisition of zzso zzso zzso further study to understand the evolutionary mechanisms involved in their dissemination and stability in bacterial zzso
