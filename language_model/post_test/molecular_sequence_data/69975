The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso growth zzso zzso with zzso similarity to its human counterpart in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains two B1 repeats in its 3' zzso region and a zzso zzso to the human zzso The mouse zzso gene is expressed at low level in specific zzso of the adult animal such as zzso heart, lung and zzso In zzso zzso analysis during zzso zzso zzso zzso to day zzso reveals a very restricted expression zzso zzso transcripts are first detected in a few zzso cells at day zzso During zzso the transcripts are expressed in the forming zzso and later during development zzso gene expression is restricted to the zzso zzso of the developing zzso This expression pattern suggests a role for zzso gene in the determination of the zzso cells that subsequently give rise to the zzso
