A composite zzso zzso DNA sequence zzso base pairs in length was determined from three zzso clones isolated from a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso acids encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristic of the steroid zzso family include an zzso region with five repeated zzso acid zzso a central zzso domain zzso with other steroid zzso and a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso probe used in Northern zzso analysis zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in male zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was indicated in rat zzso prostate by an increase in the level of zzso zzso after zzso and suppression of zzso zzso upon zzso zzso A 15 zzso acid zzso with sequence derived from the deduced zzso zzso sequence was zzso and used as zzso in raising zzso zzso in zzso zzso reacted with high zzso against the synthetic zzso by zzso zzso zzso and against the native zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by an increase in zzso zzso rate determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso localized the zzso zzso to zzso cell zzso in rat zzso zzso
