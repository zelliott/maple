The organisms of a zzso layer beneath the shards of a gypsum rock were characterized by molecular zzso The zzso consortium consisted almost exclusively of zzso zzso The organisms of the shards expressed zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and in zzso After a prolonged period of drought at the rock, the cells were zzso but they resumed zzso activity 2 to 3 days after the addition of zzso In a suspension culture of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso reduction required zzso conditions and was strictly dependent on low light zzso zzso of a segment of the zzso zzso gene zzso indicated that zzso possesses the alternative zzso zzso 2, expressed in zzso zzso only under reduced zzso zzso rather than the zzso common zzso zzso The shards apparently provide zzso with reduced light zzso and reduced zzso tension that allow zzso fixation to proceed in the zzso zzso at the gypsum rock, unless the activity is due to minute amounts of other, very active zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences tends to suggest that zzso zzso 2 is characteristic of those zzso or zzso zzso zzso fixing zzso under zzso conditions zzso
