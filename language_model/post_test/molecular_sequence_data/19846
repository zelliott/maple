The objective of study was to investigate the combined effect of zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso gene on the zzso cell cycle and zzso of chronic zzso leukemia cell line zzso zzso gene was amplified from peripheral blood zzso cells by zzso and confirmed by DNA sequencing, then the zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into zzso cell line by zzso After screening with zzso zzso cell clone zzso expressing zzso was zzso zzso protein was identified by Western zzso The cell survival rate was determined by zzso cell cycle and zzso were detected by flow zzso The results showed that partial deletion of zzso gene in zzso cells was verified by DNA sequencing, leading to the function of zzso protein to be zzso The expression of zzso protein can be detected by Western zzso in zzso zzso A strong zzso of cell proliferation was observed in zzso cells as compared with that of the control zzso zzso The cells of zzso phase in zzso cells increased apparently, and S phase cells declined zzso Cell cycle was arrested in zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cells greatly increased after zzso with zzso cells combined with zzso and cell survival rate notably zzso It is concluded that the zzso in combination with the expression of zzso gene has a synergistic effect on the zzso of zzso cell proliferation and promotion of its zzso
