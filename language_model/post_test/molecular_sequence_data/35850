zzso through its binding to the zzso zzso functions as a major zzso of zzso zzso and as a carrier for various small molecules in its zzso across continuous zzso via zzso zzso Several zzso proteins zzso have been zzso three zzso zzso which we call zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso and rich in zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso raised against bovine zzso zzso to investigate the possible zzso among zzso to better understand their role in binding and zzso zzso not only zzso with zzso zzso by cultured zzso but also recognized zzso in zzso of cultured zzso human, and bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso binding to both zzso and zzso zzso This effect was eliminated by zzso of zzso to immobilized zzso zzso also significantly inhibited zzso binding to cultured zzso zzso cells via its interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso were also tested, and one serum raised against a zzso encompassing an zzso region of zzso recognized both zzso and zzso but did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not recognized by any of these zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are functionally and zzso related zzso that may share a common zzso zzso zzso appears to be the major zzso of zzso binding to zzso zzso
