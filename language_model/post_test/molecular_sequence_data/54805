One of the most important goals in zzso is the ability to predict zzso structure of a protein from its zzso acid zzso In this paper, new feature groups based on the physical and zzso properties of zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso side zzso predicted secondary structure based on zzso frequency of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are proposed to tackle this zzso The proposed features are extracted using a modified feature extraction method adapted from zzso et zzso To study the effectiveness of the proposed features and the modified feature extraction method, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Support zzso zzso zzso that have been commonly and successfully applied to the protein folding problem are zzso Our experimental results show that the new feature groups altogether with the modified feature extraction method are capable of enhancing the protein fold prediction accuracy better than the previous works found in the zzso
