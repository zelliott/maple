In previous in zzso studies, zzso fibers formed from a zzso ubiquitous in human seminal fluid zzso zzso of viral infection zzso were found to dramatically enhance the zzso of the zzso virus zzso orders of magnitude by some zzso To complement those studies, we performed in zzso zzso of zzso the most active precursor to zzso and other zzso zzso to investigate the physical mechanisms by which the zzso promotes the interaction with zzso zzso At zzso (but not at zzso zzso freshly dissolved zzso zzso the formation of large zzso zzso in a variety of membrane compositions, which may be linked to the promotion of zzso transport in the zzso environment rather than transport by a random zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is itself zzso and zzso the integrity of the membrane in such a way that may promote fusion by the zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso of zzso lying parallel to the membrane surface, is implicated in promoting bridging interactions between zzso by the screening of the zzso zzso that occurs when two zzso are brought into close zzso This suggests that zzso binding of zzso or small zzso forms of zzso in a zzso zzso to zzso zzso may be an additional mechanism by which zzso enhances the zzso of the zzso zzso
