zzso acid zzso is both necessary and sufficient to promote fiber zzso in cultured zzso zzso of the zzso cotton variety Coker zzso This is likely due to the zzso and spatial regulation of zzso zzso perception, and subsequent signal zzso that leads to zzso in gene expression and zzso Our results indicate that the initiation of fiber zzso by the application of zzso to cultured zzso zzso with increased expression of genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are involved in promoting cell zzso To gain a better understanding of the zzso signaling components in cotton, that lead to such changes in gene zzso two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and two zzso protein genes zzso and zzso that are zzso to the rice zzso zzso zzso and the rice zzso gene zzso respectively, were zzso Similar to the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso is under the negative regulation by zzso while zzso positively regulates zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity in zzso that was zzso in the presence of zzso zzso or rice zzso indicating complex formation between the receptors and zzso zzso This was further supported by the zzso interaction of these proteins in zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso in the rice zzso zzso plants rescued the zzso dwarf zzso which demonstrates that it is a functional zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso in wild type zzso led to reduced growth and zzso expression of zzso zzso
