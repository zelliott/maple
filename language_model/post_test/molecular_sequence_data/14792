zzso labeling and mass zzso are seeing increased use together as a way to obtain insight into the zzso structure of proteins and protein zzso Several zzso acid specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso are available for this zzso zzso zzso is a promising labeling zzso because it can potentially probe up to zzso of the zzso in the average protein and gives only one reaction product, thereby zzso mass zzso zzso It was recently reported, though, that zzso modifications are zzso for some zzso zzso Here, we show that label loss is more significant and widespread than previously thought, especially for zzso zzso zzso and His zzso when relatively long protein zzso times are zzso Such label loss ultimately decreases the amount of protein structural information that is zzso with this zzso We find, however, that the number of zzso modified zzso and, thus, protein structural information, can be significantly increased by decreasing the time between the zzso labeling reaction and the mass zzso zzso This is most effectively accomplished using short zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso with zzso such as immobilized zzso or zzso rather than using methods zzso zzso or zzso zzso that accelerate zzso in other zzso Using short zzso times, we show that the percentage of zzso accessible zzso that can be modified by zzso increases from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso In effect, these increased numbers of modified zzso improve the protein structural resolution available from this zzso labeling zzso Compared with typical overnight zzso conditions, the short zzso times decrease the average distance between modified zzso from 11 to 7 zzso for zzso 13 to 10 zzso for zzso zzso and 9 to 8 zzso for zzso
