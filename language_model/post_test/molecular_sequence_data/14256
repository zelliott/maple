zzso zzso are a rich source of zzso zzso zzso For the most part, they are structurally related small zzso proteins containing a zzso pattern of six zzso that is assumed to dictate their common three-dimensional zzso In the conventional pattern, two zzso bridges connect an zzso segment to the zzso strand of a double- or zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso scaffold zzso Here we show that two zzso zzso peptides from zzso zzso conserve the zzso spacing of common scorpion zzso peptides but display an unconventional zzso pattern, accompanied by a complete zzso of the secondary structure zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural comparisons of the peptides adopting this novel fold suggest that it would be a new zzso of the widespread zzso scaffold, thus revealing an unexpected structural versatility of these small zzso zzso zzso of such versatility is important to understand how zzso structural complexity emerged on a limited number of molecular zzso
