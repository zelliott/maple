zzso zzso was adopted for the construction of zzso acid zzso zzso having beta zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the first zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso as starting sugar derivatives to react with zzso zzso zzso zzso of 5 with 9 and 10 gave zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso 12 and 15 with zzso zzso gave products zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of 5 with 11 followed by treatment with zzso zzso gave compounds zzso and zzso zzso The second step zzso of 14 and 17 with zzso zzso zzso zzso gave zzso derivatives (23) and zzso respectively, and that of 18 with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gave zzso derivatives (25) and zzso zzso The removal of the protecting groups of zzso gave zzso zzso respectively, having a zzso zzso as one of two sugar components in the zzso The zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso on carbon zzso zzso zzso in zzso were compared with zzso zzso having only neutral sugar components and naturally occurring zzso zzso having two zzso sugar components zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
