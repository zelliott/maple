To examine the possible role of zzso box genes in zzso development we have studied the structure and expression pattern of zzso a newly isolated zzso box gene that maps to the left end of the mouse zzso locus on zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso box has been zzso It is highly zzso to zzso and zzso demonstrating extended conservation among three zzso box complexes in the zzso Northern and in zzso zzso analyses of zzso demonstrate a novel, regionally restricted pattern of expression in developing zzso and zzso We detect localized zzso transcripts as early as zzso days zzso The expression pattern of zzso was analyzed over the next 3 days of zzso as well as in later zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso reconstruction of zzso transcript zzso within the central nervous system of early zzso clearly illustrates the neural expression zzso Although the zzso expression pattern is regionally restricted during all of these stages of development, the pattern changes along the zzso and zzso axes of the zzso as the zzso zzso complex zzso movements and zzso
