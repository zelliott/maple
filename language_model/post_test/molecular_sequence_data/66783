The zzso Va light chain zzso has been proposed to function as an zzso to link the zzso to certain zzso Here, we mapped the binding site for zzso within the zzso Va heavy zzso zzso and pull-down experiments showed that the heavy chain contains a single zzso binding site and that this site resides within a zzso in the zzso central zzso zzso zzso zzso B, an alternatively zzso zzso acid zzso is a part of this binding site, and we show in the context of full-length zzso Va that this zzso is required for zzso Va zzso We investigated the effect of zzso binding on the structure of a zzso Va heavy chain zzso that contains the zzso binding site and zzso zzso only parts of which are strongly predicted to form a coiled zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso change in the secondary structure of this zzso zzso zzso that is consistent with an increase in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the binding of zzso considerably zzso this heavy chain zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded an apparent association constant of approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso for the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Together, these data show that alternative zzso of the zzso Va heavy chain controls zzso Va interaction and that zzso binding alters the structure of a portion of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso B could have a significant impact on the zzso and regulatory folding of native zzso zzso as well as on its interaction with certain zzso
