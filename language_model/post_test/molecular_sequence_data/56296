The zzso protein zzso by the avian zzso virus zzso is responsible for the transformation of zzso and zzso by this zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso which lie zzso terminal to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso destroys the ability of the virus to transform zzso cells without severely affecting zzso zzso This region is termed the zzso and has been zzso to contain a region important for zzso cell zzso zzso deletions of approximately 23 zzso acids were introduced throughout the zzso in an attempt to locate a specific region that was essential for zzso cell zzso Several of the deletions gave rise to a partial transformed zzso although no single deletion that completely abolished zzso cell transformation was zzso Interestingly, deletion of zzso acids zzso resulted in a zzso zzso protein that was more active for zzso cell transformation than the zzso zzso zzso zzso This indicates that there is a negative regulatory region located within this region that normally partially suppresses the transforming activity of the zzso protein for zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso contains both negative and positive regulatory regions that function in zzso cells, and complete deletion of the region is necessary to abolish zzso cell zzso
