zzso complexes have largely been studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although this approach has been widely and successfully used it is limited because it has difficulties reliably discriminating true from false protein complex zzso identifying zzso zzso and detecting quantitative changes in complex composition or state of modification of complex zzso We have developed a protocol that enables us to zzso in a single zzso analysis, the true protein constituents of a complex, to detect changes in the complex zzso and to zzso zzso sites and estimate their respective zzso The method is based on the combination of zzso zzso zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso labeling and protein zzso treatment of zzso It was evaluated on model peptides and proteins and on the complex zzso isolated by tandem affinity zzso from zzso zzso The two known zzso in zzso and zzso could be zzso shown to be fully zzso The protocol was then applied to the analysis of samples zzso from zzso zzso cells expressing an zzso form of the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso These experiments allowed us to identify zzso zzso and the insulin zzso as specific zzso zzso In a further experiment, we compared the zzso materials obtained from zzso zzso cells that were either treated with insulin or left zzso This analysis showed that hormone stimulation increases the association of zzso proteins with zzso and zzso several zzso sites of the zzso some of which are located within predicted recognition motives of zzso zzso
