Previous studies have suggested that zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso synthetic zzso may be associated with differences in blood lead levels, perhaps due to differential binding of lead in zzso The authors examined associations of zzso zzso with blood lead and zinc zzso zzso levels, exposure zzso sex, and plant in 308 currently exposed lead workers in three lead storage battery manufacturing plants in the Republic of Korea in zzso The overall prevalence of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso but prevalence varied by plant zzso zzso zzso zzso in plant A, zzso in plant B, and zzso in plant zzso While zzso was not associated with mean blood lead levels, the zzso was associated with blood lead levels greater than or equal to 40 zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso adjusted OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with adjustment for sex, plant, and exposure zzso and with exposure zzso greater than 6 years zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with adjustment for blood lead, sex, and zzso Among workers in plant C, the highest exposure plant, zzso was associated with lower zzso levels when controlling for blood lead zzso These data suggest that lead zzso may be modified by zzso zzso and that zzso may be protective for the health effects of zzso zzso zzso also appears to have been a selection factor for current lead exposure status in the studied zzso
