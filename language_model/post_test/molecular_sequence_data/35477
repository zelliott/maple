Several reports mention the presence of zzso resistance genes in natural and zzso zzso but many studies are based on their detection via zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of known genes and not on an activity zzso We constructed a zzso zzso bank from DNA isolated from a zzso river in Brussels, Belgium, the zzso A total of zzso clones were pooled and zzso directly on solid media containing different zzso Several clones were isolated which could grow in the presence of zzso The DNA from several clones was extracted and subjected to restriction analysis and, based on their restriction pattern, two different clones were zzso One of the clones was selected for further study as it showed a higher level of resistance to different zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso To find out which gene is responsible for the resistance, an in zzso zzso zzso was performed and clones having lost the resistance zzso were analyzed via inverse zzso zzso Several clones had an insert in a gene zzso a new type of zzso The amplified zzso DNA was fully zzso revealing an insert of 41 zzso containing 39 open reading frames zzso zzso insertions zzso the resistance to zzso were also found in the zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso an zzso suggesting a polar effect on the zzso of the gene zzso In addition, other genes were found such as zzso zzso zzso which were found to be scattered on the zzso a zzso zzso and genes belonging to type II zzso zzso This predicted system was zzso validated in zzso coli using an zzso expression zzso
