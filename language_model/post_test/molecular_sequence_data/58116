zzso zzso of the human zzso for zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso have previously been described by using zzso These zzso were shown to exhibit different patterns of zzso with zzso Among human zzso zzso gamma zzso has been detected on B cells but not T cells when assessed by flow zzso and zzso with the use of zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso and zzso were found to react with B cells, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not react with any zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso and zzso react strongly with the majority zzso of B cells zzso and zzso with a proportion zzso of T cells zzso including 10 to zzso of zzso and 27 to zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso for zzso gamma zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain zzso zzso and zzso also reacted with a majority of zzso cells, and zzso zzso These findings indicate that a subset of T cells and zzso cells express zzso gamma zzso and are of interest in the light of previous studies which zzso that human zzso gamma zzso cells and zzso gamma zzso zzso T cells suppress the B cell immune zzso
