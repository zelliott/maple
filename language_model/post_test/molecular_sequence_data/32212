The zzso zzso gene family of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso signals is involved in the control of stem cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso data on zzso gene zzso indicating high expression levels in the human zzso led us to analyze these two proteins in adult human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso levels and protein distribution were analyzed in isolated human zzso zzso the zzso pancreatic cells and in zzso sections of adult human zzso Using real time zzso only lowest amounts of zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso did not reveal any zzso protein in adult human pancreatic zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and protein were clearly present in adult human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso levels for zzso were significantly higher in isolated zzso as compared to the zzso zzso zzso with an zzso against insulin identified the beta cells of the zzso as the zzso zzso zzso only a subset of beta cells contained zzso As shown by western zzso analysis zzso seems to be zzso processed in beta zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study describing a zzso with which the pool of pancreatic beta cells can be further zzso Future studies will show whether this zzso of beta cells translates into functional zzso
