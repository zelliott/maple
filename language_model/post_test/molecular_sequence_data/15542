The full-length zzso sequence of a putative zzso zzso zzso of the facilitated diffusion zzso type has been cloned from the African zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is 1990 zzso in length and its open reading frame encodes a 409 zzso acid long zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The sequence is closest to those of zzso ( approximately zzso zzso acid zzso followed by zzso and zzso ( approximately zzso and then zzso ( approximately zzso zzso was clearly expressed in zzso zzso liver, skeletal muscle and zzso Upon zzso in water after 33 days of air exposure zzso zzso exhibited a massive rise in zzso zzso which peaked at zzso h with rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal aquatic rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso and persisted until 70 zzso This appears to occur mainly through the zzso Total zzso zzso zzso amounted to approximately zzso zzso zzso over 3 zzso By real-time zzso there was no difference in zzso expression in the zzso abdominal skin between aquatic zzso controls and zzso zzso immediately after return to water zzso zzso and no zzso of zzso zzso at this zzso However, skin zzso revealed a significant zzso zzso of zzso expression at 14 zzso zzso with peak zzso zzso At 48 zzso there was no longer any significant difference in zzso zzso levels from those at 0 and 14 zzso or from aquatic fed zzso In accordance with earlier studies, which identified elevated zzso zzso via the skin of zzso zzso with pharmacology typical of zzso carriers, these results argue that zzso zzso of a facilitated diffusion type zzso zzso zzso occurs in the skin during zzso This serves to clear the body burden of zzso accumulated during zzso
