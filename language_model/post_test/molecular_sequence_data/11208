The zzso sequence of the human zzso gene was cloned using zzso zzso The gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso of which the first 21 zzso acids represent a putative signal zzso sequence and which possesses 11 zzso repeats flanked by zzso zzso The zzso possesses a zzso untranslated region of 149 zzso a coding region of zzso zzso including the stop zzso and a 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso terminating in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso with a single zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is present in zzso at all zzso Analysis of zzso DNA revealed that the zzso gene possesses two zzso both of which reside within the coding zzso The first zzso has a length of about zzso zzso and separates the zzso for zzso and zzso The second zzso has a length of about zzso zzso and splits the zzso for zzso This zzso organization results in zzso 1 zzso the signal zzso the zzso zzso region, and the first 9 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso the last 2 zzso repeats and part of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso the remainder of the zzso zzso zzso The gene does not possess a zzso box prior to its zzso start zzso Isolation of a zzso clone spanning the zzso gene enabled its zzso location to be zzso The gene was shown to reside at zzso zzso
