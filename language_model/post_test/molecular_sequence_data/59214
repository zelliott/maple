zzso is a 40 zzso zzso for protein zzso C found in zzso and zzso Based upon its zzso zzso contains two of the zzso zzso zzso that are thought to be binding motifs for zzso zzso zzso and/or G protein beta gamma zzso zzso beta zzso In the present studies we have examined the interaction between zzso and G beta gamma by zzso zzso fusion proteins with zzso from human zzso In this analysis, both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso bound G beta gamma in zzso as did peptides containing as little as the first 30 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of a point zzso into this region, analogous to the zzso in the zzso zzso domain that causes zzso zzso disease zzso in mice, dramatically disrupted this zzso We propose that zzso may interact with G beta zzso and that one potential site for this interaction involves the first 30 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
