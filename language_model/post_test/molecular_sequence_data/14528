The focal zzso protein zzso product of the zzso zzso zzso is involved in modulating cell zzso zzso The zzso expressed protein belongs to the highly zzso zzso family, the newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the mechanisms underlying zzso expression and regulation, we first mapped its major zzso start site at the zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region was zzso zzso and aligned with the corresponding zzso zzso region of its human zzso zzso Despite the differences in activity, cell in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso efficient promoter region lacking a functional zzso zzso shift zzso confirmed the specific interaction between zzso zzso zzso and the potential element in the zzso region of the zzso zzso Site zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses suggested that zzso is an important regulator of the zzso zzso
