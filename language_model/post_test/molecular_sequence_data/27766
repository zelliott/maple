The zzso clone for a major mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been isolated from a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of a major zzso indicates that the protein is a single zzso chain of zzso zzso acids zzso clearly organized in three zzso distinct in the zzso of other zzso A strong zzso of the mouse major zzso with human zzso A or B, but not with human zzso C is observed only in the zzso stretch of 23 zzso zzso indicating that the major mouse zzso species cloned is similar to human zzso zzso The zzso zzso is absent in all zzso zzso or cell lines zzso The zzso zzso is induced during the differentiation of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso
