zzso zzso play a pivotal role in signal zzso by carrying out the regulated synthesis of zzso zzso The nine cloned zzso zzso zzso all share two zzso regions of zzso C1 and zzso which are zzso to each other and are together responsible for zzso zzso zzso C1 and C2 zzso catalyze the synthesis of zzso zzso when they are mixed and activated by zzso and C2 zzso alone also manifest reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso Using limited zzso and mass zzso we have mapped the boundaries of a minimal stable and active C2 zzso domain to zzso zzso of type II zzso zzso We report the properties and zzso of this trimmed domain, termed zzso zzso zzso belong to space group zzso where zzso zzso 1 or 3; a zzso b zzso zzso and c zzso zzso zzso and there are two molecules per zzso unit related by an approximate body centering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso A along the zzso direction and to zzso A along the zzso and zzso directions using zzso zzso
