We have determined the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using two independent approaches, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis, we show that zzso maps to zzso mouse zzso zzso This map position is within the zzso linkage group corresponding to the short arm of human zzso 1, where the human zzso zzso has been shown to map zzso The position of zzso on mouse zzso 4 is in the vicinity of the mouse zzso zzso zzso lens zzso However, using a genetic approach, we show that zzso maps zzso to zzso on mouse zzso zzso
