Some zzso zzso use a modified zzso zzso that employs an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso or, in the case of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of three zzso have been zzso However, there is no structural information available for zzso or the zzso Here, we present the first crystal structure of an zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso forms determined to zzso and zzso resolution, respectively, along with zzso characterization of the zzso The overall structure of zzso maintains a similar large and small zzso domain structure seen in the zzso zzso A large zzso change accompanies binding of zzso zzso zzso or both, in all members of the zzso zzso characterized thus far, which is believed to be critical to zzso zzso Surprisingly, no such zzso change was observed in the zzso zzso structure compared with the zzso zzso Through comprehensive zzso zzso of the zzso binding pocket we identified zzso that were critical for both zzso recognition and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and many of the zzso binding zzso are zzso between zzso and zzso however, four key zzso differ in the zzso pocket, which we have shown determine the zzso zzso Using these results we were able to engineer a zzso zzso that mimics the zzso and is able to zzso both zzso zzso and zzso
