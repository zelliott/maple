The interaction between a virus and its specific zzso on the membrane of the host cell mimics the zzso combination of signal zzso and its zzso and zzso the specific signal zzso from this activated zzso to induce a relative gene zzso During the investigation of the interaction between zzso zzso virus I zzso and human zzso via the virus binding to its zzso complex on the cellular zzso a new gene of cellular response against the specific stimulation of zzso binding to zzso was cloned from a zzso library established from zzso of an early gene zzso This gene zzso a protein of zzso with the structural characteristics of zzso and zzso zzso The analysis of the role of this protein in the infection by zzso indicated that this zzso expressed only in zzso phase and zzso functioned as a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso The details of the mechanism of this zzso of zzso zzso zzso is still zzso
