zzso of chemically immortalized Syrian zzso zzso cells that had either retained zzso or lost zzso the ability to suppress zzso when zzso with a zzso cell line were zzso Both zzso cell types are zzso however, the zzso but not zzso cells exhibit conditional zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso organization were observed in zzso but not zzso cells that corresponded to a significant reduction of the zzso protein zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso To examine the possibility of a direct relationship between zzso expression and the zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with an expression zzso containing the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso The zzso reduction of zzso levels in zzso clones caused a zzso reorganization and zzso zzso growth potential that were indistinguishable from those characteristic of zzso zzso These data provide direct evidence that zzso regulates both zzso organization and zzso growth and suggest that zzso zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso
