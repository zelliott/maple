zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso gene has been implicated in the resistance of tumor cell lines to a wide array of zzso agents, but its normal zzso zzso remains zzso We have compared the sensitivity to zzso drugs and toxins of zzso zzso embryonic stem cells zzso and of single and double zzso gene knockout cells derived zzso zzso expression was totally zzso in the double knockout cell line and partially zzso in the single knockout cell zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso genes were not expressed in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso were significantly greater in double knockout cells than in parental zzso zzso zzso single knockout zzso cells displayed an intermediate level of zzso In contrast, no difference in sensitivity to zzso and zzso existed between the cell zzso zzso zzso in double knockout zzso cells was zzso higher than in zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that baseline zzso expression has the capacity to exert a protective role against the toxicity of multiple zzso agents and natural zzso
