To investigate the zzso agent associated with zzso disease zzso we initially established a zzso system using zzso A zzso zzso zzso cells obtained from each zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso with each of 1) 40 patients with zzso 2) 10 patients with other viral infection and skin zzso and 3) 10 zzso and zzso normal zzso Five major findings suggested that zzso particles with reverse zzso zzso activity are associated with zzso First, zzso activity appeared significantly higher on day 12 after the onset of fever in the zzso patients than in those with other viral infections and normal controls zzso zzso zzso zzso 248 zzso 434 zzso 50 zzso 412 zzso 46 zzso P zzso zzso Second, the zzso activity was not zzso because the Con zzso zzso cells were obtained from the individuals who were negative for zzso Third, zzso particles zzso zzso in zzso by electron zzso were found in the concentrated pool zzso of particulate fraction containing zzso activity subjected to zzso density zzso obtained from zzso zzso Fourth, the viral product, a zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso after internal zzso zzso and density zzso zzso zzso using a zzso universal pol gene zzso as a primer and the zzso method, a zzso band was detected in the zzso zzso obtained from four zzso and one AIDS patients but not in patients with zzso or in healthy zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
