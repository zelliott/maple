To identify the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and study the molecular mechanism of a novel zzso 

The clinical data and blood samples from 185 unrelated subjects with zzso zzso were collected and evaluated together with 200 healthy zzso The coding zzso and the zzso zzso regions of the zzso gene were amplified by zzso and zzso using the zzso chain termination zzso The zzso gene was cloned and the corresponding zzso was acquired by site directed zzso The zzso zzso expressing zzso and the reporter zzso expressing enhanced green zzso protein zzso driven by the promoter of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were zzso into zzso cells with zzso The effect of zzso zzso gene on the zzso activity of zzso zzso factor was analyzed by reverse zzso zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in 1 zzso zzso The zzso leads to zzso to zzso acid change at zzso acid zzso 64 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in 1 zzso zzso The zzso might cause zzso by zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso
