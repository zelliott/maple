Recently, it has been shown that really interesting new gene zzso between ring finger zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso and are involved in regulation of zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso domain and an zzso zzso highly zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso and this interaction is zzso through the zzso domain of zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso domain of zzso is required and sufficient for zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso does not require its zzso zzso zzso zzso Together with a recent report showing that zzso is involved in zzso and degradation of zzso a zzso downstream protein promoting growth arrest and zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso is involved in switching a cell from zzso growth arrest to zzso
