In the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate entry into the cell cycle zzso by zzso the zzso protein zzso We find that zzso is a much rarer protein than zzso or zzso and has a much weaker associated zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso is not significantly cell cycle zzso nor is it zzso by mating zzso zzso zzso An artificial burst of zzso expression early in zzso phase zzso Start and rapidly zzso at least five other zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the cell zzso zzso factor zzso In similar experiments, zzso is less efficient than zzso at zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso is dependent on zzso in a zzso zzso strain, possibly explaining why zzso is essential in the absence of zzso and zzso To explain the potent ability of zzso to activate zzso despite its apparently weak zzso activity, we propose that zzso may be an upstream zzso of the zzso zzso which directly catalyze zzso Given the large number of known zzso such zzso zzso may be a common theme in cell cycle zzso
