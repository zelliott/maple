We recently reported that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso in regulating leaf blade zzso By using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a genetic zzso we showed that the zzso which is zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso is partly responsible for the repressive activity of zzso All members of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso in zzso that contain intact zzso can substitute for zzso function while the intermediate and ancient zzso members including zzso and zzso zzso due to lack of the intact zzso Taken together, our results reveal a zzso repression mechanism playing a central role in cell proliferation zzso to the zzso dynamic zzso gene family with acquisition of a zzso zzso
