zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso coupled to a two-dimensional liquid zzso separation was applied to the identification of peptides in zzso zzso of the zzso extracts of nine Italian cheese zzso In particular, the zzso zzso collected during a preliminary fast protein liquid zzso zzso separation on the cheese extracts were zzso for zzso activity towards zzso zzso zzso Active zzso were subsequently analyzed by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso sequential mass zzso zzso with zzso up to zzso zzso identification was then performed starting from a conventional zzso approach based on tandem mass zzso zzso analysis followed by database zzso In many cases this strategy had to be integrated by a careful correlation between spectral information and predicted zzso zzso in order to reach zzso zzso When even this integrated approach failed, zzso zzso provided decisive information on the zzso acid sequence of some zzso through fragmentation of zzso groups along the zzso zzso As a result, 45 zzso all arising from zzso of milk zzso were identified in nine zzso zzso zzso of zzso extracts obtained from five of the nine cheese varieties zzso Many of them corresponded to peptides already known to exhibit biological zzso
