A significant bottleneck in large-scale DNA sequencing projects is the creation of high-quality random libraries suitable for zzso We have zzso an zzso strategy and developed a simple protocol to reliably generate zzso random zzso zzso libraries yielding uniform coverage and zzso zzso clones per zzso of zzso Of the resulting white zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso were due to zzso with no zzso and none of the clones were found to contain extraneous DNA zzso or multiple zzso zzso
