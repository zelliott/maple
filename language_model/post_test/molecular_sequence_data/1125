The structural basis of zzso selectivity of G zzso receptors for zzso hormones has been an area of intense investigation, and yet it remains zzso One approach to zzso the mechanism of zzso interactions is to compare the zzso zzso of receptors expressed in species that emerged at different times within zzso zzso In this paper we describe the isolation, functional, and zzso characterization of the zzso zzso from the goldfish zzso zzso zzso order zzso and compare its zzso specificity with that of the zzso rat zzso Goldfish zzso zzso zzso zzso production in a zzso manner from isolated goldfish zzso resulting in zzso increase at 1 zzso The goldfish zzso zzso zzso shares 56, 51, 50, and zzso zzso acid identities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso In competitive binding experiments, the zzso zzso displays high affinity toward zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, and 13 zzso zzso but not toward goldfish zzso zzso or human zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas both goldfish and human zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso through the zzso zzso the zzso rat zzso zzso only with human zzso analogous to the specificity of the previously characterized zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the binding pocket of zzso can accommodate a broad range of zzso structures and that in the frogs and zzso there is a structural switch to a more restrictive zzso of zzso zzso
