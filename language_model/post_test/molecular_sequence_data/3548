zzso growth factor zzso which binds to zzso receptors zzso stimulates zzso zzso cell zzso enabling rapid repair after zzso zzso In the normal human zzso zzso zzso expression is present and confined to the zzso zzso 

To examine zzso changes in and dynamics of zzso expression during healing after acid zzso zzso in a rat zzso 

zzso acid zzso zzso was induced in zzso rats by zzso of the zzso and the transitional region between the zzso and the zzso portion for 5 zzso followed by release of both zzso zzso were killed 7 and 14 days after production of zzso to examine zzso and zzso changes as well as dynamics of zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso and protein by zzso and Western zzso or zzso 

zzso acid zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the lower and middle part of the zzso These zzso were healed by 14 days and zzso showed zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in controls to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats, as well as zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso The number of zzso cells among zzso cells on day 14 was significantly increased from zzso zzso zzso in controls to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein was significantly increased on day 14 and most zzso cells were zzso positive in both zzso and zzso zzso 

Acid zzso zzso injury caused zzso cell zzso with an increase in cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene and protein in response to acid zzso injury may facilitate zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso growth factor receptors play a crucial role in healing after acid zzso zzso in zzso
