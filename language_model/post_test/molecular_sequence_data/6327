zzso forms of the zzso of zzso are abundant in human zzso fluid and possibly zzso although their function is zzso We now describe the development of a new zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso forms containing both the pro and alpha C regions of the zzso The zzso has a detection limit for zzso human zzso C of zzso zzso and less than zzso zzso with zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso of zzso fluid extracts demonstrated that the zzso is likely to detect zzso precursor forms of both the free zzso and intact zzso zzso The serum concentration was measured in normal men zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso women zzso zzso zzso zzso and women treated with zzso before in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso fluid contained zzso zzso The mean serum concentration in the female zzso cycle rose from zzso zzso zzso zzso in the early zzso phase to zzso zzso 113 zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso offers a useful tool for investigation of the role of zzso proteins in human zzso There may be particular clinical value under circumstances in which other zzso for zzso forms have insufficient zzso
