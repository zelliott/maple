zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of a triple bond at the zzso position of zzso acid, forming zzso acid in developing zzso zzso contain a high level of zzso acid but other zzso contain zzso Using reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso which were highest in flower zzso To understand why functional expression of the zzso is limited to seeds, genes that affect zzso activity by providing zzso zzso or electrons zzso zzso or that compete for zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis indicated that the availability of a preferred zzso zzso zzso is not a limiting zzso zzso seeds zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso at high zzso zzso heads zzso zzso and zzso at high levels, and zzso and zzso at moderate zzso zzso was not expressed in developing zzso zzso zzso absolute transcript zzso showed zzso higher zzso expression in developing seeds than in flower zzso zzso the results show that both the zzso expression level and the zzso of other zzso may contribute to the tissue specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso pathway, so does not accumulate zzso zzso zzso analysis showed relatively strong zzso expression in young zzso zzso zzso is observed in both species without zzso of the zzso product, zzso zzso expression of zzso appears to be affected by competition and collaboration with other zzso
