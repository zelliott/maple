zzso zzso zzso zzso is a human genetic disorder of impaired zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes zzso of a novel zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the longest zzso includes an interrupted zzso domain of 19 zzso repeats and a motif zzso in the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso In order to understand better the function of the zzso protein zzso and its zzso we have studied the processing and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso human fetal kidney zzso and monkey kidney zzso zzso Similar to other members of zzso membrane proteins and members of zzso zzso zzso is a type II membrane protein and it forms zzso The membrane zzso of zzso is zzso it is found on the zzso and lateral surfaces of the cells where it zzso with zzso zzso The zzso motif and zzso found near the zzso are necessary for correct transport to the cell zzso but the zzso and zzso zzso are not required for the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a new member in the zzso zzso family involved in the early zzso interaction that regulates zzso zzso zzso
