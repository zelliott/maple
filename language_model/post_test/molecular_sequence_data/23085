The three-dimensional structure of zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso to zzso A zzso zzso has a core domain similar to known zzso structures with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso density for two zzso at the zzso interface is weak despite the bright yellow color of the protein solution and zzso The shape and size of the putative binding pocket is markedly different from that of members of the zzso family, which may indicate some significant changes in the zzso binding mode of this protein relative to members of the zzso
