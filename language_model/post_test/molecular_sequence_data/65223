zzso zzso is a major target of the zzso cascade in the heart, functioning to zzso zzso force by altering the rate of calcium zzso by the zzso zzso zzso by zzso binding is zzso by shifts in the calcium dependence of zzso zzso toward higher calcium zzso zzso of zzso by zzso reverses the zzso action of zzso To investigate structural changes in the zzso portion of zzso that result from either the zzso of zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso or calcium binding to the zzso we have used zzso zzso zzso to measure the spatial separation and zzso zzso between zzso zzso bound to a single zzso zzso engineered near the membrane surface of the zzso domain of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of calcium zzso of the zzso or zzso of zzso in zzso by zzso we find that zzso remains tightly associated with the zzso in a zzso zzso However, calcium zzso of the zzso zzso an increase in the overall dimensions of the zzso portion of bound zzso whereas zzso zzso results in a more compact structure, consistent with increased zzso content induced by a salt link between zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso may occur through different zzso calcium binding to zzso sites within the zzso functions to overcome zzso constraints imposed by zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the backbone fold of zzso to release zzso interactions with the zzso
