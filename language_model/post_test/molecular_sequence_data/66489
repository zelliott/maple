zzso selectively package two copies of their zzso zzso in the context of a large excess of zzso zzso zzso packaging of zzso zzso is zzso in part, by recognizing zzso that form a poorly understood zzso structure at their zzso zzso We zzso zzso the stability of, and use extensive experimental constraints to calculate a zzso model for a zzso structure domain that mediates specific interactions between zzso zzso in a gamma zzso In an initial interaction, two zzso structures from one zzso form highly stringent zzso zzso base pairs with the same structures on a second zzso zzso Upon subsequent folding to the final zzso state, these zzso zzso interactions convert to a high affinity and compact zzso structure, stabilized by zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso switch model illustrates how zzso formation of an zzso zzso structure yields a stringent molecular recognition event at early assembly steps that can be converted to the stable zzso architecture likely packaged into nascent zzso
