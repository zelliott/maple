Little is known about the stability of zzso relationships in complex natural communities over evolutionary zzso Here, we use sequence data from 18 nuclear zzso to reconstruct and compare the zzso histories of major zzso zzso populations in the Middle East, the zzso and zzso in a guild of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all attacking zzso oak zzso We develop a likelihood method to zzso estimate models of divergence between three populations from zzso zzso We investigate the power of this framework on simulated data, zzso zzso alignments of zzso zzso the support for all possible divergence relationships between zzso populations in the four zzso Although an East to West order of population divergence has highest support in all but one species, we cannot rule out alternative population tree zzso Comparing the estimated times of population splits between species, we find that one species, zzso has a significantly older history than the rest of the guild and must have arrived in central Europe at least one glacial cycle prior to other guild zzso This suggests that although all four species may share a common origin in the East, they expanded zzso into Europe at different zzso
