zzso zzso T zzso zzso play a critical role in the immune control of zzso C zzso zzso zzso In the current study, a number of zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso were evaluated by examining the zzso affinity for major zzso complex zzso class I zzso the stability of zzso complexes, killing activities of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso Among 24 peptides tested, 15 peptides induced high or medium killing activities of zzso zzso Thirteen of the 15 peptides exhibited high or medium binding affinities for zzso zzso indicating that the high binding affinity for zzso class I molecules is an important factor for zzso In contrast, the stability of zzso class I complexes was not correlated with killing activities of zzso zzso Furthermore, only a limited number of peptides could induce high or medium zzso of zzso zzso T cells, which were generally considered to play a crucial role for the clearance of zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso such as in the current study should provide important information about the design of an efficient zzso vaccine that zzso vigorous, zzso and broad zzso zzso zzso
