zzso are zzso zzso responsible for a significant number of zzso human zzso Despite this, information about the composition and function of their zzso contents is zzso In this study, we have used a zzso to zzso zzso approach combining two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso sequencing and similarity searching to better understand the complexities of the zzso from two Brazilian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparisons between the zzso profiles and the mass compositions of the zzso of the two species are zzso The observed molecular masses ranged from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 62 molecular zzso and from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso 65 molecular zzso Also, the zzso of representatives of 10 zzso families were successfully zzso where nine of them showed no significant similarity to other protein sequences deposited in the zzso zzso A screening for zzso activities in zzso from zzso zzso zzso has also been zzso Six out of the 12 tested zzso were responsible for clear toxic effects in house zzso This work demonstrates that zzso zzso might be a neglected but important source of new zzso zzso
