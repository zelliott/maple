We analyzed the distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in whole normal human zzso and in the brains of normal and fragile X zzso The zzso of zzso for the 3 genes in normal whole zzso and in the brains of normal male and female carrier fetuses were similar, with large amounts of zzso in the nervous system and in several zzso system zzso No zzso zzso and zzso was detected and no evident zzso abnormalities found in the brains of male carrier zzso suggesting that the zzso product zzso may have no crucial function in early stages of nervous system zzso zzso and zzso zzso had the same distribution and similar intensity in the brains of normal and zzso fetuses zzso and male zzso The zzso in the same zzso of zzso zzso and zzso associated with the normal expression of zzso and zzso and the absence of obvious zzso abnormalities in pathological zzso supports the notion that the zzso and zzso proteins partially compensate for zzso zzso However, the absence of significant zzso of zzso and zzso in pathological brains suggests that these genes do not compensate for the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins may not have zzso functions, but instead may regulate functions by zzso or zzso zzso as suggested by other zzso Thus, a dominant negative effect of abnormal zzso protein complexes lacking zzso zzso by modification of zzso and zzso protein zzso may result in the fragile X syndrome zzso
