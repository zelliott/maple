We have zzso the expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso of patients with low levels of circulating zzso (four patients with isolated zzso zzso zzso and one zzso dwarf zzso in comparison with a control group exhibiting normal serum zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso were performed on zzso to determine the number of zzso binding sites per cell and their zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso or zzso contained significantly zzso zzso zzso more receptors per cell zzso zzso zzso binding zzso with a reduced affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso from controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso in circulating zzso were determined by an zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso There was a statistically significant increase in zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso from patients with zzso or zzso when compared with controls zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units, P zzso zzso The increased level of zzso binding due to increased zzso zzso gene expression may represent a zzso zzso process activated in response to the low levels of zzso in the circulation of patients with zzso or zzso
