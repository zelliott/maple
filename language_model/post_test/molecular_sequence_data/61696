To study the effects of adaptation and stress on the resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to antibiotics in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of BC or stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in higher minimum zzso concentration zzso of BC and zzso zzso zzso to growth in zzso of the initial zzso of BC resulted in stable BC resistance and enhanced tolerance to several antibiotics and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso increased more than zzso for both zzso zzso zzso of zzso in adapted zzso coli zzso zzso indicated that the observed resistance was due to zzso Changes in outer membrane protein profiles were detected in the zzso zzso There were no indications of lower membrane zzso to zzso 

zzso of stress response or gradual adaptation to BC or zzso results in acquired zzso between BC and antibiotics in zzso zzso zzso zzso was one of the observed differences in adapted zzso 

zzso not taking due zzso extensive use of zzso could lead to emergence of zzso zzso
