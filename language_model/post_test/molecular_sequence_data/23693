One of the most common pathways for the export of zzso zzso zzso across the plasma membrane requires the participation of the zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of integral membrane proteins that share little conservation in their primary zzso acid zzso making it difficult to delineate functional zzso This paper reports the cloning and expression in zzso coli K-12 of various zzso zzso from different bacteria as zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso system for zzso zzso synthesis was used to assess the ability of each zzso protein to complement an zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso proteins from zzso systems that use zzso or zzso for the initiation of the zzso of the O repeat can fully complement the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen with zzso from zzso zzso a system that uses zzso in the initiation zzso In contrast, there was negligible zzso with the zzso protein from zzso zzso a system in which zzso is the initiating zzso These results support a model zzso the first sugar of the O repeat can be recognized by the zzso zzso zzso
