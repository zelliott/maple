High zzso zzso is essential for studying the spread of multiple zzso zzso A test zzso zzso designed to detect 94 zzso resistance genes was constructed and successfully used to identify zzso resistance genes in control zzso The zzso was then used to zzso 51 zzso related bacteria, including zzso and zzso zzso resulting in the identification of 61 different zzso resistance genes in these zzso These results were consistent with their known gene content and resistance zzso zzso results were confirmed by zzso chain reaction and Southern zzso zzso These results demonstrate that this approach could be used to construct a zzso to detect all zzso zzso resistance genes in nearly all zzso
