The zzso zzso zzso involved in the crucial process of zzso invasion are promising targets for novel malaria control zzso We report here the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading the way to in zzso functional studies of this zzso The zzso of expression and zzso zzso imply a central role for zzso in zzso zzso Through the use of gene targeting strategies, we assessed the relevance of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The selection of zzso zzso zzso and the proper expression of the modified coding region demonstrate that the zzso locus is accessible to genetic zzso However, zzso zzso zzso were not recovered, confirming the importance of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and supporting the fact that its zzso zzso zzso zzso is an attractive drug target zzso Finally, we identify zzso zzso that have lost the integrated selection cassette while zzso a zzso zzso These spontaneous zzso events should overcome the zzso of zzso markers available for this zzso giving access to multiple gene tagging strategies, which, together with the validation of a zzso tag, would represent valuable new tools for studying the biology of zzso zzso
