We have expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells a zzso inactive form of human factor zzso zzso zzso A zzso precursor of human factor zzso was zzso by two point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso material involved zzso followed by zzso zzso Two forms were zzso a fully processed zzso zzso and a partially processed zzso zzso Limited zzso zzso acid sequencing of factor zzso detected the predicted zzso and zzso acid content was zzso of human plasma zzso Although devoid of measurable zzso activity, factor zzso competitively inhibited plasma factor zzso assembly into functional zzso complexes zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso also inhibited plasma zzso in a zzso zzso The possible use of zzso zzso inactive proteins as a general approach for pharmacological regulation of human diseases is zzso
