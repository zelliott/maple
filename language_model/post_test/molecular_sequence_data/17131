Evolution of resistance by zzso is the main threat to long-term insect control by transgenic crops that produce zzso zzso zzso zzso We previously identified three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso gene in pink zzso zzso zzso linked with zzso resistance to zzso toxin zzso and survival on transgenic zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso chain reaction zzso method that detects the zzso in zzso DNA of each of the three resistant zzso Using zzso that distinguish between resistant and susceptible zzso zzso this method enables identification of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso For each of the three resistant zzso the method detected the resistance zzso in a single zzso zzso zzso or zzso pooled with DNA from the equivalent of 19 susceptible zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso detection method described here could greatly increase the efficiency of monitoring for resistance to zzso compared to zzso that detect rare individuals with zzso zzso
