zzso development in zzso zzso proceeds through a series of discrete zzso stages that culminate in the production of dormant spores called zzso Changes in the pattern of gene expression parallel the zzso transformations associated with zzso As a prerequisite to the analysis of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso several genes of unknown function that are zzso expressed during zzso were isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso The molecular structure and zzso sequence of one of these zzso designated zzso is zzso The zzso gene specifies a relatively rare zzso message which is first detected about 8 h following the induction of zzso zzso analysis of both zzso and zzso clones indicates that the zzso gene consists of three zzso divided by two small zzso It encodes a zzso of 340 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso zzso and zzso A comparison of the regions upstream from the zzso zzso and zzso genes revealed several short sequence motifs which may be important in zzso gene zzso
