We have isolated zzso a zzso clone from the developing seeds of zzso and have demonstrated significant zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso 3 zzso This zzso clone was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein that oxidized zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein had the highest similarity with pumpkin zzso 2 zzso zzso but did not possess 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the gene was expressed primarily in the inner parts of developing seeds, up to 10 d after zzso zzso In the zzso fruits induced by treatment with zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of the seeds were zzso whereas the zzso zzso of maternal origin, showed nearly normal zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the seeds of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso 3 zzso gene was expressed in zzso zzso In our analysis of zzso zzso from developing seeds, zzso and zzso were detected at high levels but those of zzso and zzso were very zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso in seeds prefers a zzso zzso over an early zzso zzso We also analyzed zzso zzso from seeds of the zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso much lower there than in normal seeds, indicating that zzso zzso unconnected with zzso exist in zzso zzso during early seed zzso
