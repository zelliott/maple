The African zzso fever virus zzso gene zzso which is zzso to zzso has been zzso A multiple alignment of zzso showed the conservation in zzso zzso of the motifs that define this protein zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso showed that the virus zzso is a zzso highly specific zzso that requires a zzso zzso for zzso The zzso is most probably zzso with zzso the preferred zzso and has an apparent zzso for zzso of 1 zzso Northern and Western zzso as well as zzso zzso indicated that the zzso is expressed at early and late times of infection and is localized in the zzso of the infected zzso On the other hand, an zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Growth zzso showed that zzso replicates as efficiently as parental virus in zzso cells but only to zzso or less of parental virus in zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso activity is zzso for virus replication in dividing cells but is required for productive infection in zzso zzso zzso the natural host cell for the zzso The viral zzso may play a role in lowering the zzso concentration in natural infections to minimize zzso of zzso into the viral DNA and ensure the zzso of zzso zzso
