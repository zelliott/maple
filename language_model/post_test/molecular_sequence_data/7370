On the basis of the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso protein was proposed to repress expression of two different zzso involved in zzso degradation, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Hartnett, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In spite of its proposed negative role as a zzso zzso is similar in zzso acid sequence to positive zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso this anomaly, we found that zzso zzso of zzso did not cause the zzso expected for the disruption of a zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso no cat genes were expressed zzso but rather zzso and zzso were still zzso by zzso Moreover, this zzso zzso grew poorly on zzso a process requiring the expression of all cat zzso The zzso of the cat genes in this zzso zzso was completely eliminated by a zzso deletion 10 zzso upstream of zzso In this double zzso zzso in trans restored zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso These results suggested the presence of an additional regulatory locus controlling cat gene zzso The ability of zzso to function as an zzso was also suggested by these zzso In support of this hypothesis, in zzso zzso protection zzso showed that zzso protects two zzso in a zzso 65 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start site, in a location and pattern typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso also binds to a region upstream of zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed a zzso near the 3' end of zzso not present in the published zzso zzso of the corrected sequence resulted in the deduced zzso protein being 52 zzso longer than previously zzso The size, zzso acid zzso and mode of action of zzso now appear similar to, and typical of, what has been found for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Analysis of one of the zzso zzso of zzso previously thought to zzso a dysfunctional zzso indicated instead that it encodes an zzso zzso zzso
