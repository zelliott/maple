zzso zzso has particular promise in zzso biology for identifying genes involved in a variety of biological functions that include: synthesis and zzso of silk, sex determination zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso Wild zzso have hardly been the subject of detailed scientific zzso zzso largely to zzso of molecular and genetic data on these zzso As a first step, in the present study we generated large scale expressed sequence tags zzso in three economically important species of wild zzso In order to make these resources available for the use of global scientific community, an zzso database called zzso was zzso 

zzso is a zzso of zzso generated from several zzso at different zzso stages of 3 economically important zzso zzso an Indian golden zzso zzso zzso an Indian tropical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Currently the database is provided with zzso zzso which are clustered and assembled into zzso zzso and zzso zzso Data can be zzso and downloaded using a standard web zzso Users can search the database either by zzso zzso zzso or Gene zzso zzso There are options to carry out searches for species, tissue and zzso stage specific zzso in zzso zzso Other features of the zzso include zzso discovery, GO viewer, zzso zzso zzso zzso and links to all other related zzso The zzso is freely available from zzso 

A total of zzso putative zzso was identified in 3 species of wild zzso These genes provide important resources to gain insight into the functional and evolutionary study of wild zzso We believe that zzso will be extremely useful for all those researchers working in the areas of comparative zzso functional zzso and molecular evolution in general, and gene discovery, gene organization, zzso elements and zzso zzso of insect species in zzso
