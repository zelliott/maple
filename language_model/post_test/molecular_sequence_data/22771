zzso are the major zzso zzso center in the zzso they also contribute to zzso pole organization and play a role in cell cycle progression as well as completing zzso Here we describe the molecular characterization of a novel human zzso zzso located in zzso that is expressed in multiple zzso and various cancer cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso predicted a protein of zzso zzso acids with several putative zzso zzso that are responsible for zzso zzso Indeed, we found zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso as well as an zzso fusion protein is present at the zzso throughout zzso whereas it also appears at the zzso zzso in late zzso and in the zzso in zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso with zzso association of zzso zzso suggesting that it directly interacts with zzso components rather than with zzso In zzso regrowth zzso zzso of zzso did not enhance or inhibit zzso zzso Together, these data suggest a possible involvement of zzso in zzso cellular functions, such as zzso zzso and/or cell cycle zzso or in the regulation of zzso
