zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the brain and zzso of the brown zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso specially regarding a possible relationship with zzso Y zzso zzso fibers were demonstrated in many regions of the brain, with the highest density in the zzso However, no zzso was found in the zzso zzso cells were chiefly located in the nucleus zzso of the zzso although a few cells were recognized in the zzso area of the zzso zzso zzso of adjacent sections zzso alternatively with zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed overlapping of the zzso patterns of the zzso structures in the zzso Moreover, the same cells in the nucleus zzso were zzso with both zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso is abolished by zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso but not eliminated completely by zzso with appropriate zzso zzso avian pancreatic zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso was blocked by zzso of the zzso with zzso pancreatic zzso or zzso although no blocking by zzso was zzso zzso the present study shows that, in the brown zzso zzso structures in the brain can be recognized by zzso zzso
