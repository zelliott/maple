During zzso the stable pairing of the zzso zzso is zzso by the assembly of the zzso complex zzso Its zzso structure is well zzso in zzso and consists of two lateral elements zzso and a central region zzso that in turn is formed by several zzso filaments zzso and a central element zzso In a previous article, we have shown that not only the structure, but also the major structural proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso SC are zzso in zzso zzso In continuation of this work, we now investigated the evolution of the zzso zzso proteins using zzso and zzso zzso In zzso to the observations made for zzso and zzso we did not detect zzso of the zzso zzso proteins in insects or zzso but in several other zzso zzso We were able to identify zzso of three zzso zzso proteins in several zzso and zzso species, for two of these proteins down to the zzso zzso of zzso Our approaches indicate that the SC arose only once, but evolved zzso during diversification of zzso Certain proteins appear to be ancient in animals, but successive addition of further components as well as protein loss and/or replacements have also taken place in some zzso
