The known zzso zzso zzso was converted to the corresponding zzso zzso 4 which was zzso The product 5 was used as the initial zzso zzso to construct two zzso zzso zzso having zzso flanked by either zzso or zzso groups, compounds 10 and 29, respectively zzso protected, except zzso zzso When these were zzso with zzso zzso zzso only the zzso zzso zzso 29 gave good yield of the desired zzso zzso The zzso and zzso products, together with the corresponding zzso 23, were formed in almost equal amount when zzso of 10 was performed with the zzso donor carrying the zzso protecting zzso zzso at zzso of 30, followed by further zzso of the zzso and global zzso gave the zzso zzso of the title zzso zzso zzso Except for differences due to presence of the zzso zzso group, the fully assigned zzso zzso of zzso 35 were found to be virtually identical to those reported for the parent zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso thus proving the correct structure assigned to the naturally occurring zzso All theoretically possible structural fragments of 35, as well as analog of 35 lacking the zzso group at the terminal zzso zzso compound 40, were also zzso zzso 35, its zzso and zzso zzso 2 and 40, respectively, as well as the zzso zzso of 35, zzso 12, were further zzso and zzso to zzso using zzso acid chemistry, to give zzso with a predetermined zzso ratio of approximately 3 and approximately zzso
