zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso its zzso sequence was determined, and the coding zzso termed zzso was cloned and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso exhibited similarity to those of other zzso zzso zzso of zzso there was a second zzso termed zzso which exhibited sequence similarity with zzso zzso The two genes were found to constitute an zzso adjacent to and zzso transcribed from the zzso gene at 296 degrees on the zzso zzso A weak zzso activity was associated with zzso zzso but no zzso activity was found for the product of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or both genes resulted in no zzso effect on growth, zzso spore heat resistance, or spore zzso A zzso zzso fusion was zzso expressed during zzso growth and was significantly induced at the onset of zzso This induction depended on the activity of the zzso product in zzso repression by the zzso zzso A single zzso start site which was apparently dependent on E zzso A was detected upstream of zzso
