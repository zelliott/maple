The zzso of several zzso contain open reading frames with zzso to the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene of zzso zzso 68, which target major zzso complex class I zzso as well as zzso molecules for zzso or zzso zzso The zzso gene product of zzso zzso zzso was recently shown to reduce the cell surface expression of zzso In addition, normal zzso surface expression was observed in cells infected with zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sutter, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso also zzso the zzso zzso zzso and we study the molecular mechanism by which zzso achieves the zzso of zzso and zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso was rapidly zzso and zzso in zzso whereas deletion of zzso from the zzso of zzso restored zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso was dependent on the presence of zzso zzso in their zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso was observed upon zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso of zzso zzso Surface expression of zzso was restored upon zzso of zzso a zzso interaction zzso protein that sorts zzso proteins into zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zinc finger of zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso in zzso Our data suggest that zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso with zzso serving as a zzso targeting zzso Since a similar mechanism was recently proposed for zzso zzso it seems that members of the unrelated families of zzso zzso and zzso share a common immune evasion mechanism that targets host cell immune zzso
