zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso is a rare zzso disorder caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Type 2 zzso zzso 

zzso patients from six unrelated families were subjected to zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso characterization of novel zzso zzso by a combination of functional and zzso techniques provided further insight into molecular mechanisms causing zzso zzso 

zzso analysis revealed four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso One family carried the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso deletion zzso corresponding to a zzso in the third zzso loop zzso which was not genetically linked to zzso The functionally tested zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to reduced zzso cell surface expression in zzso zzso cells, most probably due to zzso and zzso zzso and consequently to reduction or loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso function in zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso showed that this part of the zzso is structurally not zzso and, therefore, less relevant for zzso zzso In contrast, all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affect zzso positions that were fully preserved during zzso zzso 

Our results provide valuable information about zzso critical for zzso zzso trafficking and function and proof that these zzso are responsible for causing zzso in the affected zzso
