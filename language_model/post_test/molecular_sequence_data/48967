The three-dimensional structure of mouse zzso M, zzso zzso with 130 zzso acids has been determined by zzso zzso zzso We found that mouse zzso M had four zzso two zzso and a double- and a zzso zzso zzso and its structure was very similar to that of zzso zzso in solution and in the zzso zzso The pH activity profile of zzso zzso zzso zzso by mouse zzso M was similar to that of zzso zzso but the zzso activity of mouse zzso M was zzso From analyses of binding affinities of zzso to a zzso analogue and internal motions of zzso we suggest that the lower activity of mouse zzso M was due to the larger zzso constant of its zzso complex and the restricted internal backbone motions in the zzso
