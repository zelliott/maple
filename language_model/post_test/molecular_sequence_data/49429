zzso in crustaceans is controlled by zzso hormone zzso and zzso It is presumed that zzso zzso the synthesis and the zzso of zzso by the zzso resulting in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is similar to that of zzso zzso hormone zzso and therefore, they form a zzso family referred to as the zzso zzso Most of the zzso family peptides show no zzso whereas a few peptides show multiple hormonal zzso To reveal the structural basis of this functional zzso we determined the solution structure of zzso from the zzso prawn zzso zzso and compared the solution structure of zzso with a zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso The solution structure of zzso consisted of five zzso and no zzso zzso a novel structural zzso The zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso was very similar to the solution structure of zzso with the exception of the absence of the zzso zzso and the zzso tail, which were zzso close to each zzso The surface properties of zzso around this region were quite different from those of zzso These results strongly suggest that this region is a functionally important site for zzso zzso zzso
