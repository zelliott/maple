zzso zzso readily binds to stainless steel and other zzso surfaces, causing major problems in both the medical and food zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso binds to zzso surfaces in a zzso zzso manner during the initial stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso type IV zzso mediate binding to stainless steel as a zzso strain does not bind to steel, zzso type IV zzso bound in a zzso zzso manner, and zzso zzso competitively inhibited whole cell zzso zzso zzso can also bind polystyrene and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso As an zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso binding domain inhibited adherence to zzso surfaces, the role of the zzso zzso binding domain in zzso binding to steel surfaces was zzso A synthetic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso binding domain zzso bound directly to steel with high zzso The interaction of zzso with steel was specifically inhibited by this zzso with an apparent Ki of approximately zzso zzso and effectively inhibited the binding of viable zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains to steel with an apparent Ki of approximately 4 zzso A single point zzso zzso in the zzso zzso binding domain was observed to abolish binding to stainless steel while binding to human zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso the zzso zzso binding domain appears to have evolved for binding a variety of zzso
