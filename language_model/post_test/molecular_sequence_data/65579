The zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso mediates zzso of hormone zzso and cell zzso and zzso zzso Its expression is widespread in various normal zzso and many zzso cells, and is zzso by zzso in breast cancer zzso This study was undertaken to investigate molecular mechanism of zzso regulation of the human zzso zzso for which an additional zzso zzso 1) in the zzso region was recently zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that the immediate zzso region containing two zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso zzso sites provided full promoter zzso An zzso together with zzso analysis in zzso zzso Schneider line zzso cells showed that zzso acted on the zzso zzso site, whereas zzso zzso and zzso did on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso occurred through two different zzso one included these zzso elements and the other existed in the upstream region containing zzso response element zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence zzso This upstream zzso responsiveness was observed in a human breast cancer zzso cell, but not in zzso or zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso cells, and was zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso whose binding to the zzso zzso was verified by zzso A zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso was recruited to the zzso zzso after zzso treatment in zzso zzso The present results should provide a molecular basis for zzso regulation in a variety of zzso and pathological contexts of zzso zzso
