zzso zzso zzso directs the zzso degradation of zzso through a process known as zzso interference zzso Using a recently developed zzso in zzso system, we examined the molecular mechanism underlying zzso We find that zzso is zzso dependent yet zzso from zzso zzso During the zzso reaction, both strands of the zzso are processed to zzso segments zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso to the small zzso fragments does not require the targeted zzso The zzso is zzso only within the region of identity with the zzso zzso occurs at sites zzso zzso apart, the same zzso observed for the zzso itself, suggesting that the zzso zzso fragments from the zzso are guiding zzso zzso
