During zzso two zzso cells fuse to form a single zzso Cell fusion requires extensive zzso of the cell wall, both to form a seal between the two cells and to remove the intervening zzso The two plasma zzso then fuse to produce a continuous zzso We report the characterization of two cell fusion defective zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated previously in our zzso Fluorescence and electron zzso demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were defective for cell wall zzso but not plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso were a zzso both zzso caused the zzso zzso when present in the zzso parent but not in the zzso alpha zzso zzso with an zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso produced less zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso to zzso and zzso respectively, two genes known to be required for zzso of zzso Several experiments demonstrated that the partial zzso in zzso production resulted in the zzso zzso First, zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso Second, zzso to an zzso alpha partner zzso to mating zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso in zzso Finally, the gene zzso zzso zzso was placed under the control of a zzso zzso reduced levels of zzso zzso caused an identical cell fusion zzso during zzso We conclude that high levels of zzso are required as one component of the signal for zzso to initiate cell zzso
