Previous cloning and sequencing of clones from a zzso library constructed from zzso zzso zzso had identified a tandem pair of open reading zzso identified as zzso and zzso zzso surface zzso expected to zzso proteins with zzso to ( but not identical zzso a 39 zzso surface exposed membrane protein from this animal zzso Additional screening of the zzso library was performed to retrieve the remainder of the zzso gene using new zzso zzso based upon the cloned gene zzso Not only was this goal met but we also discovered two more adjacent and related zzso genes zzso and zzso and have completely zzso zzso They are all in a parallel orientation and appear to have a set of similar but distinct regulatory elements that may control separate expression of their open reading frames zzso Thus, there are four zzso zzso genes which are predicted to zzso a family of structurally zzso zzso The four adjacent open reading frames zzso are of similar size zzso zzso and share from zzso to zzso identity in their zzso acid zzso zzso data suggests there may be yet another zzso gene copy in a zzso location of zzso zzso that faithfully encodes the 39 zzso surface zzso The organization and zzso of these highly zzso multiple gene copies are zzso
