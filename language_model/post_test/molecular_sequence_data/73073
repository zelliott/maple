During the cell cycle, cells progress through four distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso controls play an important role at the transition between these zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso factor from budding zzso binds to the so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso elements found in the promoters of many DNA synthesis zzso and activates the zzso of those at the zzso phase zzso zzso is comprised of two zzso zzso and zzso 

The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso has been determined by zzso anomalous zzso from zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso The structure is composed of a zzso beta sheet zzso with two pairs of alpha zzso The most zzso core region among zzso zzso factors folds into a central zzso motif with a short zzso beta strand and a zzso beta zzso 

Despite little sequence zzso the structure within the core region of the zzso zzso domain exhibits a similar fold to that of the zzso zzso of other zzso such as zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso from zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso However, the structure outside the core region defines zzso as a larger entity with zzso that stabilize and display the zzso zzso
