The mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso and the zzso boundaries were determined by zzso zzso The zzso approximately 10 zzso in zzso contains the entire coding region, and consists of five zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was zzso with that of other species, with the exception of an additional DNA sequence zzso 7 zzso acids in zzso zzso A region of the zzso end of zzso 2 appeared to be alternatively zzso and generated an zzso shorter by 52 zzso The shorter zzso may zzso an 48 zzso acid open reading frame due to zzso of zzso These two zzso zzso were expressed equally in the mouse zzso
