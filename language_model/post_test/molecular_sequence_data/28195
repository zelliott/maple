zzso of the zzso gene is a marker for the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso being gradually increased during zzso We have analyzed the fine structure and function of two zzso zzso elements of the chicken zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both increase their activities upon zzso zzso both contain multiple binding sites for similar or identical nuclear factors and both can be divided into two functional zzso For the zzso zzso zzso we found a synergistic activity of the zzso to be dependent on their zzso zzso sites for nuclear proteins within zzso zzso zzso overlap substantially with the previously identified zzso zzso binding site, which is required for steroid induction of zzso zzso in the zzso
