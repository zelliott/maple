The zzso control region of the zzso zzso contains multiple zzso elements to which specific zzso factors zzso One such well-studied binding motif in the zzso promoter is the major zzso zzso response element zzso zzso located at zzso In this study we investigated the role of this element in gene regulation by beta zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso By transient gene expression zzso we were able to show that the zzso regulatory sequences spanning zzso zzso to zzso could mediate gene expression by the beta zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso For zzso however, a stimulating effect was observed in zzso cells, while an zzso effect was measured in cells supplemented with zzso The gene regulation by the zzso zzso agents could be due, at least zzso to the major zzso since this isolated motif zzso gene expression by these zzso zzso zzso complexes were obtained with nuclear extracts prepared from cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso under different serum zzso We further show that DNA zzso of this zzso may also be involved in gene regulation as zzso of the zzso motif strongly reduced the binding of nuclear zzso
