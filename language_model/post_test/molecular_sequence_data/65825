zzso P zzso P) is a zzso zzso responsible for the zzso of transfer zzso It is a zzso complex containing an essential zzso and a varying number of protein zzso depending on the source: at least one, four and nine in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since bacterial zzso P is required for viability and differs in zzso composition from its zzso counterpart, it is a potential zzso zzso To zzso the basis for our previous finding that the zzso zzso of zzso B is zzso more potent than zzso B in zzso bacterial zzso zzso we zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso B and compared their zzso zzso Our studies indicate that zzso zzso flexibility and composition zzso account for the zzso potency of the zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso interfere with zzso P function by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our finding that an zzso can discriminate between a bacterial and zzso (an experimental surrogate for zzso zzso P zzso lends promise to the design of zzso zzso as selective zzso of bacterial zzso zzso especially once the structural differences in zzso P from the three zzso of life have been zzso
