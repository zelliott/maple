Type II zzso zzso zzso zzso in animals and zzso have been known to be important for regulating zzso and zzso signaling by zzso zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso However, the molecular and zzso properties of type II zzso in plants have not yet been zzso In this report, we show that three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins with a zzso domain and a zzso domain, a novel combination present only in plant zzso We demonstrate that these genes are zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso is induced in response to zzso and wounding zzso Our zzso studies reveal that although both zzso and zzso exhibit zzso activity toward only zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso with the highest zzso affinity toward zzso All three zzso require zzso for their zzso zzso Our molecular and zzso characterization of three zzso zzso provides a foundation for further zzso of their cellular functions in zzso
