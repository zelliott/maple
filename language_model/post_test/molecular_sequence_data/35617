In this study, zzso zzso quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso were developed based on the zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso was assessed by conventional zzso on 99 strains zzso 63 oral bacterial species, including the type strain and eight clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso products were amplified from the zzso zzso of only zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were able to detect as little as 40 zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA at a cycle threshold value of zzso These findings suggest that these zzso zzso detect zzso zzso with high specificity and zzso
