Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of zzso repeat regions within envelope proteins of viruses in zzso zzso changes at various stages of viral zzso However, it is not clear if zzso repeats have a direct role in the actual fusion zzso Here we have zzso zzso labeled and functionally and structurally characterized a zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso composed of both the fusion zzso and the zzso zzso repeat of zzso virus fusion zzso two of its zzso as well as the fusion zzso and zzso repeat zzso One zzso was introduced in the fusion zzso zzso and another in the zzso repeat region zzso Similar zzso have been shown to drastically reduce the zzso ability of the zzso fusion protein of zzso disease zzso We found that only zzso was active in inducing zzso mixing of egg zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso and not the zzso nor the mixture of the fusion zzso and the zzso zzso zzso characterization revealed that zzso and to a lesser extent its two zzso were potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso of red blood cells, while the fusion zzso and zzso were zzso active alone or in a zzso zzso zzso revealed that none of the peptides disturb the binding of zzso to red blood zzso Further studies revealed that zzso and its zzso zzso similarly in solution and in zzso and have similar potency in inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed a higher zzso content for zzso compared to its zzso in 40 % zzso and in zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso studies indicated that zzso lies more parallel with the surface of the membrane than its zzso These observations suggest a direct role for the zzso zzso repeat in assisting the fusion zzso in zzso membrane zzso
