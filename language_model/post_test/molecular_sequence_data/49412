The production of high levels of zzso allows the human gastric pathogen zzso zzso to survive the zzso conditions in the human zzso zzso zzso produces zzso through zzso degradation of zzso but it is also able to convert a range of zzso zzso into zzso via its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here data are provided that demonstrate that the zzso regulatory protein zzso directly and indirectly regulates the activity of the two zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso activities were not induced by medium supplementation with their respective zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein expression and zzso zzso activity were zzso in zzso zzso zzso but zzso in the zzso fur zzso This regulation was zzso at the zzso level via the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter zzso In contrast, zzso zzso activity was not zzso but was significantly higher in the fur zzso This effect was not zzso at the zzso level, and zzso did not bind to the zzso promoter zzso These roles of zzso in regulation of the zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso zzso regulator may have acquired extra functions to compensate for the absence of other regulatory zzso
