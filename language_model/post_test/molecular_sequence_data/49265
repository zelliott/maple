The zzso coli replication machinery employs a beta clamp that zzso the zzso to DNA, thus ensuring high zzso The zzso also contains a zzso switch that zzso the zzso from its beta zzso The switch requires the zzso zzso of the clamp zzso and is regulated by different DNA zzso At a primed site, the switch is zzso When the zzso reaches the downstream primer to form a zzso the switch is flipped, and zzso zzso the zzso from zzso This switch has high zzso for completed zzso remaining zzso until just prior to incorporation of the last zzso and turning zzso only after addition of the last zzso These actions of zzso are confined to its zzso region, which is located outside the clamp loading zzso Thus, this highly zzso replication machine has evolved a mechanism to specifically counteract zzso at a defined time in the zzso zzso
