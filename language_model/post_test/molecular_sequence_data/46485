The zzso surface proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were candidates for the transmission blocking vaccine zzso which exhibited great zzso zzso among various zzso zzso of these genes in the zzso from Republic of Korea zzso were zzso which provided valuable baseline data for the field trials of zzso zzso A total of 98 zzso were collected over 11 years from 1996 to zzso zzso and zzso genes from the above zzso were zzso zzso and compared against zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso products from zzso zzso zzso revealed two zzso types, zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, in comparison with Sal I type sequence zzso From zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso in the first and third zzso zzso in comparison to zzso strain were zzso zzso Six zzso tandem repeats followed by zzso or zzso were identified at the end of the fourth zzso domain in all Korean zzso Interestingly, different tandem repeats of zzso acid zzso were observed from zzso collected after 2006 in comparison with preceding zzso The zzso zzso revealed limited sequence zzso in zzso and tandem repeats in zzso in comparison with reported zzso from other zzso Current observations suggested the rapid zzso of genetic changes among Korean zzso
