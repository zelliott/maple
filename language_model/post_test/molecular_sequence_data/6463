To analyze the mechanism of zzso zzso in patients with zzso syndrome zzso we examined the zzso repertoire of zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso The repertoire of the zzso V beta gene on zzso T cells from the zzso of SS patients was more restricted than those on zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso V beta 2 gene was expressed predominantly in six of seven zzso SS zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso the V beta 2 gene on zzso T cells in the zzso of five SS patients showed that some of the cells expanded zzso indicating zzso stimulation rather than zzso zzso The same V beta 2 clones in the kidney were not detected in zzso zzso zzso of the same SS zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso at position zzso in the zzso region of the V beta 2 gene was found at a frequency of zzso in the zzso whereas it was detected in only zzso of the clones in zzso In conclusion, these findings suggest the possibility that T cells that zzso the zzso of SS patients with zzso zzso might recognize different zzso than those that zzso zzso zzso zzso
