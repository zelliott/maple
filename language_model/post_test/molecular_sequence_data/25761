zzso is the class of zzso protein complex found in coated zzso derived from the plasma membrane of zzso zzso We demonstrate here, using a chemical method, that an zzso complex is an zzso structure consisting of one large alpha chain, one large beta chain, one medium zzso chain, and one small zzso zzso The complex has been shown to contain a core and two zzso The zzso core includes the small zzso and the medium zzso chains together with the zzso zzso of the large alpha and beta zzso One zzso zzso to the zzso domain of the beta zzso We find that as in the case of the beta zzso the zzso portion of the alpha chains is an independently folded domain corresponding to the second zzso We use limited zzso zzso of zzso coats to show the release of the zzso from the interior of the coats and the retention of the zzso core by the remaining zzso zzso In addition, we find that the zzso core zzso the coat and prevents its zzso These results are consistent with the proposal that the zzso core contains the binding zzso for zzso while the zzso and zzso zzso interact with membrane components of coated pits and coated zzso
