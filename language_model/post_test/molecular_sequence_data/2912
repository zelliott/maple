The study of gene family members has been aided by the isolation of related genes on the basis of DNA zzso We have adapted the zzso chain reaction to screen animal zzso very rapidly and reliably for likely gene family zzso Using zzso zzso acid sequences to design zzso zzso zzso we have shown that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contains sequences zzso to many zzso genes involved in pattern formation, including the segment polarity gene wingless zzso zzso and zzso sequences characteristic of the zzso zzso and paired zzso In addition, we have used this method to show that zzso zzso contains at least five different sequences zzso to genes in the zzso zzso zzso Lastly, we have isolated six zzso channel sequences from humans, a result that zzso the utility of the method with large zzso and suggests that human zzso channel gene diversity may be zzso
