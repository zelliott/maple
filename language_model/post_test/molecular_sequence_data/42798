The zzso sequence of the DNA regions zzso the cohesive end site of the temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Four pairs of sequence repeats of 8 to 13 zzso in length were revealed close to the cohesive zzso These repeats possibly represent signal sequences involved in zzso DNA maturation and zzso The start of an open reading frame was localized only 42 zzso from the left end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region, zzso that zzso probably proceeds across the zzso zzso zzso of the characteristics of the DNA zzso of zzso with complementary cohesive DNA ends suggests that zzso of zzso bacteria generally carry zzso zzso whereas those of zzso hosts carry zzso zzso
