zzso parallel sequencing of DNA by zzso technology offers much higher zzso and lower cost than conventional zzso zzso Although extensively used already for sequencing of zzso relatively few applications of zzso parallel zzso to zzso analysis have been zzso To test the ability of this technology to provide unbiased representation of zzso we analyzed zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Two sequencing runs yielded zzso expressed sequence tags zzso after quality zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso zzso and to The zzso Information Resource zzso zzso models zzso zzso zzso parallel zzso detected zzso of zzso gene zzso providing very deep coverage of the zzso Performing a second sequencing run only increased the number of genes identified by zzso but increased the overall sequence coverage by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to their predicted full-length transcripts indicated that all regions of the transcript were well represented regardless of transcript length or expression zzso Furthermore, short, zzso and long transcripts were equally zzso zzso Over 16,000 of the zzso that mapped to the zzso were not represented in the existing zzso zzso In some cases, the zzso provide the first experimental evidence for transcripts derived from predicted zzso and, for at least 60 locations in the zzso zzso identified likely zzso sequences that are not now zzso as zzso Together, the results indicate zzso parallel zzso provides novel information helpful to improve the zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the unbiased representation of transcripts will be particularly useful for gene discovery and gene expression analysis of zzso plants with less complete zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso numbers in zzso are zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso through zzso zzso
