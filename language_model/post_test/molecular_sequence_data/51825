zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso frogs is essential for the performance of male courtship zzso During zzso zzso development, the initially zzso zzso of zzso muscle zzso and fast zzso zzso is converted to the masculine form zzso fast zzso under the influence of zzso zzso To explore the molecular basis of zzso zzso we have isolated zzso clones zzso portions of a new zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso We have detected expression of this gene only in zzso muscle and specifically in zzso All adult male zzso muscle fibers express the zzso zzso zzso Adult female zzso muscle expresses zzso only in some zzso zzso of zzso during PM development was examined using Northern blots and in zzso zzso Males express higher levels of zzso than females throughout PM development and attain adult levels by zzso In zzso zzso expression zzso zzso at zzso Treatment of juvenile female frogs with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene will permit analysis of zzso sexual differentiation in this highly sexually zzso zzso
