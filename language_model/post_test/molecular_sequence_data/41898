A zzso chain reaction zzso procedure for simultaneous detection and identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was developed and evaluated against culture in a study zzso zzso zzso and zzso from 166 patients with suspected zzso 54 of which were culture zzso A zzso sequence in the zzso toxin promoter region was amplified using zzso zzso 1: zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequence contains zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and species were differentiated by restriction zzso zzso of the amplified zzso The lowest zzso amount of zzso zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso approximately 30 zzso No false zzso were found in clinical samples or among 18 other zzso Treatment of 66 zzso with a weak zzso exchange zzso increased the diagnostic sensitivity of zzso Two zzso zzso were negative by zzso but grew with a single colony among zzso zzso and could be identified only after zzso analysis of the colony zzso The amount of positive cases was increased from 13 by culture to 19 by the addition of zzso Six samples positive by zzso were culture zzso All six patients showed clinical and zzso evidence of zzso and three patients had been treated with zzso zzso increased the sensitivity of zzso case finding with retained specificity and can be used for laboratory diagnosis of zzso zzso
