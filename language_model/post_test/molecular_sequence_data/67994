A zzso zzso to the zzso zzso named zzso was developed and zzso It was then zzso bound to zzso and used to purify hybrid zzso proteins from zzso coli crude zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region, inserted within the zzso zzso was used as a model to assess immune response in mice injected with zzso zzso coli extract or with zzso hybrid zzso zzso None of the mice zzso with the whole bacterial extract produced zzso to zzso On the other hand, all the mice zzso with the zzso protein developed zzso zzso zzso These results might be due to the presence of bacterial components capable of masking the zzso protein to the immune zzso The use of zzso zzso proteins may constitute in some instances a more effective way of generating an immune response against foreign zzso as opposed to whole bacterial zzso
