Small differences have been reported in the internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso region among strains of zzso zzso We compared zzso sequences among 6 zzso zzso strains analyzed in our laboratory, including 2 strains that have not been examined previously zzso and zzso Five sequences showed zzso similarity and also were identical to 7 of 11 sequences that were previously reported by zzso In contrast, initial attempts to sequence the zzso of zzso generated 12 zzso differences compared with the other 5 zzso and several ambiguous zzso However, the single band containing the zzso region, as observed after zzso on a zzso zzso zzso became divided into 2 distinct bands when zzso using 5 or zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and the zzso within these separate bands were zzso without zzso The other 5 zzso zzso strains were also zzso using zzso and in each strain 2 distinct bands were zzso In comparison, 2 strains of zzso zzso continued to show only 1 band when examined using zzso The zzso sequence of zzso from Brazil, differs in several base pairs from those of North American and European strains of zzso zzso zzso variation of the zzso region appears to be common in zzso zzso in contrast to zzso zzso
