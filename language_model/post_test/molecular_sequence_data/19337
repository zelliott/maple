zzso zzso zzso is a pasture zzso species that forms a highly specific zzso symbiotic interaction with a group of bacteria that belong to zzso These zzso have zzso % sequence similarity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso % sequence similarity to zzso zzso for the zzso gene zzso zzso and strain zzso has 100 % sequence similarity to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had 85 % zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and 50 % zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso zzso was zzso zzso also had a similar cellular fatty acid profile to zzso zzso These results are strong evidence that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso belong to the same group of zzso zzso differences were revealed between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in growth conditions, zzso resistance and carbon source zzso The zzso content of the DNA of zzso was zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained a zzso ( approximately 500 zzso but the symbiotic genes were detected on a mobile zzso island and considerable variation was present in the symbiotic genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was zzso % sequence similarity for zzso and zzso % for zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso host of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso These significant differences observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso warrant the proposal of a novel zzso for zzso zzso within zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the reference zzso
