zzso zzso zzso of childhood represent approximately zzso of pediatric brain zzso They are highly invasive tumors and respond poorly to conventional treatments in contrast to zzso zzso which usually are well demarcated and frequently can be cured by zzso The molecular events for this clinical relevant finding are only partially zzso In the current study, to identify zzso zzso genes that may be involved in the zzso of pediatric zzso we performed a zzso differential zzso zzso approach and found frequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 9) gene zzso a zzso factor involved in brain zzso zzso zzso sequencing and combined zzso restriction analysis showed that zzso were frequently zzso at two zzso zzso regions in comparison to benign, zzso zzso zzso and normal brain zzso The zzso zzso was associated with reduced zzso zzso expression in pediatric zzso samples and corresponding cell zzso This zzso modification was zzso by pharmacological zzso zzso and zzso of zzso transcript was induced in pediatric zzso cell zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cell lines did not directly affect cell proliferation and zzso but specifically inhibited zzso cell migration and invasion in zzso suggesting a possible implication of zzso in the migratory zzso of zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso gene is frequently silenced in pediatric zzso zzso by zzso and that this zzso zzso is involved in zzso cell migration and zzso
