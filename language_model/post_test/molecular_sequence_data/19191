Over the last 60 years, the use of zzso zzso as a zzso has resulted in the production of zzso million tons of zzso waste, which has been dumped in open sinks across the zzso Here, the combination of the zzso of two genetic subspecies zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso isolated from two discrete geographical locations, Japan and India, zzso capable of degrading zzso with zzso data from an zzso zzso zzso zzso per g zzso enabled the reconstruction and validation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the subspecies zzso demonstrated that zzso of the genes in each subspecies were absent in the zzso This includes two zzso from the zzso zzso degradation pathway, suggesting that the zzso was unable to degrade zzso zzso but descendants acquired zzso genes by zzso lateral gene zzso In addition, zzso and zzso degradation traits were found to be strain zzso retained only by zzso and environment zzso in the zzso and subspecies, but prevalent in the zzso specific, zzso One draft secondary zzso two near complete plasmids and eight complete zzso zzso were assembled from the zzso zzso zzso these results reinforce the elastic nature of the zzso zzso and describe the evolutionary acquisition mechanism of a zzso degradation zzso in response to environmental zzso This also demonstrates for the first time the use of zzso data in ancestral zzso zzso highlighting its potential to provide significant insight into the development of such zzso
