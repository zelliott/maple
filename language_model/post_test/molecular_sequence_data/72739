zzso E zzso is initially zzso as a larger precursor containing an additional zzso zzso that is highly zzso between human and zzso Previous studies have established that the zzso is zzso active and that deletion of the pro region does not affect the expression of the active zzso In the present study the function of the pro region was examined both by deleting this region from zzso and by attaching this region to the zzso of zzso zzso lacking the pro region is sorted into the regulated zzso zzso in zzso cells, based on zzso zzso and examination of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso cells with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso lacking the pro region to similar zzso indicating a similar efficiency of sorting of the zzso When the pro region of zzso is replaced with the pro region of zzso followed by expression in zzso cells, the protein is not sorted into the regulated pathway, based on the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso protein is retained in the zzso zzso to a greater extent than is zzso zzso analysis indicates that the pro region of zzso is not efficiently removed from the zzso of zzso and the small amount of zzso zzso that does occur takes place soon before zzso of the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso indicates that the majority of the zzso is removed from zzso and that this zzso occurs in the zzso network or soon after sorting into the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the pro region of zzso is not required for the expression or zzso zzso of this zzso
