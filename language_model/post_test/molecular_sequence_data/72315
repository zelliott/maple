Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were amplified from rat zzso zzso and both exhibited zzso sequence identity to the short zzso II - ) zzso of type I zzso zzso Type III zzso zzso was also expressed in zzso zzso The distribution of zzso receptors included the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate the zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and suggest multiple functions for zzso receptors in this zzso
