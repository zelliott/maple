We have determined the zzso sequences of the two internal transcribed zzso the adjacent zzso coding sequences and the boundary between the external transcribed zzso and the zzso coding sequence in a cloned zzso zzso unit from zzso zzso The transcribed zzso differ very extensively from those of zzso zzso Nevertheless, embedded in the internal transcribed zzso are several short sequence elements which are identical between the two zzso These zzso elements are zzso displaced by substantial distances in the zzso borealis sequence with respect to that of zzso zzso These relative zzso imply that insertions and deletions have played a major role in transcribed zzso divergence in zzso This in turn implies that large regions of the transcribed zzso do not play a zzso role in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso parts of the zzso coding regions, which zzso 670 zzso differ at only three points from the corresponding sequences in zzso zzso each by a single zzso These zzso are readily zzso by current models for zzso higher order zzso
