zzso of a zzso zzso zzso B zzso was localized to a zzso clone zzso encompassing zzso zzso of zzso N and to a series of zzso synthetic peptides containing a zzso zzso Human zzso containing zzso zzso also bound to this zzso motif in the form of a zzso zzso and could distinguish the zzso sequence from similar sequences present in the zzso A and C zzso in a number of zzso zzso zzso binding to either this zzso or to a zzso present on both B and D zzso inhibited the majority of zzso binding in 50% of zzso zzso The region of zzso containing zzso also bears a second zzso zzso blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso This hotspot binds zzso of zzso activity in zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso B zzso recognition repertoire is restricted in zzso zzso
