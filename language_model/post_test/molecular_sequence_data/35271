Although more than 80 weak D types have been reported, many rare zzso probably remain zzso However, direct evidence that associates zzso zzso in the zzso gene with weak D types is zzso 

Blood samples were obtained from Shanghai Blood zzso zzso samples typed in routine laboratories were tested using a zzso zzso M zzso an indirect zzso test, and a commercial panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing that included adjacent zzso zzso regions was zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis was zzso 

Four different zzso zzso were identified among six blood samples, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso tests were consistent with weak D zzso The zzso results indirectly suggest that these sequence changes affect zzso 

This study is the first to describe weak D types caused by zzso variations near the zzso sites in the zzso zzso which is supported by the zzso results combined with zzso profiles and zzso zzso The identification of the four novel zzso zzso represents a new significant addition to the molecular bases that zzso weak D, which would deepen our understanding of the mechanism of the low expression of the zzso zzso These zzso changes are predicted to have regulatory effects on zzso zzso
