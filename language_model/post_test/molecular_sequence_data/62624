To prepare the zzso for detection of zzso D virus zzso 

Several pairs of specific zzso zzso were designed according to the zzso region of zzso zzso The DNA zzso were prepared by zzso the zzso products onto the surface of glass slides with the use of zzso and restriction display zzso zzso was employed to label the zzso 

zzso analysis showed that the products of zzso amplification were the specific gene fragments of zzso zzso signals on the gene chip demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity of the zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso clinical zzso detection can be sensitive and zzso
