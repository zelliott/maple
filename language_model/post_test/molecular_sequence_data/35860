A zzso gene zzso zzso resistance, zzso newly found among zzso strains of zzso coli, was observed at a frequency of zzso among zzso veterinary zzso This rather high frequency of zzso could be due to the extensive use of zzso in veterinary practice in zzso After searching several hundred clinical zzso one human zzso coli strain was also found to harbor the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso gene seems to have spread from zzso bacteria to human zzso Furthermore, the occurrence of other genes coding for resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso among the zzso zzso was zzso In addition, association of zzso genes with the zzso open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso In colony zzso experiments, both zzso and zzso were found associated with these zzso zzso The most common combination was zzso and zzso indicating a high prevalence of zzso
