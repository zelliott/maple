To investigate the structural requirements and functions of the zzso and the zzso regions of the chicken zzso signal zzso the zzso acids of each region were zzso The replacement of zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso respectively, resulted in the complete shift of the zzso site from position zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso This shows that the introduction of a zzso zzso like Pro makes it possible to control the zzso site of the signal zzso zzso of the positive charge and introduction of a negative charge in the zzso region decreased the zzso activity of zzso human zzso zzso and processing efficiency of zzso but the length and additional positive charge in this region had little zzso This suggests that the length of the zzso region scarcely influences the function of the signal zzso and that this region possibly interacts with the zzso zzso membrane to initiate the zzso of zzso similar to zzso signal zzso However, it needs only minimum positive charge for its zzso
