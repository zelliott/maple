zzso of zzso zzso of zzso transient zzso potential protein zzso is an important clue to understand molecular mechanisms underlying zzso influx activated in response to stimulation of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso Here we have isolated zzso zzso a novel seventh zzso zzso zzso zzso from mouse zzso zzso showed abundant zzso expression in the heart, zzso and eye and moderate expression in the brain, zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney cells exhibited distinctive functional features, compared with other zzso zzso zzso influx activity accompanied by reduction in zzso release from internal stores was characteristic of zzso cells but was by far less significant in cells expressing zzso which is structurally the closest to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso influx in response to zzso zzso stimulation at zzso zzso lower than those necessary for zzso of zzso and for zzso release from the zzso store, which suggests that the zzso channel is activated independently of zzso zzso In fact, zzso expression did not affect zzso zzso entry induced by zzso whereas zzso greatly zzso zzso influx induced by zzso without involvement of protein zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso patch clamp recordings from zzso cells demonstrated the zzso activated and zzso inward zzso zzso both of which were initially blocked and then subsequently facilitated by zzso zzso at a zzso zzso zzso of zzso currents by internal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acid revealed an essential role of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso and their potent zzso by the zzso analogue suggests that the zzso channel is a new member of zzso zzso zzso Relative zzso indicate that zzso is slightly selective to zzso zzso Thus, our findings reveal an interesting correspondence of zzso to the background and zzso zzso zzso currents in various native zzso
