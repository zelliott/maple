The wine zzso acid bacteria zzso zzso has to cope with harsh environmental conditions including an zzso zzso a high alcoholic content, zzso growth temperatures, and growth zzso compounds such as fatty zzso zzso acids and zzso We here describe zzso and cloning of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a protein belonging to the zzso cassette zzso of zzso The zzso protein displays the highest sequence similarity with the zzso of zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso most notably the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso The zzso gene proved to be a zzso gene since its expression was increased at high temperature or under zzso zzso The zzso protein function was tested in zzso coli, and consistent with the zzso gene expression pattern, zzso zzso protection to bacteria grown on a high salt zzso zzso also triggered bacterial resistance to sodium zzso wine and ethanol zzso The zzso zzso protein featured the same zzso pattern than zzso when expressed in zzso coli, and the contribution to resistance of both zzso and zzso zzso was decreased by zzso a well-known inhibitor of the human zzso zzso Genes zzso to zzso were detected in other wine zzso acid bacteria, suggesting that this type of genes might constitute a zzso zzso molecular zzso
