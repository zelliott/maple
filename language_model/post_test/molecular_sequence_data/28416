The antenna complex zzso of zzso marina has been isolated by applying zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso density zzso of zzso zzso zzso The antenna zzso zzso and zzso were prepared by organic zzso extraction of extensively zzso and zzso zzso antenna complex material or zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso in the presence of organic zzso and an additional step on a zzso reversed phase column yielded pure zzso and zzso Their complete primary structures have been zzso using automated zzso degradation and zzso zzso According to quantitative zzso degradation the ratio of zzso and zzso has been determined as zzso in the isolated antenna complex as well as in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso marina, presumably zzso consists of 52 zzso acid zzso and is 75, 56, 52 and zzso zzso to the corresponding core antenna zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is less zzso to the corresponding core zzso zzso of the same strains zzso 51, 41 and zzso It shows an extended zzso domain as compared to the zzso zzso Apart from the typical structural features of bacterial zzso antenna zzso (three domain zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the antenna zzso of zzso marina are structurally related to zzso of core antenna complexes with strong near infrared circular zzso zzso
