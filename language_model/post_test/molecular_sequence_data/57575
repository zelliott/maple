zzso of proteins destined for different plasma membrane zzso zzso and zzso pathways takes place in the zzso network zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein found in this zzso zzso We show that zzso contains an autonomous targeting signal within its zzso domain which determines its zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso of this domain demonstrate that a zzso motif zzso to the zzso signal of surface receptors is necessary and sufficient for correct zzso These findings suggest that zzso is maintained in the zzso by retrieval from the plasma membrane and employs a different mechanism for retention from that of the zzso zzso of the zzso
