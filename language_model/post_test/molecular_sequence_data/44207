We have identified a novel human gene that is entirely deleted in two boys with abnormal zzso development and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is located in zzso zzso approximately 80 zzso zzso to the recently isolated zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso showed a ubiquitous pattern and suggested high levels of expression in skeletal muscle, brain, and zzso A transcript of zzso zzso was detected in a range of zzso and additional alternate forms of zzso and zzso zzso were present in zzso and zzso zzso The gene extends over 100 zzso and is composed of at least seven zzso of which two are zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso revealed two overlapping open reading frames zzso that zzso putative proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two alternative spliced transcripts affecting the large open reading frame were identified that, together with the Northern zzso results, suggest that distinct proteins are derived from the zzso No significant zzso to other known proteins was zzso but segments of the first zzso zzso zzso tracts and zzso zzso which are frequently observed in zzso zzso The zzso gene is a strong candidate for being implicated in the zzso zzso present in the two zzso zzso The gene also serves as a candidate for other disorders that map to zzso zzso
