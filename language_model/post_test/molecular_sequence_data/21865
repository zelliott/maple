A zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso was isolated from a sample of soil immersed in zzso water containing zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso suggested that strain zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the isolate were zzso zzso straight zzso zzso by a single polar zzso The strain grew at zzso zzso with optimum growth at 35 zzso at pH 7, and at pH zzso It zzso Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 80, but not zzso zzso starch or zzso Its major zzso zzso was zzso zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The zzso fatty acid profile consisted mainly of zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso and zzso sequences revealed that the isolate could be zzso from zzso species that exhibited more than 97 % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity and zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso group including the closest relative of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed 51 zzso 5 % zzso zzso to differences in zzso properties and zzso analyses based on zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso zzso data, the isolate merits zzso in a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
