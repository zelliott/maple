A zzso zzso library derived from 4-6 zzso rats was screened using a zzso 435 base pair zzso zzso probe derived from zzso 3 of rat brain zzso zzso Two positive clones were isolated from an initial screening of approximately 20,000 zzso zzso zzso The longest insert zzso zzso was zzso and was found to contain a portion of zzso A at the zzso zzso B was sliced as it is in the brain, therefore, the domain structure of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso 3, reading in the zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso is located at the zzso of zzso 2, the reading frame of zzso is zzso however, within zzso A are 4 upstream zzso zzso which exist in a favorable context for initiation of zzso It is probable that translation of zzso would be inhibited by the presence of these upstream zzso zzso which may explain the zzso between the levels of zzso zzso and zzso peptides in the zzso zzso prior to the onset of zzso was found to drastically reduce the level of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso factors affect the expression of the zzso gene in these zzso either directly or zzso
