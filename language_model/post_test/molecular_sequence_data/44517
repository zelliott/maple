The small zzso zzso zzso zzso has two regions of extended primary sequence zzso to the zzso zzso The 3' region zzso zzso shows the consensus structure for the zzso guide class of zzso whereas zzso between the zzso region zzso zzso and the zzso zzso sequence is required for the formation of functional zzso Between zzso A and B lies another essential region zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso can be zzso in zzso to the zzso zzso is detected exclusively with the zzso primary zzso Many zzso in zzso that lie outside of zzso A and B are zzso to the zzso in particular the essential domain Y region is zzso at several zzso zzso is, therefore, in far more extensive contact with the zzso than predicted from simple zzso zzso Moreover, zzso can be zzso to other small zzso zzso The functional interactions made by zzso during zzso synthesis are likely to be very zzso
