Six independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from the root zzso of rice grown at the International Rice Research Institute zzso and investigated in a zzso zzso zzso 

The strains produced fatty acid patterns typical for members of the family zzso Comparative sequence analyses of the zzso zzso as well as zzso genes allocated the strains to two zzso groups within the zzso zzso family zzso The analyses indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to be the closest related zzso An zzso zzso protein comparison supported the placement in the zzso zzso and the zzso of our zzso to the aforementioned zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso analyses provided further evidence that the novel strains belong to two new species within the zzso zzso The two species can be differentiated from each other and from existing enteric species by acid production from zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, among other zzso Members of both species revealed capacities to zzso rice roots, including zzso capabilities such as an active supply of fixed nitrogen to the plant and zzso of zzso zzso next to traits allowing adaptation to the zzso 

Two novel proposed zzso species, denominated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from rice zzso Both species are capable of promoting rice growth by zzso nitrogen and zzso
