zzso a zzso zzso exists in a large zzso specifically expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and a small visceral zzso generated by a downstream zzso start zzso Using zzso to the green fluorescent zzso we could show that both zzso zzso are localized at zzso containing filaments and mapped two zzso that are each sufficient for zzso at the zzso zzso The first domain is located in the zzso zzso half of zzso and the second in the common, zzso zzso The second domain shares clear sequence similarity with a domain of zzso T involved in zzso filament zzso These results suggest that the zzso expression of zzso zzso might contribute to the different zzso properties of smooth muscle zzso
