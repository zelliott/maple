The zzso zzso plays an important role in cell zzso zzso zzso of differentiation and zzso These functions most likely result from the zzso factor activity of zzso As a zzso with Max, the zzso protein binds to the zzso sequence zzso which is also recognized by zzso zzso In order to test differences in target gene recognition of zzso Max and zzso zzso we compared the DNA binding characteristics of these proteins in zzso using zzso viruses expressing full-length zzso and Max zzso As expected, zzso zzso binds specifically to a consensus zzso The optimal conditions for DNA binding by either zzso Max or zzso zzso differ with respect to zzso strength and zzso zzso zzso Most interestingly, the zzso complex binds with a high affinity to its natural target, the rat zzso zzso which contains two zzso consensus zzso High affinity binding results from zzso ability of zzso zzso to bind zzso to these zzso We propose that differential cooperative binding by zzso binding zzso factors could contribute to target gene zzso
