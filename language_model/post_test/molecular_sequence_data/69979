zzso outgrowth is dependent on the presence in zzso of assembled zzso which consist of zzso zzso to which zzso proteins zzso are zzso This study adds to previous evidence of the similarity between the high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso and explains the different zzso patterns observed by different laboratories on frozen zzso using zzso zzso against each zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso and labels growing but not mature zzso in the rat nervous system and, therefore, expression of this zzso or molecular changes in it may be important for zzso zzso It has been shown that a zzso form of zzso can be detected by zzso in brain areas with growing zzso This study shows that there is zzso dependency of zzso binding to zzso which is, however, lost during brain zzso
