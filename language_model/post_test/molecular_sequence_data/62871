zzso zzso uses G zzso signal zzso for many zzso and zzso functions, suggesting the existence of G zzso receptors zzso other than the four known zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso of the zzso receptors were used to identify zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Limited sequence identity between these putative zzso and the zzso receptors suggests the zzso receptors are unlikely to be receptors for zzso The zzso genes are expressed at various times during growth and the zzso life zzso zzso of individual zzso genes did not impair zzso responses to zzso acid or zzso or alter zzso zzso However, zzso zzso grew to a higher cell density than did zzso cells and zzso zzso expression zzso were zzso to cell zzso suggesting that zzso is a negative regulator of cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso produce large zzso with delayed anterior tip formation indicating a role for the zzso zzso in the development of the anterior zzso cell zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the anterior zzso cell region of zzso organisms supports a zzso role for the zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso
