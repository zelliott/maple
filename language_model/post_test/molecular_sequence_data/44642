The specific binding of zzso to zzso zzso is believed to play an important role in the infection process by zzso adherence of the bacteria to host zzso The domain of zzso involved in the interaction with zzso zzso is zzso In the present study, we constructed a zzso random zzso zzso display library, which was used to pan against intact cells of zzso zzso Several zzso zzso peptides containing a zzso zzso motif within the zzso repeats were found to bind to zzso These data were supported by competition experiments, in which a representative zzso acid synthetic zzso zzso zzso part of a zzso repeat inhibited binding of the bacteria to zzso while a control zzso with identical zzso acid composition but a scrambled sequence had no zzso Moreover, cells of zzso zzso were shown to bind to the synthetic zzso as well as to immobilized zzso whose structural zzso to the zzso repeats in the zzso zzso has long been zzso zzso zzso could inhibit zzso binding to immobilized zzso These results provide first evidence for a biological role of zzso itself and respective repeats in zzso in bacterial zzso suggesting that during an infection process these or other zzso zzso proteins could be potential targets for bacterial attachment and subsequent zzso
