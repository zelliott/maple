The zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been shown to serve along with zzso as zzso for zzso The zzso of zzso strains for zzso of zzso cells can be explained, at least partly, by the selective use of G zzso receptors zzso We have identified a novel human zzso zzso located on zzso 3 that encodes a zzso with sequence similarity to zzso receptors and to zzso zzso orphan zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and activated T cells, and is induced in activated peripheral blood zzso When zzso into nonhuman zzso zzso cells expressing human zzso the zzso zzso rendered these cells competent to fuse with cells expressing zzso envelope zzso zzso Of greatest interest, zzso in contrast with zzso or zzso was able to function as a zzso for fusion zzso by zzso from both T cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines also supported enhanced productive infection with zzso compared with control zzso zzso Despite the sequence similarities between zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines did not respond to any in a panel of zzso Based on the pattern of tissue expression of the zzso zzso and given the ability of zzso to function with zzso of differing zzso zzso may play a role in the establishment and/or progression of zzso zzso
