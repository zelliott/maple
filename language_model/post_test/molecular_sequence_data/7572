The zzso factors zzso alpha and zzso beta belong to the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso family of zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta are expressed in the liver and are implicated in the control of zzso events following following zzso It is hypothesized that zzso of zzso alpha gene expression following zzso may lead to some of the zzso features we recognize as zzso syndrome such as decreased visceral protein zzso zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso alpha zzso zzso is zzso inhibited 12 zzso following zzso zzso consistent with previous zzso However, we demonstrate that zzso there is increased binding of zzso nuclear protein to the zzso alpha DNA response element 48 zzso following zzso zzso a marked increase in zzso alpha protein is observed 48 zzso following zzso insult compared with no increase in zzso zzso alpha protein at 12 zzso zzso zzso the increase in zzso zzso alpha protein at 48 zzso following zzso zzso and puncture is not associated with an increase in zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso the increase in zzso zzso alpha protein is associated with an increase in zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is decreased at 12 and 48 zzso following insult and does not correlate with the zzso alpha protein zzso We conclude that the possible role of the zzso factor zzso alpha with respect to decreased zzso gene expression following zzso must be zzso
