zzso zzso is essential for AIDS zzso but this viral protein is not targeted by zzso zzso The functions of zzso are largely related to zzso of zzso trafficking and signaling pathways through zzso and zzso motifs that are required for interactions with zzso zzso protein complexes and zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso We previously described a zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso and zzso many, but not all, of its biological zzso We now report a further development of this zzso strategy through the demonstration of the remarkable zzso activity of artificial zzso zzso called zzso comprised of the zzso zzso fused to modified zzso zzso The zzso inhibited all key activities of zzso including zzso zzso and major zzso complex class I zzso cell surface zzso and enhancement of virus zzso When expressed in T zzso zzso specifically inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which contributes to the zzso of the formation of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso inhibited the zzso formation of zzso giant cells and zzso zzso and it zzso the zzso activity of zzso on zzso Since we show here that these effects of zzso on zzso and T cell functions were both dependent on the zzso and zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso disrupted interactions of zzso with both zzso complexes and zzso These results demonstrate that it is possible to inhibit all functions of zzso both in T zzso and zzso with a single zzso that represents an efficient tool to develop new zzso strategies targeting zzso
