The human zzso protein 1 zzso belongs to the large zzso cassette zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso is involved in tissue defense, zzso in cancer cells, it is zzso and contributes to resistance to zzso We previously investigated the folding properties of the predicted zzso fragments zzso zzso and zzso from zzso domain 2 zzso These zzso folded only partially as an zzso and were located in the polar zzso region of zzso zzso used as membrane mimics zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now extended these studies to zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso zzso zzso whereas the role of zzso is less zzso because few studies have focused on zzso a domain present in some zzso zzso zzso Each TM contained a single zzso zzso zzso or zzso acting as an intrinsic fluorescent zzso The location and dynamics of the zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso and zzso fluorescence, including zzso zzso zzso TM structure was analyzed by zzso circular zzso studies in zzso zzso and zzso zzso behaved similarly to zzso and zzso with an zzso location in zzso consistent with a possible role in lining the transport zzso By contrast, zzso behaved like a classical TM zzso with a high zzso content, and its zzso zzso did not require its interaction with other zzso
