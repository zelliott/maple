zzso zzso proteins are close relatives of the zzso regulators of zzso zzso but their function is zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of full-length zzso in complex with its zzso zzso delta solved in two crystal forms zzso Data Bank codes zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows a dramatic zzso change from the zzso form, which suggests that it is zzso membrane zzso zzso delta is structurally closely related to zzso and contains a deep empty zzso zzso Further experiments show that zzso zzso zzso and G zzso interact with zzso delta and that, at least for zzso the intact zzso is zzso We suggest zzso delta to be a specific soluble transport factor for certain zzso proteins and zzso a regulator of zzso zzso zzso
