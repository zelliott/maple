The zzso zzso zzso system of zzso zzso has recently been suggested to belong to the zzso zzso systems zzso zzso and zzso Gene 97 (1991) zzso The zzso sequences of zzso mod and zzso have been zzso Two closely adjacent open reading frames were found 12 zzso apart with coding capacities of 651 zzso and zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso The zzso lying in the same direction of zzso in the zzso order, are transcribed as distinct zzso The deduced zzso sequences reveal zzso with known zzso zzso from the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso restriction zzso zzso like other zzso and zzso zzso contains sequence motifs characteristic of zzso zzso which may be involved in DNA unwinding at the zzso zzso
