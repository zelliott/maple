The major zzso complex zzso plays an important role in an zzso ability to respond to zzso zzso diversity is advantageous as it permits the recognition of more external zzso For this reason, zzso and immune gene variation are considered a barometer for the genetic health of wild zzso Mountain zzso zzso zzso were previously shown to have little variation at the zzso Class II zzso zzso which was attributed to population bottlenecks during the last glacial maximum zzso In this paper, we extended the analysis of zzso zzso in mountain zzso to 5 genes representing the 3 classes of zzso gene zzso I zzso Class II zzso and zzso and Class III zzso and the natural zzso zzso zzso We zzso approximately zzso zzso from 31 individuals sampled across the range of mountain zzso and found very low levels of diversity zzso zzso sites per zzso with the exception of the Class I zzso zzso zzso was nearly 30 times more diverse than the other immune genes and appears to represent a source of increased zzso zzso This diversity may be attributed to multiple zzso zzso by pathogen exposure, or potentially influenced by social zzso The distribution of zzso was not associated with zzso history, suggesting that the current distribution of zzso diversity was present prior to the zzso These data suggest that although they have low levels of diversity at the 4 of 5 immune zzso mountain zzso may be better equipped for future climate zzso and pathogen exposure than previously zzso
