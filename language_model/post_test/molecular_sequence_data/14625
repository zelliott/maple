The zzso zzso factors belong to the zzso of zzso group D that play a major role in disease resistance and zzso Most of the zzso identified in zzso interact with the master regulator of zzso zzso that controls the expression of zzso zzso As a first approach to determine the possible involvement of these zzso factors in zzso defense, we characterized zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Six zzso zzso to zzso were zzso The predicted zzso proteins were highly similar to zzso sequences and probably share the same DNA binding properties and zzso regulation zzso The protein sequences alignment evidenced the presence of zzso zzso characteristic of this group of zzso zzso The zzso showed that zzso evolved into three different zzso associated with defense and floral zzso This is the first report of zzso expression patterns assessed by zzso from the whole zzso of zzso members in different zzso from zzso zzso zzso mature zzso Overall, zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a zzso expression in all zzso zzso zzso expressed strongly in all zzso except in zzso while zzso expressed only in petals and to a lower extent in zzso Although more detailed studies in zzso and other floral structures are required, we suggest that zzso might be zzso and it might be involved in zzso floral zzso On the other hand, we report here for the first time, the expression of the whole family of zzso in response to salicylic acid zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso increased in response to zzso what would suggest its involvement in the zzso response in zzso
