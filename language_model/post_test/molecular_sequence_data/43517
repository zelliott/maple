The bona fide zzso zzso genes in the rat are found in a zzso tandem repeat and the zzso occur in a zzso tandem zzso Three bona fide zzso zzso genes and one gene zzso with one base substitution in the coding region were isolated from the zzso zzso Six zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso The total number of zzso zzso is zzso copies per zzso zzso and the zzso repeat contains about 50% more zzso zzso related sequences compared with the bona fide gene zzso Various zzso zzso - and zzso sequences of the bona fide gene and of the zzso were used for in zzso zzso to zzso zzso The results showed that the bona fide zzso zzso gene repeat zzso maps to zzso zzso and the zzso repeat zzso maps to zzso
