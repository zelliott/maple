We describe a 2-year-old girl with zzso giant cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Both the initial and zzso zzso contained solid and zzso zzso The former was composed of loosely arranged zzso zzso cells and giant cells with a zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso spaces were often lined by zzso giant zzso zzso the zzso cells and small vessels in the zzso tissue were positive for zzso growth factor zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso analysis revealed fusion of collagen type zzso zzso 26 with zzso chain zzso 2 that induced unscheduled production of zzso These findings suggest that zzso and its receptors significantly contribute to the development of zzso in both an zzso and a zzso zzso
