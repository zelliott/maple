In this report, we describe the characterization of a zzso in the low density zzso zzso zzso gene of a true zzso familial zzso zzso zzso The combined use of zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and DNA sequence analysis revealed a unique A to G transition in the penultimate zzso of zzso 16 of the LDL zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that a cryptic zzso site was activated in zzso 16, upstream from the original zzso site, leading to the inclusion of 62 zzso and a reading zzso The resulting new translation product contains a stretch of 154 zzso acids at the zzso that have no resemblance to the normal zzso zzso To zzso the biological effects of the zzso the structural and functional properties of the zzso LDL zzso protein were zzso zzso of the newly zzso LDL receptors showed that an zzso precursor form of the LDL zzso protein was zzso about 10 zzso larger than normal, which is not further processed to the mature zzso Some 50% of the normal LDL binding activity was found on the cell surface of the patient's zzso whereas zzso and degradation of LDL were zzso
