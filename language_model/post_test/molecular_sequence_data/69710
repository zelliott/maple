A novel zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated in a zzso zzso procedure by zzso exchange and affinity zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso molecular mass determined by zzso of 62 zzso of which zzso is zzso The zzso point is zzso zzso exhibits a high stability towards organic zzso and elevated zzso Besides the zzso activity, zzso exhibits zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso favors zzso of zzso with basic zzso acid zzso in either zzso or zzso and particularly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso In zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso coupled in good yield, but zzso zzso poorly, and unlike other zzso free zzso acids could not be coupled or zzso zzso to form zzso In zzso zzso peptides with neutral, but not zzso zzso in zzso could be zzso The scope of zzso for zzso zzso synthesis is zzso
