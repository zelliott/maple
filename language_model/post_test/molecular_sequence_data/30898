zzso zzso is an ubiquitous zzso in zzso cells, and zzso zzso are produced in zzso by differential expression of the two genes which zzso this zzso activity as well as by alternative zzso of the primary transcript of one of these zzso zzso of this zzso activity is one of the most common causes of zzso zzso in zzso To provide a framework for understanding the molecular basis of this inherited disorder and the mechanisms responsible for regulating the expression of this zzso activity, both the human and rat zzso genes for zzso zzso have been cloned and partially zzso zzso of the two genes shows a high degree of conservation of sequence and structural zzso The two genes share the following zzso 1) both are approximately 20 zzso in size, have identical zzso zzso and exhibit similar zzso structural zzso 2) the zzso start site is located at the same position in both zzso and comparison of zzso sequences reveals four highly zzso zzso that together contain the information necessary for zzso expression of a zzso zzso 3) coding sequences are zzso identical and the zzso regions are zzso zzso 4) both genes have extremely short zzso regions zzso zzso 5) highly zzso intervening sequences of several hundred zzso surround most zzso zzso In zzso zzso and analysis of zzso zzso cell hybrids have localized the human gene zzso zzso to zzso 1 in the region zzso The implications of these structural properties for identifying functional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso regulation of expression of this zzso and inheritance of zzso zzso zzso are zzso
