To evaluate the genetic diversity of viral zzso zzso virus zzso the sequence of the zzso genes zzso of 11 North American and European zzso were zzso zzso with the G protein of representative members of the family zzso suggested that zzso was a different virus species from infectious zzso necrosis virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso At a higher zzso level, zzso zzso and zzso formed a group which was genetically closest to the zzso zzso Compared with each other, the G genes of zzso displayed a dissimilar overall genetic diversity which correlated with differences in geographical zzso The multiple sequence alignment of the complete G zzso showed that the divergent positions were not zzso distributed along the zzso A central region zzso acid position zzso accumulated zzso and appeared to be highly zzso The genetic zzso within a single isolate was high, with an apparent internal zzso frequency of zzso zzso zzso per zzso site, zzso the zzso nature of the viral zzso The zzso separated zzso strains according to the major geographical area of zzso zzso I for zzso Europe, zzso II for the British zzso and zzso III for North zzso zzso from zzso Europe exhibited the highest genetic zzso with zzso correlated partially with the zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso were able to discriminate between the zzso The overall structure of the zzso tree suggests that zzso genetic diversity and evolution fit within the model of random change and positive selection operating on zzso
