A gene coding for a protein containing two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso four zzso factor C, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso and Alpha zzso zzso motif was cloned from zzso zzso and zzso identified in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data zzso At least one of these sequence motifs zzso has adhesive properties in other zzso therefore, we propose to name this protein zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso is a single copy gene on zzso 14 in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly expressed in zzso zzso zzso but was zzso on Northern blots of zzso from the asexual blood zzso zzso zzso raised to different parts of zzso detected a protein expressed in late zzso but not in the early stages of zzso or asexual blood stages of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso functions in the zzso for example, in zzso of the zzso host immune response or in protection against complement factors in the blood zzso
