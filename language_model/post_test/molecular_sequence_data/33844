zzso transmission between zzso zzso cells and downstream zzso zzso plays an important role for zzso zzso This process is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso channel zzso The signal transmission occurs on a rapid zzso however, the molecular organization that ensures timely signaling in this cascade is zzso zzso studies in human patients and animal models reveal that zzso cell signaling depends on the synaptic protein zzso We have conducted a zzso search for proteins associated with zzso in the mouse zzso and identified zzso as the binding zzso We further demonstrate that zzso additionally interacts with zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevented targeting of zzso to the zzso compartment of zzso zzso These results reveal a unique zzso organization of the zzso zzso where principal signaling components are zzso by zzso creating an organization essential for the correct zzso of the signaling ensemble and ultimately intact transmission of the signal at the first visual zzso
