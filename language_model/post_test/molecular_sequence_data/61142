A set of 19 heat shock proteins zzso was observed - by zzso two-dimensional gel zzso - to be induced when zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was temperature zzso from 28 degrees C to 43 degrees zzso zzso protein spots were excised from multiple two-dimensional zzso The proteins were concentrated using a zzso device before being zzso onto zzso zzso zzso for zzso with zzso before zzso and tandem zzso analysis or for zzso sequence zzso Five proteins in the range zzso zzso were identified as the small zzso zzso zzso C, D, E and zzso and three others showed strong sequence similarity to the zzso zzso Two other low molecular mass proteins corresponded to zzso and zzso and five novel proteins were zzso Four proteins of approximately 60 zzso were identified as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso An analysis of the heat shock induction of zzso of four of the most strongly induced zzso proteins and six of the zzso revealed that the proteins could be placed into four distinct regulatory groups based on the zzso of protein zzso
