In the course of systematic cloning of protein zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso stem and zzso cells, we have identified the zzso zzso of human zzso It encodes a protein containing the five zzso characteristic of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and 2 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso In adults, zzso expression was found primarily in bone zzso and at a lower level in lung and zzso During fetal development it was also found in the zzso at late stage of gestation and in zzso Analysis of bone zzso zzso showed that zzso was expressed in the zzso cell population and maturing zzso cells of the zzso lineage where expression increased with maturation and zzso At the zzso a high level of zzso expression was also found in zzso and zzso zzso expression was not detected in the primitive zzso stem cell population, and cells of the zzso zzso and zzso It was also not detected in most of the cell lines zzso Our results indicate that zzso is another member of the zzso zzso family, which is predominantly expressed in the zzso lineage within the zzso zzso
