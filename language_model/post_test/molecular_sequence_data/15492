A zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from tidal flat zzso and subjected to a zzso zzso study involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequence zzso A zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was closely related zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other type strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA and the major zzso zzso of the type strain were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The major fatty acid components were zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso this profile, with zzso : zzso as the zzso fatty acid, was characteristic of members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso zzso studies and zzso and zzso tests identified zzso and zzso differences between strain zzso and recognized zzso zzso On the basis of these data, therefore, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
