To investigate the ability of zzso zzso or zzso zzso bovine zzso promoter sequences for the expression regulation of zzso in zzso transgenic mice were produced with human type II collagen gene fused to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of bovine zzso promoter by DNA zzso Five and three transgenic founder mice were produced using zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of bovine zzso promoters zzso Founder mice were zzso with the wild type to produce F1 and zzso zzso Total zzso were extracted from four zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and zzso of female F1 transgenic mice of each transgenic line following zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis revealed that the expression level of zzso was variable among the transgenic lines, but transgenic mice containing zzso zzso of promoter sequences exhibited more leaky expression of zzso in other zzso compared to those with zzso zzso zzso Moreover, Western zzso analysis of transgenic mouse milk showed that human type II collagen proteins zzso into the milk of zzso transgenic mice contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso These results suggest that promoter sequences of zzso zzso bovine zzso gene can be used for induction of zzso zzso expression of zzso in transgenic zzso
