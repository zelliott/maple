A series of derivatives structurally related to zzso zzso was designed with the aim to zzso selectivity toward the zzso zzso The results obtained demonstrated that the presence of a correctly oriented function with positive electronic effect zzso in portion X of the zzso is an important factor for significant zzso selectivity zzso 5, 13, 16, and zzso zzso modeling and zzso studies support experimental data and highlight the crucial role for the hydrogen bond between the zzso nitrogen in position 3 of 5 and the zzso ring of zzso which is favorably oriented in the zzso zzso
