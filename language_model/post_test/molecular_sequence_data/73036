zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso I) zzso complexes bearing a zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso in the absence of zzso When such complexes were isolated and incubated in the presence of zzso the associated zzso was shortened from the zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso zzso transcripts were still associated with the DNA and were zzso zzso upon addition of zzso The zzso activity could be removed from the pol zzso complex with buffers containing zzso zzso These findings indicate that a factor with characteristics similar to zzso factor zzso is associated with the pol I zzso zzso However, addition of zzso zzso zzso to zzso pol I zzso complexes had no effect, whereas it showed the expected effects in control reactions with zzso prepared pol II zzso zzso The results thus suggest the existence of a pol zzso zzso zzso I also report the sequence of a novel type of zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of the present and previously identified zzso zzso are less than zzso zzso Thus, like zzso species, zzso has at least two highly divergent forms of zzso
