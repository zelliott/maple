Human zzso acid zzso zzso is a prostate zzso differentiation zzso To understand the regulation of expression of the zzso zzso we studied the zzso elements of its zzso A DNA zzso from zzso to zzso base pairs zzso of zzso gene was fused to the zzso zzso zzso reporter gene and introduced into zzso and zzso human prostate cancer zzso The expression of the zzso gene driven by the zzso promoter was assessed in transient expression zzso zzso zzso deletions of the promoter were constructed and analyzed to reveal the positive and the negative regulatory elements that are involved in regulating the zzso of the zzso zzso Our data showed that the zzso sequence zzso zzso directs a high level of the zzso activity in both cell zzso zzso of the region from zzso to zzso resulted in approximately a zzso and zzso decrease of the zzso promoter activity in zzso and zzso cells, zzso Interestingly, an inverse correlation of the zzso activity with the cell growth was observed when the reporter gene was driven by the zzso fragment, but not by the zzso zzso Two regions of zzso suppression were identified and located in positions from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, the activity of the core promoter region from zzso to zzso zzso can be activated by a zzso zzso The results, thus, clearly demonstrate the presence of positive and negative zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso
