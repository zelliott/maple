While searching for genes expressed in acid lemon but not in zzso lime zzso we isolated clone zzso which showed the following expression zzso zzso while it was expressed in the zzso in both zzso its zzso was detected only in the pulp of the acid fruit, zzso no or very low expression of the gene was detected in zzso zzso These expression patterns suggested that zzso is an zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso fragments upstream of the zzso start site of the lemon and lime genes to zzso zzso activity was investigated by transient expression in isolated juice zzso of both zzso Whereas zzso promoter from lemon showed faint activity in lemon and lime juice zzso no activity was evident with the lime zzso The activities of the zzso fragments and their zzso fragments were further investigated in zzso The results indicated that the promoters were active in a manner similar to that in acid lemon and zzso zzso the lemon promoter generated activity in the fruit zzso analogous to citrus fruit zzso The zzso analyses identified an zzso region which, in the lemon promoter, contained a sequence zzso to a zzso element of the melon zzso zzso Another region, which reduced promoter activity, contained an zzso zzso identified as a zzso negative zzso Taken together, zzso promoter was confirmed to be zzso and zzso zzso in the expression of zzso between the two varieties could be attributable to changes in the gene promoter zzso
