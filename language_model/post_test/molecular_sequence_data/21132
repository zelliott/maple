Nine zzso producing from six different reservoirs with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso were surveyed for presence of zzso compounds and zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed to detect the presence of the zzso zzso gene involved in zzso zzso production in members of zzso zzso group and the zzso gene involved in regulation of zzso production in zzso zzso chain reaction amplification, zzso and sequencing confirmed the presence of the zzso genes in zzso collected from all nine zzso The presence of zzso zzso strains was confirmed by sequencing two other genes commonly used for zzso identification of bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso gene related to zzso was detected in any of the zzso zzso levels of zzso compounds in zzso were low or not zzso but zzso production could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso with a known zzso zzso strain together with nutrients increased zzso zzso The genetic potential to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso addition zzso zzso production in zzso from diverse zzso suggesting that a zzso approach for zzso oil recovery may be technically zzso
