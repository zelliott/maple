zzso architecture is a key zzso factor determining grain yield, and thus has been a major target of cereal crop zzso Transition from a spread zzso typical of ancestral wild rice zzso zzso zzso to the compact zzso of present zzso zzso zzso zzso was a crucial event in rice zzso Here we show that the spread zzso architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant zzso zzso a previously reported zzso zzso factor that controls rice zzso zzso Association analysis indicates that a zzso zzso in the zzso regulatory region led to a compact zzso architecture in zzso during rice zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso can fine-tune the spatial expression of the target zzso and that selection of zzso zzso might be an efficient strategy for crop zzso
