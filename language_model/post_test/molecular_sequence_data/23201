The genetic structure of populations of zzso mosaic virus in zzso was assessed by making host range and gene sequence comparisons of 142 zzso Most zzso collected in West zzso infected zzso plants whereas those from East zzso infected both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso sites zzso in five regions of the zzso (one third of the full zzso showed that the protein 1 zzso zzso had zzso more frequently than the other gene regions in both zzso but that the zzso were located in different parts of the zzso of the zzso Estimates of zzso diversity showed that the West zzso zzso was more diverse than the East zzso zzso but the zzso group of the genes from the latter zzso had a greater zzso substitution ratio, especially in the zzso viral zzso protein zzso and nuclear inclusion a zzso zzso zzso These zzso seem to have evolved independently from the ancestral European population, and their genetic structure probably reflects founder zzso
