Recent developments in zzso transcript monitoring have led to a rapid zzso of data from gene expression zzso Such projects highlight the need for methods to predict the molecular basis of zzso zzso A zzso project identified the zzso zzso transcripts whose synthesis displays cell zzso zzso We present here a statistical technique we developed to identify the sequence elements that may be responsible for this cell cycle zzso Because most gene regulatory sites contain a short string of highly zzso zzso any such strings that are involved in gene regulation will occur frequently in the upstream regions of the genes that they zzso and rarely in the upstream regions of other zzso Our strategy therefore zzso statistical procedures to identify short zzso five or six zzso in zzso that are zzso in upstream regions of genes whose expression zzso at the same phase of the cell zzso We report, with a high level of confidence, that 9 zzso and 12 zzso are zzso in the upstream regions of genes whose expression zzso at the early zzso late zzso zzso zzso or M phase of the cell zzso Some of these sequence elements show a preference for a particular orientation, and others, through a separate statistical test, for a particular position upstream of the zzso start zzso The finding that the majority of the statistically significant sequence elements are located in late zzso upstream regions zzso with other experiments that identified the late zzso S boundary as a vital cell cycle control zzso Our results highlight the importance of zzso an element implicated previously in late zzso S gene regulation, as most of the late zzso zzso contain the zzso sequence or variations zzso It is striking that most zzso sequences zzso to a specific region upstream of the zzso start zzso Additional sequences that we have identified may be important for regulation at other zzso of the cell zzso
