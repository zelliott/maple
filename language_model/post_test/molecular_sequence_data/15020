The 1918 influenza pandemic caused more than 40 million deaths and likely resulted from the introduction and adaptation of a novel zzso zzso zzso A virus zzso are important in host switching and zzso zzso influenza virus zzso bind zzso acid receptors linked via zzso zzso bonds, while zzso zzso bind zzso zzso zzso analysis of 1918 zzso showed zzso genes with zzso or mixed zzso zzso To characterize the role of the zzso acid binding specificity of the 1918 zzso we evaluated in mice zzso influenza viruses expressing zzso and zzso zzso genes from avian and 1918 strains with differing zzso zzso zzso expressing 1918 zzso possessing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso acid specificity were fatal to mice, with similar pathology and cellular zzso zzso zzso to zzso binding specificity did not increase the zzso of an zzso zzso Thus, the 1918 zzso contains zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso binding zzso
