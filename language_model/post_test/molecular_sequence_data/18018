The genes for both zzso of zzso zzso zzso are located on the zzso of the brown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The organization of these genes in the form of an zzso was similar to that found in zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the complete zzso revealed a high degree of zzso and great structural similarities to corresponding genes from two red zzso In contrast, sequence zzso to zzso genes from zzso and zzso was much zzso This clearly indicated a close zzso relationship between the zzso of zzso and zzso which seem to have evolved independently from the zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso of zzso and zzso have originated from zzso zzso red zzso Surprisingly, red and brown zzso zzso show a significantly higher degree of zzso to that from a hydrogen zzso than to those from zzso
