zzso zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso in two different forms, in the absence of an inhibitor and in the presence of zzso The crystal structure of the zzso F1 free form was solved by the molecular replacement method, using the zzso of the zzso zzso complex with zzso and was refined to a final zzso of zzso using the data extended to zzso A zzso For the crystal structure of the zzso F1 complex with zzso the solution of the molecular replacement method was obtained on the basis of the zzso of the zzso F1 free form, and was refined to a final zzso of zzso using the data up to 2 A zzso The two crystal structures of the zzso F1 free form and the complex with zzso are very similar to each other as reflected by a small zzso displacement zzso value of zzso A for all C alpha zzso The main differences between the two structures are associated with binding of zzso in the zzso recognition site in the loop between zzso and zzso A structural comparison between zzso F1 and zzso zzso shows a substantial similarity between all the C alpha zzso as evidenced by a zzso value of zzso zzso The loop from zzso 32 to 38 was zzso different between these two zzso in both its zzso and its hydrogen bonding zzso The zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso is shifted away from the zzso site in zzso F1 by zzso A and zzso A with respect to the corresponding positions in the zzso zzso free form and in the zzso zzso complex with zzso zzso In the zzso F1 complex, the zzso base of zzso has a zzso zzso about the zzso bond, and the zzso ring assumes a zzso zzso which is different from that found in the complex with zzso zzso In the zzso site of the zzso F1 complex with zzso one water zzso was observed, which bridges the zzso oxygen atoms of zzso and the zzso of the zzso important zzso zzso and zzso through hydrogen zzso A water zzso occupying the same position was found in the zzso F1 free zzso The significance of this water zzso in the zzso reaction is zzso
