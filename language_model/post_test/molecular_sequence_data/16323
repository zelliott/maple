The zzso and zzso zzso plasmids of zzso are closely zzso closed circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso bases or zzso whose characteristics suggest relationships to zzso DNA zzso and zzso Here, we characterized the structure of the zzso zzso determined its complete zzso sequence and mapped its major zzso The zzso and zzso plasmids have more than zzso zzso zzso Both plasmids contain a zzso zzso acid open reading frame that encodes a reverse zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this open reading frame is strongly zzso between the two plasmids zzso zzso zzso as expected for a functionally important zzso Both plasmids have a zzso zzso region that contains five zzso zzso and a direct repeat of approximately 160 zzso zzso of sequences in this region suggests that the zzso zzso has zzso less from a common zzso than has the zzso zzso Two major transcripts of the zzso zzso were detected by Northern zzso zzso a full-length linear zzso of zzso zzso and an additional prominent transcript of zzso zzso zzso zzso longer than zzso zzso zzso we find that the zzso zzso transcript is a hybrid zzso consisting of the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript plus a zzso leader of zzso zzso that is derived from the zzso end of the zzso small zzso This and other findings suggest that the zzso zzso like certain zzso zzso has a mechanism for joining zzso zzso to the zzso end of its major transcript, and that, under some circumstances, zzso sequences in zzso may be zzso at the zzso zzso
