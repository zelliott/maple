A strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria, designated zzso was isolated from a brown algae zzso in South zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 25 zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso trees based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell within the cluster zzso the type strains of species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso zzso and zzso to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso algae and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso G and summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids of strain zzso were zzso and two unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso and its zzso zzso values with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso algae zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and genetic distinctiveness and differential zzso properties revealed that strain zzso is separate from the three recognized species of the zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
