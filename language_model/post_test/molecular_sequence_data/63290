zzso disease virus zzso zzso collected from various geographic locations in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2005 were genetically zzso and their zzso was reconstructed utilizing zzso sequences of the complete zzso coding zzso Three zzso of zzso zzso A, O, and Asia 1) were identified as causing clinical disease in Afghanistan during this zzso zzso analysis revealed that the type A viruses were most closely related to zzso collected in Iran during zzso This is the first published report of zzso A in Afghanistan since 1975, therefore indicating the need for inclusion of zzso A in vaccine zzso that will be used to control disease outbreaks in this zzso zzso O virus zzso were closely related to zzso zzso including those that originated from zzso and Nepal during zzso The Asia 1 zzso collected along the northern and eastern borders of Afghanistan, were most closely related to zzso zzso collected in Pakistan during 2003 and zzso Data obtained from this study provide valuable information on the zzso zzso circulating in Afghanistan and their genetic relationship with strains causing zzso in neighboring zzso
