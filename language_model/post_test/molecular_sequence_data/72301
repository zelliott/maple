We report the discovery of four novel human putative zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso was isolated by amplifying zzso DNA with zzso based on the zzso and zzso related zzso genes and subsequent screening of a zzso zzso Also, using our customized search procedure of a database of expressed sequence tags zzso zzso sequences that partially zzso novel zzso were zzso These zzso fragments were obtained and used to screen a zzso library to isolate the full-length coding region of the zzso This resulted in the isolation of genes zzso zzso and zzso The four zzso receptors share significant identity to each other and to other members of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed expression of zzso and zzso in several human brain regions while zzso expression was detected also in zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso was used to map zzso to zzso zzso region zzso zzso to zzso 9, region zzso zzso to zzso 7, region zzso and zzso to zzso X, region zzso
