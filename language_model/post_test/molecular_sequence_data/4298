A number of the culture zzso proteins zzso by zzso tuberculosis are known to contribute to the zzso of tuberculosis and to possess zzso activities associated with zzso However, a complete analysis of the protein composition of this fraction has been zzso By using two-dimensional zzso gel zzso detailed maps of the culture zzso proteins of zzso tuberculosis zzso were zzso In total, 205 protein spots were zzso The zzso of this zzso technique with Western zzso analysis allowed the identification and mapping of 32 zzso Further molecular characterization of abundant proteins within this fraction was achieved by zzso zzso acid sequencing and liquid zzso zzso zzso proteins were subjected to zzso zzso of these, only 10 could be zzso by zzso zzso Among the most interesting were a novel zzso protein demonstrating significant zzso to an zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso a zzso protein corresponding to open reading frame 28 of the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso and a zzso protein exhibiting an zzso acid sequence identical to that of zzso zzso and zzso This latter product migrated with an zzso point between those of zzso zzso and zzso but did not react with the zzso specific for this complex, suggesting that there is a fourth member of the zzso 85 zzso Novel zzso zzso acid sequences were obtained for three additional culture zzso zzso however, these did not yield significant zzso to known protein zzso A protein cluster of 85 to 88 zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and known to react with zzso from a large proportion of tuberculosis patients, was zzso to zzso zzso Nevertheless, mass zzso of peptides obtained from one member of this complex identified it as the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso Thus, the detailed mapping of zzso tuberculosis zzso combined with state-of-the-art zzso techniques such as mass zzso provides a basis for further analysis and rapid identification of biologically relevant zzso
