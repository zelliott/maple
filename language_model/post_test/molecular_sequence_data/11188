zzso is a small protein composed of zzso zzso regions zzso 2 and 3, zzso the zzso zzso and zzso but its function remains zzso To clarify zzso zzso a human brain zzso library was searched for targets of the zzso zzso of zzso A novel zzso detected zzso zzso to as zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 4) contained zzso sequences and, through the function of one of them, zzso with the middle zzso domain of zzso A zzso fusion zzso exhibited an affinity for zzso Ash and zzso zzso in whole cell zzso zzso also had an zzso domain, which could bind to activated zzso zzso These zzso interactions imply the zzso of zzso signaling around the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso bore a putative nuclear zzso signal and a zzso zzso both characteristic of nuclear zzso and might therefore relate to the presence of zzso in the cellular zzso
