zzso produced by the human zzso cell line zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid as sugar zzso Sugar chains were liberated from zzso by zzso Free zzso groups of the sugar chains were zzso and the zzso sugar zzso were zzso with zzso under new reaction conditions in which no zzso acid zzso was zzso The zzso zzso derivatives of the sugar chains thus obtained were zzso by gel zzso and zzso zzso Seven major zzso chains were isolated and the structure of each zzso zzso chain was identified by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that the structures of the major zzso chains were of the zzso type, to which 0 to 2 zzso of zzso and 1 to 2 zzso of zzso acid were linked as shown zzso zzso see zzso
