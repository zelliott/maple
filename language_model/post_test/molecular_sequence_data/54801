zzso zzso is a food-borne bacterial pathogen associated with zzso of all zzso deaths, predominantly because of consumption of contaminated zzso The ability of zzso zzso to cause disease is linked to the production of a large zzso called the zzso zzso zzso zzso a factor shown here to be an important zzso factor by the zzso route of infection in zzso In this study, we examined genetic variation of the zzso gene that encodes zzso in 40 zzso zzso zzso 1 strains and found four distinct zzso of zzso that zzso toxins with different arrangements of zzso zzso We provide evidence that these zzso arose by zzso either with zzso genes carried on plasmids or with the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso to expected results, the most common zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso encodes a toxin with reduced potency and is distinct from the toxin produced by strains isolated from market zzso These results indicate that an important zzso factor of zzso zzso is undergoing significant genetic zzso and may be subject to selection for reduced zzso in the zzso This finding would imply further that in the future zzso genetic variation of the zzso toxins could result in the emergence of novel strains with altered zzso in zzso
