The zzso zzso zzso is a rich source of zzso and other comparative data in zzso Most land plants possess a zzso of similar zzso However, in a major group of plants, the zzso a unique zzso structure has zzso The gene order in zzso has been explained by a series of zzso zzso relative to the zzso organization of seed zzso Here, we examine for the first time the structure of the zzso across zzso zzso We used a zzso strategy to map and partially sequence zzso We found that a pair of partially overlapping zzso in the region of the zzso repeat occurred in the common zzso of most zzso However, the ancestral zzso zzso structure is still found in early zzso branches leading to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that a second pair of overlapping zzso occurred on a branch leading to the core zzso We also found that the unique placement of the gene zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso is not a result of a large-scale zzso as previously zzso This is because the zzso loss maps to an earlier point on the zzso than the nearby zzso We speculate on why zzso may occur in pairs and what this may mean for the dynamics of zzso zzso
