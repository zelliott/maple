This study aimed to evaluate the safety of zzso zzso and to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on mice zzso in the zzso tract by way of examining the population of different zzso isolated from zzso zzso We zzso evaluated the safety of zzso zzso using acute toxicity test and Ames zzso Then zzso male zzso mice were divided into the following four treatment groups, each consisting of ten zzso normal group, zzso group, zzso group and high-dose zzso zzso contents were removed zzso immediately placed into an zzso chamber, and dissolved in sterile zzso zzso The determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was analyzed by the spread plate method, cell zzso and zzso zzso The results showed the oral maximum tolerated dose of zzso zzso was more than 10 zzso body weight in mice and no zzso judged by negative experimental results of Ames zzso And in zzso and high-dose groups, the populations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased in zzso as well as the ratios of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the normal zzso This research showed the intake of zzso zzso significantly improved the zzso of the zzso tract in zzso mice by increasing the amount of zzso and reducing the populations of unwanted zzso
