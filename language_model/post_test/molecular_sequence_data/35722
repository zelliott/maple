The interaction between human zzso zzso and five zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and pregnancy zone zzso rat alpha zzso and alpha zzso and rat alpha zzso 3) is zzso Complex formation involves specific limited zzso in the zzso bait regions, zzso of the internal zzso zzso zzso zzso changes and zzso complex zzso For human alpha zzso and rat alpha zzso and alpha zzso it is estimated that the overall rate constant of complex formation is greater than zzso zzso while it is much lower for human pregnancy zone protein and rat alpha zzso zzso More than zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso The identification of the sites of specific limited zzso in the bait regions of the five zzso shows that zzso may take place in sequences that are not related to those identified earlier in the zzso These results greatly expand the repertoire of sequences known to be zzso by zzso zzso and suggest that this zzso has a primary zzso specificity resembling that of the microbial zzso zzso as it zzso zzso at the zzso side of large zzso zzso In addition, the results highlight the unique structure of the flexible zzso bait region in that it can accommodate a zzso required by the highly restrictive zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso may play an important role in locally controlling the activity of zzso and perhaps other zzso of the zzso zzso
