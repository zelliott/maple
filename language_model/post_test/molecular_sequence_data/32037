zzso zzso are zzso predatory bacteria that grow within zzso zzso using zzso to invade their zzso zzso They also grow zzso on organic nutrients after undergoing a zzso zzso The nature of the growth switching mechanism has been zzso but several independent reports suggested zzso in the hit zzso locus on the zzso zzso were associated with the transition to zzso zzso zzso are essential for prey entry by zzso and sequence analysis of the hit locus predicted that it was part of a cluster of Type zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso In this study we have deleted the whole zzso zzso which is unique to zzso and compared its zzso to strains containing spontaneous zzso in zzso and the common natural 42 zzso deletion zzso of zzso We find that deletion of the whole zzso gene greatly reduced the zzso of zzso whereas the 42 zzso deletion caused greater zzso zzso than zzso The zzso isolated from these strains were comprised of the Type zzso zzso zzso zzso Attempts to similarly delete gene zzso which like zzso encodes a zzso zzso were not successful, suggesting that it is likely to be essential for zzso viability in any growth zzso zzso has a sugar binding zzso repeat motif and an zzso with a putative zzso fold and was found to interact directly with zzso These results lead us to propose that the zzso interaction regulates zzso production in zzso zzso by interaction with the zzso zzso at the cell zzso and that the presence (and possibly zzso zzso of the zzso feeds back to alter the growth state of the zzso zzso We further identify a novel small zzso zzso by the hit zzso the zzso of which is altered in different zzso zzso zzso
