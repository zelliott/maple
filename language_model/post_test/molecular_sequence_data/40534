The zzso to, and pathology induced by, zzso zzso infection in zzso sheep zzso and domestic sheep zzso are distinctly zzso zzso sheep are particularly susceptible to pneumonia caused by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in infected zzso are more severe than those in zzso The molecular basis for this disparity has not been zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso of multiple lung diseases of humans and zzso It is possible that the enhanced pathology observed in the zzso lungs of zzso zzso zzso in comparison to that of zzso is due to comparatively higher levels of zzso zzso expression in zzso As the first step towards zzso this concept, we have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso consists of zzso zzso and zzso base pairs zzso zzso 101, and 234 zzso zzso zzso The availability of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso should facilitate the zzso of the role of these zzso in the differential pathology induced by zzso zzso infection in zzso and zzso
