We have cloned and characterized the first zzso member of the zzso gene family, zzso from zzso of the Northern sea star, zzso zzso zzso We have used an zzso that is complementary to the virtually zzso zzso zzso zzso box A in the second zzso and a zzso library constructed from zzso active zzso Relatives of this zzso existed approximately 100 million years prior to the origin of the earliest known zzso for which zzso sequence is currently available (the zzso Nonetheless, our zzso encodes a protein with approximately zzso zzso acid identity and zzso overall conservation to human zzso zzso of substantially higher conservation zzso zzso in order to the zzso zzso zzso A, B and zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso basic zzso and zzso zzso in the second and third zzso of human zzso Sea star zzso zzso detects a zzso transcript on Northern blots of monthly samples of zzso tissue from zzso individuals zzso zzso zzso indicating peak expression during active zzso This is also the first example of seasonal variation in expression of zzso during zzso in laboratory or natural populations of any zzso It is intriguing to speculate about the potential zzso character of zzso in this zzso in which tumors have not yet been observed, and about the possibility that zzso is more widely present in zzso than has been zzso
