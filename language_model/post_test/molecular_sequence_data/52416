DNA sequence analysis of class II zzso from Caucasian and black patients with type 1 zzso diabetes zzso has suggested that zzso acid at position 57 zzso zzso of the zzso beta chain provides protection against zzso diabetes zzso zzso In contrast, most Japanese patients with zzso have zzso zzso zzso To determine the reason for the differences and to zzso the zzso zzso gene in Japanese, we studied the zzso and zzso genes of Japanese patients with zzso and control subjects by the zzso chain reaction in combination with restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso were zzso zzso was associated zzso with zzso The zzso zzso which is associated positively with zzso in Japanese, was associated with zzso and zzso indicating that the Japanese zzso zzso is the same as that in zzso but different from that in zzso Of the zzso on Japanese zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed the highest association with zzso zzso was also positively associated with zzso Since zzso is identical to zzso except that it contains zzso 57, the data suggests that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso when the whole zzso of the zzso beta chain is similar to other susceptible zzso beta zzso zzso appears to be a marker of zzso in all these zzso Japanese, zzso and zzso
