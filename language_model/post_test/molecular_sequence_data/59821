Banana is one of the most important zzso fruit zzso zzso improvement by traditional breeding strategies is difficult and better knowledge of zzso structure is zzso zzso sequences are powerful markers for genetic zzso The method proposed here to determine the copy number of nuclear repetitive elements is based on competitive reverse zzso chain reaction and can also be used for zzso zzso zzso The reliability of this method was investigated on crude preparations of total zzso Variations due to the zzso of crude DNA extracts showed that a single locus reference is needed for accurate zzso A mapped zzso locus was used to zzso copy number zzso Copy number zzso of repetitive elements using this method clearly zzso between the two banana subspecies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two repetitive sequence families, zzso and zzso were zzso that cover up to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Their copy number varied up to six fold between the two zzso Furthermore, sequence zzso showed that zzso zzso are present in crude zzso banana DNA at up to 40 copies per zzso
