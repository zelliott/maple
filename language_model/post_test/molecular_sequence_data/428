The zzso zzso zzso zzso attach zzso acids to their corresponding zzso acid adapter zzso zzso The interactions in the zzso complexes are mostly zzso and largely zzso zzso a way of zzso mutual adaptation throughout evolution offers a clearer view of understanding how zzso systems preserve patterns of zzso recognition and zzso In this study, we used the zzso zzso analysis to explore adaptation of zzso in respond to random zzso that can occur in the zzso zzso We showed that the frequency of zzso zzso among zzso that belong to the recognition region is zzso higher than that of the exposed zzso The highest zzso of zzso zzso are observed for pairs of charged zzso wherein one zzso is located within the zzso area, while the second is placed outside of the area, and contributes to the formation of the zzso zzso zzso Given charged zzso are compensated by buried charge zzso in more than zzso of the analyzed zzso The zzso and zzso zzso preserve similar patterns of zzso zzso in the zzso recognition zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso demonstrate a significant increase in the frequency of zzso zzso in the zzso Our findings shed light on the physical nature of zzso zzso in zzso thereby keeping unchanged zzso zzso
