The study was conducted to investigate the molecular epidemiology of zzso zzso from western zzso A total of 830 zzso specimens were collected during July zzso 2007 from children, zzso or zzso years of age suffering from acute zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso All the specimens were subjected to zzso sequencing and zzso analysis for detection and characterization of zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso varied between zzso and zzso in different cities with the predominance of zzso zzso zzso infections were very common in the patients zzso or zzso years of zzso A majority zzso of the patients suffered from severe disease, however, vomiting was not experienced in zzso zzso with zzso were found in zzso zzso Summer month zzso supported zzso infections in western zzso The zzso analysis of partial zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes identified 2 zzso zzso 2 and zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genetic clusters with possible occurrence of zzso zzso of zzso Six different combinations of zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso zzso prevailed in zzso while the predominance of probable zzso zzso strains zzso was noted in zzso with the contribution of zzso at zzso zzso zzso type identified in 37% infections in zzso was completely replaced by zzso type in zzso This is the first report that highlights the zzso epidemiology and strain diversity demonstrating possible circulation of new zzso in patients with acute zzso from western zzso
