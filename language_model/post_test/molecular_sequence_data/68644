The zzso properties of seven overlapping zzso 9 to 16 zzso long, that comprise the entire primary structure of bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso have been characterized by circular zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic zzso The peptides are largely zzso although apparently with somewhat different average zzso zzso of the zzso zzso similar to those indicated by methods to predict secondary zzso zzso zzso appears to be approximately the sum of the individual zzso Several local interactions involving aromatic rings of zzso interacting with groups nearby in the primary structure have been identified and verified by replacing the responsible zzso The roles of these interactions in folding of reduced zzso could be determined, as the zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance properties of all the major zzso zzso are zzso Two of these local interactions contribute to the folding process and to stability of the fully folded zzso whereas the other two do zzso
