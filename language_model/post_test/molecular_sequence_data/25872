The zzso gene is the major negative regulatory gene in the nitrogen control circuit of zzso zzso which, together with positive regulatory zzso zzso the expression of multiple zzso structural genes of the zzso zzso functional zzso of the zzso protein were investigated by zzso analyses using three different zzso First, the zzso chain reaction was used to clone the zzso locus from two conventional zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso were zzso A single point zzso was shown to be responsible for the zzso zzso in each of these zzso The zzso zzso contains a nonsense zzso and in the zzso zzso an zzso has been zzso for zzso at zzso zzso Our second approach studied possible functionally important regions in the zzso gene by the use of zzso zzso The region containing the naturally occurring substitution in zzso appears to be essential for function whereas a region in the zzso part of the protein does not seem important for zzso zzso Finally, over 50% of the protein coding region was randomly zzso and zzso acid zzso that are essential for function and others that are functionally zzso were zzso
