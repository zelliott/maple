The zzso is a zzso zzso zzso associated with de zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we report the molecular definition of this zzso aberration in four zzso zzso cloning showed the consistent zzso of the zzso gene on zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso The zzso targets the zzso gene on zzso a member of the zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso In zzso and zzso the zzso zzso occurred within two zzso of each gene and the two genes merged zzso to produce the zzso transcripts characteristic of this zzso Although two zzso zzso products, zzso and zzso were predicted, only zzso appears to be implicated in zzso zzso is predicted to be involved in zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a nuclear pore complex protein and a target of zzso zzso in acute zzso leukemia through the zzso zzso The predicted zzso fusion protein may promote zzso through zzso zzso transport of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso
