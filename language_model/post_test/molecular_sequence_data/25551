To assess the prevalence of zzso infection in the zzso tracts of women with normal zzso zzso a random series of 109 women was zzso using zzso a further zzso zzso and punch zzso taken from the zzso (in 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso The biopsy material was examined using routine zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with a zzso DNA probe cocktail zzso 6, 11, 16, zzso and the zzso chain reaction zzso to detect zzso zzso Changes consistent with zzso infection were seen in zzso zzso of the biopsy zzso Seven biopsy specimens zzso from seven different women were found to contain zzso DNA using zzso All of these zzso zzso were diagnosed as zzso characteristic zzso zzso six flat zzso and one zzso zzso Using zzso the zzso DNA detection rate was highest in the cervical biopsy specimens zzso and lowest zzso in the zzso biopsy zzso A total of zzso of the 93 biopsy specimens studied using zzso contained zzso zzso The zzso type was zzso 11 zzso followed by zzso 18 zzso Four of the nine biopsy specimens zzso from zzso normal areas proved zzso zzso using zzso Of 17 biopsy specimens in which the zzso was normal, seven were examined using zzso and three were zzso The discovery of zzso DNA using zzso in zzso of the biopsy specimens zzso which had been found to be zzso zzso when routine zzso was used is zzso The results suggest that the light zzso criteria currently used in diagnosing zzso infections are of no value in predicting zzso zzso infections and that zzso zzso is unable to distinguish between zzso and zzso infections on the one hand and changes unrelated to zzso on the zzso
