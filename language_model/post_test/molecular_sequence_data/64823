The aim of this work was to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso surface molecules zzso attachment to zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells with an zzso zzso zzso cell wall extract led to the recognition of zzso factor Tu zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso at the surface of zzso was confirmed by analysis of zzso outer surface protein extract by zzso experiments, by electron zzso and by zzso zzso zzso of live zzso Furthermore, tandem mass zzso analysis proved that zzso was expressed at the zzso surface as an intact zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to determine that its binding to zzso cells and to zzso is pH zzso Competition experiments suggested that zzso has an important role in zzso zzso binding zzso In addition, zzso studies performed on zzso cells showed that zzso zzso protein can induce a zzso response in the presence of soluble zzso Our in zzso results indicate that zzso through its binding to the zzso zzso might participate in gut zzso
