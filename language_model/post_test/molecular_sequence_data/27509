Many techniques have been developed for studying zzso gene zzso but all of them are zzso systems consisting of zzso elements at the DNA or zzso level, zzso regulator proteins and/or small molecules as zzso zzso zzso are the only known zzso regulators of gene zzso They consist of a zzso secondary structure in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso which contains the zzso zzso The zzso site can be masked or unmasked by a simple temperature shift, thereby zzso or inducing zzso Recently, we and others have designed synthetic zzso zzso that are considerably simpler than naturally occurring zzso and can be exploited as convenient zzso switches of gene zzso In this zzso we describe the construction and use of synthetic zzso zzso We provide guidelines for the in zzso design of zzso zzso leaders and for their experimental testing and zzso the entire procedure can be completed in 2-3 zzso
