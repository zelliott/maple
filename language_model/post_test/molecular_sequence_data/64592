In zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso focuses mainly on gene discovery and functional zzso The search for regulatory elements contained within these zzso sequences is often based on prior knowledge of other zzso elements or on learning zzso of zzso determined data, potentially leading to a biased prediction zzso The zzso In zzso Regulatory zzso zzso program is a zzso program in Visual zzso It performs an zzso zzso search on zzso zzso sequences to uncover and extract zzso alignments hinting at regulatory elements contained within these zzso in a deterministic manner without any prior experimental or zzso zzso 

The zzso program was tested on known zzso zzso with zzso verified regulatory zzso zzso was able to extract zzso regulatory sequences correctly for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based solely on the zzso zzso For 11 zzso new predictions of zzso zzso putative regulatory elements were made, further corroborating this zzso
