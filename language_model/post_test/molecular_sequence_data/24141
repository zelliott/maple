zzso constitutes the zzso 20,000 Da zzso zzso of collagen zzso and has been shown to possess zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated the role of the zzso sites in the in zzso mechanism of action of zzso The majority of the zzso binding is zzso by zzso zzso in zzso but there is also a minor site constituted by zzso zzso Using zzso zzso lacking either of these two sites, we show that zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso in the chicken zzso membrane requires both zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of vascular zzso growth zzso zzso membrane zzso by zzso was only dependent on the minor zzso site zzso These zzso were also required for zzso to inhibit zzso growth zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso zzso of primary zzso zzso Moreover, we show that a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of human zzso (which covers the minor zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and reduces tumor zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso effects of the zzso These data show an essential role for zzso binding in the zzso action of zzso
