Definition of the zzso mechanisms involved in protective immunity against zzso infections is crucial to the development of an effective zzso The induction of zzso and zzso zzso immune responses was studied in cats following vaccination with whole zzso zzso zzso virus zzso Cats were zzso by zzso with three doses of zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso cell line, zzso which is persistently infected with the zzso isolate of zzso zzso or zzso skin zzso either infected with zzso zzso zzso or zzso virus or zzso with zzso zzso peptides were used as targets in zzso release zzso zzso cells were fresh peripheral blood zzso zzso Following the third zzso all vaccinated zzso but none of the control cats zzso with zzso alone, had zzso zzso zzso zzso in their peripheral zzso Two cats also exhibited zzso zzso There was no recognition of either zzso skin zzso infected with zzso zzso virus or zzso target cells infected with zzso zzso virus, indicating the specificity and zzso nature of the zzso zzso zzso but not control zzso were protected from challenge with the zzso zzso isolate of zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso zzso response was performed using overlapping zzso acid peptides from the zzso zzso domain of zzso This response appeared to be directed at zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso which lie adjacent to a zzso within the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
