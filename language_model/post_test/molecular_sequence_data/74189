zzso zzso zzso stimulation enhances cell zzso via the zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso cell zzso follows a typical zzso zzso curve, that is, stimulation with low zzso of zzso enhances cell zzso whereas excess zzso stimulation does not enhance zzso So far, the zzso of the response at higher zzso zzso has not been zzso We report here that zzso interacts with the regulator of G protein signaling zzso zzso which is a zzso protein zzso for zzso G zzso in a concentration dependent zzso The zzso complex zzso at higher zzso zzso yet it was unaffected at low zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is involved in the concurrent decrease of cell zzso In zzso zzso cells, the decrease of cell zzso induced by high zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was not implicated in the zzso of the zzso Similar results were observed upon stimulation with the zzso form of zzso zzso which is an zzso zzso In conclusion, the suppressed response in cell zzso induced by excess zzso or zzso via zzso is regulated by zzso functioning through a mechanism that is independent of zzso zzso
