Many zzso zzso zzso have been identified in the coding region of the zzso zzso which encodes zzso type zzso These zzso are highly zzso 

The zzso zzso chain reaction zzso product containing the whole zzso coding region in three human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Turks zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso consisting of novel zzso were determined by sequencing cloned zzso and the zzso consisting of already reported zzso were zzso by free computer software zzso The functional significance of novel zzso by transient expression study was also zzso 

zzso zzso were found including seven novel zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso A, zzso zzso A, zzso zzso A, zzso zzso A, zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso zzso A transient expression study suggested that the zzso zzso A, zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso T zzso are zzso zzso 

This study identified 24 zzso in the zzso zzso of which 7 were zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were determined in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso composition of each population was similar to those of geographically closer zzso
