zzso degradation pathways of fuel zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have already been studied in some zzso However, many of the involved zzso are still unknown, and possible side reactions have not yet been zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain R8, we have now detected volatile zzso as zzso of the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alcohol zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was formed only during zzso zzso while the beta and gamma zzso of zzso were produced only during zzso zzso Both zzso alcohol degradation and zzso production were strictly oxygen zzso However, the relative contribution of the zzso reaction to total alcohol conversion increased with decreasing oxygen zzso In zzso experiments where the zzso oxygen content was adjusted to less than zzso more than 50% of the zzso was converted to zzso zzso formation from zzso was about zzso lower, reaching up to zzso alcohol turnover at low oxygen zzso It is likely that the putative zzso alcohol zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso iron zzso and found in all three strains tested, or an associated zzso step zzso the unusual elimination zzso This was also supported by the detection of zzso genes in zzso and zzso enrichment cultures obtained from two treatment ponds operating at zzso zzso The possible use of zzso formation as an zzso indicator of zzso fuel zzso zzso in contaminated aquifers is zzso
