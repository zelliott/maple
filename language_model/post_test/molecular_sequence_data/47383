The zzso zzso identified in zzso coli, encodes a zzso zzso zzso with high specificity for zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso base zzso and zzso mismatch zzso Genes zzso proteins with strong similarities to zzso have been found in every zzso zzso zzso to date, with the exception of zzso and zzso zzso Multiple genes zzso proteins similar to zzso are found in some zzso including zzso and zzso and in the zzso Among this divergent set of zzso seven zzso motifs zzso We demonstrate here that zzso acids within six of these motifs are essential for both the zzso and genetic functions of zzso coli zzso These motifs may define interactions with zzso zzso or zzso zzso A large family of proteins more zzso related to zzso is present in zzso zzso and zzso including a hypothetical protein in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a domain of putative zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso zzso Because these six zzso motifs are shared between zzso and zzso they may constitute an ancient zzso domain now found in all zzso of zzso
