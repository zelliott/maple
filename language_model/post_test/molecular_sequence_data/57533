The zzso protein zzso functions as a regulator of cell proliferation and in turn is regulated by zzso zzso zzso D1 and D3 can form complexes with zzso that resemble those formed by several viral zzso and are disrupted by the zzso zzso zzso and derived zzso These zzso contain a sequence motif similar to the zzso zzso region II motif of the viral zzso zzso of this motif in zzso D1 prevents formation of zzso zzso complexes while enhancing the biological activity of zzso D1 zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso D1 and D3 interact with zzso in a fashion distinct from zzso A and zzso which can induce zzso zzso and that zzso D1 activity may be regulated by its association with zzso
