The human zzso and other zzso sequencing projects have generated huge amounts of protein sequence zzso Recently, a structural zzso project that aims to determine at least one representative three-dimensional structure from every protein family zzso has been zzso zzso modeling will play an essential role in structure based drug design such as in zzso zzso because based on these representative structures the three-dimensional structures of the remaining proteins zzso in the various zzso can be predicted by zzso zzso The results of the last Critical Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the quality of zzso modeling prediction has zzso reaching a level of reliability that biologists can now confidently use zzso zzso With improvements in modeling software and the growing number of known protein structures, zzso modeling is becoming a more and more powerful and reliable zzso The present paper discusses the features and roles of zzso modeling in structure based drug design, and describes the zzso and zzso modeling systems as zzso For a sample application, zzso modeling of zzso proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso coronavirus is zzso Many biological functions involve formation of zzso zzso in which the protein molecules behave zzso in the course of zzso zzso an understanding of zzso interaction will be very important for structure based drug zzso To this end, normal mode analysis is zzso The present paper discusses the prediction of zzso interaction using normal mode analysis and examples of applications are zzso
