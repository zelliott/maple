The zzso zzso zzso encodes three proteins that display similarities with human zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso and zzso The three zzso proteins have been named zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso forms are active as zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso and as zzso acid zzso while they are not active against the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso activity is also zzso in zzso cell zzso The zzso activity characteristics of the zzso proteins contrast with those of another zzso zzso zzso The latter is active against zzso and also displays zzso zzso activity against organic zzso such as zzso zzso but is not active as a zzso zzso Analysis of point zzso derived from zzso zzso indicates that, among the three zzso zzso of the zzso only the zzso at position 46 is required for the zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso acts through a zzso zzso zzso the active site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the proposed zzso active site containing zzso allows zzso to retain some activity against zzso Therefore the zzso adjacent to the respective active zzso zzso in zzso and zzso are important zzso for the zzso zzso activity against small zzso zzso
