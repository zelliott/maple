zzso stimulates zzso of the human zzso hormone zzso gene in zzso zzso Combined treatment with zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso response elements zzso in the zzso zzso sequence mediate the effect of zzso In this report, we show that the zzso can also mediate the synergistic effect of zzso zzso In addition to serving as an zzso zzso element, the two zzso act zzso to increase zzso zzso We now provide direct evidence via equilibrium binding studies that tandem zzso bind their zzso factors zzso However, the level of zzso is insufficient to explain the high degree of zzso zzso suggesting that another element in the zzso promoter may be required for complete zzso In support of this hypothesis, we show that zzso is drastically reduced when the zzso are removed from the context of their native promoter and linked to a zzso zzso Thus, amplification of the zzso signal zzso by the tandem zzso occurs through at least three distinct zzso First, at the level of signal zzso by convergence of the A- and zzso zzso second, through zzso interactions of zzso factors binding to tandem zzso and finally through zzso interaction of the two zzso with another, as yet, undefined zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso
