zzso a gene that codes for an zzso zzso is present only in zzso zzso strains that are associated with severe forms of zzso disease zzso I zzso We found that the genetic locus that contains zzso zzso is part of a zzso DNA zzso that likely was acquired zzso and integrated into the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso island is flanked by direct repeats of 31 zzso In some zzso zzso is split into a right segment zzso and a left segment zzso by a novel zzso sequence zzso In a minority of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are separated by an intervening zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso base pairs that form the zzso region and the extreme 3' end of the zzso region reveals the presence of 19 zzso that code for proteins predicted to be mostly membrane associated with one gene zzso which is similar to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso and the transport systems required for zzso transfer, including the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso of several of the zzso genes zzso induction of zzso expression in gastric zzso cell zzso Thus, we believe the zzso region may zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso system for the export of zzso zzso
