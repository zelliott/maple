The zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso contains six open reading zzso zzso six hypothetical zzso Five of these zzso in the zzso zzso delta zzso make up the zzso zzso zzso complex similarly in bacteria, zzso and zzso The sixth gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows very little sequence zzso to any protein of known structure or zzso The gene has previously been zzso the product (called zzso has been zzso expressed in zzso coli, and zzso to high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Benito, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso of the protein zzso corresponding to the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 255 zzso zzso We have solved the X-ray crystal structure and refined a model of zzso to atomic zzso Here we present the crystal structures of zzso and the complex of zzso with zzso and zzso and show that it has extensive structural similarity to zzso zzso zzso This is the first structure determined from a new group of zzso related bacterial proteins of at least six zzso They share the identical zzso acids that bind zzso and a zzso of zzso acids in the putative zzso zzso
