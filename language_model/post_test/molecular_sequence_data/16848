A number of zzso bacteria, and bacterial toxins can only act on cells that express the appropriate zzso zzso on the outer surface of their plasma zzso An example of this dependency is provided by zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso junction by catalyzing zzso of a zzso zzso thereby inducing a zzso zzso zzso components of zzso forms of zzso mediate its adherence to zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells while the cellular activity of most isolated zzso requires the presence of certain zzso especially those of the zzso zzso This review discusses available information about the identity and the roles of zzso in the activity of zzso Observations that zzso zzso of zzso require zzso for optimum activity zzso G apparently does not), permits the hypothesis that it should be possible to develop an zzso of this interaction thereby zzso its zzso
