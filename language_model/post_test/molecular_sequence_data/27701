zzso peptides corresponding to sequences zzso and zzso of mouse zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as competitors in a variety of T cell zzso The zzso according to their binding specificity for major zzso complex zzso were expected to inhibit T cell responses restricted to zzso but not those restricted to zzso zzso zzso In competition experiments with T cell zzso the poor zzso zzso zzso required zzso to zzso higher competitor zzso than the good zzso zzso zzso to achieve 50% zzso of zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso state of zzso mice to zzso zzso zzso could be overcome by increasing the zzso dose, and zzso T cell responses to different zzso in association with a variety of class II zzso molecules could be blocked by the mouse zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the capability of some and failure of other zzso molecules to bind certain peptides appeared zzso rather than of an all or none nature, in these experimental zzso The zzso of zzso T cell lines to zzso competitors was found to decrease with zzso Lines maintained by repeated zzso with zzso and zzso but without zzso zzso 2, acquired resistance within zzso In contrast, T cell clones retained their zzso to zzso competitors over a long period of zzso The latter data raise the possibility that a competition between ubiquitous zzso peptides and foreign zzso may result in the selection of T cells that have high zzso for the zzso zzso complex, and are thus relatively resistant to competition at the level of zzso zzso
