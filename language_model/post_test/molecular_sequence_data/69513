We have previously described the zzso of an abundant zzso protein zzso that binds specifically to zzso leaders of zzso zzso in zzso zzso consists of two zzso with zzso of 40 and 39 zzso Limited sequence analysis of zzso identifies it as the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso activities are specifically lost in cells containing disruptions in either zzso or zzso the nuclear genes zzso the two zzso of the zzso thus zzso identifying zzso as zzso and showing that both activities are dependent on the simultaneous presence of both zzso Although we still must ascertain whether and how either function of zzso is regulated and whether the two functions are compatible or mutually zzso this combination of zzso activity and zzso in a single protein may be part of a general regulatory circuit linking the need for zzso function to zzso zzso
