H5N1 highly zzso avian influenza virus has been endemic in poultry in Egypt since 2008, notwithstanding the zzso of mass vaccination and zzso of infected zzso zzso circulation of the virus has resulted in a progressive genetic evolution and an zzso zzso In poultry, the occurrence of zzso drift in avian influenza viruses is less well documented and the mechanisms remain to be zzso To test the hypothesis that H5N1 zzso drift is driven by mechanisms similar to type A influenza viruses in humans, we generated zzso zzso by reverse zzso that zzso molecular changes identified in genetically divergent viruses circulating in the vaccinated zzso zzso and zzso zzso viruses were zzso analyzed by zzso zzso zzso test and zzso zzso zzso The results of the study indicate that the zzso drift of H5N1 in poultry is driven by multiple zzso primarily occurring in major zzso sites at the zzso binding zzso similarly to what has been described for human influenza zzso and zzso zzso zzso
