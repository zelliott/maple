We studied the functional significance of a region of the zzso hormone zzso zzso binding domain which is zzso in all members of the zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso has been implicated in the binding of heat shock protein 90, and deletions of the zzso zzso that include this region result in zzso zzso Both deletion and point zzso were made in this area of the rat beta 1 zzso hormone zzso zzso acids zzso and the functional consequences of these zzso were analyzed in zzso cells by transient zzso along with a zzso responsive reporter zzso All zzso studied resulted in significant zzso of zzso zzso regulation without inducing significant zzso zzso For some zzso the lack of zzso response correlated with a diminished ability to bind zzso However, point zzso of zzso acids zzso zzso and 300 resulted in impaired zzso regulation despite wild type zzso binding zzso In addition, zzso of these three zzso acids failed to impair zzso of the zzso to the nucleus or binding to DNA in zzso zzso of plasmids expressing the wild type and zzso zzso zzso proteins resulted in zzso of the wild type zzso zzso zzso We conclude that this region of the rat beta 1 zzso zzso is essential for full zzso activity, but this is not due to a role in zzso zzso DNA zzso or nuclear zzso We zzso that nuclear factors may need to bind to this region for full zzso zzso
