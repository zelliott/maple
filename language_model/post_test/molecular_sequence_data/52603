The zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as the zzso for the inner zzso particle zzso which buds into the zzso of the zzso zzso during virus zzso The structure of the zzso domain of zzso from zzso strain zzso has been investigated by using limited zzso and mass zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso region that is 28 zzso acids zzso The minimal sequence requirements for zzso function have been defined by constructing zzso with zzso zzso and assessing their ability to bind zzso These experiments demonstrate that 17 to 20 zzso acids from the extreme C zzso are necessary and sufficient for zzso binding and that this binding is zzso These observations are consistent with a model for the structure of the zzso zzso region in which four flexible regions of 28 zzso acids are presented by a zzso zzso zzso domain, with only the last approximately 20 zzso acids of each zzso interacting with the surface binding sites on the zzso
