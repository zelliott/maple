zzso express two zzso for zzso of zzso which is responsible for zzso of the vast majority of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which uses the dedicated zzso zzso However, targets and zzso for zzso are zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso functions with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to degrade the zzso rule zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso functions in the zzso in parallel with the zzso zzso which promotes turnover of nuclear zzso proteins and an apparently zzso distinct pool of zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso discharge from, and zzso zzso by, both zzso and zzso in zzso This work provides insight into the machinery employed by the zzso cascade to promote protein turnover and suggests that the zzso and zzso pathways can function in parallel with the same zzso to degrade the same targets in a zzso distinct zzso
