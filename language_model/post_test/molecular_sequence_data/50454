zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso Following conventional column zzso the zzso was zzso zzso to near zzso with a specific activity of 20 zzso This zzso zzso preparation migrated as a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 35 zzso on zzso and 39 zzso on gel zzso As in zzso the zzso zzso required CO2 for zzso zzso of CO2 from the reaction mixture completely abolished the zzso activity, while zzso atmospheric CO2 zzso zzso in the zzso gave zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed an absolute requirement for zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso reaction was zzso zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + CO2 + zzso + 2 zzso A zzso zzso was raised against a synthetic zzso zzso whose sequence was deduced from the apple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Olson, zzso Silverstone, zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1992) Plant zzso 98, zzso which is zzso to tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso On a Western zzso this zzso specifically recognized the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of the zzso zzso agreed well with that deduced from the zzso zzso When the protein was zzso with zzso and one of the zzso fragments was isolated and zzso for 20 cycles, its sequence zzso precisely matched that predicted from zzso zzso zzso When zzso apple fruit was treated with zzso a parallel increase in in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso activities was observed, and this increase was accompanied by a zzso increase in the level of zzso zzso These observations support the conclusion that the isolated zzso zzso protein is zzso by zzso
