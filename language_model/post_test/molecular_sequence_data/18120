During the synthesis of fatty acids and their zzso in zzso fatty zzso zzso are linked to zzso carrier protein zzso In contrast to previously cloned zzso zzso zzso we have now isolated a zzso clone for a potentially zzso zzso zzso from a spinach root zzso zzso between the zzso acid sequence zzso by this zzso and zzso sequence data for zzso protein from spinach leaf indicates that the root zzso encodes zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence for zzso shows zzso identity with spinach leaf zzso Southern analysis suggests that multiple zzso genes or zzso occur in the spinach zzso zzso northern zzso analysis and zzso protection studies confirm that, within the region zzso the mature zzso the cloned zzso sequence is expressed in leaves and seeds as well as in zzso zzso zzso protection data indicate that the ratio of zzso and zzso zzso sequences in leaf is similar to the ratio of the two zzso
