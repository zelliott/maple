All affected patients in four families with zzso dominant familial zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso in their red cell zzso zzso band 3 zzso zzso zzso and these zzso were not found in any of the nine normal family members zzso The zzso zzso His was present in two families, while zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes were found in the other zzso zzso studies confirmed the zzso of the disease with a genetic marker close to zzso The affected individuals with the zzso zzso had reduced red cell zzso transport and altered zzso of the red cell band 3 zzso zzso The red cells of individuals with the zzso zzso zzso had markedly increased red cell zzso transport but almost normal red cell zzso zzso The zzso and kidney zzso of the zzso band 3 proteins were expressed in zzso zzso and all showed significant zzso transport zzso We conclude that zzso inherited zzso is associated with zzso in band 3; but both the disease and its zzso dominant inheritance are not related simply to the zzso transport activity of the zzso zzso
