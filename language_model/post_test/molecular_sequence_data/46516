We surveyed zzso diversity at two candidate genes zzso and zzso involved in an zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, in two closely related tomato species zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our six population samples (three for each zzso cover a range of zzso to very dry zzso The zzso zzso plays an important role in the plants' response to drought zzso zzso is an upstream gene involved in zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso gene positioned downstream in the zzso The two genes show very different patterns of zzso zzso zzso exhibits very low zzso diversity relative to the eight neutral reference zzso that were previously surveyed in these zzso This suggests that strong zzso selection has been acting on this zzso In contrast, zzso exhibits higher levels of zzso diversity and, in particular in zzso higher genetic differentiation between populations than the reference zzso which is indicative of local zzso In the more zzso species zzso one population (from zzso shows a significant zzso structure, which appears to be the result of positive zzso zzso
