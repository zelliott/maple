To investigate the genetic basis of differing zzso in the closely related species zzso zzso and zzso zzso which replace one another along a zzso zzso we characterized the zzso gene cluster in multiple strains of both zzso In both species, all zzso copies cluster in a single zzso zzso zzso and each cluster includes two zzso genes arranged as an zzso pair, the ancestral zzso The total number of zzso copies is zzso seven in the more zzso zzso zzso and five in the less tolerant zzso zzso with some strains of each species exhibiting lower copy zzso Thus, maximum zzso copy number zzso to zzso zzso and zzso protein levels reported previously and the size of zzso zzso at zzso The zzso sequence and spacing of the zzso copies are consistent with tandem zzso of the zzso genes in a common zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by loss of zzso genes in zzso zzso These and other data for zzso in zzso suggest that evolutionary adaptation has repeatedly modified zzso copy number by several different genetic zzso
