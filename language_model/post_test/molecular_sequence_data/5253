To investigate the role of alpha zzso in protein zzso we compared energy characteristics of alpha zzso from zzso and zzso proteins belonging to four protein families of known three-dimensional structure, for at least one member of each zzso The changes in intrinsic free energy of zzso formation were estimated using the statistical mechanical theory for describing zzso transitions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso 1994; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on known sequences of zzso and zzso zzso proteins we found that zzso a high stability of alpha zzso is necessary but is not a sufficient condition for zzso of zzso zzso zzso the total zzso stability, rather than that of individual zzso is the factor determining protein zzso and zzso two zzso of zzso zzso the intrinsic zzso zzso of zzso acids and the side zzso chain zzso are the main contributors to protein zzso Similar analysis applied to families of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso led us to conclude that an enhanced total stability of alpha zzso is a general feature of many zzso zzso The magnitude of the observed decrease in intrinsic free energy on zzso formation of several zzso proteins was found to be sufficient to explain the zzso determined increase of their zzso Free energies of zzso interactions of different zzso proteins calculated at three temperatures that are thought to be close to its normal environmental conditions were found to be approximately zzso This indicates that certain flexibility of zzso protein structure is an essential factor for protein zzso All zzso proteins analyzed fell into three zzso classes of similar zzso stability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These classes were consistent with the natural origin of the zzso Based on the sequences of protein alpha zzso with zzso arrangement of stabilizing zzso a natural reserve of zzso protein zzso was estimated to be sufficient for zzso stability of the protein at nearly 200 degrees zzso
