Two zzso zzso zzso degrading bacteria, strains zzso and zzso were identified as strains of the species zzso zzso belonging to the zzso a zzso of the order zzso Both showed characteristic growth and degradation of zzso rubber as described previously for the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For strain zzso the zzso properties were investigated, and zzso zzso experiments with the type strain revealed the affiliation to the species zzso zzso The comparison of the zzso zzso zzso and especially zzso variable regions of these, led to the zzso of strain zzso to the same zzso At present, the species zzso zzso comprises three different zzso which share the ability to degrade zzso rubber zzso but which were obtained from different geographic zzso
