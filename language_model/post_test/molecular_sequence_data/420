Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in the zzso flank of zzso gene that are associated with osteoporosis but the underlying mechanism is zzso Here we investigated the functional effects of these zzso on zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher with the zzso zzso zzso compared with the common zzso zzso zzso shift zzso showed that the region surrounding the zzso zzso recognized a complex of proteins essential for zzso differentiation and function including zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso had increased binding affinity for this zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the region zzso zzso bound a complex of proteins including zzso and zzso and also showed evidence of recruitment of zzso to the zzso binding site in zzso zzso Further studies showed that zzso zzso had higher binding affinity for zzso zzso II, consistent with increased zzso of the zzso zzso and there was a significant inverse association between carriage of zzso and bone mineral density zzso in a cohort of zzso Caucasian zzso We conclude that common zzso zzso in the zzso flank of zzso regulate zzso by affecting zzso interactions and that increased levels of zzso correlate with reduced zzso values in zzso This is consistent with a model zzso increased zzso zzso zzso to zzso probably by increasing production of the alpha 1 chain and zzso the normal ratio of collagen type 1 alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso
