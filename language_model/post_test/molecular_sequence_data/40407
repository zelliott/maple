zzso peptides termed as genetically engineered zzso for zzso zzso are small zzso sequences selected via zzso zzso protocols of zzso or cell surface display zzso Recent advances in zzso and molecular biology allow the engineering of these peptides with specific affinity to zzso often used as molecular zzso or zzso to facilitate materials zzso which provides a new insight into the material science and engineering zzso As a case study on this zzso application, here we report a novel zzso zzso binding protein and its application in promoting zzso materials zzso In brief, the gene zzso a zzso binding zzso was genetically fused with zzso and zzso using zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein zzso was zzso zzso with zzso system, identified by zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis and confirmed by liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test demonstrated that the fusion protein had a specific zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso synthesis experiment indicated that the new protein played a promoting part in grain refinement and accelerated zzso during the formation of the zzso precursor zzso in the zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso analysis on the final products after zzso the precursor zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Our work suggested a novel approach to the application about the zzso zzso
