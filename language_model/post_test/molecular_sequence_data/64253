zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso gene containing two zzso We have investigated the utility of the second zzso of zzso zzso as a tool for zzso reconstruction at lower zzso zzso As an example, the zzso of 46 zzso two zzso and four zzso species is reconstructed using maximum zzso and maximum likelihood analyses of zzso zzso We designed new zzso based on zzso sequences of the second and third zzso for use in a range of zzso zzso to amplify and sequence the second zzso In zzso zzso proved to be rather short zzso zzso highly variable and zzso In all but two species a single amplification product was zzso zzso from zzso analysis of zzso are largely zzso with results using the zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso and compare favorably in percentage of zzso characters, overall zzso levels, number of zzso zzso in consensus trees and resolution of zzso relationships within zzso When amplification products are not too large, alignment is relatively straightforward, and sequences are used in combination with other fast evolving zzso the zzso zzso may be a valuable new tool for zzso studies at lower zzso zzso
