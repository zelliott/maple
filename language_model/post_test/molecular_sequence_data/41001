We have previously shown that a zzso complex formed by two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and U2 small nuclear zzso zzso can catalyze a zzso zzso reaction that depended on an zzso zzso region in zzso the zzso zzso Here we further analyze this zzso reaction and show that while the zzso and 3' zzso site zzso are juxtaposed and positioned near the zzso sequence in zzso the role of the zzso in the reaction is beyond mere juxtaposition of the zzso and likely involves the formation of a sophisticated active zzso Interestingly, the zzso reaction is metal dependent, as is the case with other known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reactions indicate metal binding by the zzso complex within the zzso zzso regions of zzso The above results, combined with the structural similarities between zzso and zzso critical zzso in group II zzso zzso suggest that the zzso complex of zzso and U2 zzso is a vestigial zzso and a likely descendant of a group zzso zzso zzso
