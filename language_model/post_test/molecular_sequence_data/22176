zzso zzso zzso transfers two reducing zzso derived from a hydride zzso of zzso via zzso and zzso to the large family of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso transfer zzso The mechanism of electron transfer by zzso zzso remains elusive and zzso Here, we determined the crystal structure of truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso which is functionally active toward its zzso zzso zzso zzso and discovered a second zzso binding site at the interface of the connecting and zzso binding zzso The two zzso binding sites have different zzso to the bulk zzso and different zzso acid zzso suggesting stabilization of different electronic structures of the reduced zzso Since only one zzso zzso is required for function, a hypothetical mechanism of electron transfer is discussed that proposes shuttling of a single zzso between these two sites coupled with the transition between two zzso forms, neutral zzso and zzso zzso
