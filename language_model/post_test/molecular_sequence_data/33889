zzso variation in zzso structure contributes to resource specialization and zzso but the genetic zzso that zzso zzso adaptation remain zzso Here we show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene are responsible for zzso variation in the shape of the lower jaw both within and among zzso of Lake Malawi zzso zzso The zzso derived zzso of zzso reduces the length of the zzso zzso process of the lower zzso a change predicted to increase speed of jaw rotation for improved zzso The alternate zzso is associated with a longer zzso and a more robustly zzso zzso typical of species that use a biting mode of zzso zzso with the most divergent feeding zzso are nearly fixed for different zzso zzso whereas species with intermediate zzso still segregate variation at zzso Thus, the same zzso that help to define zzso divergence among zzso also contribute to zzso zzso of zzso traits within some zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso has likely contributed to niche zzso and ecological zzso of these zzso
