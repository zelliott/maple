zzso genes in zzso zzso are arranged as a tightly clustered gene family consisting of seven related coding zzso devoid of zzso The two blood zzso members of this family, zzso and zzso were shown to play a crucial role in the breakdown of the blood meal zzso The role of zzso and zzso in the process of blood meal zzso remains to be zzso We have examined the zzso and the expression patterns of these zzso as well as the functional interactions in blood meal zzso between zzso and other zzso zzso Northern zzso and zzso analysis indicated that the genes zzso and zzso are all zzso expressed in zzso female zzso Soon after blood feeding the zzso of these zzso genes became zzso and appeared again at the end of the zzso zzso The blood zzso zzso zzso was also zzso expressed at low level in the gut of adult female zzso This zzso was the only member of this gene family to be expressed in the gut of male and female zzso By using zzso that specifically recognized zzso zzso we were able to show that the corresponding protein in zzso is zzso and stored in the gut zzso of zzso females as zzso zzso and zzso of this zzso was shown to occur in the zzso zzso immediately after fluid zzso and independently of the protein content of the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, with the exception of zzso and zzso were able to activate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus suggesting that blood meal zzso is able to trigger a cascade of events leading to the zzso of several zzso
