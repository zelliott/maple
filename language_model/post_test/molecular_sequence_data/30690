The zzso gene related zzso zzso gene is a complex zzso unit that is expressed in a highly restricted pattern in both the nervous system, particularly in sensory zzso and zzso and in the zzso C cells of the zzso system, with zzso alternative zzso processing events generating transcripts zzso either the hormone, zzso or the zzso zzso This pattern of expression in neural and zzso zzso raises the question whether similar or distinct zzso elements are responsible for zzso in both neural and zzso cell zzso We have identified a complex zzso element, located more than 1 zzso zzso of the zzso initiation site of the zzso gene that functions in cells of zzso or C cell origin, but not in any other cell type zzso At least two complementary regulatory sequences are required for the function of the zzso zzso
