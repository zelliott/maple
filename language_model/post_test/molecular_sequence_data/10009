zzso E zzso and certain peptides derived from it have been shown to exert zzso effects in zzso and zzso has been linked to the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso The mechanisms underlying these toxic and pathological effects are, however, not zzso To approach this question, we have studied the effects of zzso peptides on the zzso calcium zzso zzso of cultured cortical zzso A tandem zzso repeat zzso zzso derived from the zzso binding domain of zzso was found to have a potent effect on zzso of zzso zzso The zzso by which zzso exerted this effect was shown to involve both the zzso of zzso calcium and the influx of zzso zzso although the effect on influx was more zzso zzso zzso occurs via a zzso zzso C zzso pathway, whereas calcium influx appears to involve a novel zzso zzso Both the zzso and the influx of calcium require the binding of the zzso zzso to a membrane zzso because both pathways are blocked by zzso to zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that the zzso effects of zzso may be zzso by a persistent zzso of zzso
