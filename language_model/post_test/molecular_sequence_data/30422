Platinum compounds with the zzso zzso carrier zzso are of particular interest because cell lines that have developed resistance to platinum compounds in general often retain sensitivity to zzso compounds, suggesting that the zzso carrier zzso affects the formation, repair, or zzso of zzso zzso The effect of the zzso zzso on platinum zzso formation was assessed by using the zzso zzso of zzso treated to give equal amounts of zzso or zzso zzso The sites of zzso formation were mapped by zzso with zzso coli ABC zzso There were no significant effects of the zzso carrier zzso on the types or sites of platinum zzso zzso The effect of the zzso zzso on platinum zzso repair was determined by using synthetic zzso designed to have single, specific platinum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with either the zzso or zzso zzso carrier zzso These zzso differed significantly in their ability to serve as zzso for ABC zzso with zzso greater than or equal to G greater than AG greater than zzso The zzso carrier zzso had little effect on the recognition of AG and zzso zzso by ABC zzso but significantly improved the ability of ABC zzso to zzso G zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that if the carrier zzso has any effect on the repair of platinum zzso it is more likely to exert that effect on the repair of platinum zzso or zzso zzso rather than on the more abundant AG or zzso zzso zzso incorporation was used to zzso the rate of zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
