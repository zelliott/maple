Human zzso heavy chains are zzso by a highly complex zzso zzso which encompasses many zzso units, including nine alternative constant region zzso Much of the constant region gene cluster was duplicated during zzso zzso In zzso zzso is known to be regulated by multiple zzso including several enhancers 3' of the alpha zzso A constant region zzso CA, the last transcribed zzso zzso downstream of the two human CA zzso possibly containing zzso zzso zzso have not yet been zzso By long-range mapping of zzso DNA, a cluster of zzso rare restriction sites, representing a potential zzso island, was previously reported downstream of each CA zzso close to the 3' end of the duplicated zzso Such potential zzso islands are candidates for additional zzso regulatory zzso We isolated zzso clones containing these clusters of zzso restriction sites, which lie within short zzso zzso Some of these sites showed zzso zzso 3' of the zzso zzso zzso clones derived from the zzso zzso copy of the duplicated region, zzso in order, zzso zzso zzso a processed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso with the presumed 3' zzso copy of the duplicated region showed that similarity was lost exactly at the end of the zzso long terminal repeat zzso These results imply that an zzso zzso integration was present immediately 3' of zzso in the common zzso zzso and suggest models for the zzso of the zzso
