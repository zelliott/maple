The production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso organization and regulation of the zzso gene cluster encompassing 11 genes was zzso Two zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown by Northern zzso zzso extension experiments and zzso zzso confirmed three independent promoter sites preceding genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso initiated in zzso zzso zzso activities were reached at the transition to stationary growth and were zzso with zzso zzso The zzso activity was dependent on zzso with the zzso regulatory system zzso The presence of zzso was needed for efficient expression of all three promoter zzso zzso This suggests a zzso zzso according to a zzso mechanism with zzso as zzso and signal zzso via zzso Additionally, zzso expression was found to be under positive control of the alternative zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso H strongly decreased zzso zzso Full zzso production could be restored after zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the major zzso zzso transition state regulator zzso strongly increased zzso zzso These results show that the zzso zzso regulatory system, and hence zzso zzso and zzso is under dual control of two independent regulatory zzso zzso via zzso and zzso regulation via zzso factor zzso
