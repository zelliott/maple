The distinguishable zzso and yellow fluorescent proteins zzso and zzso enable the simultaneous in zzso zzso of different promoter zzso Here, we report new cloning zzso for the construction of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso By extending the zzso portions of previously described zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso production was zzso zzso the addition of sequences zzso the first eight zzso acids of the zzso part of zzso of zzso zzso overcomes the slow translation initiation that is provoked by the zzso zzso bias present in the original zzso and zzso zzso Using these new zzso we demonstrate that, within an zzso population of zzso zzso zzso cells, expression of the zzso and zzso genes is distinct in individual zzso
