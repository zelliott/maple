We have isolated five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from a patient with zzso to oxidized zzso zzso by zzso display zzso Analysis of their binding specificity revealed that all three beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with beta zzso while both zzso zzso zzso and zzso reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with beta zzso and zzso and showed comparable binding affinity to both zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso 10-6 M for beta zzso vs zzso zzso 10-6 M for zzso This clone may thus, define a zzso unknown shared zzso between beta zzso and zzso zzso analysis of all five clones showed significant zzso of the expressed zzso One rearranged zzso segment was repeatedly employed by three clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, all three clones used different L zzso Of note, the pairing of zzso with the zzso L chain in zzso zzso resulted in the loss of binding to beta zzso and specific zzso to zzso Together, these data suggest that while the zzso chain may be important in the binding to beta zzso pairing with certain L chains may influence this zzso These data are the first human zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences zzso both represent the major zzso of zzso zzso present in zzso syndrome zzso
