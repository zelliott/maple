zzso zzso is an zzso zzso pathogen that is the zzso agent of Rocky Mountain spotted zzso To identify genes involved in the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of an zzso strain, zzso zzso Iowa, was zzso and compared to the zzso of the virulent strain zzso zzso Sheila zzso zzso zzso Iowa is zzso in a guinea pig model of infection and displays altered plaque zzso with decreased zzso of infected host zzso zzso of the two zzso revealed that zzso zzso Iowa and zzso zzso Sheila Smith share a high degree of sequence zzso A zzso alignment comparing zzso zzso Iowa to zzso zzso Sheila Smith revealed a total of 143 deletions for the two zzso A subsequent zzso zzso zzso analysis comparing Iowa to Sheila Smith revealed zzso zzso for the two zzso One of the deletions in zzso zzso Iowa zzso zzso zzso a major surface zzso zzso outer membrane protein A zzso and member of the zzso family, zzso zzso from the start of zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the absence of zzso from zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso Iowa is defective in the processing of zzso an zzso and also a major surface zzso of spotted fever group zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso in zzso processing are most likely factors that contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between the two strains do not significantly alter gene expression as analysis of zzso revealed only four differences in gene expression between zzso zzso Iowa and zzso zzso strain zzso Although zzso zzso Iowa does not cause apparent disease, infection of guinea pigs with this strain zzso protection against subsequent challenge with the virulent strain zzso zzso Sheila zzso
