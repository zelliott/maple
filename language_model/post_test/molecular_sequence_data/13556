In this paper we describe the molecular characterization of zzso the largest zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso region encompasses 6 zzso and encodes eight putative zzso seven of which were expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein is the only one carrying a signal zzso sequence at the zzso and is a putative zzso localized in the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins contain one and five putative zzso zzso respectively, and are most likely associated with the inner zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins show sequence similarity to putative components of different type III protein zzso pathways in zzso Examples include zzso proteins from other plant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso start site and the zzso promoter was zzso The minimal zzso promoter region of 90 zzso contains a novel sequence zzso the zzso which might play a role in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and possibly other zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso
