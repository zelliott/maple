zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso are generally believed to adopt some common secondary structural features: a zzso beta turn at one end of the cycle, and a type VI turn with a zzso zzso bond at the zzso A proposed zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso has been placed into a zzso zzso analog of zzso in order to zzso the putative zzso zzso zzso The final zzso was done by either chemical or zzso zzso The product, zzso ), was found to have zzso of the activity of zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso revealed that the backbone as well as side chain zzso and zzso were well zzso zzso zzso methods were used to extract distance restraints from the nuclear zzso effect zzso data set, and these were used in a systematic search of zzso space to identify structures consistent with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these structures using a number of different force fields produced structures having the expected beta zzso turn at zzso and a beta zzso turn in the zzso portion of the zzso The similarity of the minimized structures to those previously reported for zzso zzso zzso of zzso confirms the similarity of the zzso geometry to that of the zzso zzso in zzso
