We report the cloning and functional analysis of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of approximately 35 zzso with high zzso acid identities to zzso zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso zzso Members of the zzso family are zzso of the zzso zzso and have been implicated as positive zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells exhibited a zzso pattern of distribution throughout the zzso and nucleus, predominantly in the nuclear zzso a distribution consistent with that of the cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells caused a zzso stimulation in zzso zzso activity, as determined by a reporter gene zzso This effect was associated with a pronounced increase in the levels of cellular zzso In zzso degradation zzso further demonstrated that zzso specifically decreased the rate of zzso degradation in a dose dependent zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso and possibly other related zzso zzso function as positive zzso of zzso by increasing the stability of cellular zzso making elevated amounts of this protein available for zzso of zzso zzso
