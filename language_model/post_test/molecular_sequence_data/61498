The zzso negative regulators zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso transfer by blocking zzso zzso extension past a potential zzso zzso sequence zzso To identify potential target sites for negative regulation, we isolated and zzso 13 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the 3' end of zzso zzso showed that eight zzso mapped in the region zzso zzso zzso Four zzso were in the zzso promoter region and one was in zzso Three zzso in zzso greatly reduced the zzso level of this zzso but did not affect that of zzso However, both zzso zzso and zzso protein were reduced in three zzso promoter region zzso and the expression of zzso transcripts extending 3' from zzso became zzso zzso zzso could mediate its negative regulatory activity in the absence of zzso and this activity was not abolished by zzso the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso Based on the experimental data as well as computer analysis of predicted secondary structures of zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso we concluded that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso termination or degradation at zzso In cells lacking a zzso target zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso promoter, and this repression was relieved by addition of zzso zzso Thus, even though the synthesis of these negative regulators is zzso they each act independently on separate targets to regulate expression of zzso zzso
