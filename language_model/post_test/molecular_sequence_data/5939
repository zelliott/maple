We have investigated the usefulness of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso for the discovery of novel modes of drug resistance in human zzso In zzso zzso zzso of the essential zzso gene zzso zzso drug resistance through a zzso involving an zzso zzso factor zzso by zzso We have identified zzso a human zzso zzso that can substitute fully for zzso and induce zzso drug resistance in zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and ultraviolet light when zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a previously unidentified component of the human 26 S zzso a zzso complex that degrades proteins targeted for destruction by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso mechanism that determines cellular zzso to zzso agents, perhaps by influencing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
