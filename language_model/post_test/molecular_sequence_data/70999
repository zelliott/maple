zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso is a systemic disease of zzso zzso Variations in zzso and mortality have been observed during zzso at different geographical regions and in laboratory experiments with zzso from these different zzso This raises the possibility that zzso patterns of genetic variation might be a significant factor with this zzso To assess the genetic zzso the zzso zzso DNA, the internal transcribed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso DNA of zzso from 3 different hosts and 3 geographic origins were amplified using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of this analysis confirm that zzso zzso is a member of the gamma zzso of the zzso and show that the zzso form a tight zzso cluster with zzso zzso similarities ranging from zzso to zzso The ITS regions were 309 base pairs zzso did not contain zzso zzso and varied between zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene was zzso from 5 of the zzso yielding similarities ranging from zzso to zzso zzso trees were constructed based on the zzso zzso ITS and zzso zzso sequence data and zzso The trees were zzso similar, suggesting that the 3 types of molecules provided similar zzso zzso Five of the zzso are closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso ITS and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of one Chilean zzso zzso was unique, with zzso zzso similarities to the other zzso ranging from zzso to zzso the ITS from zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso
