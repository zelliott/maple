We have cloned two complementary zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso sensitive zzso carrier from rat liver by direct full-length rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso that were deduced from published sequences of tumor cell zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, both clones mediate zzso and zzso zzso zzso consists of 2,445 zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso The corresponding protein with 512 zzso acids has a molecular weight of 58 zzso zzso zzso zzso differs by an additional insert of zzso zzso This insert is located in frame at position zzso of the zzso and contains the typical zzso junction sites at the zzso and 3' end, indicating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is generated by alternative zzso The insert contains a stop zzso that shortens the zzso protein to 330 zzso acids zzso zzso Both zzso contain the binding site sequence for the zzso zzso responsive element zzso in conjunction with a zzso recognition sequence zzso zzso zzso results show that the Barbie box acts as a negative regulatory zzso The two liver zzso clones show zzso to the published sequences of folate and the reduced folate carriers, but no zzso is found to the transport systems for organic zzso like the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso for the zzso carrier is found in liver, zzso heart, brain, zzso zzso and skeletal muscle, but not in the zzso as revealed by Northern zzso zzso The highest abundance of the zzso is found in the zzso
