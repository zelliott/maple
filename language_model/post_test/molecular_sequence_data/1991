zzso a novel zzso of the zzso zzso 1) family, was discovered by zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso shares critical zzso acid zzso with zzso and binds to the zzso protein enhancing its ability to inhibit zzso zzso We also showed that low levels of zzso are zzso present zzso in human blood zzso In this study, we demonstrate that similar to zzso both zzso and zzso protein expression of zzso are zzso by zzso zzso in human zzso In stable zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, there was no zzso protein expression despite a highly active zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso was rapidly zzso in zzso cells, via a zzso zzso zzso control of zzso transcript zzso After zzso zzso there was a rapid transient increase in zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Using sequence zzso we found a zzso zzso zzso box within the open reading frame of zzso which is zzso the coding region instability elements of some selective zzso zzso deletion of downstream zzso 5 from the full-length zzso zzso markedly increased the levels of zzso zzso A similar coding region element is located in zzso When zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso was also unstable unless treated with zzso These results indicate that both zzso and zzso zzso contain functional instability zzso within their coding region, which influence zzso zzso as a novel mechanism to regulate the expression of zzso family zzso
