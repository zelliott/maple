The zzso gene zzso the blue zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of the characterization of a gene zzso a blue zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence exhibits a high degree of similarity to other zzso zzso zzso from various bacterial zzso The full-length protein included a zzso leader zzso The zzso gene was zzso in zzso coli and was shown to be exported to the zzso zzso was achieved in a single step, and analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of the signal zzso occurred at a position identical to that for the native zzso isolated from zzso zzso The zzso zzso isolated directly was blue and zzso and, on the basis of electron zzso resonance zzso and metal analysis, possessed only type 1 copper zzso This type zzso zzso preparation also had a low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fraction with copper zzso prior to zzso resulted in the isolation of an zzso with a full complement of type 1 and type 2 copper centers and a high specific zzso The kinetic properties of the zzso zzso were indistinguishable from those of the native zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso This rapid isolation procedure will greatly facilitate genetic and zzso characterization of both zzso and zzso derivatives of this zzso
