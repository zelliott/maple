In most zzso the prospective zzso positions of zzso crossovers are marked during zzso zzso by protein complexes called late zzso zzso zzso In tomato zzso zzso a zzso zzso map has been constructed based on zzso zzso We demonstrate that the mismatch repair protein zzso occurs in zzso We determined the positions of zzso zzso along the 12 tomato zzso pairs zzso during zzso zzso and compared the map of zzso focus positions with that of zzso zzso On all 12 zzso the number of zzso zzso was approximately zzso of the number of zzso zzso with zero zzso zzso were rare, which argues against random failure of detecting zzso in the zzso We zzso that there are two types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that each zzso gets an zzso zzso zzso The two zzso types are differently distributed along the zzso Furthermore, zzso interference among zzso zzso was much stronger than interference among zzso zzso that zzso marks the positions of a subset of strongly interfering zzso Based on the distances between zzso zzso or zzso we propose that zzso and zzso zzso stem from the same population of zzso interfering zzso
