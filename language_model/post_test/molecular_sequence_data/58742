zzso a type II zzso zzso system from the zzso zzso zzso recognizes the sequence zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso coli using zzso selection to isolate the zzso However, none of these clones contained the restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso attempts to clone the complete zzso gene along with zzso in one step failed, presumably due to expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of inadequate expression of zzso The complete zzso was finally cloned using a zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate the 3' end of zzso from a zzso The intact zzso reconstructed under control of an zzso promoter, was introduced into an zzso coli strain containing a zzso with the zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso system was determined, analyzed and compared to previously zzso zzso zzso The sequence was also examined for features which would help explain why zzso unlike other zzso zzso genes seemed to be expressed in zzso zzso
