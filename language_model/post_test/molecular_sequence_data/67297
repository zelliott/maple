An important zzso factor of zzso zzso is the production of zzso zzso zzso a thick zzso layer that allows for evasion of the zzso defense and creates a barrier against zzso zzso zzso production is driven mostly by the expression of genes located in a locus called zzso and the resulting structure is used to distinguish between different zzso (K zzso In this study, we report the unique genetic organization of the zzso cluster from zzso zzso zzso a clinical isolate recovered during a large outbreak of zzso infections that occurred in a Brazilian teaching zzso 

A zzso approach showed that the zzso region of zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and contains genes common, although not universal, to other zzso such as the zzso zzso that codes for zzso zzso zzso also presents some unique features, like the inversion of the zzso gene and a unique repertoire of zzso In zzso comparison of zzso zzso pattern with 102 previously published zzso zzso patterns showed that zzso is distinct from the C patterns of all other K zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso showed only a weak reaction with zzso types zzso and zzso We confirm that zzso zzso shares common genes with zzso such as the zzso zzso but lacks features like zzso and zzso zzso while zzso capsules contain three of the five zzso that potentially form the zzso zzso 

We report the first description of a zzso cluster from a Brazilian clinical isolate of a zzso zzso zzso The gathered data including zzso support that zzso zzso belongs to a novel zzso zzso The zzso of zzso probably includes zzso and zzso in its structure, among other zzso Because genes involved in zzso zzso are absent in humans, this zzso may represent potential targets for the development of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of clinical zzso is of great importance for further development of vaccines and/or novel therapeutic zzso The distribution of zzso among zzso zzso is unknown, but our findings may encourage scientists to perform zzso typing of zzso strains zzso
