In zzso zzso peptides zzso lower blood pressure, reduce blood volume and broadly inhibit cardiovascular zzso zzso are often referred to as cardiac hormones, though they also have integral roles in regulating vascular tone, zzso zzso and zzso vascular smooth muscle cell zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified as zzso constituents in the zzso of zzso though such a phenomenon has not previously been described in zzso Here we describe the zzso production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in multiple blood vessels of the rainbow zzso Western zzso analysis showed zzso and zzso production in the zzso zzso artery, zzso artery, zzso zzso and anterior zzso zzso The detection of zzso and zzso was also supported by zzso mass zzso analysis of zzso tissue zzso Although vascular zzso levels of zzso and zzso were zzso quite comparable to those found in reference zzso (the atrium for zzso and brain for zzso zzso levels of these zzso in the zzso were greatly reduced as determined by quantitative zzso When the zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso was infused into zzso trout, it reduced central zzso pressure and mean circulatory filling zzso zzso also decreased cardiac output via a reduction in zzso The presence of zzso zzso production in the trout zzso and potent in zzso zzso effects further support the numerous functional similarities between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
