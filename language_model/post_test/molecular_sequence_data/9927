Secondary structure analysis of the zzso from a zzso construct carrying the zzso gene 3 zzso of Japanese zzso zzso revealed the presence of a potential 28 zzso long stem and loop beginning with the zzso of the initiation zzso zzso that had a calculated stabilization energy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of an additional zzso along with three zzso upstream resulted in complete relief of zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein was consistent with initiation of protein synthesis having occurred from the upstream zzso Similar levels of zzso specific zzso in zzso coli cells carrying the expressing and zzso zzso and restoration of zzso protein expression following deletion of segments beginning with the stem and loop confirmed the role of this structure in blocking expression at the level of translation zzso Our approach exploits the ability of a zzso in motion to open up downstream secondary structural elements of considerable stability and represents a novel and widely zzso strategy to overcome a block in translation initiation caused by zzso secondary structure around the translation start zzso
