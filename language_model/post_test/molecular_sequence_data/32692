In order to improve wastewater treatment zzso a need exists for tools that rapidly give detailed insight into the community structure of activated zzso supplementary to chemical and physical zzso In this study, the advantages of zzso and quantitative zzso chin reaction zzso methods were combined into a real-time zzso zzso that allows the simultaneous zzso of zzso and functional genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was possible along a zzso dynamic range and with high linear correlation (R zzso zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso was confirmed by cloning and sequencing analyses of zzso zzso obtained from activated zzso The real-time zzso was validated on mixed liquid samples of different treatment plants, which varied in nitrogen removal zzso The abundance of zzso zzso was in the order of magnitude of zzso down to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were less abundant zzso order of zzso The results were in correspondence with the zzso zzso rate in the sludge zzso As for the zzso zzso and zzso gene copy numbers, their abundance was generally in the order of magnitude of zzso When sludge samples were subjected to zzso zzso a decrease in zzso rate was reflected within 18 h in the copy numbers of zzso genes zzso with 1 to 5 log zzso whereas zzso genes remained rather zzso These results demonstrate that the method is a fast and accurate tool for the analysis of the zzso community structure and size in both natural and engineered environmental zzso
