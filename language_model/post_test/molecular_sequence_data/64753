zzso elements are zzso terminal repeat zzso zzso that specifically integrate into the 28 S zzso genes of their zzso These elements zzso a single open reading frame with a zzso zzso and a reverse zzso that uses the zzso zzso target site to prime reverse zzso zzso of the DNA strand that is used to prime reverse zzso is an efficient process that occurs in the presence or absence of zzso zzso of the second DNA strand is much less efficient and requires zzso zzso zzso occurs before second strand zzso and only if the zzso bound to the protein contains the 3' untranslated region of the zzso zzso Thus a complex series of protein interactions with the DNA and zzso changes in the protein are likely to occur during this zzso zzso Here, we conduct zzso zzso zzso and zzso I footprint studies on the binding of the zzso protein to the DNA target in the presence and absence of zzso both before and after first strand zzso While the total expanse of the protein footprint on the DNA eventually covers five zzso turns, before zzso the footprint only extends from 17 zzso to 40 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso This footprint is the same in the presence and absence of zzso We zzso that the active site of the zzso domain is analogous to type zzso restriction zzso in that it is located on a flexible domain that is not tightly bound to the zzso zzso After first strand zzso the protein footprint extends beyond the zzso zzso We suggest that this increased protection after zzso is the zzso domain that is positioned over the free DNA end to begin reverse zzso on the zzso DNA zzso
