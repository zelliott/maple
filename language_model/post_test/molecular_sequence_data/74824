zzso coupled receptors zzso typically have a functionally important zzso which, in the largest zzso zzso zzso includes a zzso eighth zzso zzso of this region are associated with several zzso There are few zzso studies on the family B zzso and no data supporting the existence of a similar eighth zzso in this second major zzso which has little or no sequence zzso to family A zzso Here we show that the zzso of a family B zzso zzso has a disparate region from zzso to zzso required for zzso zzso and a zzso region of twelve zzso (from zzso to zzso in a similar position to the family A eighth zzso required for zzso zzso at the cell zzso A combination of circular and linear zzso zzso and modified zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that a zzso zzso of this domain readily forms a zzso zzso anchored to the zzso by an zzso zzso zzso The study reveals two key functions held within the zzso of a family B zzso and presents support for an eighth zzso region with striking zzso similarity to the zzso family A zzso This zzso structure appears to be found in most other family B zzso
