zzso transfer protein zzso is a highly specific carrier of zzso zzso without known zzso zzso functions include the supply of PC required for zzso into zzso or lung air space zzso and the zzso of zzso reactions involving PC synthesis or zzso To test these functions, we generated zzso mice unable to make zzso zzso these mice are normal and have no zzso in any of the zzso zzso functions zzso The zzso content and composition of the zzso as well as lung zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso mice, is zzso The lack of a zzso contribution to zzso zzso zzso is in agreement with our finding that zzso is zzso in adult mouse zzso whereas zzso is abundant in the liver of mouse zzso zzso levels decrease zzso zzso around 2 zzso after birth, when zzso formation zzso In adult mice, zzso levels are high only in zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso mast zzso zzso of zzso in bone zzso mast cells does not affect their zzso composition or PC synthesis and zzso We discuss how PC might reach the zzso membrane of the zzso for zzso into the zzso if not by zzso
