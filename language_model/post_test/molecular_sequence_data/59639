zzso forming zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso could be ideal vehicles to deliver zzso energy to specific DNA zzso causing DNA breaks and, zzso zzso of these zzso To demonstrate this approach we labeled with zzso zzso zzso per zzso on zzso a zzso zzso which forms a stable triplex with a zzso zzso zzso stretch in the human zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the bound zzso was shown to cause zzso double strand breaks zzso in the target zzso sequence cloned into zzso zzso No zzso breaks were observed if zzso zzso were not bound to the zzso zzso After 60 days of zzso zzso (one zzso zzso approximately a quarter of all zzso molecules contained zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso gel analysis shows that the DNA breaks are distributed within a few bases of the zzso at those bases opposite to the positions of zzso in the zzso
