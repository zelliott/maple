A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated in our laboratory by virtue of its increased expression in rat zzso tumor cell zzso zzso which zzso human or rat zzso form tumors in zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and in normal zzso suggesting that zzso protein has different zzso interactions in normal cells and in zzso zzso different zzso gene family members may be functional in normal development and in zzso While mapping the zzso location of zzso to zzso we discovered a second zzso zzso which is zzso and maps to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso we determined that zzso is expressed in both normal and zzso zzso However, high levels of zzso zzso in cancer cell lines are due to increased expression of zzso Thus, this family of zzso appears to zzso participate in zzso zzso
