The distribution of three putative zzso genes in 123 zzso zzso zzso strains was determined by zzso The zzso strains were isolated from human patients zzso and food zzso and were characterized by zzso zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and adherence factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most frequent among human strains and the majority zzso of food strains were zzso zzso The zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most common in humans strains and zzso zzso in food zzso The presence of these genes in addition to zzso in zzso from different sources may suggest a relevant role in their zzso
