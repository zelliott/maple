The gene for zzso growth hormone zzso was expressed without signal sequences in zzso zzso A zzso zzso expression zzso has been constructed which directs the synthesis of a fusion protein containing a stretch of six zzso zzso zzso at the zzso under the control of a zzso zzso Upon induction with zzso the zzso protein was zzso and accumulated in the zzso in the form of inclusion bodies, at levels of approximately zzso of the total cellular zzso The zzso zzso growth hormone containing His tag was recovered and zzso to zzso zzso in a single step by immobilized zzso zzso with a special affinity zzso zzso that has selectivity for proteins with neighboring zzso zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso followed by zzso and zzso terminal analysis demonstrated the authenticity of the fusion zzso The zzso zzso after zzso was found to be functionally active in terms of its zzso binding and zzso as analyzed by radio zzso zzso and radio zzso zzso Yields of the zzso expressed protein were found to be 32 zzso at a zzso zzso Thus, results indicate that a combination of zzso coli expression and affinity zzso by zzso zzso promises to be a rapid method to produce zzso for use in zzso zzso
