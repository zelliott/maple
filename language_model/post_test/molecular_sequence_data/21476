There is a growing evidence that zzso zzso plays a zzso role in liver cancer zzso Previous reports showed that the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a significant increase in zzso zzso expression and promoter activity in rat zzso zzso In this study, we confirmed that human zzso is also zzso by zzso treatment independent of translation, and we identified the mechanism by which zzso zzso the expression of human zzso via driving zzso away from a zzso motif located within zzso of the promoter in zzso zzso zzso of zzso dramatically reduces zzso zzso of both internal expression of zzso and promoter activity, whereas zzso of zzso has the opposite zzso zzso the present study zzso the fundamental elements in the promoter which will be helpful in the future studies on the regulation of zzso expression in liver zzso
