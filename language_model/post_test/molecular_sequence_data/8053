zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a group of zzso in the zzso which zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso contain 12 zzso and 11 zzso zzso comparison of two zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the corresponding zzso from leaves, showed preferential use of a zzso zzso as the zzso zzso border in zzso 1 instead of an adjacent zzso zzso four zzso further zzso This zzso zzso zzso site is zzso in all seven zzso genes characterized from three different zzso Likewise, in the 3' region of zzso 1 two AG zzso are located seven zzso zzso Only the most zzso of these zzso was found to be used in zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso isolated from seeds, zzso and zzso tissue using reverse zzso zzso showed that the zzso pattern of this zzso is identical in these zzso for zzso The zzso and the most 3' AG zzso mentioned above have been assumed to be the zzso borders of zzso 1 in several zzso zzso The present investigation shows that this assumption is not zzso
