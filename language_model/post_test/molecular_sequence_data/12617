The clinical efficacy of local zzso and zzso drugs is due to their zzso and zzso block of zzso zzso zzso local zzso zzso such as zzso which are permanently charged and zzso effectively block cardiac zzso channels when applied from either side of the membrane but block zzso zzso channels only from the zzso zzso This difference in zzso access to zzso is retained when rat brain zzso zzso channel alpha zzso and rat heart zzso zzso channel alpha zzso are expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso segment zzso of zzso domain IV zzso of zzso channel alpha zzso have important effects on block by local zzso zzso Although five zzso acid zzso in zzso differ between brain zzso and cardiac zzso exchange of these zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso showed that only conversion of zzso in zzso to Val as in zzso was sufficient to reduce the rate and extent of block by zzso zzso and slow the escape of drug from closed channels after zzso zzso zzso also reduced the rate of block by zzso zzso and slowed escape of bound zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso indicating that zzso must move through the pore to zzso zzso binding was inhibited by zzso of zzso in the local zzso zzso site of zzso to Ala whether the drug was applied zzso or zzso Thus, zzso binds to a single site in the zzso zzso channel alpha zzso that contains zzso whether it is applied from the zzso or zzso side of the zzso Access to that site from the zzso side of the pore is determined by the zzso acid at position zzso in the zzso cardiac zzso zzso
