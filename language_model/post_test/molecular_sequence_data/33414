The removal of zzso from zzso zzso transcripts requires the activities of five zzso zzso complexes and numerous associated zzso The lack of zzso affecting zzso factors essential for animal survival has limited the study of the in zzso regulation of zzso From a screen for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso in genes that zzso the zzso zzso zzso of two zzso factors, the zzso large zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and caused the zzso zzso transcript to be spliced using a cryptic 3' zzso site generated by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not cause the zzso of this cryptic 3' zzso zzso We isolated four zzso zzso zzso that restored the viability of zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso These zzso zzso affected the recognition of the cryptic 3' zzso site and implicated a small region of zzso between the zzso small zzso domain and the first zzso recognition motif in affecting the choice of 3' zzso zzso We constructed a reporter for zzso zzso and using zzso zzso found that the position of the cryptic zzso site affects its zzso We also identified zzso of the zzso 3' zzso site important for recognition by zzso zzso Our genetic and molecular analyses suggested that the zzso suppression of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso was likely caused by altered zzso of an unknown zzso Our observations provide in zzso evidence that zzso can act in regulating 3' zzso choice and establish a system that can be used to investigate the in zzso regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
