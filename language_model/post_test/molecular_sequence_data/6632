A zzso zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously has been shown to include the functions required for maintenance of zzso as an zzso zzso This zzso contains the open zzso reading frames rep and zzso 56 plus an intervening segment believed to be zzso Using deletion zzso we show that the zzso replication origin and other zzso sites necessary and sufficient for replication map to a DNA segment that extends 515 zzso zzso to the zzso start of zzso and lacks zzso zzso that include this segment are maintained in zzso zzso as zzso zzso when zzso in trans by the rep gene zzso
