The zzso zzso leukemia zinc zzso zzso zzso when fused to zzso acid zzso alpha zzso causes a zzso form of acute zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso broad zzso domain of zzso plays a critical role in this disease, since it is required for zzso repression by the zzso fusion zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain revealed an zzso zzso with a highly zzso charged pocket formed by zzso of the two zzso An extensive zzso analysis showed that the charged pocket motif plays a major role in zzso repression by zzso We found that zzso of the zzso domain that neutralize key charged pocket zzso did not disrupt zzso yet zzso the ability of zzso to repress zzso and led to the loss of interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We extended these studies to the zzso zzso which is linked to the zzso of zzso zzso In this case, zzso the charged pocket also resulted in loss of repression and zzso zzso zzso with zzso protein showed that zzso interactions were zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso anemia zinc zzso protein shows that variations in the zzso pocket result in differential affinity for zzso which predicts the potency of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso pocket represents a molecular structure involved in recruitment of zzso repression complexes to target zzso
