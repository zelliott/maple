All zzso selected T cells are inherently zzso yet many data indicate a fine specificity in zzso recognition, which enables virus escape from immune control by zzso in infections such as the human zzso virus zzso To address this paradox, we analyzed the fine specificity of T cells recognizing a human zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso gag zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso peptides tested bound zzso but only one third were zzso Surprisingly, one recognized zzso zzso showed marked differences in structure when bound to zzso T cell zzso zzso recognition of zzso of these two peptides implied that they adopted the same zzso in the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso binding were zzso zzso that zzso changes at the zzso binding interface occur after an initial zzso zzso zzso These findings have implications for the rational design of vaccines targeting viruses with unstable zzso
