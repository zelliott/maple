zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso implicated in cellular zzso and zzso Two distinct zzso genes have been identified that are predicted to zzso proteins with significant zzso acid sequence identity with mouse zzso mouse zzso zzso protein and zzso growth factor zzso protein zzso Here we report that the zzso and zzso genes are zzso regulated in zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells zzso both zzso and zzso zzso levels, but the effect on zzso zzso expression is significantly zzso zzso treatment also increases zzso protein zzso as determined by zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso serum stimulation of zzso cells increases zzso zzso expression but not zzso zzso zzso Finally, when zzso zzso cells are grown in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are significantly increased whereas zzso zzso levels are only slightly zzso These results indicate that the zzso and zzso genes are zzso regulated in zzso zzso by two different zzso agents and by zzso zzso Therefore these structurally related zzso may have at least some distinct cellular zzso for example, although both zzso and zzso activity may be important for the zzso changes associated with cellular zzso zzso may be the primary zzso zzso involved in cellular zzso
