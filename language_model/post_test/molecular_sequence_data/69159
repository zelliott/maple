In order to characterize the regulation of the gene zzso the I zzso zzso inhibitor of the zzso factor zzso B, we have isolated a human zzso clone and zzso the promoter of this zzso The zzso promoter exhibits a potential zzso element upstream of one of the two major zzso sites, and contains several potential zzso B binding zzso suggesting that the gene is positively regulated by members of this zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that the zzso promoter can be activated by various combinations of members of the zzso B family, as well as by zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso deletion of one of the zzso B zzso located 37 zzso upstream of the zzso box, zzso responses to zzso and zzso This zzso B motif binds zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso These results help to explain the previously observed transient nature of the zzso B response: following zzso B zzso the expression of the inhibitor is increased, therefore the extent of nuclear zzso of the active complex is reduced, resulting in a decreased zzso of its target zzso
