The zzso zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso is the first and only naturally split zzso that has been identified so zzso It is capable of catalyzing a protein zzso mechanism to assemble a mature protein from two separate zzso zzso it is a powerful tool for protein modification and zzso zzso have not been identified, nor have zzso protein zzso reactions been demonstrated, in plant zzso In this paper, we describe the use of the zzso zzso split zzso in transgenic plants for zzso of a protein zzso zzso We have zzso artificial genes that zzso for zzso half zzso and zzso half zzso fragments of zzso zzso split zzso and divided zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso and zzso parts of the zzso as zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso We have observed in zzso zzso of functional zzso when both zzso and zzso zzso were introduced into the same zzso zzso either by zzso or through genetic zzso hereby signifying an zzso protein zzso mechanism zzso in plant zzso
