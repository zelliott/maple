zzso T cells rather than zzso are the principal cells infected by human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been linked to the ability to enter cells through zzso in conjunction with limiting zzso levels, which are much lower on zzso than on T zzso We recently reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso depleted of zzso T cells before zzso infection exhibit extensive zzso infection as well as high chronic viral loads and rapid progression to zzso Here we show that zzso and control zzso were strictly zzso dependent but that, by day 42 zzso plasma virus of zzso T zzso zzso was dominated by zzso that mediate efficient infection using zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso and control zzso zzso were resistant to zzso by zzso zzso plasma but became sensitive if zzso with zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were highly sensitive to zzso plasma zzso However, plasma from zzso zzso T zzso animals lacked this zzso zzso activity and failed to neutralize any zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso from day 42 zzso T zzso zzso was also seen with zzso zzso that target both known zzso and other zzso zzso zzso independence and zzso sensitivity were both zzso by zzso zzso acid changes zzso and zzso that arose independently in multiple animals, with the latter introducing a potential zzso zzso site within a predicted zzso pocket of zzso Thus, the absence of zzso T cells results in failure to produce zzso that neutralize zzso zzso and zzso control zzso In the absence of this constraint and with a relative paucity of zzso target cells, widespread zzso infection occurs in zzso accompanied by emergence of zzso carrying structural changes that enable entry independently of zzso
