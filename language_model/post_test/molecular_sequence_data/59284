A zzso zzso library containing a random zzso insert was screened for identification of zzso zzso that bind zzso zzso the random insert from more than 100 zzso indicated that more than zzso of the zzso zzso that bound to this zzso contained a zzso sequence motif in which X was frequently a zzso zzso The zzso sequence was often repeated as zzso Two zzso peptides were zzso to determine whether or not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and the importance of the zzso zzso within this zzso The zzso containing zzso had a Ki of 24 zzso whereas replacing the zzso with zzso increased the Ki value to zzso zzso
