The zzso zzso zzso zzso disease resistance gene zzso zzso zzso race zzso protection against three zzso zzso and has been a highly relevant gene for wheat breeding since the green zzso zzso located on zzso zzso encodes an zzso cassette (ABC) zzso Both wheat zzso with and without zzso resistance zzso a zzso functional protein that differ by only two zzso acid zzso In this study, we focused on the identification and characterization of zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso wheat and other zzso In zzso wheat we found an expressed and zzso functional zzso zzso located on zzso zzso designated zzso Another zzso zzso zzso located on zzso zzso was disrupted by the zzso of repetitive zzso zzso sequences of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were detected in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso indicating independent deletion of this particular ABC zzso zzso was part of a zzso island on the wheat D zzso We found gene zzso on the zzso A and B zzso of zzso zzso but little zzso in other zzso The zzso zzso protein and the zzso from rice and zzso have the susceptible zzso for the two critical zzso distinguishing the zzso proteins from susceptible and resistant wheat zzso We conclude that the particular zzso found in resistant wheat zzso is zzso It probably resulted from functional gene diversification that occurred after the zzso event that was at the origin of cultivated bread zzso
