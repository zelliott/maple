zzso contains two structurally independent zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso Their functional zzso has been suggested by the analysis of the zzso zzso mouse zzso in which a zzso to zzso substitution at position 9 of the zzso abrogates DNA binding by both zzso This zzso is located in the zzso portion of a zzso zzso and the requirement for this structure was investigated by zzso at this and neighboring zzso At position 9, only substitution with zzso increased DNA binding by the zzso and zzso above the level observed with the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso is necessary for the function of both zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso also identified a number of zzso zzso important for DNA binding by both zzso emphasizing the requirement of the zzso for the interaction of zzso with zzso Furthermore, we show that these zzso reduce binding by the zzso at the zzso level and do not impair zzso on a zzso consensus zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso was found to prevent zzso on consensus motifs with zzso pair spacing of the type zzso zzso both the deleterious effect of the zzso zzso on zzso DNA binding and the loss of zzso on zzso motifs can be transferred to a zzso zzso from the human zzso zzso Moreover, the presence of the zzso affects sequence discrimination within the zzso pair zzso in this zzso These analyses establish that the zzso motif is essential for zzso and zzso DNA zzso and suggest a novel mechanism by which the zzso can influence sequence specificity of the zzso within the zzso zzso
