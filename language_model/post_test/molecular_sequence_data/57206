The zzso and zzso products of zzso sites are the major zzso and lethal zzso zzso in zzso To investigate their relative zzso to repair and other factors such as sequence context and zzso in the complementary strand that might influence repair zzso we constructed zzso duplexes containing zzso zzso of zzso sites at central zzso Using these zzso we measured the binding of zzso coli DNA zzso to zzso zzso in four sequence contexts and to two zzso zzso in close proximity and on opposing zzso We found that the sequence within a zzso pair region had little effect on binding and that two zzso molecules bound to zzso containing two zzso in the zzso orientation, but not in the zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso of a zzso zzso by zzso zzso was not influenced by the sequence in the immediate vicinity of the zzso and the zzso was active on zzso zzso zzso but not on zzso zzso Of special significance, we found that zzso zzso removed the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at vastly differing relative rates of zzso zzso
