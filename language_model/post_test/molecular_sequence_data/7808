zzso zzso zzso spontaneous phase variation in colony zzso zzso in colony zzso have previously been shown to correlate with differences in the ability of organisms to colonize the zzso surface of the zzso in an animal zzso The genetic basis of zzso variation was identified in transformation zzso A DNA library, from a strain that varies at high frequency, was screened to identify a single clone capable of transforming a transparent recipient strain which varies at low frequency to an opaque zzso Analysis of this zzso locus revealed two zzso zzso and zzso with similarity to genes required for zzso metabolism in other zzso Following the zzso zzso repetitive zzso zzso boxes A and C, were zzso These zzso elements were not present in the same locus of the recipient zzso Although not required for phase variation in colony zzso the box element was necessary for expression of phase variation at high zzso Introduction of the box elements during transformation affected colony zzso possibly by altering expression of a putative regulatory gene downstream from the box zzso zzso within this region confirmed the contribution of the putative regulatory gene to the expression of colony zzso Growth characteristics of strains generated in this study provide additional evidence for an association of differences in cell wall zzso and variation in colony zzso
