In order to scan the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene for regulatory sequences involved in directing zzso and zzso zzso a zzso gene was constructed containing the zzso A promoter of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso structural sequence as a reporter gene and the zzso A zzso region of zzso zzso zzso This zzso gene and zzso end deletions zzso were introduced into zzso plants with the help of zzso zzso plant zzso and zzso activity was zzso A 220 zzso zzso A promoter zzso contains zzso elements zzso zzso and zzso zzso A promoter zzso from zzso to zzso although at a low level, was still able to direct zzso expression but could not drive zzso expression in transgenic zzso zzso zzso analysis of binding of flower nuclear proteins to zzso A promoter fragments by gel zzso zzso showed strong specific binding to the sequences from zzso to zzso zzso sequence comparison of zzso genes from other plant species, combined with the deletion analysis and gel zzso zzso strongly suggests the involvement of the zzso repeats zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso of the zzso A gene in zzso zzso We also describe an in zzso zzso transient expression system, in which flower or purple callus zzso are used, that enables us to zzso zzso expression of a zzso reporter zzso
