zzso and zzso contribute to the development of severe zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso malaria is mostly associated with zzso or pulmonary complications and very rarely with cerebral zzso The most zzso zzso alpha domain of zzso a protein zzso by the zzso zzso family mediates zzso We analyzed zzso of Brazilian patients with severe malaria to determine whether there were particular zzso alpha zzso sequences predominantly expressed in such zzso 

zzso alpha zzso sequences were obtained from zzso of Brazilian patients with severe and mild malaria and were analyzed by standard zzso zzso Three hundred zzso zzso zzso alpha sequences obtained from 80 Brazilian patients with mild malaria were spotted in zzso filters and zzso to zzso representing predominantly expressed sequences in zzso from patients with severe zzso A zzso alpha domain was expressed in bacteria and used to demonstrate its binding capacity to zzso by zzso 

zzso different and zzso zzso alpha zzso acid sequences were zzso zzso predominantly expressed in patients with severe malaria could be zzso due to deletions of zzso zzso These sequences were commonly found in the zzso gene repertoire of zzso from patients with mild malaria, yet they were rarely expressed in these zzso A zzso protein representing the most abundantly expressed sequence detected in one patient with severe malaria bound directly to zzso zzso 

This is the first report showing an association of severe zzso malaria from Brazil with particular zzso alpha zzso
