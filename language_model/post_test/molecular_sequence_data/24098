De zzso zzso backbone and zzso resonance assignments are presented for zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso by zzso zzso determined using solid-state magic angle spinning zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso angles and secondary structure predicted from the statistical analysis of zzso and zzso chemical shifts are in general agreement with solution values for the intact full-length zzso confirming that the secondary structure is retained in the zzso complex prepared as a zzso zzso zzso The differential labeling of complementary zzso fragments introduced in this work is expected to be beneficial for high-resolution structural studies of protein zzso formed by protein zzso by solid-state zzso zzso
