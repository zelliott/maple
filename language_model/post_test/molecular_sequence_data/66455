Cook zzso which separates the North and South Island of New Zealand, has been a zzso but zzso feature of the New Zealand land mass throughout the zzso maintaining its current zzso and depth for the past zzso zzso Historic land fragmentation coupled with the complex zzso of the Greater Cook Strait region has created both zzso and zzso zzso between the North and South Island in several marine zzso Here we use zzso zzso b DNA sequences of three endemic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to assess zzso zzso patterns across Cook Strait and to look for zzso zzso of ecological and evolutionary processes among closely related zzso We zzso zzso zzso in zzso individuals from zzso populations spanning the zzso range of the three zzso zzso zzso analyses show moderate to strong genetic zzso among North and South Island populations due to zzso zzso This pattern was broadly zzso across the three species and the observed divergence among this group of zzso zzso zzso is similar to that of previously studied zzso zzso For each species, divergence time calculations suggest contemporary North and South Island lineages zzso from their respective most recent common zzso approximately 200 zzso to 300 zzso years before present zzso significantly earlier than previous estimates in other coastal marine zzso that arose from a zzso of divergence zzso
