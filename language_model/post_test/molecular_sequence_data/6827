Digital zzso calcium imaging was used to investigate and identify the primary biological responses of human zzso to zzso zzso E zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso caused a transient rise in the level of zzso calcium that was inhibited by zzso zzso The calcium rise was due mainly to release from an zzso zzso store that is also sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso calcium transient was independent of zzso gamma receptors and of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the mere binding of zzso to zzso is sufficient to evoke a biological response without the need for zzso zzso
