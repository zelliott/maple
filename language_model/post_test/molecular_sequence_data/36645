With direct sequencing of the amplified zzso we zzso the transcript and zzso zzso zzso in a common Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The result shows that this zzso gene would not only produce zzso processed zzso zzso but also transcribes a small amount of normally spliced zzso hence leading to zzso zzso The method described zzso provides a simple and sensitive approach to the studies of gene expression and molecular defects in genetic diseases at zzso zzso
