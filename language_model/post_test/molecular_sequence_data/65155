The zzso factor alpha zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso are subjected to zzso zzso zzso a modification that zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso at zzso by preventing recruitment of the zzso zzso protein zzso This zzso is performed by the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of which zzso and zzso are the only reported zzso Here we investigated the zzso requirements of zzso by characterizing its zzso zzso and by examining zzso acids within the zzso zzso for their importance in recognition and zzso by zzso Using zzso we showed that both zzso and zzso zzso are primarily confined to the zzso and remain there under zzso and following treatment with the zzso zzso zzso Individual zzso zzso of seven zzso zzso acids zzso the zzso zzso in zzso revealed the importance of the zzso zzso adjacent to the targeted zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso lower zzso in zzso zzso whereas all other zzso were zzso as efficiently as the wild type zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso was zzso suggesting negligible zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas the wild type and other zzso were zzso under zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso predicted an zzso in zzso positioning compared with the wild type zzso zzso providing an explanation for the impaired zzso observed and confirming the importance of zzso in zzso zzso by zzso
