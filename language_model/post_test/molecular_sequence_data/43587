The type II transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the initiation of multiple zzso signaling zzso and loss of its function is associated with many types of human zzso Here we show that zzso zzso is regulated intricately by zzso on at least three zzso zzso zzso in the zzso segment outside the zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso which is essential for the zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso of zzso and zzso growth zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso and zzso located in a segment corresponding to the zzso recognition zzso region in a three-dimensional structural model of protein zzso is enhanced by zzso zzso and can occur via an zzso zzso zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso while zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso results in a zzso zzso that is better able than zzso to induce zzso zzso and subsequent cell cycle zzso Since on a single zzso either zzso or zzso but not both zzso can become zzso our results show that zzso zzso is regulated intricately and affects zzso zzso signal zzso both positively and zzso
