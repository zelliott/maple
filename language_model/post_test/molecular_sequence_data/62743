The zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso was searched for the presence of open reading frames zzso zzso zzso potentially involved in the formation of zzso and of zzso We found zzso similar to known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but none similar to known zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso was confirmed by zzso tests with crude and zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso as the zzso The characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from their cloned genes in zzso zzso and zzso to zzso revealed that zzso is discriminating in the sense that it does not zzso zzso that zzso is zzso and that its zzso product is zzso by zzso On the other hand, zzso is directly zzso by zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso known to zzso zzso via the indirect zzso and to zzso zzso via the direct zzso The essential role of zzso in the formation of zzso in zzso zzso and the absence of a similar activity in the zzso of zzso cells identifies zzso as a potential target for antibiotics to be designed against this human zzso Such novel antibiotics could be active against other zzso zzso pathogens such as zzso and zzso as well as all zzso zzso zzso
