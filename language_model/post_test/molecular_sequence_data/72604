The population genetic structure of the zzso zzso in western Kenya was studied using length variation at five zzso zzso and sequence variation in a zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected from houses in villages spanning up to 50 zzso zzso The following questions were zzso zzso Are mosquitoes in a house more related genetically to each other than mosquitoes between zzso zzso What degree of genetic differentiation occurs on these geographical zzso zzso How consistent are the results obtained with both types of genetic zzso At the house level, no differentiation was detected by zzso and zzso and the band sharing index test revealed no significant associations of zzso across zzso Likewise, zzso of kinship based on zzso zzso in houses were even lower than in the pooled zzso zzso the hypothesis that mosquitoes in a house are more related genetically was zzso At increasing geographical zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar among all population samples and no subdivision of the gene pool was detected by zzso or zzso Likewise, estimates of zzso divergence of zzso between populations were not higher than the within population estimates, and zzso zzso values were not significantly different from zzso That sequence variation in zzso provided matching results with zzso zzso zzso high genetic variation was observed in all zzso suggested that this pattern represents the whole zzso The minimum area associated with a zzso of zzso zzso in western Kenya is therefore larger than 50 zzso in zzso
