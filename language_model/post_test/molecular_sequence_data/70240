zzso of rat zzso with zzso the major basement membrane adhesive zzso was zzso zzso fetal zzso attached more to zzso than adult zzso zzso promoted attachment of fetal zzso in a concentration dependent manner and showed zzso binding zzso zzso from zzso induced zzso rat liver also attached more to zzso The zzso zzso derived from zzso promoted attachment of adult and fetal zzso but to a lesser zzso A 67 zzso protein was isolated from the zzso plasma membrane of zzso induced zzso rat liver by affinity zzso over zzso zzso This protein appeared to be relatively abundant in zzso liver than in normal zzso The zzso 67 zzso protein could be inserted into zzso and these zzso attached to zzso coated with zzso in a concentration dependent manner in a zzso zzso free zzso Its specificity for zzso was also revealed by absence of significant binding to zzso and zzso
