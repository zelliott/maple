Renal zzso zzso cells are specialized zzso cells located in the zzso zzso at the entrance to the zzso Their main function and distinctive feature is the synthesis and release of zzso the key zzso of the zzso system that regulates zzso blood zzso Despite their relevance to health and disease, not much is known about factors that zzso and/or maintain zzso cell zzso To identify genes uniquely expressed in zzso cells, we used a cell culture model and zzso differential zzso zzso cells cultured for 2 days express zzso and zzso zzso but after 10 days in culture they no longer contain or release zzso and zzso zzso is reduced zzso We report one zzso zzso expressed in the zzso zzso cell culture that detects a zzso zzso expressed at higher levels in newborn than adult zzso zzso a zzso culture zzso cell zzso library yielded clones representing zzso spliced zzso These zzso zzso one unique protein zzso containing zinc fingers and zzso characteristic of zzso factors and zzso binding zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed zzso zzso expression in differentiated zzso cells, and identified an additional unique zzso zzso The zzso transcripts are zzso regulated in kidney and a number of other zzso The features of the zzso protein and its organ distribution suggest a possible role in regulation of zzso and/or zzso both important steps for controlling zzso expressed zzso
