The zzso of zzso zzso killer zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso a small neutral protein of 18 zzso of as yet zzso zzso Although this zzso is located between two larger zzso 4 and 6, which it zzso zzso analysis showed that it is transcribed zzso zzso gene disruption of zzso via in zzso zzso zzso between native zzso zzso and a transfer zzso employing the zzso zzso zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso element, yielded zzso zzso at high zzso The zzso were found to carry a new zzso form of zzso with zzso replaced by the zzso marker, termed zzso in addition to the zzso plasmids zzso and zzso Northern analysis detected a zzso zzso transcript distinct in size and regulation from its nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to zzso native zzso during zzso selective zzso however zzso was displaced by zzso during zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to be an essential gene for zzso integrity and/or zzso The zzso product was detected by zzso of an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Western analysis using a zzso zzso specific for the zzso tag identified a protein band with apparent molecular weight of 20 zzso corresponding in size to the predicted zzso
