zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the disruption of normal zzso differentiation when fused to the zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso by the zzso between zzso zzso 15 and 17 in acute zzso leukemia zzso As an initial step in the characterization of zzso in species other than human, a zzso zzso clone of the zzso gene was isolated and zzso and the zzso organization of the zzso locus zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the mouse zzso protein shows zzso similarity to that of its human zzso However, the mouse and human proteins show greater than zzso similarity in the proposed functional zzso of the zzso Despite its role in the zzso of zzso zzso expression is not zzso altered during zzso differentiation in a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus by zzso cell hybrids and by linkage analysis indicates that the gene maps to a region of mouse zzso 9 with known linkage zzso to the region on human zzso zzso to which zzso has been zzso
