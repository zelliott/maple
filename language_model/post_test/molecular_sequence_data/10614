The AAA protein family, a recently recognized group of zzso zzso has been subjected to an extensive sequence zzso Multiple sequence alignments revealed the existence of a region of sequence zzso the so-called AAA zzso The borders of this cassette were localized and within it, three boxes of a high degree of conservation were zzso Two of these boxes could be assigned to substantial parts of the zzso binding site zzso to Walker motifs A and zzso the third may be a portion of the zzso zzso zzso trees were calculated to obtain insights into the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso with varying degrees of zzso could be zzso these relationships are also supported by analysis of sequences outside the zzso AAA zzso within the cassette are regions that are strongly zzso within each zzso whereas little or even no similarity between different zzso can be zzso These regions are well suited to define fingerprints for zzso A secondary structure prediction utilizing all available sequence information was performed and the result was fitted to the general zzso structure of a Walker zzso The agreement was unexpectedly high and strongly supports the conclusion that the AAA family belongs to the Walker zzso of zzso
