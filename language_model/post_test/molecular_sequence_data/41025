zzso bacterial essential genes using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an important strategy in the development of novel zzso zzso zzso are neutral DNA zzso that inhibit gene expression in a zzso zzso In this study, several zzso zzso peptides were zzso to zzso zzso that target 2 bacterial essential zzso zzso carrier protein zzso and zzso A zzso These were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso agent of zzso zzso targeted upstream of both target gene start zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso were found to be most effective in zzso bacterial growth in zzso Both of the zzso zzso protected zzso from zzso zzso induced cell zzso zzso in zzso testing of the zzso resulted in increased survival of mice challenged with the virulent Ames strain of zzso zzso Together, these studies suggest that zzso targeting essential genes have the potential of being used as zzso antibiotics to treat zzso zzso zzso
