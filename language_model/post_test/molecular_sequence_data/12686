We have measured the amount of zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso and protein in primary breast zzso and zzso breast tissue and have found greatly reduced levels in breast cancer compared with zzso zzso A total of 116 breast zzso and 37 zzso taken from zzso breast were compared for zzso zzso expression using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and significantly lower levels were found in the cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings were confirmed at the protein level where four out of five breast zzso contained no zzso zzso and a fifth cancer had a low level of zzso compared with three samples from reduction zzso Similar results were obtained from breast cell lines in which zzso of cancer cell lines had very low levels of zzso whereas all zzso breast cell lines contained higher levels of zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was present in the zzso zzso cells of the zzso breast but was absent from cancer zzso The decreased levels of zzso in breast cancer may indicate that stimulation of cancer cells is resulting in zzso of zzso expression or may zzso zzso as a differentiation factor rather than a growth factor at its zzso concentration in the zzso
