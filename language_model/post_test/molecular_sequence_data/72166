The human zzso zzso termination factor zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso and two alternative precursors of the protein have been imported into isolated zzso and processed to the mature zzso The precursors contain a zzso targeting zzso and the mature zzso zzso zzso exhibits three zzso zzso of which one is zzso and two widely spaced basic zzso The in zzso zzso mature protein has the expected specific binding capacity for a zzso zzso containing the zzso sequence required for directing zzso and produces a zzso I footprint very similar to that produced by the natural zzso However, in contrast to the latter, it lacks zzso zzso activity in an in zzso system, pointing to another zzso being required for making zzso zzso A detailed zzso analysis of the zzso protein and zzso versions of it by band shift zzso has demonstrated that both basic zzso and the three zzso zzso motifs are necessary for DNA zzso Furthermore, a variety of tests have shown that both the zzso and the natural zzso bind to DNA as a zzso arguing against a zzso role for the zzso zzso and rather zzso together with the results of zzso experiments, to zzso zzso zzso interactions being required to bring the two basic zzso in close register with the zzso target DNA zzso
