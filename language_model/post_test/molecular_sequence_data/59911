zzso acid donor 5, which has a zzso group as a zzso auxiliary and zzso group as a leaving group was prepared and subjected to model zzso zzso with zzso zzso 6, 7, and 8 gave coupled products zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in a higher efficiency than previously observed for the zzso zzso This reaction was further applied to the synthesis of protected zzso acid zzso 12, that is zzso designed for the synthesis of zzso acid containing zzso
