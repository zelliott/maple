The synaptic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in the rat zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in both synaptic layers of the zzso the inner zzso layer zzso and the outer zzso layer zzso The zzso of zzso was restricted to the zzso zzso zzso examination showed that in the zzso zzso was localized in horizontal cell processes zzso to both rod zzso and cone zzso It was always only one of the two zzso horizontal cell processes at the zzso zzso labeled for zzso zzso in the zzso was found only zzso to cone zzso and never zzso to rod zzso The zzso processes made flat contacts with the cone zzso suggesting they are the zzso of OFF bipolar zzso In the zzso the different zzso zzso were localized zzso to ribbon zzso of both rod and cone bipolar zzso As a rule, only one of the two zzso elements at the bipolar cell zzso was stained for each of the zzso zzso zzso The selective and zzso distribution of these receptors at the ribbon zzso of the zzso and zzso suggests a high degree of differential processing of the zzso zzso
