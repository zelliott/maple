A human zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso shows extensive sequence zzso zzso identical zzso and an additional approximately zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso To understand the relationship of these zzso the zzso of several zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso towards human, Chinese zzso chicken, and bacterial cells has been zzso A number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to zzso with a zzso zzso in zzso cell extracts and stained zzso in zzso zzso Some of these zzso also reacted with a zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso coli cells, expressing part of the human zzso zzso These results provide strong evidence that zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The human zzso protein also shows significant similarity zzso less than zzso to a number of other bacterial and viral proteins including the pol zzso of human zzso viruses and the zzso protein of zzso zzso The observed similarity between human zzso protein and the major zzso proteins of zzso organisms zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso suggests its possible involvement in zzso diseases zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso
