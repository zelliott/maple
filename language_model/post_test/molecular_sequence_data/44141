Five genes are thought to be required for zzso of methanol zzso genes in zzso zzso These putative regulatory genes include zzso which zzso a putative zzso pair, and zzso and zzso whose functions are less zzso In this study, zzso in zzso zzso zzso were shown to be required for expression of a zzso zzso fusion to the structural gene for the large zzso of methanol zzso zzso confirming the role of these genes in zzso regulation of zzso The zzso sequence suggests that zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso with two zzso zzso and that zzso encodes a zzso response zzso A zzso zzso fusion to the putative zzso promoter showed low-level expression in zzso cells grown on zzso zzso compounds and no zzso expression in cells grown on zzso zzso analysis of this promoter construct showed that the region zzso zzso upstream of the start of zzso is required for zzso The expression of the zzso fusion was examined in each of the five known regulatory zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced to zzso levels in zzso and zzso zzso but was not affected in the other regulatory zzso or in zzso zzso defective in methanol zzso These results suggest a regulatory hierarchy in which the zzso pair zzso control expression of the zzso pair zzso and zzso in turn control expression of a number of genes involved in methanol zzso
