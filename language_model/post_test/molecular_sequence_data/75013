zzso zzso zzso sites have been mapped in zzso on restriction fragments spanning the zzso origin region and surrounding sequences by a new fine structure analysis zzso zzso DNA fragments were zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso which forms only zzso zzso were then zzso and zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso which we have determined pauses at zzso zzso When zzso sites were mapped on zzso sequencing gels, it was observed that zzso binds zzso to zzso sites, and to a lesser degree to zzso zzso zzso this approach, we have identified a zzso hypersensitive region in which the binding sites were much stronger than those in the surrounding zzso This region extends from 150 base pairs zzso to the late side of the enhancers to the early zzso zzso We suggest that this region contains a sequence directed structural zzso of the DNA zzso which can be detected by the zzso mapping approach zzso
