The zzso gene encodes a protein in the embryonic zzso of the sea zzso zzso zzso and is specifically expressed in the zzso primary zzso cell zzso To clarify the mechanism for the differentiation of this cell zzso which proceeds rather autonomously in the zzso regulation of the zzso gene was investigated previously and it was shown that the zzso DNA region upstream of this gene from - zzso to - zzso zzso contained numerous negative regulatory elements that suppressed the zzso expression of the gene in the zzso Here we study the influence of the zzso region from - zzso to + 104 zzso Analysis of the expression of reporter zzso indicated that a strong positive zzso element existed in the region from zzso to zzso This element worked both in forward and reverse zzso and zzso when placed zzso upstream to the reporter zzso In addition, other weaker positive and negative regulatory sites were also detected throughout the zzso zzso zzso gel mobility shift analyses showed that multiple nuclear proteins were bound to the putative strong zzso zzso One of the proteins binding to this region was present in ear y zzso a time when the zzso gene was still silent, but it was not in zzso zzso actively expressing the zzso The binding region for this zzso protein was narrowed down to the region from - 132 to zzso zzso which included the consensus binding site for the zzso zzso product, zzso Two possible zzso binding sites were identified in the vicinity of the zzso zzso This information was used to make a comparison of the general regulatory architecture of genes that contribute to the formation of the skeletal zzso
