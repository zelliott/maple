The majority of patients with zzso zzso or zzso anomaly facial syndromes share a common genetic zzso deletion of zzso region zzso This report describes a zzso approach toward the identification and molecular characterization of a newly identified zzso zzso from the minimal critical deleted region zzso A zzso zzso of the minimal critical region has been assembled and zzso in its zzso Database searches and computer analysis of one zzso zzso for coding sequences identified two regions with high similarity to the mouse zzso zzso zzso Our investigations demonstrate that one of these regions contains a zzso gene that zzso differential zzso while the other region is most likely a zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso cloning demonstrate that there is alternate processing of the zzso without altering the zzso zzso zzso within the open reading zzso zzso zzso can play a regulatory role and have been found to be expressed during early zzso Based on its position in the zzso and possible function, the gene reported here is a candidate for the features seen in the zzso deletion zzso
