Very few studies have attributed a zzso active, functional role to zzso zzso We describe here an zzso zzso with a unique role for maintaining the active zzso of a protein of the zzso zzso The distinguishing feature of zzso is the zzso transition, in which the zzso center loop zzso as a zzso into the central zzso zzso This transition forms the basis for the conversion of zzso to the inactive zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso converts to the zzso state about zzso slower than human zzso In contrast to human zzso fish zzso carries a single zzso zzso at zzso in the gate region through which the zzso center loop passes during zzso zzso While the zzso transition of human zzso is unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso goes zzso about zzso faster than the zzso zzso and about zzso faster than zzso human zzso X-ray crystal structure analysis of zzso fish zzso confirmed the presence of an zzso zzso in the gate region and a lack of zzso structural zzso Thus, zzso transition of zzso is delayed by zzso hindrance from the zzso in the gate zzso Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism for zzso of protein zzso changes by zzso hindrance from zzso zzso
