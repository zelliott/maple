Heat shock protein 70 zzso was identified as an zzso zzso by screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library with pooled zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso clones coding for zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed greater than 97 and zzso identity with zzso from zzso zzso and humans, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein from the zzso portion zzso zzso also reacted with pooled zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso region of zzso contains at least one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae showed increasing levels of zzso with increasing zzso Further, a zzso mouse zzso zzso had zzso to the zzso of cattle zzso zzso zzso zzso and to human zzso derived from a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso to zzso was strong, with zzso zzso normal zzso showing significantly greater reactions than zzso from zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso from other microbial infections may be primary targets for developing zzso zzso
