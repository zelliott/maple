zzso is a serious disease in horses caused by zzso zzso subspecies zzso In this study, genes zzso putative zzso proteins in this subspecies have been identified using signal sequence zzso zzso Among these, one showed similarities to the zzso zzso a member of the zzso proteins of zzso zzso The novel gene zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing typical features found in cell zzso proteins in zzso zzso Based on similarities to the zzso zzso zzso proteins the mature zzso protein can be divided into various zzso an zzso zzso region zzso a highly repetitive zzso region zzso and a zzso zzso zzso region zzso Using zzso the zzso gene was detected in all studied strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso against zzso zzso were detected in a collection of zzso from horses with no history of zzso as well as horses previously infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso from zzso horses were found to have significantly increased zzso zzso against the zzso protein indicating that this protein is expressed during infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso
