zzso factor zzso is a potent zzso zzso that is zzso by zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has been detected in bovine zzso zzso and zzso activity is extraordinarily high in bovine seminal zzso The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize partially the zzso in bovine seminal zzso zzso factor zzso was partially zzso from bovine seminal plasma using zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso activity was increased zzso over seminal plasma with a yield of zzso zzso factor zzso activity was zzso from a single band with a zzso of zzso from a zzso zzso PAGE gel along with several other proteins of varying molecular zzso Following separation by sodium zzso zzso zzso under reducing conditions, zzso was identified as a approximately zzso band by western zzso using zzso directed against human blood zzso zzso sequencing of the approximately 60 zzso band, followed by zzso zzso similarity searching, demonstrated a zzso match with zzso from bovine zzso Based on western zzso a approximately zzso band corresponding to zzso was detected in seminal zzso fluid but not in samples of washed, zzso zzso or zzso plasma zzso where activity was low zzso and zzso respectively, of that in seminal zzso suggesting that seminal plasma zzso does not bind tightly to zzso zzso zzso activity measured in seminal zzso fluid was in the lower range of that in seminal zzso These results demonstrate that zzso activity in bovine seminal plasma is due to zzso zzso by the seminal zzso with sequence zzso to the zzso in human zzso
