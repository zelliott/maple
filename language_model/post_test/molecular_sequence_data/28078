We have recently described an zzso zzso zzso that is present in much greater abundance in acute zzso blast cells zzso and zzso than in resting or zzso zzso zzso cells or chronic zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this report we describe the cloning of two different sized full-length zzso that code for zzso The two zzso differ in their zzso regions as a result of alternative zzso Analysis of the complete zzso sequence and the corresponding zzso acid sequence did not reveal significant zzso to any previously described zzso We show evidence that this gene is highly zzso in several animal species and low stringency zzso studies suggest that the zzso gene may be a member of a family of partially zzso genes in the human zzso
