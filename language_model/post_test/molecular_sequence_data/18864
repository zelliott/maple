zzso zzso receptors zzso engage zzso using zzso region zzso zzso that are either germ zzso zzso and zzso or zzso rearranged zzso zzso zzso compose a presentation platform zzso zzso complex zzso and a variable zzso component consisting of a short zzso zzso The sequence of events when the zzso engages its zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Some studies suggest that the germ line elements of the zzso engage the zzso prior to zzso zzso but this order of binding is difficult to reconcile with some zzso zzso Here, we used zzso that exhibited enhanced zzso binding as a result of zzso in either zzso and/or zzso zzso that bound to the zzso or zzso respectively, to dissect the roles of these zzso in stabilizing zzso zzso Our data show that zzso interactions play a strongly dominant energetic role providing a binding mode that is both temporally and energetically complementary with a system requiring positive selection by zzso in the zzso and rapid recognition of zzso in the zzso
