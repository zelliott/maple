zzso DNA structures that occur during DNA repair and zzso must be efficiently processed by zzso zzso in order to avoid cell zzso In the present paper, we zzso our screen for new interaction partners for the zzso replication clamp that led to the functional characterization of a novel zzso family, dubbed zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso revealed an unexpected binding site for zzso zzso zzso that zzso together with the replication zzso the zzso activity of this protein towards zzso zzso zzso zzso Our studies suggest that understanding the detailed architecture and dynamic zzso of the zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso nuclear zzso complex with DNA will be crucial for identification of its zzso relevant zzso
