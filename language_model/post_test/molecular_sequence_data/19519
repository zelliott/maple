The zzso of scales of gecko zzso comprises zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso we have characterized zzso of zzso layers of scales in zzso especially zzso in zzso pad zzso In the latter, the formation of thin zzso zzso allow for the zzso and climbing vertical or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso remain in the zzso and neutral range of zzso while zzso of zzso zzso show a broader variation of zzso zzso Some protein spots for zzso zzso to previously zzso basic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The predicted secondary structure shows that a large part of the zzso has a zzso zzso small alpha zzso regions, and a central region with 2-3 strands zzso The latter, termed zzso shows zzso with zzso zzso of birds and is involved in the formation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicates that these proteins are mainly present in the zzso and zzso layer, including zzso The zzso proteins of zzso form zzso of zzso that determine their zzso This process resembles that of zzso on the zzso of zzso cells in zzso It is suggested that small proteins rich in zzso zzso and zzso evolved in zzso and birds to reinforce the mechanical resistance of the zzso zzso initially present in the zzso of scales and zzso
