zzso cassette zzso zzso C2 zzso zzso to the zzso plasma membrane in polarized zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but the mechanism by which zzso zzso to the zzso membrane has not been zzso zzso Here, we investigate the role of scaffolding proteins on zzso zzso with a focus on the function of zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso domain containing 1) in regulating zzso zzso The zzso 77 zzso of zzso were used to probe interacting proteins from zzso zzso zzso mass zzso identified zzso as a major interacting zzso zzso associated with the plasma zzso most likely at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso of zzso bound to the fourth zzso domain of zzso zzso of this zzso motif significantly reduced the normal zzso zzso of zzso In zzso cells, zzso of this fourth domain overcame zzso zzso and reduced the zzso zzso at the zzso membrane with a zzso increase of zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest a possible role for an interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
