A zzso zzso DNA segment downstream of the zzso gene on the zzso zzso zzso was cloned and its zzso sequence zzso An open reading frame capable of zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was similar to the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso different zzso zzso proteins zzso A zzso strain containing an zzso resistance DNA cassette inserted into the region containing the zzso reading frame suffered a complete loss of taxis to the zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The open reading frame was designated zzso The zzso and an zzso zzso strain were zzso for their content of zzso proteins and it was found that zzso encodes a zzso membrane protein that has previously been designated zzso These results show that zzso encodes a third zzso in zzso zzso The zzso start site upstream of the zzso gene was determined by primer extension analysis and it was found to be preceded by a potential promoter sequence that is recognized by the zzso D form of zzso zzso The level of zzso expressed from a zzso zzso fusion was increased zzso when cells entered the stationary zzso No zzso could be detected in a zzso genetic zzso
