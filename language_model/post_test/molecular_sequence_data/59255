A member of zzso zzso satellite DNA contained internal zzso in its 174 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA isolated from liver tissue was subjected to zzso zzso and the DNA sequences of about 40 zzso flanked by both zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso This zzso combination of zzso reaction and zzso converts zzso in the zzso DNA to zzso in the amplified DNA, whereas zzso in the zzso DNA remain as zzso zzso analysis of the amplified DNA fragments revealed that most of the zzso zzso at zzso were zzso in this zzso
