Wheat zzso zzso zzso and zzso play key roles in determining wheat grain zzso as well as in defending the plant against zzso zzso has much greater zzso property and zzso activity because it contains more zzso zzso in the unique zzso domain zzso In order to obtain proteins with higher zzso activity, zzso of zzso containing two or three copies of zzso designated zzso and zzso respectively, were constructed and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso Metal affinity zzso was used to purify the soluble zzso zzso zzso The secondary structures of the zzso proteins were predicted by the online program zzso zzso Y zzso zzso zzso and zzso assessed using circular zzso Minimum zzso concentration tests and zzso microscope analyses were employed to evaluate the zzso activities of the zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso zzso was correctly folded and presented significantly higher zzso activities against zzso coli and zzso zzso than zzso zzso suggesting its potential use as an zzso zzso The results also confirmed that zzso is a zzso of the zzso activity of zzso and demonstrated that it is feasible to enhance the zzso activity of zzso by adding one copy of zzso
