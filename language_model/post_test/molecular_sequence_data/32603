For reliable diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso infection we created an zzso molecular strategy for zzso that zzso the dominant zzso zzso site of zzso followed by zzso analyses of zzso We identified zzso zzso sites of zzso zzso strain through zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso zzso using synthetic peptides spanning the zzso zzso All 11 zzso obtained recognized peptides in the zzso loop zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso reacted to zzso one in the zzso loop of zzso and one in the zzso C zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso protein predicted exposure of all these sites on the zzso surface in a close line centered around zzso We then designed a single pair of zzso zzso to zzso and amplified the region of approximately 320 zzso encompassing puff in 8 zzso zzso strains and 6 field zzso zzso analyses of the puff sequences of 11 zzso strains and 34 field zzso obtained from zzso showed that all zzso strains (both field and zzso were always zzso except for one zzso Japanese zzso This zzso strategy appears to be a reliable surrogate for zzso and could facilitate the diagnosis and zzso study of zzso zzso
