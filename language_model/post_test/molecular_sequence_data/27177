zzso transport zzso provides a mechanism for the transport of zzso zzso but the mechanisms for linkage of cargo and zzso proteins have not been zzso Using the sensory outer segments zzso of zzso which are derived from sensory zzso we have identified zzso complexes containing zzso zzso zzso 2 family zzso two zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso relative of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of these complexes leads to a model in which zzso through its binding to zzso and zzso plays a critical role in formation or stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso with the function of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso activity, zzso enhances the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso fluorescent protein zzso reduces zzso membrane targeting of zzso without apparent effect on zzso zzso
