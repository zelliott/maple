zzso disorders of zzso type I zzso form a growing group of zzso zzso zzso Identification of disease genes is compromised by the enormous zzso in clinical symptoms and the large number of potential genes zzso Until now, gene identification included the sequential application of zzso methods in blood samples and zzso In genetically zzso cases, zzso mapping has been applied in zzso zzso Altogether, this time-consuming diagnostic strategy led to the identification of defects in 17 different zzso zzso Here, we applied zzso sequencing zzso in combination with the knowledge of the protein zzso zzso for gene identification in our remaining group of six zzso zzso patients from unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso based on a list of 76 potential zzso candidate zzso leading to the rapid identification of one known and two novel zzso gene zzso These included the first zzso zzso due to a de zzso zzso in zzso and compound zzso zzso in zzso together the first two steps in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso in two cases, involved in zzso sugar zzso The zzso of the zzso was confirmed by showing the deficient activity of the corresponding zzso in patient zzso Combined with these results, the gene zzso has been identified in zzso of our zzso zzso Our results zzso the potential of zzso to unravel disease genes in the zzso in newly diagnosed singleton zzso
