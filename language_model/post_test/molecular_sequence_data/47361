In zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been reported to serve as receptors of zzso Here, we identified the third member of the zzso zzso family zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso Although zzso was capable of binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization occurred much less effectively in zzso cells zzso with zzso than in those with zzso zzso lacking zzso activity were viable and zzso with few zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that the absence of zzso activity suppresses the effects of zzso wingless zzso such as failure of wing and antenna formation and restores target gene expression to the normal levels without change in wingless zzso zzso signaling may thus be attenuated by zzso at least in wingless zzso zzso
