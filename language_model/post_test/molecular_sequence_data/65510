Bone zzso zzso zzso is an zzso factor critical for the regulation of zzso zzso When zzso human zzso zzso produced in human embryonic kidney zzso cells was subjected to zzso analysis, two mature protein forms corresponding to 16 zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso were zzso Despite the zzso relevance and critical function of zzso in female zzso little is known about the structure of zzso Here, we have analyzed the structure of the zzso mature proteins zzso and zzso using state-of-the-art zzso zzso Our findings are as zzso zzso the zzso zzso acid of zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso at the sixth position of zzso is zzso zzso zzso is zzso at zzso and zzso the zzso zzso acid of zzso and zzso is zzso These findings are the first knowledge of the structure of zzso mature protein toward understanding the molecular basis of zzso function and could provide an important contribution to the rapidly progressing research area involving zzso growth factors in zzso of female zzso
