We have identified a zzso zzso protein factor that specifically recognizes zzso zzso repeats at DNA zzso This factor, called zzso zzso end factor zzso is detected predominantly in extracts of zzso eggs and zzso which are estimated to contain sufficient zzso to bind approximately 3 zzso zzso DNA zzso In contrast, zzso is much less abundant zzso 90 per zzso in extracts of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso activity in egg extracts indicates that this factor binds the zzso zzso repeat sequence zzso when present in a zzso 3' zzso zzso 3' extensions of zzso zzso zzso or a zzso sequence fail to bind zzso zzso whereas changes in the zzso sequence zzso to the zzso repeat tail are zzso zzso repeats are not recognized at internal position, at a zzso protruding end, or in zzso zzso In addition, the factor does not bind zzso with zzso zzso repeats at a 3' zzso zzso complexes form and are stable in high zzso The zzso properties of zzso resemble the characteristics of a class of zzso zzso proteins identified previously in zzso zzso
