The frequent detection of zzso zzso genes in a variety of zzso zzso in zzso 1988, zzso zzso 1988) suggests that zzso makes a significant contribution to human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso While the role of zzso in zzso is zzso it is well-established that the association of zzso protein with the inner surface of the plasma membrane is critical for triggering zzso zzso The trafficking of zzso proteins to the plasma membrane requires a series of three closely linked zzso modifications zzso zzso and zzso that are signaled by the consensus zzso zzso motif present on all zzso proteins zzso in zzso and Kim, zzso Gibbs, zzso zzso and Cox, zzso zzso recent discovery that an essential intermediate in cholesterol zzso the zzso zzso is attached zzso to zzso proteins has zzso considerable interest and has identified important new directions for studies of zzso zzso First, understanding the role of zzso interactions with the plasma membrane may identify the zzso basis for the zzso actions of zzso zzso Second, the zzso that catalyze the processing steps that trigger membrane association of zzso proteins are promising targets for zzso intervention in zzso zzso In this review, we zzso our current knowledge of the role of zzso processing in zzso interaction and transforming zzso We also provide an update of recent studies addressing the role of zzso modification in the function of zzso and of other zzso proteins zzso in James and Olson, zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso While this role is likely to be specific for each zzso zzso proteins can provide an excellent zzso for understanding the role of zzso modification in protein zzso
