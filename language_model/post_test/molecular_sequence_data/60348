zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso The active zzso from zzso zzso consists of two zzso (of zzso and zzso zzso as an zzso zzso whose assembly is zzso by zzso zzso The smaller of the protein zzso zzso has been suggested to be the zzso zzso Here we report the solution structure of zzso determined from a zzso zzso and the analysis of important zzso aspects of this zzso zzso The global fold and dynamic behavior of zzso in solution are similar to those of the corresponding zzso zzso from zzso zzso which has previously been investigated using zzso Both solution structures of the two zzso zzso zzso share striking similarities with that determined by zzso for the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which is B12 zzso In the crystal structure a zzso zzso zzso was found to be coordinated to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso However, in zzso and zzso the sequence zzso zzso which includes the zzso zzso zzso and a predicted zzso region following the zzso are present as an zzso and highly mobile zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso site apparently is only partially zzso By comparing the crystal structure of zzso with the solution structures of zzso zzso and zzso a consistent picture on the mechanism of B12 binding has been zzso Important elements of the binding site only become structured upon binding zzso these include the zzso zzso zzso and an alpha zzso that forms one side of the zzso accommodating the zzso zzso of the zzso
