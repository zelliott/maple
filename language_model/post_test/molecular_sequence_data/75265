zzso acid sequences deduced from rat complementary DNA clones zzso the zzso growth factor II zzso zzso closely resemble those of the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting they are identical zzso It is also shown that zzso receptors are zzso by immobilized zzso and are specifically zzso with zzso Furthermore, zzso specifically increases by about two times the apparent affinity of the zzso rat zzso zzso for zzso zzso These results indicate that the type II zzso zzso contains zzso zzso binding sites for both zzso and zzso zzso
