zzso the rod cell zzso zzso rapid zzso upon exposure to light, resulting in zzso of the zzso from its G zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso of zzso is the first step in this process, followed by the binding of zzso In this study, a series of zzso was generated in which these zzso zzso zzso sites were zzso with zzso These zzso were expressed in zzso cells and analyzed for their ability to be zzso by zzso zzso and to bind zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso can efficiently zzso other zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of the sites reported to be the preferred zzso for zzso zzso A correlation was observed between the level of zzso zzso and the amount of zzso binding to these zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated a significant reduction in zzso binding even though the level of zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso was not sufficient to promote the binding of zzso in the absence of zzso by zzso zzso When zzso was zzso its ability to bind zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso binding to zzso zzso did not increase to the level observed for zzso zzso These results suggest that 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso play important but distinct roles in promoting the binding of zzso to zzso
