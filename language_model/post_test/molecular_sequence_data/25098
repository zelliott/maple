Recently, a procedure for detecting zzso proteins that contain active zzso zzso was zzso The method is based on the fact that zzso zzso zzso and zzso competitively and selectively react with the active zzso zzso in zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in cervical cancer, zzso labeling on zzso proteins in normal and cancer zzso was performed, zzso The zzso labeling proteins are separated by zzso zzso and then identified by zzso mass zzso zzso protein is identified as zzso zzso B containing zzso zzso in active zzso zzso of zzso zzso B in normal tissue is higher than that of oxidized form in cervical cancer zzso The result suggests that zzso play an important role in zzso regulation in cervical cancer zzso However, molecular mechanisms that zzso and zzso zzso B are integrated into a zzso signal leading to the cellular transformation remain to be zzso
