In beans, expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso the major seed storage protein of bean zzso zzso is confined to the zzso of developing zzso zzso has not been detected in the zzso which remains liquid and is lost early in zzso However, fusion zzso between the zzso promoter and the zzso region yield expression in both zzso and zzso of developing seeds from transgenic tobacco zzso zzso zzso Although elements extending zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site are known to zzso zzso zzso the zzso 295 zzso zzso are sufficient to drive high levels of zzso zzso zzso This region was dissected into three zzso a 68 zzso element zzso specific zzso zzso zzso to zzso a middle region zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso Different promoter zzso containing the zzso or middle region upstream of zzso or a zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso to zzso were fused to zzso Each construct was expressed in seed, but not in zzso zzso Use of the various zzso promoter regions yielded notable differences in relative zzso activity in zzso or zzso zzso of both the zzso and middle region resulted in higher activity than the sum of adding either element alone to zzso indicating synergistic interaction between these zzso zzso from plants transformed with the zzso 227 zzso of promoter zzso showed zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso containing two copies of the zzso element were zzso expressed in the zzso These results illustrate the modular nature of the zzso zzso promoter, where distinct elements contribute to high levels of expression in different parts of the zzso
