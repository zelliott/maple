zzso cell death zzso is a mechanism implicated in many zzso and pathological zzso Until recently, zzso zzso was the most largely studied mechanism of zzso but a growing number of laboratories are now interested in zzso zzso In the past few years data showing a tight link between both pathways has zzso Until now our laboratory used zzso zzso a zzso model in which in zzso experiments are possible, to study zzso Recently, we showed that zzso also occurs in the development of zzso zzso and that the specific markers of both types of death are found in the same zzso and/or in the same zzso These results drove us to zzso that zzso zzso can be a good model to study the link between zzso and zzso In this article, we conducted an in zzso study of zzso zzso We explored the zzso of zzso zzso of the second zzso zzso zzso and those of the classical biological models zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Homo zzso to extract and compare zzso gene zzso This zzso study was completed by an analysis of: zzso zzso profile expression during development and zzso the zzso of zzso protein by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results allowed us to conclude that a complex zzso machinery is present in zzso zzso Actually, the number of zzso genes in zzso zzso is comparable to the number of zzso genes in zzso
