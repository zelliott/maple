zzso and zzso are the major zzso zzso in zzso In many species, zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso amounts in zzso dominate over zzso and zzso zzso An imperfect zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso is known to result in higher transcript levels of the first zzso Here, we examined the zzso zzso and asked how the second gene in a heat shock zzso can be zzso expressed and found that an zzso structure in the zzso region of zzso is zzso The secondary structure masks the zzso zzso sequence and zzso start zzso and thereby zzso translation of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso combined with structure probing and zzso analysis revealed a dynamic zzso zzso zzso Following an increase in temperature, only the second of two zzso zzso melts and partially zzso the zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso of zzso is not zzso leading to an excess of the zzso in the cell at low zzso zzso in a broader context shows how structured zzso segments can zzso control expression of zzso zzso in various zzso
