zzso duck flocks in zzso province, southern China, have been suffering a widely spreading infectious disease with abrupt egg drops and death since the winter of zzso However, the zzso pathogen was not zzso We obtained two independent virus zzso named zzso and zzso from the diseased layer duck flocks and identified them as zzso zzso virus by zzso zzso sequencing the entire length of the open reading frames zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso shared high sequence similarity to the zzso of zzso zzso virus that was first emerged in eastern China in April zzso zzso analysis shows that the whole zzso sequences of zzso and zzso have the highest similarity zzso zzso to zzso first reported zzso zzso zzso and zzso (the first reported zzso zzso zzso indicating that the full-length zzso were highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso The present study suggests that zzso zzso viruses have spread fast from eastern China to southern China, causing widely spreading zzso The high conservation of zzso zzso virus strains provides the zzso basis for choosing the strains for vaccine preparation for better protection against this new virus zzso
