zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the sixth zzso of zzso zzso transcribed from a single promoter is markedly induced during zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in all zzso To determine zzso elements of the human zzso zzso the promoter region of the gene was isolated, and three potential zzso motifs and four zzso boxes were found within this zzso In a functional analysis of various deletion zzso we found that the zzso binding site at zzso to zzso was essential for basic and zzso expressions of the zzso gene in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso bound to the region is required for the expression and this was confirmed by observations that the nuclear protein bound to the zzso motif was zzso with anti zzso zzso by gel mobility shift zzso Furthermore, zzso of mouse zzso in zzso cells led to an increase in the promoter activity, which was markedly increased by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an important role in regulation of zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
