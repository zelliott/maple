zzso protein 3 zzso is a 70 zzso zzso zzso which has been identified as a plasma zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso In this study, we have characterized the expression profile and activity of zzso in the chicken, zzso zzso This is the first report of this protein in a zzso species and reveals novel details about the molecular structure of, and specific features of the expression of, important molecules in zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso inhibited chicken zzso zzso activity in zzso and increased plasma zzso zzso in zzso Chicken zzso zzso expression was detected only in the zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in mature zzso egg zzso chickens than in immature zzso However, this increase was not associated with zzso although zzso does enhance zzso and very low density zzso zzso by the chicken zzso Changes in chicken zzso zzso expression with nutritional state were zzso zzso expression was affected by certain nutritional treatments, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso gene expression in the zzso of chickens fed a zzso diet was lower than that in the zzso of chickens fed a control zzso The present study is the first to zzso characterize and analyze the gene expression of zzso and suggests that in avian species zzso plays a key role in zzso delivery to the zzso
