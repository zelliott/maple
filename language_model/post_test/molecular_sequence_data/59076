The pea zzso zzso gene encodes an abundant seed zzso Its zzso expression pattern is zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso Progressive zzso promoter deletions resulted in a gradual decrease of zzso activity in tobacco zzso A zzso of 115 zzso still zzso zzso expression albeit at a low zzso This zzso contains a 22 zzso element zzso which has been demonstrated to be important for zzso expression when coupled as a zzso to a zzso zzso box zzso zzso et zzso Plant Cell zzso zzso Here we show that deletion of zzso in the natural promoter context resulted in a strongly decreased level of gene zzso A 4 zzso zzso of zzso reduced the expression of truncated derivatives of the zzso zzso A single copy of zzso coupled to the zzso box of the zzso zzso promoter directed low gene expression in seeds and zzso zzso enhanced the expression in seeds up to zzso to levels found with the zzso promoter, whereas the expression level in leaves remained zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso element is an essential control element in the zzso zzso When taken out of its natural context and zzso it is sufficient for high expression in zzso
