The interactions of zzso zzso and its protein environment in zzso zzso were examined in a zzso molecular dynamics zzso The simulation used was previously shown to demonstrate a zzso zzso zzso that closely agreed with the zzso determined limiting zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of zzso side chain dynamics and its protein environment has now been completed and correlated to other zzso properties of this zzso zzso fluctuations of the side chain occur at rates of zzso zzso and are limited to zzso zzso zzso in all zzso Side chain motions are primarily limited by zzso collisions, although most side chain atoms have some zzso contact with polar atoms in the adjacent protein zzso or zzso The zzso relationship between zzso and zzso changes abruptly at 16 zzso into the zzso Two types of interaction with water are zzso First, a structural water appears to zzso with the greater than zzso group of zzso Second, water frequently contacts the zzso zzso The zzso field experienced by the zzso rings appears to be relatively constant and featureless regardless of ring zzso We make the following zzso from our zzso The fluorescent zzso of zzso may be zzso relative to zzso in zzso zzso either as a result of specific interactions with the structural water or relaxations of zzso bulk water and polar protein zzso The zzso efficiency of polar interactions with zzso must be extremely low given their frequency and the high quantum yield of zzso This low efficiency may be due to restricted and zzso interaction zzso zzso is located near two zzso zzso zzso in zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso phenomena by virtue of a zzso interaction with zzso The interaction of bulk water with zzso illustrates features of the gated transition state model for transient exposure to zzso added zzso zzso zzso The restrictive environment of zzso suggests that zzso zzso can only occur via interactions with the edge of the zzso zzso ring and that the efficiency of a zzso in a protein environment is likely to be a function of molecular zzso
