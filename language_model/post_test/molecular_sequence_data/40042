zzso zzso zzso transfer protein zzso is a zzso zzso capable of transferring zzso zzso and zzso zzso between membrane zzso It has been reported that zzso present in the zzso of zzso is zzso zzso and determines zzso zzso We provide evidence for the expression of an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso where the zzso 15 zzso acids of zzso are replaced by an alternative zzso of 16 zzso zzso zzso is the product of the first 11 zzso whereas zzso is a product of the first 10 zzso followed by the zzso zzso 11 being zzso Both zzso zzso are capable of zzso and zzso transfer, with zzso being unable to transport zzso zzso is zzso zzso with the highest amounts of zzso found in zzso cells and in rat zzso zzso cells express only zzso whereas rat liver expresses both zzso zzso in similar zzso In both cell types, zzso is zzso zzso and both the zzso and zzso forms of zzso are zzso In contrast, zzso lacks the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso Nonetheless, both zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and, moreover, zzso of zzso of zzso does not affect its zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso adds an extra level of zzso complexity and, in rat liver, the single gene for zzso gives rise to seven distinct protein species that can be resolved on the basis of their charge zzso
