The analysis of the zzso associated to the zzso particles produced by the zzso element revealed the specific packaging of three major zzso species, in about equal zzso the replication primer zzso zzso the zzso and a zzso zzso until now as an expressed species in zzso The latter zzso is coded by the already described zzso This zzso is enriched more than 150 fold in the particles as compared to its content in total cellular zzso where it represents less than zzso zzso zzso and zzso being 11 and 4 fold enriched zzso This zzso is the only species coded by the zzso gene which is found in three copies per zzso since no other corresponding expressed zzso could be zzso This gene is thus very poorly zzso The high concentration of zzso in the particles compared to its very low cellular content led us to consider its possible implication in Ty specific zzso
