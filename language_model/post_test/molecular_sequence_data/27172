This work was aimed at investigating the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso when zzso with other zzso zzso The growth and survival of zzso zzso zzso was not affected when zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso analysis showed that the level of protein expression of zzso zzso zzso increased under zzso zzso Although several proteins were commonly induced in both zzso the highest induction was found in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso related to zzso and stress response mechanisms, were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As shown by real-time zzso expression of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was also affected during zzso According to zzso of zzso and zzso during zzso synthesis of zzso substances was also influenced by the type of microbial zzso This study showed that expression of some zzso also zzso in zzso zzso was influenced by zzso of other zzso zzso
