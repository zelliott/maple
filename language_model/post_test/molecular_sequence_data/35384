zzso is one of the most zzso and abundant molecular zzso and is an essential component of the protective stress zzso however, its roles in zzso stress responses in soybean zzso zzso remain zzso Here, 12 zzso genes from soybean were identified and found to be expressed and to function zzso under zzso zzso The 12 zzso genes were isolated and named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on their characteristics and high zzso to other zzso according to a new nomenclature zzso zzso real-time zzso expression data revealed that all the genes exhibited higher transcript levels in leaves and could be strongly induced under heat, zzso and salt stress but not cold zzso zzso of five typical genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso provided useful zzso that zzso genes can decrease damage of zzso zzso In addition, an abnormal zzso of zzso was detected in some transgenic zzso plants suggested zzso zzso may affect the synthesis and response system of zzso Our work represents a systematic determination of soybean genes zzso zzso and provides useful evidence that zzso genes function differently in response to zzso stresses and may affect the synthesis and response system of zzso
