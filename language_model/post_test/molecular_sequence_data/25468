From zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso an zzso zzso shares many physical and chemical properties with zzso zzso zzso zzso the key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso From 60 g zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso was zzso zzso to zzso with an overall yield of zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso with a zzso Mr of zzso With 1 zzso zzso zzso approximately 5 zzso and 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso 23 zzso the specific activity at pH zzso is 297 zzso zzso With excess zzso the zzso is reduced to the zzso complex and, by addition of zzso it is zzso indicating that it can cycle between the oxidized state E and the zzso state, zzso zzso As shown by zzso sequencing of the zzso 21 out of 30 positions are identical with those of pig heart and human liver zzso zzso The zzso section comprises the zzso stretch, which represents the binding site for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso After reduction of zzso to the zzso state, the zzso is specifically inhibited by the zzso drug zzso zzso presumably by zzso at one of the nascent zzso zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are specific for the respective zzso as shown by zzso of the pure proteins and of cell zzso
