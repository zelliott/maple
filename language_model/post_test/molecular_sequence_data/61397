An artificial tandem protein was generated using the third repeat of the zzso zzso domain, and its DNA binding affinity and specificity were analyzed by a filter binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso Although this artificial protein had the proper secondary structure, which is similar to the third repeat by itself, it could not bind to the expected base sequences zzso Compared with the successful results of the zinc finger fusion proteins with novel sequence zzso the zzso between the adjacent repeats, observed in the zzso complex, should also be required for the DNA recognition by the artificial tandem zzso Using the previous analyses of the DNA binding zzso by zzso zzso zzso the differences in the DNA recognition mechanisms between the animal and plant zzso zzso are also zzso
