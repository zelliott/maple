zzso in four members of the zzso gene family have been shown to zzso distinct genetic forms of deafness, including zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have found that zzso in a fifth member of this family, zzso zzso appear to cause a common form of deafness in African zzso We identified two different zzso zzso in four of 26 African American zzso Three were zzso for a zzso substitution in the absolutely zzso zzso 11, whereas the other was zzso for a zzso zzso at the highly zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso was detected in DNA from 100 control subjects without zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso as is demonstrated by zzso amplification from human fetal cochlear zzso and by zzso of mouse cochlear zzso zzso zzso of mouse cochlear preparations showed zzso for zzso in zzso zzso cells and in zzso of the spiral ligament and the spiral zzso To our knowledge this is the first alpha zzso gene to be associated with zzso zzso zzso must also play a critical role in the physiology of hearing, presumably by participating in the recycling of zzso to the cochlear zzso
