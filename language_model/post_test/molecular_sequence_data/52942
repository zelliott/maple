A highly abundant and zzso small zzso about 205 to 210 bases long named zzso zzso has been identified in zzso zzso It was localized on the zzso within a zzso zzso space of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso A database search at the DNA level revealed the highest similarity to a sequence located within the zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso that was also shown to be transcribed into two abundant, but smaller zzso than the ones in zzso zzso The zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso have the potential to code for zzso zzso and zzso zzso but so far, these peptides have not been identified zzso in bacterial protein zzso
