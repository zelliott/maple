The largest family of zzso zzso zzso factors is that containing the zzso box, or zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of these proteins functions as a zzso zzso with the downstream zzso motifs providing zzso zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso factor zzso zzso which contains a zzso domain but lacks a zzso zzso Western zzso analysis identified zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso localized these proteins primarily to the zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso for zzso transcripts confirms the selective expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso we could detect no zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso However zzso appears to be capable of interacting with the zzso zzso and exhibits zzso zzso activity when fused to zzso zzso binding domain zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequence suggests that the zzso transcript may result from zzso of a longer zzso containing zzso
