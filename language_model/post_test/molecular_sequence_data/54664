A variable migration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso spots in two-dimensional zzso gel patterns of total zzso zzso zzso has been detected during population screening in two differently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso differing in apparent molecular weights tended to form only zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso in a zzso strain while all zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in a zzso zzso zzso the zzso population significantly deviated from the zzso principle zzso test, zzso zzso due to a lack of zzso while the zzso population zzso to the zzso equilibrium zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso from a partial chemical zzso zzso or limited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso seem to indicate that altered zzso acid sequence segments might be located either at the zzso end of zzso domain or in the zzso domain zzso
