An zzso inversion was previously identified in a 9-month-old male patient with complex zzso heart zzso altered lung zzso zzso liver, and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was inherited from the zzso normal zzso We termed these regions zzso zzso in zzso A at zzso and zzso at zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the inversion zzso and the gene that is disrupted by the zzso zzso The putative zzso is identical to the zzso zzso which was originally identified as a gene that zzso the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso group zzso The zzso zzso was found to be zzso by a large zzso at least 300 zzso long, composed of 15 zzso The function of the gene product remains largely zzso However, the near central portion of the zzso protein is predicted to contain a zzso domain, which has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso Southern analyses and zzso in zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso in the patient and his father lies within the zzso between zzso 6 and 7 of zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated strong expression in human fetal and adult zzso and in mouse embryonic zzso and adult zzso zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso also showed that the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso zzso Several hypotheses are discussed to explain the relationship between the zzso inversion and the accompanying zzso
