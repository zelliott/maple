At Department of Energy Site zzso beneficial hydrocarbon zzso and favorable subsurface conditions facilitate sequential reductive zzso of zzso zzso and rapid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso upon periodic oxygen zzso We assessed the zzso and microbial community of groundwater from across the zzso zzso of zzso was shown to coincide with oxygen influx in zzso groundwater near the source zzso Principal component analysis of zzso and zzso compounds showed that monitoring zzso could be differentiated based upon zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar communities were detected in groundwater from zzso containing zzso high zzso and low nitrate zzso zzso identified by sequencing zzso zzso genes belonged to seven zzso groups, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas members of the zzso and zzso group were abundant in all zzso zzso zzso zzso gene copies zzso quantitative zzso showed that zzso were elevated zzso zzso only in zzso containing hydrocarbon zzso The study shows that bacterial community structure is related to groundwater zzso and that zzso are enriched in locales where zzso removal zzso
