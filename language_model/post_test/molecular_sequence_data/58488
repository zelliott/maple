zzso a skeletal disorder of inadequate bone zzso with an abnormal increase in skeletal mass, results from a variety of independent single gene zzso that affect zzso differentiation and/or zzso The zzso zzso zzso is one of four spontaneous, zzso zzso in rats that result in zzso In zzso progeny of zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 carriers, we mapped this locus by linkage analysis with zzso markers to rat zzso zzso The linkage group zzso as well as zzso 15 anonymous DNA zzso and 9 DNA zzso associated with genes zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso sex hormone binding zzso zzso C, zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso leukemia avian viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso The markers for these zzso include nine not previously zzso The zzso locus mapped to the end of the zzso 10 linkage group, within 1 zzso of the anonymous DNA zzso zzso Based on its location, the zzso gene is likely to be distinct from seven described zzso in mice as well as three other zzso in zzso These results may permit a zzso cloning strategy to be undertaken to identify the gene and zzso underlying the zzso zzso
