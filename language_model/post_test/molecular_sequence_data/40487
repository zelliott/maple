Although the N zzso of the prion protein zzso has been shown to directly associate with zzso zzso the precise zzso zzso basis, and functional implications of such zzso particularly in relation to zzso occurring fragments, are zzso To better understand these issues, we studied a range of synthetic zzso specifically those zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments derived from zzso processing of zzso and including those representing arbitrarily defined component zzso of the N zzso of mouse prion zzso zzso more zzso relevant large zzso zzso zzso studies at zzso pH zzso showed absent binding of all peptides to lipids containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso or zzso At pH 5, typical of early zzso zzso crystal zzso with dissipation showed the highest affinity binding occurred with zzso and zzso selective for zzso zzso zzso Of particular note, the absence of binding by individual peptides representing component zzso underscored the importance of the combination of the zzso repeat and the zzso zzso regions for effective membrane zzso In addition, using zzso crystal zzso with dissipation and solid-state zzso we characterized for the first time that both zzso and zzso deeply insert into the zzso zzso with minimal zzso Potential functional implications related to cellular stress responses are zzso
