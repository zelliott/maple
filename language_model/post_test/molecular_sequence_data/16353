The DNA coding for parts of the repetitive zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso protein has been spliced to a sequence zzso part of the precursor to the major zzso surface zzso to produce a hybrid zzso zzso in zzso coli produces a protein with zzso zzso from both malaria zzso zzso raised against the expressed material react with both a zzso derived from the zzso repeat zzso and the zzso surface zzso zzso molecules of this type may be the basis of a malaria zzso
