zzso human zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso and several zzso with zzso sequences modified by addition or deletion of one or two zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been expressed in zzso cells and in zzso coli, respectively, zzso to zzso and zzso The observed values for the molecular mass of zzso and zzso are in complete agreement with the predicted values for a correctly folded structure containing seven zzso zzso Moreover, the relative proportions of the various types of secondary structures of the zzso of zzso as measured by CD zzso are similar to that found for native zzso pancreatic zzso indicating that the zzso proteins are correctly zzso zzso activities of zzso with modified zzso decreased to zzso of the activity of the mature zzso emphasizing a key role of the zzso for zzso zzso
