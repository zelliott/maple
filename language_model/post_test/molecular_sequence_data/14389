zzso zzso a widely used zzso drug, zzso the DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Prior studies implicated a zzso zzso numbers of tandem zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso of the zzso gene as a zzso of zzso expression in tumors and normal zzso and proposed that these zzso zzso could help decide zzso zzso Clinical associations between zzso toxicity and the zzso zzso were reported, however, results were inconsistent, suggesting that additional genetic variation in the zzso gene might influence zzso zzso We thus conducted a detailed genetic analysis of this region, defining new zzso in this gene including zzso zzso zzso repeats and novel single zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in the zzso genetic zzso Our zzso analysis of this region used data from both established and novel genetic zzso and found nine zzso zzso accounting for more than zzso of the studied zzso We observed zzso relationships between the zzso and adjacent zzso zzso such that each type of zzso commonly occurred on several zzso zzso Our results confirmed the expectation that the zzso zzso exhibit zzso and lack the common ancestry required for a reliable marker of a linked adjacent locus that might govern zzso We propose that it may be necessary in a clinical trial to zzso multiple types of genetic zzso in the zzso region to zzso model linkage of genetic markers to zzso zzso The presence of multiple long (up to 26 zzso zzso zzso repeats in the promoter region of the sole human zzso synthetic zzso is zzso
