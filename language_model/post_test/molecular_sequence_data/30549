zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of proteins at zzso zzso We have analyzed the zzso specificity of zzso from bovine adrenal zzso with a novel zzso using synthetic peptides as zzso The peptides were modeled after the known, or zzso zzso zzso sites of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso I) and zzso as well as the zzso zzso sites of zzso and zzso zzso the sequence of these zzso we found that zzso the apparent zzso of peptides with multiple zzso zzso sites decreased zzso with the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso acids were the major zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso acids adjacent to the zzso being more important than distant zzso zzso a zzso terminally located zzso zzso may be zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso but not of a zzso corresponding to the zzso site of zzso zzso These results zzso define structural zzso for the zzso specificity of zzso and show that this zzso and certain zzso zzso zzso have overlapping zzso zzso in zzso
