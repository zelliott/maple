Our understanding of the evolution of microbial pathogens has been advanced by the discovery of zzso of DNA that differ from core zzso and contain zzso of zzso The acquisition of zzso islands zzso by horizontal gene transfer zzso is thought to have played a major role in microbial zzso There are, however, few practical demonstrations of the acquisition of genes that control zzso and, significantly, all have been achieved outside the animal or plant zzso Loss of a zzso from the bean pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is driven by exposure to the stress imposed by the plant's resistance zzso Here, we show that the complete zzso island, which carries zzso genes including the zzso zzso transfers between strains of zzso by transformation in zzso and zzso at a specific zzso site in the zzso of the zzso Our results show that the evolution of bacterial pathogens by zzso may be achieved via zzso the simplest mechanism of DNA zzso This process is activated by exposure to plant defenses, when the pathogen is in greatest need of acquiring new genetic traits to alleviate the zzso stress imposed by plant innate zzso
