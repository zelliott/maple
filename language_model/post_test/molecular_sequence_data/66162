Combined zzso of factors V and VIII zzso is a bleeding disorder caused by zzso in zzso or zzso zzso encodes zzso a cargo zzso with an zzso zzso domain, and zzso is a zzso zzso We prepared a zzso soluble form of zzso which we labeled with zzso zzso zzso By flow zzso zzso bound to zzso cells in the presence of calcium but only after zzso with zzso Treating the cells with zzso H or zzso them with high zzso zzso especially zzso zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance experiments demonstrated that zzso specifically bound to zzso and 2 zzso zzso found in zzso patients had a zzso that was 3 or 4 orders of magnitude lower for zzso than for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was measured at several pH values and calcium zzso and we found that at a calcium concentration less than zzso zzso this interaction became significantly zzso These results demonstrate that the binding of zzso to sugar is enhanced by its interaction with zzso and defects in this interaction in zzso patients may be the cause for reduced zzso of factors V and zzso
