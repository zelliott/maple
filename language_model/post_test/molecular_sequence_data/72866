The full-length mouse Indian zzso zzso zzso was cloned from an embryonic zzso kidney library and was used to study the zzso processing of the zzso and zzso and spatial expression of the zzso zzso analysis predicted two putative translation initiation zzso zzso translation was initiated at both initiation sites when expressed in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso demonstrated that the internal translation initiation site was sufficient to produce the mature forms of zzso zzso zzso processing proceeded in a fashion similar to Sonic and zzso zzso the zzso form underwent signal zzso zzso as well as internal zzso processing to form a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso This processing required zzso present in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript was detected by in zzso zzso zzso as early as 10 days zzso zzso in developing gut, as early as zzso zzso in the cartilage zzso and in the developing zzso zzso In zzso reverse zzso chain reaction experiments, Indian zzso transcript was first detected in the mouse zzso at zzso zzso transcript abundance increased with zzso age, becoming zzso in zzso In adult zzso zzso transcript was detected only in the zzso convoluted zzso and zzso straight zzso
