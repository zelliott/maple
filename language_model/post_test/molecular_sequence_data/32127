zzso proteins often evolve zzso but it is not known if their divergence occurs within species and zzso with the evolution of zzso isolation, or if divergence typically accumulates between already isolated zzso We examined the evolution of a candidate zzso protein in several zzso and zzso populations of zzso blue mussels, species that zzso in zzso Within a single species, zzso zzso we found zzso divergence of zzso a zzso zzso protein that zzso the egg zzso envelope during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group into two distinct zzso zzso G and zzso and individual zzso in these zzso are separated from each other by at least three and up to zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates of selective pressure zzso zzso zzso selection in the divergence between zzso zzso zzso zzso and within the zzso zzso zzso tests of population differentiation indicate that the relative frequency of G and zzso zzso zzso differs significantly among zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso Mediterranean samples, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are found at elevated frequency in samples from the East Atlantic and California, areas of secondary contact and zzso between zzso species, and Australia, an area of unknown species zzso zzso divergence between the zzso most common in zzso and those found at elevated frequency in samples from zzso suggests that selection pressures acting in zzso zzso likely following zzso secondary contact with zzso zzso in the East Atlantic, drove the divergence of zzso in zzso zzso
