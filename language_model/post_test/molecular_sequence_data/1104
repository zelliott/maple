We describe a novel zzso system to control zzso expression in zzso The system is based on the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso for plant zzso usage and for nuclear targeting zzso The zzso protein bound in zzso to double stranded DNA zzso the zzso operator zzso as well as to single stranded zzso operator DNA zzso in an zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein was localized to the nucleus, whereas zzso fusion remained in the zzso The ability of zzso to repress zzso expression was validated in transgenic zzso zzso and zzso zzso When expressed zzso under the zzso promoter, zzso zzso the expression of the reporter gene zzso linked to a modified zzso promoter containing zzso operator sequences in the vicinity of the zzso box and downstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso ranged from 32 to zzso in zzso zzso and from 23 to zzso in zzso zzso These results are discussed in relation to the potential application of zzso in controlling the expression of zzso and zzso genes in plants and other zzso
