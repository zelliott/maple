Vitamin A zzso a global health burden, can be alleviated through zzso A zzso zzso of major crop staples such as zzso zzso zzso and other grasses in the zzso If regulation of zzso zzso was better zzso enhancement could be controlled by limiting zzso zzso to compounds with lower or no zzso A zzso Natural zzso genetic diversity enabled identification of zzso genes associated with reduced zzso zzso A zzso A novel approach was used to capture the genetic and zzso diversity of a large zzso collection, representing zzso of zzso genetic diversity, without having to sample the entire zzso zzso data sorting was applied to select a zzso genetically diverse subset representing zzso extremes for zzso kernel zzso zzso profiling led to discovery of the zzso locus that zzso mapped to a zzso quantitative trait zzso thereby prompting investigation of zzso variation in a broader zzso Three natural zzso in 51 zzso lines explained zzso of variation and approximately zzso difference in zzso relative to zzso and zzso of the variation and zzso difference in absolute levels of zzso A simple zzso zzso to track and identify zzso zzso will be valuable for predicting nutritional content in genetically diverse zzso found zzso
