zzso disease zzso is an zzso dominant disorder with a variable age of onset that is influenced by the sex of the affected zzso The recent recognition that HD is caused by an expanded zzso repeat suggests the possibility that the onset age may be predicted by the length of the zzso This hypothesis was tested by zzso the length of the repeat in 114 individuals who were clinically diagnosed with HD and had a known onset zzso Every individual had an expanded zzso The range was from 36 to 82 repeats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and larger than the normal range (6 to zzso The size of the expanded zzso was correlated with the age of onset zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Despite the highly significant zzso the repeat size explains less than half of the zzso in onset zzso Furthermore, the age of onset cannot be predicted from the size of the zzso zzso particularly if the number of repeats is in the smaller end of the expanded zzso If the repeat is zzso or zzso 50 zzso the amount of variation in the age of onset explained by the length of the zzso repeat is less than zzso As an zzso the onset age of individuals with 39 repeats ranges from 30 to 65 years zzso The sex of the affected parent had no effect in our sample beyond the effect of the length of the zzso zzso offspring of affected fathers had longer repeats and a larger zzso in zzso size than offspring of affected mothers, perhaps reflecting greater instability in paternal zzso
