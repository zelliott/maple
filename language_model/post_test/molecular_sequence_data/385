To gain insight on zzso DNA zzso evolution, we assembled and analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso comparisons across the zzso zzso zzso impart power for detecting zzso zzso regions that maintain zzso function and regions that evolve uniquely on zzso zzso rate varies across zzso regions of the zzso zzso evolving zzso regions harbor the majority of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, patterns of nearly perfect conservation within zzso regions reveal a refined set of zzso underlying the binding of zzso termination zzso zzso of zzso zzso ends indicates that zzso C zzso I zzso has a novel zzso start zzso and that perfectly zzso regions upstream of two zzso zzso zzso genes are transcribed and likely extend these protein zzso zzso at synonymous sites in the zzso zzso zzso reflect a zzso process that is biased toward A and T zzso and differs between zzso zzso zzso in zzso usage bias across genes reveal that weak selection at silent sites may offset the zzso zzso The zzso balance at synonymous sites has also zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso Rates of evolution are highly zzso across the zzso zzso with zzso accumulating many more zzso acid zzso than zzso These zzso zzso zzso rates of evolution vary across lineages and may reflect zzso and ecological change across the zzso zzso
