zzso zzso zzso in metallic zzso and zzso in living zzso Previous studies have focused mainly on the functions of zzso in zzso but the functions of zzso during zzso in zzso remain zzso In order to investigate the functions of zzso during zzso in the Japanese stone crab zzso zzso we identified the zzso zzso zzso complete zzso sequence from the total zzso of the zzso using zzso and zzso The 587 zzso zzso zzso zzso an 80 zzso zzso untranslated region, a zzso zzso 3' untranslated region, and a 174 zzso open reading zzso zzso has 57 zzso acids including 19 zzso The protein alignment between zzso sequences of zzso zzso and other zzso shows a high similarity and a strong identity in zzso zzso vital for the zzso affinity of zzso After the cadmium zzso exposure, the zzso displays both abnormal zzso and zzso zzso expression both of which indicate a sensitive response of zzso zzso to zzso zzso we suggest that zzso is an excellent zzso candidate for evaluating zzso zzso
