We have characterized a repeated DNA sequence zzso from rice zzso zzso zzso with respect to its organization in the rice zzso and its distribution among rice and other zzso The results indicate that the zzso sequence is zzso in the rice zzso and limited to the zzso zzso It is highly zzso and can be used to fingerprint rice zzso A structure was observed in which several repeated sequences were clustered in DNA regions of zzso zzso We characterized three zzso zzso clones that contained the zzso zzso Southern analysis using zzso derived from restriction fragments of the three zzso clones indicated that all fragments except one are zzso repeated sequences and belong to different repeated sequence zzso zzso slot zzso zzso showed that most of them are only present within the zzso zzso Some of the zzso physically linked sequences show the same zzso distribution, which suggests that these sequences might have evolved in a coordinate zzso On the other hand, some of the repeated sequences have a different distribution even though they are physically adjacent in the zzso We speculate that such blocks of zzso repeated sequences may serve as hotspots for rapid changes in the rice zzso
