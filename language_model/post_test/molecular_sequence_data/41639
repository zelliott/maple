zzso zzso contamination was evaluated in five rivers of Argentina between 2005 and zzso zzso was present in all sampled rivers, with distinct zzso patterns in waters impacted by zzso zzso In rivers affected by zzso populations zzso and zzso zzso only one or two zzso were present, zzso being the main one, with winter zzso In contrast, in the much more heavily populated area of zzso Aires city the prevalent zzso was accompanied by several additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso with no clear zzso zzso zzso was the main zzso detected zzso zzso and zzso analyses performed in region D of the zzso gene showed a most recent common zzso in 2002 and a substitution rate of zzso zzso per site per year zzso for this zzso still involving a significant population size with a slight decrease since zzso The zzso diffusion analysis proposed Europe as an intermediate path between the American Continent and the rest of the World for zzso zzso Given the importance of zzso as a cause of epidemic zzso and the likelihood of its environmental transmission, the results of this work should increase public and institutional awareness of the health risk involved in sewage zzso into the zzso Environmental surveillance of enteric viruses could be a very useful tool not only to prevent zzso outbreaks, but also to describe the epidemiology of the zzso The detailed analysis of the viral zzso disposed into the environment contributed to the characterization of the zzso diversity and zzso of zzso in its natural host zzso In future studies, environmental surveillance and molecular analysis should be zzso with a quantitative viral risk assessment for zzso the disease burden from viruses in the zzso
