Genome analysis of zzso zzso highlighted the presence of three zzso protein zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso whereas only one zzso gene zzso is found in the other zzso zzso zzso Here, we aligned the zzso zzso with characterized zzso from plants and found that they possess all the zzso zzso acid zzso identified as important for zzso zzso zzso We also carried out a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso together with bacterial and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso proteins is in conflict with the currently recognized zzso zzso zzso scenarios that might explain this zzso are discussed and involve either gene conversion or gene zzso zzso
