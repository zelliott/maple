zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the slow skeletal muscles of three representative species of tilapia, zzso Nile zzso zzso zzso blue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one hybrid zzso zzso female symbol zzso zzso zzso male symbol, and the primary structures were zzso All zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso base pairs, zzso 147 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso were completely zzso among these species, though species variations in the zzso sequences were recognized both in coding and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence identity was around zzso compared to other zzso zzso In comparison of each zzso segment (A through zzso and the zzso regions to the counterparts of tuna zzso the zzso segments C and F as well as the zzso regions zzso and zzso were zzso The identities of zzso segments B and H and the zzso region zzso were relatively zzso zzso were also recognized in the zzso plot and the zzso structures obtained by zzso zzso The zzso rates at 25 degrees C of zzso fraction from the slow skeletal muscle were essentially the same among the above zzso species, as expected from the zzso zzso acid zzso
