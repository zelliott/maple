We have identified the gene responsible for the inherited zinc zzso in the lethal milk zzso zzso The zzso here designated zzso encodes a zzso protein that is zzso to two zzso zzso and zzso responsible for zzso of zinc into zzso compartments and synaptic zzso zzso We show that the zzso gene zzso zinc resistance to a zzso zzso strain and that it is abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso The lethal milk zzso has a nonsense zzso at zzso zzso 297 in the zzso zzso
