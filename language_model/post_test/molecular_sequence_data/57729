Based upon reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction results with human zzso cell zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso corresponded to a zzso zzso zzso zzso found in several tumor cell zzso The remaining zzso of this zzso zzso was cloned by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A full length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely a zzso that contains four open reading zzso Based upon sequence analysis of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely processed from a gene containing at least six zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of human tumor cell lines and an zzso from is expressed in a zzso zzso
