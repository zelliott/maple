We propose that regions outside the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso influence its biological zzso Here we evaluate if sequence variation of the zzso regions of rabbit and canine zzso changes their biological zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso from rabbit zzso extracts by reverse phase and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The zzso was characterized by zzso and mass spectral zzso of the intact and zzso zzso zzso and rabbit zzso were evaluated for their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The sequence of rabbit zzso differs from that of canine zzso in 9 of the zzso terminal 40 zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso more potent than rabbit zzso for zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso but about the same potency for stimulation of zzso release from zzso zzso zzso The canine zzso was zzso more zzso than rabbit zzso 

zzso and rabbit zzso have different biological and zzso properties that can only result from differences in their zzso sequences which influence the properties of their identical zzso zzso These results are the first direct demonstration that zzso acids outside the zzso of zzso influence zzso biological zzso
