zzso has the significant relationship with the high prevalence of zzso zzso a zzso duct zzso in the endemic areas in Southeast zzso To reveal the molecular mechanism of the zzso induced by zzso zzso infection, the present study investigated the kinetic expression of RB zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during the development of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The results of quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction indicated that the expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso during the development of zzso induced by infection plus zzso treatment in a zzso zzso On the other hand, the expressions of zzso D1 and zzso were zzso The expression zzso was corresponding to the pathological progression of the zzso zzso revealed by zzso zzso Moreover, the analysis of the expression of these genes in human zzso zzso cases showed the decreased expression of zzso and zzso in 50% and zzso cases and zzso of zzso D1 and zzso in half cases, zzso The results suggested that RB zzso is likely involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and proposed the potential application of some of these genes as zzso in zzso and molecular therapy of the zzso zzso
