Human zzso zzso cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including the most prevalent viral sexually transmitted disease, zzso zzso zzso is found in a greater number of zzso warts than any other zzso To increase our understanding of the structural and functional relationships between zzso zzso and to provide information for zzso studies, the sequences of the zzso E6 and zzso coding regions of zzso zzso in clinical samples were zzso This sequence analysis was performed on zzso originally designated zzso on the basis of analysis of patterns generated by restriction zzso zzso It was found that the designation of zzso on the basis of restriction zzso zzso correlated poorly with the designation of zzso on the basis of sequence zzso in fact, the clinical zzso were clearly zzso into zzso and zzso groups, with the previously described zzso being a member of the zzso zzso It was also found that the zzso zzso protein is a much less potent zzso of zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso our previous results with the zzso zzso protein to this second zzso zzso zzso These studies indicate that the zzso acid differences observed between these natural zzso of the zzso zzso protein do not affect its zzso
