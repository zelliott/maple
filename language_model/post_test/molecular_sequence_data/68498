Major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso chain zzso gene and the zzso class II molecules are physically and functionally associated within class zzso cell zzso These genes are generally zzso in various cell types and zzso induced by zzso such as zzso zzso Human zzso gene shares a regulatory mechanism with zzso class II genes via the X and Y zzso zzso zzso X and Y are required for zzso expression in B zzso cell lines and for induction by zzso in a zzso cell zzso The zzso element zzso contributes zzso zzso activity to class II gene zzso and an S zzso has been implied in zzso gene zzso Now we report that along with X and Y, the zzso S box functions in a positive manner to regulate zzso zzso in B cell lines but not in T cell zzso In addition, zzso and Y are all necessary for induced expression of zzso in an zzso zzso cell line and in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso X and Y elements zzso with the presence of in zzso zzso interactions in zzso zzso Most interestingly, in zzso interactions are induced upon zzso induction in a zzso zzso Thus, the zzso promoter contains elements that zzso regulate expression with the zzso class II zzso and these functional sites are contacted in zzso emphasizing their importance in zzso gene zzso
