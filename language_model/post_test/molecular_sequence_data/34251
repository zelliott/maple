zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso scaffolding protein involved in brain development, zzso formation, and establishment of cell zzso To accomplish these diverse functions, zzso zzso in numerous zzso zzso In particular, zzso forms competing zzso and zzso zzso complexes that physically associate with the zzso tail of zzso a zzso protein enriched at zzso zzso This study shows that a short linear zzso zzso motif from zzso is necessary and sufficient for binding zzso We also identified the zzso binding site for the zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso A related zzso zzso from zzso was also discovered to be sufficient for zzso zzso all human proteins for the zzso consensus zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso invasion and zzso 1 zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso that was also found to be sufficient for zzso binding in zzso zzso is well known for its role in tumor zzso but it also possesses overlapping cellular and neurological functions with zzso suggesting a previously unknown cooperation between the two zzso This new zzso interaction motif also explains how zzso and zzso form competing complexes and suggests a new role for the cellular hub protein zzso
