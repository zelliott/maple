In zzso zzso zzso species, functional embryonic muscle is not zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso supplied factor for embryonic muscle zzso The failure of embryonic muscle development in zzso zzso may be due to the suppression of zzso zzso In this paper, however, we report the expression of zzso in zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso has lost the zzso potential to form functional embryonic muscle, zzso was expressed in a very similar manner as in zzso zzso This result, together with those of previous studies, strongly suggests that in zzso zzso the upstream genetic cascade responsible for muscle formation is intact, while the downstream cascade including the expression of muscle structural genes is severely zzso
