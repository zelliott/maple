Why is agreement on one particular name for each gene zzso As one zzso after another becomes zzso it is imperative to consider the complexity of zzso genetic architecture, gene zzso zzso and zzso interactions and evolutionary zzso across zzso To agree on a particular gene name not only makes one's own research easier, it aids automated zzso zzso and search engines, which are increasingly employed to find relationships in the millions of abstracts in the medical research literature and sequence zzso A common nomenclature system will also be helpful to the present generation, as well as future generations, of graduate students and zzso fellows who are about to enter zzso zzso In this paper, the authors present some problems that arose when two separate research communities decided to choose the same zzso zzso for naming their gene zzso They then offer a logical solution, by zzso the zzso genes with a common zzso such as zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and using evolutionary divergence to cluster genes of the highest level of zzso
