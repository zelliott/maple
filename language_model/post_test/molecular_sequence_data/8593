Previous studies of zzso coli zzso have shown that zzso of zzso zzso lowers zzso by 5 orders of zzso As shown here, introduction of a second zzso zzso that zzso a positive charge in the active site increases activity of zzso by 100 fold, suggesting that part of the effect of the zzso zzso may be attributed to zzso charge zzso This conclusion is supported by the fact that the zzso zzso shows a pH dependence that is the reverse of the wild type zzso whereas the double zzso has a pH dependence that resembles that of wild type zzso although somewhat zzso
