zzso immune recognition of microbes is a complex process that can be influenced by both the host and the zzso zzso uses two distinct immune signaling zzso the Toll and immune zzso zzso zzso to respond to different classes of zzso The Toll zzso is predominantly activated by zzso bacteria and zzso while the zzso zzso is primarily activated by zzso zzso Recent work has suggested that this differential zzso is achieved through zzso recognition protein zzso recognition of specific forms of zzso zzso In this study, we have further analyzed the specific PG molecular requirements for zzso zzso through the pattern recognition zzso zzso in both cultured cell line and in zzso We found that two signatures of zzso zzso the presence of zzso acid in the zzso bridge and a zzso form of zzso acid in the zzso chain, allow discrimination between zzso and zzso zzso Our results also point to a role for PG zzso in zzso zzso and we demonstrate that elements of both the sugar backbone and the zzso bridge of PG are required for optimum zzso Altogether, these results indicate multiple requirements for efficient zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and demonstrate that PG is a complex immune zzso
