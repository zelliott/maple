zzso zzso continues to be a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and is endemic in communities around Lake zzso Interest is growing in the molecular evolution and population genetic structure of zzso zzso and we describe a detailed analysis of the molecular epidemiology and zzso of zzso zzso from Lake zzso In total, 388 zzso zzso 1 zzso sequences were obtained from 25 sites along the zzso zzso and Kenyan zzso of Lake Victoria, and 122 unique zzso were zzso 9 corresponded to previously discovered zzso from Lakes Victoria and zzso A subset of the data, composed of zzso sequences from zzso from 10 individual children, was used for population zzso zzso these results were zzso by zzso analysis of 4 zzso of zzso adult zzso Overall, 12 zzso were found to be shared across all 3 countries, whereas the majority occurred zzso and were locally zzso The population zzso analyses were in agreement in revealing high diversity at the level of the human host and negligible population structuring by zzso The lack of correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance in these data may be attributed to the zzso influence of high zzso diversity as well as human migration between zzso
