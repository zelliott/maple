The zzso gene first appeared in the common zzso of plants, animals, and zzso and is required in the male zzso for fusion to the female zzso in the zzso organisms zzso and zzso We have identified a zzso gene in the zzso sequence of the sponge zzso zzso This finding provides a continuous evolutionary history of zzso from zzso organisms into the zzso zzso Divergent versions of the zzso gene are also present in the zzso of some but not all zzso By examining the expression of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso we have found the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that zzso was used for male zzso fusion in the zzso of extant zzso and that it retains that function in modern zzso
