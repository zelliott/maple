zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that functions in the C4 zzso of zzso The light regulation is believed to be zzso in zzso by zzso reduction and zzso of zzso zzso The rates of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso are strongly influenced by the zzso zzso that seem to ultimately determine the zzso extent of zzso in zzso 

The X-ray structure of the zzso oxidized zzso was determined at zzso A zzso The core structure is zzso to zzso zzso zzso Two zzso and zzso zzso bonds are present, one in the zzso extension and the other in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso oxidized zzso is constrained by its zzso bond to fold into the active site over zzso hydrogen bonding to the zzso zzso as well as zzso access of the C4 acid zzso Two zzso zzso the active site, termed the zzso and zzso zzso that contain the C4 acid zzso binding zzso are prevented from closing by the zzso zzso 

The structure explains the role of the zzso extension in zzso zzso The negative C zzso will interact more strongly with the positively charged zzso of zzso than zzso explaining why the zzso affinities of the zzso differ so markedly from those of all other zzso zzso acid zzso zzso may also slow zzso of the C zzso upon reduction, providing a mechanism for the zzso of zzso by zzso but not zzso
