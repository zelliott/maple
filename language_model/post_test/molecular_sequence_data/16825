zzso syndrome zzso the zzso dominant form of the zzso long zzso syndrome, is zzso by zzso of the cardiac zzso process associated with zzso zzso of the zzso de zzso zzso zzso studies have identified zzso in six zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the accessory protein zzso zzso to be responsible for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and subsequent DNA sequence analysis have identified a zzso zzso in a family that were clinically conspicuous due to several zzso and prolonged zzso intervals in the zzso The zzso zzso was expressed and functionally zzso in the zzso zzso expression zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso with a C to T transition at the first position of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was identified in three concerned family members zzso zzso 500, 510 and zzso zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso zzso within the highly zzso zzso segment zzso of the zzso channel is replaced by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso produced zzso currents reduced by approximately zzso while zzso zzso experiments with a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded currents reduced by approximately zzso A novel zzso zzso identified in the zzso zzso gene of three members of a zzso family showed a zzso effect on native zzso currents leading to zzso of the heart zzso and possibly increases the risk of zzso zzso with sudden cardiac zzso
