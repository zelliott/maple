zzso has been shown to be involved in DNA zzso break zzso repair and zzso in zzso but its role in human cells is still under zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso and zzso repair after zzso of a zzso in a human zzso cell zzso zzso virus zzso zzso human zzso were zzso with a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso The main zzso were zzso protein level, zzso DNA zzso and DNA protein zzso activity, zzso survival, and zzso repair zzso After zzso of the zzso decreased zzso protein zzso zzso DNA zzso activity, and DNA protein zzso activity were observed in the zzso cellular zzso The zzso zzso with the zzso showed also a zzso zzso with a surviving fraction at 2 zzso of zzso compared with zzso for the control and zzso of zzso zzso observed at 24 hours after zzso compared with zzso for the zzso Several clones were also isolated with a decreased level of zzso zzso a surviving fraction at 2 zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso at 24 zzso This study is the first to show the implication of zzso in zzso repair and in the zzso of human zzso This investigation strongly suggests that zzso could constitute an appealing target for combining gene therapy and radiation zzso
