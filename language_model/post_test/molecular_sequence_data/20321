The zzso zzso purple zzso zzso zzso zzso harbors a zzso zzso oxygen and zzso domain zzso which shows a particular zzso zzso zzso perceive blue light by a zzso bound zzso and transmit the signal to various coupled output zzso zzso that harbor a zzso core, function zzso as zzso or zzso clock zzso zzso zzso which act as zzso between the zzso core and the output domain, were shown to be involved in the zzso zzso of the output zzso Like zzso from zzso zzso the zzso domain protein of zzso zzso is not coupled to an zzso domain and harbors an extended zzso alpha zzso We expressed the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso in zzso zzso The protein binds an zzso as a zzso and shows a zzso typical for zzso domain containing zzso In zzso zzso we detected the protein as well in the zzso as in the membrane zzso which was not reported for other bacterial zzso domain zzso
