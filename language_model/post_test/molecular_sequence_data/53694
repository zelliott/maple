We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso binding zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso zzso the first four zzso zzso zzso The overall structure of zzso is zzso due to contacts between zzso 1 and 4 and zzso 2 and zzso In the zzso these molecules are aligned in a string with adjacent molecules oriented in an zzso fashion and their C zzso perpendicular to the zzso This arrangement suggests that cell zzso by zzso zzso interaction occurs by the formation of a linear zzso array in which the zzso molecules are alternately provided by the two zzso zzso In accordance with this model, zzso in a loop critical for the formation of the zzso resulted in the loss of the zzso binding capacity of zzso
