The goal of this project was to obtain sequences of zzso 3 of zzso in order to develop a zzso typing protocol that provides a complete zzso zzso 3 zzso Current protocols do not provide complete sequences of zzso 3, thus not allowing to differentiate common and well-documented zzso zzso and zzso and resolve some common zzso with zzso sequencing primer zzso sequencing using positions zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the most common zzso zzso were used to obtain zzso 3 zzso which were used to design zzso zzso for zzso 3 zzso The protocol was extensively zzso no zzso dropouts were zzso The presented protocol allows differential typing of zzso and zzso and resolves some common zzso
