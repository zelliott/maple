zzso of the marine sponge zzso zzso were collected from Irish coastal waters, and bacteria were isolated from these zzso zzso analyses of the cultured zzso showed that four different bacterial zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sponge bacterial zzso were zzso for the production of zzso zzso and biological activities against zzso and zzso bacteria and zzso were demonstrated, with 50% of zzso showing zzso activity against at least one of the test zzso Further testing showed that the zzso activities extended to the important pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso the most abundant producers of zzso activities, although activities were also noted from zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the presence of potential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes also revealed that genes for the zzso of these secondary zzso were present in most bacterial zzso but were particularly prevalent among the zzso and zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso fraction of bacteria from the sponge zzso zzso is diverse and appears to possess much potential as a source for the discovery of new medically relevant biological active zzso
