The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein that is expressed in a cell zzso pattern in neuroendocrine cells and is zzso by nerve growth factor zzso in the rat zzso zzso cell zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of the zzso region of the human zzso zzso In addition to a zzso box and a zzso box located at zzso distances from the zzso start site, the human zzso promoter contains several consensus sequences for different zzso factors, including a zzso zzso response element and an zzso element, several zzso boxes, and sequences zzso to other zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso of the zzso sequence acts as a zzso promoter, efficiently used only by zzso cells that express zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that a positive regulatory region is located between zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso elements that repress promoter activity in cell lines that do not normally express zzso are located between zzso zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso The zzso region of the human zzso gene zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
