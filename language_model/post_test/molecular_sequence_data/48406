The zzso gene of zzso is expressed in the late phase of virus replication in insects and possesses high zzso and zzso activity, which can zzso zzso in the body of the zzso thus promoting terminal host zzso zzso viral zzso zzso have been well zzso but information regarding viral zzso from zzso is zzso zzso sequencing of a Korean isolate of zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted a putative zzso gene corresponding to zzso The zzso zzso gene had a coding sequence of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso including an zzso putative signal zzso Time course induction pattern observed by zzso and subsequent Western zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso of the signal zzso from the intact zzso zzso sequencing analysis was further conducted to confirm the exact nature of the mature zzso and the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso exactly matched the sequence following the signal zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in infected zzso zzso larvae, examined by real-time zzso revealed a significant zzso increase after four days of feeding with zzso leaves, with a subsequent decline at the later stages of zzso zzso microscopic analysis showed that zzso zzso possibly exists as a zzso zzso with strong zzso signals in fat body cells and zzso at four days zzso Furthermore, zzso labeling and electron zzso studies localized the zzso zzso in the zzso and sparsely within zzso structures in the fat body apart from the extensive zzso in the zzso lining of the zzso
