zzso zzso zzso was isolated with zzso coli zzso from the urine of a patient living in a nursing zzso Both zzso were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso without significant zzso of its activity by 2 zzso of zzso per zzso zzso 512 zzso and susceptible to naturally active zzso This zzso zzso was zzso in both strains by similar zzso plasmids of 40 zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso which also conveyed resistance to zzso and zzso Clinical and zzso strains produced a zzso with a zzso of zzso which belonged to the zzso family, as indicated by specific zzso zzso Compared with zzso this zzso exhibited lower zzso efficiencies zzso and zzso less for zzso and zzso respectively), and higher zzso of zzso zzso were required to yield a 50% reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso higher zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Gene sequencing revealed four zzso differences with the zzso sequence of zzso The first replacement zzso located in the promoter region, was described as being responsible for the increase in the level of zzso zzso The three other changes led to zzso acid zzso that define a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso name, zzso Two of them, zzso and zzso have previously been related to inhibitor zzso The additional zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso to have a very weak effect, at least alone, on the zzso zzso This is the first description of an zzso zzso in zzso zzso The horizontal transfer of zzso may have occurred either from zzso to zzso or in the reverse zzso
