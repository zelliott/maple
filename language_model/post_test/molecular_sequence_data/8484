A number of recent studies has shown that animals zzso with zzso zzso primary tumors show resistance against an unmodified tumor cell zzso In the present study we have evaluated the potential role of zzso a zzso differentiation inducing factor, in zzso zzso leukemia cells, a tumor so far not challenged by this zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso based zzso carrying the zzso zzso gene exhibit zzso and functional zzso zzso modified zzso cells show significant reduction in the growth constant zzso and in the ability to form zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrate increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso class II, suggesting driven differentiation towards zzso zzso cells zzso high level of zzso zzso and, upon zzso with zzso high levels of zzso further indicating a functional zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso gene coding for signals of cell zzso and improved expression of zzso zzso into zzso leukemia cells may enable more effective tumor recognition in zzso and boost the local as well as the systemic zzso zzso zzso
