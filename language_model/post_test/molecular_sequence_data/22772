zzso have been described in the zzso zzso of patients with zzso but it is not known whether they are specific for inflammatory zzso disease zzso or to some extent common to other forms of zzso The aim of this study was to compare the bacterial composition of the dominant zzso zzso in patients with Crohn's disease zzso zzso colitis zzso infectious colitis zzso and in healthy subjects zzso 

Fluorescent in zzso zzso adapted to flow zzso was used to analyze the bacterial composition of zzso samples from 13 patients with active CD, 13 patients with active zzso 5 patients with zzso and 13 zzso We used 6 zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso and spanning the main zzso groups of the zzso zzso 

A significantly higher proportion of the total zzso bacteria were recognized by the 6 zzso in HS zzso and in zzso zzso than in patients with zzso zzso in CD and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso group was reduced in UC zzso versus zzso in zzso zzso whereas the C zzso group was reduced in CD zzso versus zzso in zzso zzso The zzso group was more abundant in zzso zzso than in the other 3 groups zzso in CD, zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso for all 3 zzso 

In zzso the dominant zzso zzso comprises unusual bacterial zzso Moreover, CD and UC zzso zzso harbor specific discrepancies and differ from that of zzso and healthy zzso
