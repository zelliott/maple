Two potential migratory routes followed by modern humans to colonize zzso from Africa have been zzso These are the two natural zzso that connect both zzso the northern route through the Sinai Peninsula and the southern route across the zzso al zzso zzso Recent archaeological and genetic evidence have favored a unique southern coastal zzso Under this scenario, the study of the population genetic structure of the Arabian Peninsula, the first step out of Africa, to search for primary genetic links between Africa and zzso is zzso The zzso and zzso inherited zzso DNA zzso zzso has been the most used genetic marker to identify and to relate lineages with clear geographic origins, as the African zzso and the zzso M and N that have a common root with the Africans zzso 

To assess the role of the Arabian Peninsula in the southern route, we genetically analyzed zzso Saudi Arabs using partial zzso and complete zzso zzso sequencing, and compared the lineages obtained with those present in Africa, the Near East, central, east and southeast Asia and zzso The results showed that the Arabian Peninsula has received substantial gene flow from Africa zzso detected by the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that an zzso of the Arabian Peninsula lineages have a clear eastern provenance, mainly represented by U zzso but also by Indian M lineages and rare M links with Central Asia, Indonesia and even zzso However, the bulk zzso of the Arabian lineages has a Northern zzso 

Although there is evidence of Neolithic and more recent expansions in the Arabian Peninsula, mainly detected by zzso and zzso zzso the lack of primitive zzso M and N zzso suggests that this area has been more a zzso of human zzso including historic ones, from Africa, India, Indonesia and even Australia, than a demographic expansion center along the proposed southern coastal zzso
