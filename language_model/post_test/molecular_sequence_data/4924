The original zzso sequence reported for the zzso DNA zzso zzso was not full zzso Recently, additional zzso sequences have been reported that lie upstream of the original and contain an extended open reading frame with three additional zzso in frame with the coding region zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA , 93, zzso zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA upstream of this zzso contains two more zzso in frame and no obvious zzso zzso We have constructed, and expressed in zzso zzso clones that begin at each of these four zzso and examined their zzso zzso beginning with any of the first three zzso as their zzso zzso give a zzso DNA zzso band of approximately 185 zzso on zzso corresponding to zzso initiation at the third zzso The fourth zzso construct gives a much smaller protein band of 173 zzso The 185 zzso protein was zzso by zzso characterized by mass zzso and has a measured molecular mass of 184 zzso zzso zzso All of these zzso were functional in zzso and steady state kinetic analysis showed that the zzso proteins exhibit similar kinetic properties irrespective of their zzso The homogeneous zzso zzso from the fourth zzso construct shows a zzso preference for a zzso DNA zzso as compared to an zzso zzso whereas the 185 zzso protein is equally active on both zzso The kinetic properties of the zzso zzso are similar to those reported for the native zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso The new clones are capable of yielding large quantities of intact zzso for further structural and functional zzso
