Atlantic cod zzso zzso zzso from archaeological sites were used to study the history of the zzso Atlantic cod population in the time period of zzso Specifically, we used zzso zzso to estimate population size and fluctuations from the sequence diversity at the zzso b zzso and zzso I zzso zzso The models are consistent with an expanding population during the warm medieval period, large historical effective population size zzso a marked bottleneck event at zzso and a decrease in zzso in early modern zzso The model results are zzso by the reduction of zzso and zzso variation over time and zzso population distance as a significant portion of zzso variation zzso across the zzso time zzso The mean age of the historical fished stock is high in medieval times with a zzso in age in early modern zzso The population size crash zzso with a period of known cooling in the North Atlantic, and we conclude that the collapse may be related to climate or zzso zzso zzso
