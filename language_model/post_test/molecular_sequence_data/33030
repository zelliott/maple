zzso is a multiple zzso zzso protein localized in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso retention signal zzso Recently, we showed evidence that zzso interacts with zzso in rat cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26, zzso The present study was undertaken to further characterize the association of zzso with zzso in mouse heart by various gene manipulation zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso were partially zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was conducted in zzso cells and zzso reduction of zzso did not induce any zzso changes of other zzso zzso But it enhanced zzso transient zzso and showed shortened time to reach peak and decreased time to reach 50% of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso sensitivity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction was significantly lower in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the interaction is favored in the E1 state of zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso deletion fragments and zzso zzso zzso suggested that regions of zzso zzso acids of zzso and zzso zzso acids of zzso are the major binding zzso On the basis of our in zzso binding data and available information on three-dimensional structure of zzso a molecular model was proposed for the interaction between zzso and zzso Taken together, the present results suggest that zzso is a novel regulator of zzso and its zzso changes are tightly coupled with zzso of zzso
