Marine zzso worms without a mouth or functional gut are found worldwide in zzso zzso zzso zzso and methane-rich zzso zzso and zzso studies show that they are associated with zzso zzso While it has been hypothesized that the zzso are zzso sulfur zzso to date nothing is known about the zzso or function of zzso from marine zzso In this study, we characterized the association between bacterial zzso and the marine zzso zzso zzso from coral reef sediments in the zzso zzso analysis of the host based on its zzso zzso gene showed that zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso of the families zzso and zzso and is not closely related to marine zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso analyses of the zzso of zzso zzso using comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that these are closely related to the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso as well as to the zzso zzso from zzso marine zzso The closest zzso relatives of these zzso zzso are zzso bacteria from the family zzso zzso electron zzso and zzso in zzso zzso showed that the bacterial zzso completely fill the gut zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that these are their main source of zzso The close zzso relationship of the zzso zzso zzso to known zzso bacteria as well as the presence of the zzso zzso typically found in zzso bacteria, indicates that the zzso zzso zzso use reduced sulfur compounds as an energy source to provide their hosts with zzso
