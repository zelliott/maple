The leader zzso zzso zzso I) zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The zzso acid sequence of the predicted protein exhibits similarity to other known bacterial leader zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso of purple bacteria and thus is a relative of zzso in zzso Like the zzso zzso inner membrane zzso zzso and zzso the leader zzso from zzso has only one zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso protein with zzso and zzso did not reveal a higher overall similarity than between other zzso signal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso in combination with primer extension analysis provide evidence for a weak promoter located a short distance from the zzso start of the zzso zzso Failure to establish a zzso strain with a disrupted zzso gene indicates that this gene is zzso
