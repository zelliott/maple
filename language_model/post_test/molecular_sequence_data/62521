On the basis of a partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso previously proposed that the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso represents a new form of zzso called type i zzso zzso Indeed, it differed from both the types c zzso and g zzso known in other animals, as well as from plant and zzso zzso Recently, several proteins belonging to the same family have been isolated from zzso Here we report the complete mature protein sequence and zzso sequence of the zzso from zzso These sequences zzso the previously proposed zzso between the zzso a zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we present a structural analysis that allows us to zzso upon the function of several zzso zzso
