A zzso zzso zzso is defective in the late stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso screen that uses the zzso zzso has resulted in the identification of the zzso structural gene and a novel gene called zzso zzso encodes a previously unidentified zzso zzso protein related to the zzso zzso protein zzso Although zzso is not essential for growth, the zzso zzso displays synthetic lethal interactions with several zzso that result in zzso zzso and a block in the late stages of zzso zzso but not with those that block the budding of zzso from the zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may facilitate membrane traffic zzso possibly by maintaining zzso zzso In an effort to identify genes whose products physically interact with zzso we also tested the ability of zzso zzso to suppress known zzso zzso that block zzso traffic between the zzso and the zzso This screen revealed that zzso specifically suppresses zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of approximately 100 zzso Like zzso which has been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso is predominantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso associate with each other to form a zzso complex of approximately zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso acts in conjunction with zzso to mediate a common step in zzso zzso
