In the zzso zzso sediments of coral zzso zzso zzso flow and the zzso of organic matter establish zzso zones that are the scene of zzso zzso transformations of N zzso To investigate the zzso of N cycling in reef zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Bay, Hawaii, were surveyed for candidate nitrate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by identifying zzso of their key zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso potential for nitrate reduction were identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The estimated richness of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicates a diverse guild of nitrate zzso The guild of zzso hosts in zzso reef zzso was dominated by zzso zzso The identified members of the zzso ammonium zzso guild zzso zzso were zzso or close relatives of zzso zzso zzso bacteria were detected in the zzso pool of zzso zzso zzso More than half of these zzso show zzso identity with zzso sequences of zzso zzso while no evidence was found for members of the zzso zzso or zzso In addition to exploring the diversity of these four zzso microbial zzso in coral reef zzso the zzso of zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were estimated using real-time zzso Representatives of all targeted zzso were zzso suggesting that most processes of the zzso N cycle can be zzso by the zzso zzso of tropical coral zzso
