The zzso factor zzso is involved in the regulation of the cell division cycle and the control of programmed cell death in response to cellular zzso zzso expression has been linked with several forms of zzso A zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso protein gene results in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso gene are associated with solid tumors including several types of zzso Here we report the mapping of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene to the identical zzso locus where the zzso gene had previously been zzso zzso analysis demonstrates a zzso overlap of both genes over a zzso zzso As a result the two zzso share a 3' zzso complementary sequence allowing an in zzso interaction between the two zzso An zzso regulatory element zzso known to control zzso stability resides in the overlapping zzso To test for functional significance of the ARE a zzso reporter zzso containing the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso experiments in zzso cells show that zzso zzso zzso a significantly lower activity than a control reporter or a reporter in which the region overlapping the zzso zzso is zzso The conservation of this overlapping of the zzso and zzso genes and the role of their complementary sequence in the control of zzso stability suggest the existence of a functional link between the expression of these two zzso
