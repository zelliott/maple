The structure of the zzso zzso zzso has been determined with zzso zzso zzso interacts with a number of zzso including zzso and zzso forming a complex that binds zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso exists as a zzso The symmetry and the structure of the zzso form of zzso were determined with the zzso reconstruction zzso zzso comprises three zzso zzso with a central core and distinct caps on either zzso Crystal structures of VHS and zzso zzso fit into the zzso end caps in the zzso density zzso Thus, the location of zzso that interact with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to the zzso initiating the functional processes of zzso on the zzso Based on our model, the zzso zzso interacts with the membrane and acts as a zzso zzso that presents multiple sites for protein zzso
