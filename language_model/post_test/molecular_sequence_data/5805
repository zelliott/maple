The molecular pathways for fluid transport in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are still zzso Here we use zzso and zzso zzso to define the sites of expression of four zzso in the respiratory tract and zzso zzso where they reside in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso vascular zzso and zzso zzso is localized to the zzso plasma membrane of type I zzso and the zzso plasma zzso of zzso zzso in upper airway and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is present in zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso and is abundant in zzso zzso of surface zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso resides in zzso zzso of zzso cells of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is restricted to zzso zzso of a subset of zzso and zzso zzso These sites of expression suggest that zzso water movement, zzso of airway surface liquid, air zzso and generation of zzso zzso involve a coordinated network of zzso water zzso
