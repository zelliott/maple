Random amplification of zzso DNA and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso were compared with restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis as methods for DNA typing of zzso zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso isolated from the oral cavities of five AIDS patients undergoing zzso therapy were zzso There was an excellent correspondence between the DNA types obtained by both zzso techniques and by zzso With the exception of one patient who was infected with three DNA types of zzso zzso during a five-year observation period, the patients each zzso only one major strain, which became progressively less susceptible to zzso Each DNA type was unique to a zzso The data suggest that these typing methods are suitable for investigating the epidemiology of zzso zzso in this patient zzso
