The functional properties of two zzso acid zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso in the zzso class I zzso were analyzed in light of the zzso crystal zzso The model predicts that zzso acid zzso extending into the proposed zzso site or projecting up from the zzso are functional with respect to zzso zzso zzso whereas those zzso pointing away from the site are zzso L cell clones expressing zzso zzso and derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were generated for the zzso zzso characterization of this panel of cells by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso revealed the loss of the zzso recognized by these zzso in the zzso clone and the retention of these zzso in the zzso zzso Analysis of the L cell clones by using B6 zzso zzso demonstrated that L cell clones expressing zzso or zzso were zzso by these zzso whereas clones expressing zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso zzso L cell clones expressing zzso or zzso but were unable to lyse clones expressing zzso zzso and zzso The results indicate that the substitution at zzso acid 89 determines the zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso is primarily determined by the substitution at zzso acid zzso These findings are in good agreement with the predictions derived from the zzso crystal model of the zzso zzso
