The zzso zzso which represents zzso zzso of the cold shock protein zzso from zzso zzso has been shown to form zzso zzso when solutions containing this zzso in zzso zzso zzso are diluted in water zzso Gross et zzso (1999) zzso Science 8, zzso We established conditions in which zzso kinetic steps associated with the formation of these zzso can be zzso Studies combining these conditions with a range of zzso methods reveal that a variety of distinct events occurs during the process that results in zzso zzso A CD spectrum indicative of beta structure is observed within 1 zzso of the zzso shift, and its intensity increases on a longer zzso in at least two kinetic zzso The characteristic wavelength shift of the zzso dye zzso Red is established within 30 zzso of the initiation of the zzso process and zzso to one of the zzso observed by CD and to changes in the zzso zzso spectrum indicative of beta zzso Short zzso structures begin to be visible under the electron microscope after these events, and longer, zzso zzso zzso are established on a zzso of zzso zzso zzso shows that there are no significant changes in the concentration of zzso species in solution during the events leading to zzso formation, but that soluble zzso too large to be visible in zzso zzso are present throughout the zzso A model for zzso formation by this zzso is presented which is consistent with these kinetic data and with published work on a variety of zzso zzso These findings support the concept that the ability to form zzso zzso is a generic property of zzso zzso and that the mechanism of their formation is similar for different peptides and zzso
