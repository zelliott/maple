zzso zzso Related zzso zzso are a family of soluble molecules structurally related to the zzso zzso zzso analysis in different zzso species suggests that these molecules are zzso zzso of zzso and possibly other zzso zzso zzso a member of this family, is strongly expressed throughout embryonic development in different zzso zzso Its function is, however, poorly zzso To address the role of this protein at early stages of embryonic development, we have used the zzso fish zzso zzso as a model zzso Here, we describe the zzso and the expression analysis of zzso We also show that zzso interference with zzso expression results in zzso with a reduced eye field, a zzso that, in the most affected zzso is associated with a zzso and widening of the zzso zzso Because the expression of zzso zzso markers is unchanged but that of zzso zzso ones is expanded, we propose that zzso is needed for a proper establishment of the eye field within the zzso In addition, zzso may contribute to the control of zzso convergence extension movements that take place during zzso
