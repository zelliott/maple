Previous studies have shown that zzso and protein zzso by late zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso accumulate at high levels in mature seeds and also in response to zzso acid zzso in young zzso In this study, we studied the expression of four promoter zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso gene fused to zzso zzso zzso activity analysis revealed that the zzso promoter zzso was necessary to direct zzso zzso expression in transgenic tobacco plants zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the expression pattern of zzso zzso promoter under environmental zzso zzso transgenic tobacco zzso were exposed to zzso dehydration, high zzso and cold zzso zzso activity in the zzso was zzso zzso and expression was also observed by zzso zzso An apparent increase in zzso activity was found in plants harboring zzso zzso zzso and zzso after 24 h of zzso or zzso treatments, as well as after 10 days of zzso By contrast, only a slight increase was observed in all the three lines after cold zzso Virtually no change in expression was found in construct zzso in response to dehydration, zzso and cold, but there was a moderate response to zzso suggesting that the region between zzso and zzso was necessary for zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso elements might be located in the zzso region of the zzso
