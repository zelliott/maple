zzso zzso has been increasing in zzso in recent zzso There is strong evidence in the literature suggesting that human zzso zzso plays a role in the genesis of zzso zzso In addition, identification of zzso zzso types in zzso zzso may have zzso zzso The method used to detect zzso infection, however, affects the frequency with which viral DNA is zzso We examined zzso from 56 patients with zzso zzso cell zzso for the presence of zzso DNA by in zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction using both consensus and zzso zzso to determine if zzso detection varies when different methods are zzso In zzso zzso identified the presence of zzso DNA in zzso of zzso zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso for the zzso E6 gene demonstrated zzso DNA in zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso chain reaction with consensus zzso detected zzso DNA in only zzso of zzso All cases containing zzso type 6 were identified with zzso zzso whereas only three of 23 cases containing zzso type 16 were zzso The differences in the rate of zzso detection by the two zzso chain reactions methods are most likely related to zzso gene loss in cells containing integrated zzso type zzso
