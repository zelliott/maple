zzso zzso A zzso promotes multiple steps in zzso production including zzso and translation of viral zzso zzso of primer zzso to viral zzso and zzso the ratio of zzso to spliced viral zzso At its zzso zzso are two zzso zzso binding zzso zzso that are essential for zzso zzso zzso Linking the zzso to the core zzso domain is a zzso region containing 6 predicted zzso Working in zzso with zzso zzso zzso containing deletions of individual zzso reveals that this region may regulate the zzso zzso activity, since deletion of zzso 2 or 3 reduces the rate of unwinding zzso by zzso The biological significance of this finding was then examined during zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region do not significantly affect either zzso zzso interaction in zzso or the incorporation of zzso zzso into progeny zzso While the partial reduction in zzso activity of zzso zzso containing a deletion of zzso 2 or 3 does not reduce the ability of zzso to stimulate viral zzso zzso the promotion of zzso zzso to viral zzso is zzso In contrast, deletion of zzso 4 or 5 does not affect the ability of zzso to promote zzso zzso but reduces its ability to stimulate viral zzso zzso Additionally, zzso stimulation of viral zzso synthesis results in an increased ratio of zzso to spliced viral zzso and this increase is not inhibited by deletions in the zzso region, nor is the pattern of zzso changed within the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso classes, suggesting that zzso effect on suppressing zzso is confined mainly to the first zzso donor zzso Overall, the differential responses to the zzso in the zzso region of zzso reveal that zzso zzso in zzso zzso metabolism by multiple distinct zzso
