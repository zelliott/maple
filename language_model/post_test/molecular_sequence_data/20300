The zzso organ of the Caribbean zzso lobster zzso zzso maintains lifelong proliferation and turnover of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso examining the molecular basis of this adult zzso we search for expression of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes in this zzso zzso We report here a zzso of the zzso zzso family, called splash zzso lobster zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of split family, called zzso zzso lobster zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso indicates a zzso stage dependence of the levels of expression of splash and zzso zzso in the zzso organ, with higher expression in zzso than in zzso or zzso animals, which is positively correlated with rates of zzso splash and zzso zzso are expressed not only in the zzso organ but also in other zzso albeit at lower levels, irrespective of zzso zzso We conclude that the expression of zzso and zzso of split in the proliferation zone of the zzso organ of zzso zzso and their enhanced expression in zzso animals suggest that they play a role in the proliferation of zzso and that their expression in regions of the zzso organ populated by mature zzso and in other zzso suggests that they have additional zzso
