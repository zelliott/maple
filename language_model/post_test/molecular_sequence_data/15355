zzso T zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of T cell zzso The present study aimed to examine an association between the zzso gene zzso and zzso colitis zzso in the Han Chinese in central zzso 

One hundred zzso patients with UC and 246 healthy controls were zzso for zzso gene zzso in the promoter and zzso at the 3' untranslated region using a method of zzso chain zzso restriction zzso length zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso gene in UC patients and healthy controls were compared by zzso zzso 

The frequency of the zzso zzso at the zzso gene zzso in the promoter was significantly higher in UC patients than in healthy controls zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The frequency of the T zzso at the zzso zzso was also significantly higher in UC patients than in the controls zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso at the zzso locus was highly associated with extensive colitis in UC patients zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The frequency of the T zzso at the zzso locus was highly associated with extensive colitis in UC patients zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The T zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the promoter of zzso gene was highly associated with UC in the Han Chinese in central zzso
