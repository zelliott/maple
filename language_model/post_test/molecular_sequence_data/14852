Plant zzso and root hairs are powerful models for the study of cell fate zzso In zzso zzso zzso and root hair initiation requires a combination of three groups of zzso including the zzso repeat protein transparent zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of basic zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso The zzso component acts as a zzso site for zzso and zzso zzso Here, we isolated a zzso showing defects in zzso and root hair patterning that carried a point zzso zzso in zzso that encodes the fourth member of zzso zzso family zzso zzso analysis revealed partial redundant yet distinct function between zzso and zzso zzso zzso an important zzso factor involved in zzso and root hair control, was zzso in zzso plants, suggesting the requirement of zzso for appropriate zzso zzso Like its zzso zzso formed a complex with zzso and zzso proteins but did not zzso In addition, the interaction of zzso with zzso proteins and zzso was zzso by the zzso substitution in zzso We found that this zzso acid zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and that it is essential for their interaction with zzso proteins and for their proper zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is an important regulator of zzso and root hair zzso and they reveal a novel zzso acid necessary for zzso interactions and gene function in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
