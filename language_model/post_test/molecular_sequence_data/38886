The structural study of peptides belonging to the terminal zzso of zzso zzso can be considered as a step toward the understanding of the function of zzso in zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and is adjacent to the central zzso domain of the zzso were examined by means of zzso and circular zzso In zzso solution, zzso behaved as a mainly zzso zzso although zzso zzso in rapid equilibrium with the unfolded state could be zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a substantial increase of the zzso zzso The zzso limits, as indicated by zzso + 3) nuclear zzso effect zzso cross correlations and significant zzso zzso shifts of the zzso zzso span from zzso to zzso with zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso A structure calculation performed on the basis of distance constraints derived from zzso cross zzso in zzso zzso confirmed the zzso structure of this zzso The zzso region has a marked zzso character, due to the location of all positively charged zzso on one face of the zzso and all the zzso zzso on the opposite zzso The zzso has a zzso motif at the zzso following the zzso zzso The observed zzso zzso suggest that the zzso sequence adopts a type zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or a combination of both, in fast equilibrium with unfolded zzso zzso of the kind zzso have been proposed as DNA binding zzso The zzso zzso thus, combines a positively charged zzso zzso and a turn as potential zzso zzso
