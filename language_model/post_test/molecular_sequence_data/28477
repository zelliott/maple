In zzso cells, zzso are exquisitely controlled, often through regulatory elements in their 3' untranslated regions zzso zzso that bind to those sites are key players in controlling zzso stability, translation and zzso One family of regulatory zzso zzso zzso not only structurally zzso but also bind to zzso and zzso zzso expression in a wide variety of zzso zzso They do so either by enhancing turnover or zzso translation, and act zzso with other regulatory zzso Here, we discuss the evolution, biological function and mechanisms of action of the zzso protein family, and suggest that a primordial function of zzso proteins is to sustain zzso proliferation of stem zzso
