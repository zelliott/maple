An zzso acid zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by three steps including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and Resource Q zzso zzso zzso is composed of two identical zzso with a molecular weight of 55 zzso by zzso gel zzso The molecular weight was different with that of zzso zzso from the same species distributed in Taiwan that was 70 zzso The 24 zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso which shares high similarity with other zzso snake zzso zzso and has moderate similarity with zzso snake zzso zzso Further studies found that zzso inhibited the growth of zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso All the biological activities were eliminated by zzso a zzso zzso It was shown that these biological effects were possibly due to the formation of zzso produced by zzso
