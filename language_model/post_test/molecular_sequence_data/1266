zzso catalyze the zzso and zzso incorporation of zzso and are implicated in various biological zzso To zzso the zzso roles of zzso at the molecular level, we need to identify its zzso protein zzso and clarify the relationship between zzso modification of protein zzso and biological zzso Here we examined whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be a zzso of zzso zzso by in zzso experiments using zzso liver zzso and guinea pig liver zzso zzso pig liver zzso incorporated zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso also seemed to be incorporated into zzso by zzso In the absence of the primary zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity was decreased significantly through the zzso by zzso zzso incorporation slightly reduced the zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso for zzso reaction were isolated through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a affinity zzso and reverse phase zzso The results of zzso acid sequence analyses of these peptides and sequence zzso alignment with other zzso liver zzso zzso showed that these zzso zzso zzso were located in the region near the zzso terminal of zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that the liver zzso can be modified by zzso zzso and its activity is regulated zzso by the zzso especially by the zzso This regulatory reaction might be involved in the regulation of homocysteine metabolism in the zzso
