The Indian subcontinent is considered to be the likely zzso of river buffalo zzso based on population zzso archaeological evidence and genetic zzso Recent studies on zzso DNA diversity have drawn useful conclusions about the zzso history of zzso zzso The conclusions of these studies are, however, incomplete, unless samples can also be zzso from Pakistan, which contains the second largest buffalo population of the zzso Here, we report the results of the first study on zzso zzso sequence diversity in five breeds of Pakistani zzso Analysis of sequence variations in zzso of the zzso region of 123 animals revealed 52 zzso including 40 zzso zzso display of breed zzso zzso values revealed no strong zzso of zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso joining and zzso trees revealed a zzso consistent with zzso as well as subsequent zzso of multiple maternal lineages from the wild zzso zzso median network analysis provided evidence of population expansion from more than one set of zzso The study also confirmed that Pakistani buffalo are of the river zzso The observed zzso zzso sequence diversity suggests that Pakistani areas bordering India might have contributed to the initiation of zzso of the zzso river zzso
