The zzso protein of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso is thought to be a component of the zzso complex that mediates the zzso and packaging of viral zzso In this study we describe the generation and characterization of a series of 15 zzso zzso containing insertions of five zzso acids located randomly throughout the zzso zzso Of these zzso seven were unable to complement the growth of the zzso virus zzso in transient zzso and also failed to support the zzso and packaging of zzso zzso DNA into zzso The insertions in these zzso were clustered between zzso 51 and 74 and between 104 and zzso within the most highly zzso regions of the zzso The ability of the zzso to interact with the zzso component of the zzso was assessed in zzso and zzso zzso All four zzso with insertions between zzso acids 51 and 74 were impaired in this interaction, whereas two of the three zzso in the second region (with insertions at positions 111 and zzso were not zzso These data indicate that the ability of zzso to interact with zzso is probably necessary, but not zzso to support viral growth and DNA zzso
