zzso zzso channels are important components of virtually all cells, and they play critical roles in many cellular zzso zzso represents a new class of K channel specifically regulated by zzso and zzso to mediate the effects of substances that increase zzso zzso Since zzso has the potential to be useful in candidate gene analysis of inherited diseases, the human gene for zzso was zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso indicates that human zzso maps to zzso 1 at zzso zzso mapping of the gene was achieved by zzso of a set of zzso zzso clones that spanned the region of zzso We found that zzso zzso contains human zzso These data indicate human zzso maps to zzso and resides within the genetic zzso defined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso That region of zzso 1 contains another K channel zzso zzso
