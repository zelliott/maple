zzso alternative zzso is important for regulating gene expression in zzso yet our understanding of how signals impact zzso mechanisms is zzso A model to address this issue is alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso DNA damage zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells causes increased inclusion of zzso alternative cassette zzso zzso and zzso through an zzso signaling zzso To evaluate the role of zzso zzso sequences in the alternative zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso cell zzso zzso that zzso key aspects of zzso alternative zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso indicated that zzso site strength zzso independent and distinct mechanisms that control zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso weak zzso zzso site or weak 3' zzso site to a consensus sequence was sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso strong zzso zzso site or moderate 3' zzso site to a consensus sequence was only sufficient for zzso zzso zzso inclusion in the presence of zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso 13 3' zzso site suggest that zzso zzso inclusion involves zzso pairing between zzso and alternative zzso zzso Finally, zzso elements identified by evolutionary conservation were necessary for full repression of zzso zzso inclusion or full zzso of zzso zzso inclusion and may be targets of zzso zzso In zzso this work defines the role of sequence elements in the regulation of zzso alternative zzso in response to a DNA damage zzso
