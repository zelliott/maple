The zzso gene of the zzso coronavirus zzso gene A, is presumed to zzso viral zzso zzso zzso It has previously been shown that the zzso portion of this gene product is zzso into a protein of 28 zzso zzso To further understand the mechanism of synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso clones representing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coronavirus mouse zzso virus strain zzso were zzso and zzso into zzso zzso from which zzso were transcribed and translated in zzso The sequence was found to zzso a single long open reading frame continuing from near the zzso zzso of the zzso Although zzso is zzso from the first 1 zzso at the zzso end of the zzso translation of in zzso zzso indicated that this protein was not detected unless the product of the entire zzso region was zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso or smaller yielded proteins which contained the zzso zzso but zzso was not zzso This suggests that the sequence in the region between zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso end of the zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso and contains zzso zzso The zzso protein could not be zzso from the smaller primary translation products of gene A, even in the presence of the larger zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein was inhibited by addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso This study thus identified a protein domain essential for zzso zzso of the gene A zzso
