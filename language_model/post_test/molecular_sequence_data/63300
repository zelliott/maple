zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which was originally isolated from the interior of zzso zzso The zzso of strain zzso of zzso zzso has been completely zzso and a next step is the functional characterization of its zzso The aim of this study was to establish an efficient zzso method, using the commercial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Up to 1 zzso zzso zzso per zzso of zzso were generated in a single zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were amplified by inverse zzso and zzso for 31 zzso For ten of these zzso both zzso zzso could be identified, confirming the 9 zzso zzso that is typical for zzso zzso zzso occurred in a random fashion and were genetically stable for at least 50 zzso One zzso had an zzso in a zzso of the zzso gene zzso and was therefore predicted to be affected in zzso traits and used to validate the applied zzso zzso This zzso lacked zzso and was zzso on soft zzso Interestingly, it was also strongly affected in the ability to form zzso on glass zzso
