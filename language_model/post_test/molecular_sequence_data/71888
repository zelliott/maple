Two zzso zzso and zzso have been detected in zzso zzso growing on rich zzso Here we characterize a new zzso gene zzso a third zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso only at the end of the stationary phase in zzso zzso growing in minimum zzso whereas zzso activity was found during the exponential zzso Analysis with a zzso fusion demonstrated that zzso expression is mainly regulated at the zzso zzso An increase of zzso activity zzso with zzso induction was detected in zzso A dramatic decrease of nitrogen fixation capacity in a zzso zzso double zzso was observed, suggesting that these zzso are very important for the protection of the nitrogen fixation zzso
