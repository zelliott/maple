The D typing strategies in several European countries protect carriers of D category VI zzso from zzso zzso but not carriers of other partial zzso Besides zzso one of the clinically most important partial D is D category IV zzso A detailed description and direct comparison of the different zzso types was zzso 

zzso zzso sequences were determined from zzso zzso D zzso patterns were established with commercial zzso zzso zzso 

zzso comprises several zzso of the D zzso with distinct zzso molecular structures, evolutionary origins, and ethnic zzso The zzso zzso is determined by zzso shared by all, but not limited to, zzso zzso which are further divided into zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is expressed by zzso Type zzso harboring zzso and the dispersed zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is expressed by zzso Type 3 to Type 5 representing zzso zzso Four of the six zzso zzso zzso were encountered among 23 zzso samples zzso Of 12 zzso carriers with zzso 10 were female and seven likely zzso by zzso Two zzso zzso are newly zzso zzso which differs from zzso Type 4 by zzso and zzso zzso zzso carries zzso known to cause a large D zzso zzso 

zzso zzso arose from at least two independent evolutionary zzso zzso Type zzso with zzso zzso belongs to the oldest extant human zzso zzso zzso Type 2 to Type 5 with zzso zzso arose from more recent gene zzso zzso zzso especially zzso in zzso will be avoided not only in carriers of zzso but also in carriers of other D zzso like zzso if our proposed D typing strategy is zzso
