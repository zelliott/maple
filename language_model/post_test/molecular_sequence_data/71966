zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or human zzso 8 zzso is common in certain parts of Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean, but is rare elsewhere, except in AIDS zzso Nevertheless, zzso DNA is found consistently in nearly all classical, endemic, transplant and zzso zzso zzso as well as in some rare zzso zzso The concept that zzso zzso fall into several distinct zzso has been confirmed and refined by zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso gene zzso a highly variable zzso related to the zzso zzso family that maps at the extreme zzso end of the zzso zzso Among more than 60 different tumor samples from the United States, central Africa, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and New Zealand, zzso acid zzso were found at a total of zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso These variations defined four major zzso and 13 distinct zzso or zzso similar to those found for the zzso zzso zzso The B and D zzso zzso proteins differ from the A and C zzso by 30 and zzso respectively, whereas A and C differ from each other by zzso In all cases tested, multiple samples from the same patient were zzso Examples of the B zzso were found almost exclusively in zzso patients from Africa or of African heritage, whereas the rare D zzso were found only in zzso patients of Pacific Island zzso In contrast, C zzso were found predominantly in classic zzso and in zzso and AIDS zzso in the Middle East and Asia, whereas zzso AIDS zzso samples were primarily zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that this unusually high diversity, in which zzso of the zzso changes lead to zzso acid changes, reflects some unknown powerful biological selection process that has been acting zzso on this early zzso cycle membrane zzso zzso Two distinct levels of zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso indicative of long-term evolutionary divergence is both spread throughout the protein as well as concentrated within two zzso zzso domain variable regions zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso predominantly within a single zzso zzso zzso bridge loop and apparently represents much more recent changes that have occurred even within specific zzso In contrast, numerous zzso domain zzso sites and zzso bridge zzso as well as the zzso motif in the zzso domain are fully zzso Overall, we suggest that rather than being a newly acquired human zzso zzso is an ancient human virus that is zzso transmitted in a familial fashion and is difficult to transmit zzso in the absence of zzso The division into the four major zzso zzso is probably the result of isolation and founder effects associated with the history of migration of modern human populations out of Africa over the past 35,000 to 60,000 zzso
