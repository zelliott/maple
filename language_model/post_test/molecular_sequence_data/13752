The zzso mouse strain is genetically susceptible to pulmonary zzso We have performed a genetic linkage analysis to map pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this zzso cross we have confirmed our previous results in zzso mice on the mapping of the zzso locus to the zzso region of zzso 6, near zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso strains differed at the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso providing the resistant zzso In the latter strain, we studied the zzso sequence of a portion of the second zzso of zzso that contains zzso associated with lung tumor zzso in several zzso zzso The lung zzso zzso zzso strain had the same specific zzso sequence of susceptible zzso zzso in zzso 61 of zzso in zzso lung tumors from zzso hybrids involved the zzso zzso in all cases, while the zzso zzso zzso was never zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso mice have an identical structure of the second zzso of the zzso zzso but they differ in genetic zzso to pulmonary zzso and in zzso of their zzso zzso
