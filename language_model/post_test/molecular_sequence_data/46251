Numerous independent groups from a range of countries have reported a high prevalence of Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences in human breast cancer zzso including a prevalence of almost zzso in zzso zzso sag sequences and a completely integrated zzso have also been zzso Recently, it was reported that zzso is capable of productive infection of human breast cells in zzso zzso demonstration of an association between zzso and human breast cancer has remained zzso and negative findings from a number of independent studies have questioned the role of zzso as an zzso zzso We used breast cancer specimens from women in the Australian Breast Cancer Family Study zzso who were diagnosed with first primary invasive breast cancer before the age of 40 zzso zzso were selected for higher grade zzso and for diagnosis relatively soon after zzso We searched for zzso zzso sequences in zzso DNA using a zzso zzso designed to detect all zzso zzso represented in zzso including those reportedly detected in human breast zzso zzso specimens were deemed adequate for testing based on strong zzso zzso Despite the zzso zzso zzso regimen consistently detecting five copies of control zzso against a background of zzso human zzso DNA, no zzso zzso sequence was detected in any of the breast cancer zzso Our findings appear inconsistent with previous reports on Australian breast cancer specimens but consistent with a growing number of independent negative reports zzso We recommend caution in zzso a role for zzso or a closely related virus in human breast cancer and suggest that universally regarded alternative lines of evidence such as highly specific zzso data will be required to support such an zzso
