zzso zzso are functional zzso that enable zzso proteins to stimulate zzso zzso of these essential zzso in zzso factors has been hampered by their low sequence zzso Here we delineate the zzso sequences that are required for zzso and interaction with zzso a classical target of the zzso class of zzso zzso Our analyses indicate that zzso recognizes a diverse set of sequences for zzso This information enabled the identification of zzso sequences that are critical for the activity of the zzso zzso of five human zzso factors: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The interaction surfaces are localized in short zzso segments of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the motifs may explain the low sequence zzso among zzso zzso zzso
