zzso hypersensitivity zzso zzso is type III or IV zzso developed by repeated inhalation of zzso of zzso zzso We identified 105 strains obtained from the homes of 36 zzso patients by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso 1 region, which is located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in addition, we analyzed the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso species are classified as zzso I, II, III, or zzso Of the 105 zzso 43 zzso 53 zzso and 9 zzso strains were isolated as zzso I, II, and III, zzso zzso I, II, and III strains were recovered from 19 zzso 29 zzso and 4 zzso of the 36 houses of zzso patients, zzso No zzso zzso strains were isolated from the zzso Of 43 zzso I zzso 42 zzso were identified as zzso zzso and the remaining one was zzso zzso Of 53 zzso II zzso 37 zzso were identified as zzso zzso and the remaining zzso II zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were nine zzso III strains comprised of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity was found only in zzso zzso This zzso also causes opportunistic infections zzso seven zzso of its zzso 1 region have been zzso While the strains of zzso zzso obtained from Japanese patients with zzso were zzso I, the strains from the houses of zzso patients were zzso zzso Based on our analysis, we conclude that the strains that play the most significant roles in the development of zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, and zzso zzso representing zzso I, II, and III, zzso
