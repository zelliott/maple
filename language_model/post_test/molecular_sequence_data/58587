zzso trafficking between the zzso and pigmented zzso is probably zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso In these animals, zzso is composed of four zzso regions zzso 300 zzso acids in zzso We have determined the primary structure of zzso zzso and its expression pattern by northern analysis, reverse zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso under a variety of lighting zzso zzso zzso is half the size zzso zzso of zzso zzso because it is composed of only two zzso similar to goldfish zzso The first half of the zzso protein is most similar to the first module of zzso zzso and the second half to the fourth module of zzso zzso This suggests that during the evolution of the zzso fish zzso the middle two zzso were zzso Each of the zzso contains zzso zzso zzso which may form the zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso is zzso higher in the middle of the light period (at zzso than in the middle of the dark period (at zzso This rhythm persists for 2 days under conditions of constant light or constant darkness, then zzso to an intermediate level by 8 days of constant zzso At zzso zzso zzso is expressed by all cone types and to a lesser extent by the zzso At zzso the zzso is restricted to the zzso short single zzso These data suggest that zzso expression is regulated by zzso and zzso mechanisms that act zzso on the various zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
