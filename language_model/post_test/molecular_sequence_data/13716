zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso hormone found in zzso is responsible for zzso rescue with pregnancy zzso Of the zzso the human and zzso gene sequences are the only structures so far zzso In order to study the structure and function of zzso in other zzso we have isolated and zzso the coding regions for the two zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Study of multiple clones confirmed a high degree of zzso with the human sequences zzso and zzso for the alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha has an extra four zzso acids compared to zzso zzso whereas the zzso beta sequence has a zzso deletion that maintains the reading frame and zzso zzso acid zzso Most of the differences between zzso beta and zzso beta peptides occur in the zzso region, which includes the loss of two of the zzso zzso consensus sequences and the presence of an zzso zzso consensus zzso When zzso alpha and beta were zzso in zzso cells, assembly of biologically active hormone was confirmed by induced steroid zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta was used to raise zzso zzso To date, an zzso has been obtained that is capable of detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta were also zzso at the zzso level in cultured zzso by in zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso reported from zzso zzso and zzso is due to a zzso with structural features common to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso zzso
