Organized zzso zzso are an zzso zzso hallmark of functional skeletal zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso has a pivotal regulatory role in maintaining proper zzso zzso during development and muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso initially form muscles, but zzso and zzso zzso become progressively disrupted when the muscles undergo growth and endure increased zzso forces during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also notable in the zzso zzso The zzso defects result in compromised muscle function, and hence important zzso events do not occur properly during zzso leading to zzso zzso is localized at zzso zzso and genetic evidence indicates that zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso genes that zzso important zzso proteins for stable zzso organization and optimal muscle zzso zzso experiments and zzso analysis reveal that zzso has an additional crucial role in zzso maintenance in adult zzso zzso is required to ensure the integrity and function of zzso and zzso zzso experiments further show that zzso function is dependent upon its zzso domain, NHL repeats and zzso finger zzso The importance of these presumed zzso interactions and zzso zzso zzso supports our hypothesis that zzso is needed for specific protein complex formation and stabilization at zzso and zzso
