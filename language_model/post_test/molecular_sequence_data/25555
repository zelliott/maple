Two zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso Both elements are internally deleted and have lost the coding capacity for a functional zzso One of the elements zzso contains an insert consisting of a repetitive zzso The terminal zzso repeats and the segments necessary for passive mobility are well zzso zzso zzso has retained rudiments of the coding sequence of zzso 0 and zzso 3, but the reading frame is destroyed by insertions and zzso The comparison of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals that the two latter sequences are more similar to each other than either of them is to the zzso zzso zzso This finding contradicts the zzso relationship of the species and can be taken as an indirect but unequivocal evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer from a relative of zzso zzso to the gene pool of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso are zzso ancient and have evolved independently for about 50 million zzso A higher substitution rate at the third zzso position as well as a predominance of conservative replacements at the zzso acid level indicates that the zzso of zzso zzso have been under selective constraint over a long period and that zzso has occurred only zzso
