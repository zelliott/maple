zzso zzso are composed of two zzso the 40 zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and the 30 zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of the zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso show it can be further divided into an 18 zzso zzso zzso which forms the zzso binding pocket, and a 10 zzso zzso zzso bundle that forms a lid over the binding zzso Across zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are well zzso in both sequence and zzso The zzso zzso is, however, more evolutionary variable and the only zzso structure from rat zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso We have solved the crystal structure of the zzso 10 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which forms a zzso similar to the zzso zzso This provides the first confirmation of the structural conservation of this zzso in zzso zzso with the rat structure reveals a zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso exists exclusively as a zzso in solution in agreement with the hypothesis that regions out with the zzso zzso are necessary for zzso zzso
