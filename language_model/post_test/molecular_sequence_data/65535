The cellular zzso and processing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were investigated, in particular with respect to the unusual outer membrane zzso of this zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso was detected in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso cells and in the culture zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially released to the surrounding zzso but most zzso remained cell zzso zzso labeling of thin sections revealed that zzso zzso was localized mainly in the outer zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso revealed processing of the signal zzso after the eighth zzso thereby leaving the zzso core of the signal zzso attached to the zzso This mode of processing is reminiscent of type IV zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of the entire zzso signal zzso was necessary for release from the cell because zzso zzso from the culture zzso lacked 44 zzso at the N zzso including the zzso part of the signal zzso We conclude that zzso association of zzso is zzso by zzso 9 to 44 of the signal zzso The zzso and electron microscopic zzso studies together with the zzso processing data indicate that zzso is held at the cell surface of zzso zzso via a zzso zzso anchor, which is highly unusual for an outer membrane zzso
