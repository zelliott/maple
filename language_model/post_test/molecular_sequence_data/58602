zzso protein zzso is a central component for zzso regulation and is a target for various zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso of proteins bound to zzso we zzso a zzso zzso termed zzso protein 120 zzso from rat liver nuclear zzso The entire zzso sequence of zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a novel zzso of 1230 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso directly with zzso under a zzso condition in zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was associated with zzso in nuclear zzso Interestingly, the zzso region of zzso exhibited sequence similarity to that of zzso zzso which was shown to bind directly to zzso This novel zzso protein is considered to participate in zzso regulation through the interaction with zzso
