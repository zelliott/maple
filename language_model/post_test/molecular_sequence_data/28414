For preparing a DNA zzso with unique protruding ends, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed by inserting a synthetic zzso into zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso contains two zzso and zzso sites at its ends in opposite orientation zzso a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso (the latter site is absent from zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso cloned at the zzso and zzso sites can be zzso by either zzso or zzso treatment, the zzso and zzso sites being deleted from the cloned zzso zzso coding for parts of human zzso were cloned in these zzso
