zzso zzso 2 zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso are critical for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso based on a binding site from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) have recently been shown to bind to the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso with considerably high zzso In addition, two peptides zzso between positions zzso and zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso domain, but did not activate the zzso and even partially prevented stimulation of zzso activity by the zzso zzso zzso These findings prompted us to further examine the zzso for optimal binding to the zzso domain and for the stimulation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that combining the preferred zzso in both zzso (such as zzso or zzso zzso and zzso (such as zzso zzso leads to highly efficient zzso zzso of zzso Particularly in the context of the zzso peptides 7 zzso and 8 zzso the incorporation of these zzso resulted in zzso zzso with a significantly increased ability to stimulate zzso zzso We suggest that different binding modes zzso to consensus sequences class I and zzso are responsible for obtaining either zzso (7 and 8) or zzso (2 and 3) zzso zzso such as 7 and 8 that bind in the extended fashion of the type II mode activate the zzso through complete filling of the cavity for zzso In contrast, peptides such as 2 and 3 that bind in the class I mode do not activate the zzso because they allow more zzso space at zzso zzso their binding does not force the zzso transition necessary to trigger the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso
