Many agricultural uses of bacteria require the establishment of efficient bacterial populations in the zzso for which colonization of plant seeds often constitutes a critical first zzso zzso zzso zzso is a strain that zzso the zzso of a number of zzso important plants at high population zzso To identify the functions involved in initial seed colonization by zzso zzso zzso we subjected this strain to zzso zzso and screened for zzso defective in attachment to corn zzso Eight different zzso were isolated and zzso While all of them showed reduced attachment to seeds, only two had strong defects in their zzso to zzso surfaces zzso and different zzso zzso of the zzso affected in all eight zzso were zzso None of the isolated genes had previously been described in zzso zzso although four of them showed clear similarities with genes of known functions in other zzso They corresponded to putative surface and membrane zzso including a zzso zzso a zzso a zzso zzso and a potential zzso zzso zzso One other showed limited similarities with surface zzso while the remaining three presented no obvious similarities with known zzso indicating that this study has disclosed novel zzso
