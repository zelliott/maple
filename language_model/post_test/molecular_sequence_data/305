zzso proteins zzso factors containing zzso zzso are essential factors that control the zzso of precursor zzso by regulating multiple steps in zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso alternative zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso recognition motifs zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain that can be zzso at numerous zzso by the protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso domain that is rich in zzso repeats zzso zzso is further divided into zzso zzso zzso portion of the zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso portion of the zzso domain zzso zzso segments whose modification guides the nuclear zzso of zzso While previous studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso control within the largely redundant zzso domain is not well zzso To address this issue, we performed engineered zzso and zzso experiments to determine where and how zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso The data show that local sequence elements in the zzso domain control the strong kinetic preference for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a small region of zzso zzso zzso in the middle of the zzso domain at the zzso end of zzso and then proceeds in an zzso zzso This initiation process requires both a viable zzso groove in the large lobe of zzso and one zzso zzso on the zzso flank of the zzso zzso Thus, while local zzso content zzso regional preferences in the zzso domain, zzso contacts with zzso guide initiation and directional zzso within these zzso
