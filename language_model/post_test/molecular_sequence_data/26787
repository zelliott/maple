The zzso zzso zzso zzso the cellular plasticity and dynamics that zzso zzso and cell zzso Growing zzso plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory zzso in which specialized zzso zzso tracking proteins zzso to and control the zzso dynamics that are essential for cell division and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso regulation by zzso at zzso and astral zzso have remained zzso Here, we show that zzso is a new zzso that binds to zzso protein 1 zzso in zzso and zzso with zzso at the zzso plus ends in zzso zzso of zzso eliminates the zzso zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso also binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso that zzso to the plus end of zzso zzso of zzso diminishes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso aurora zzso zzso zzso the zzso association in zzso We reason that zzso zzso the zzso loading of zzso onto zzso plus ends and zzso the dynamics at the plus end of zzso
