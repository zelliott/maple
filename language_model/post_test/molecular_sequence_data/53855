zzso strains zzso and zzso B were isolated from produced brine at the zzso oil field in Saskatchewan, zzso Both strains are zzso zzso with hydrogen, zzso and zzso serving as the only known energy sources for zzso B, whereas zzso and zzso sulfur are the only known electron donors for zzso Neither strain uses zzso as an energy zzso Both strains are zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso grows by zzso of nitrate or zzso whereas zzso B reduces nitrate only to zzso zzso sulfur is the sole product of zzso zzso by zzso B, while zzso produces either zzso sulfur or zzso depending on the initial concentration of zzso Both strains are capable of growth under strictly zzso conditions, but zzso uses zzso as well as zzso as its sole carbon zzso Neither strain reduces zzso however, zzso B reduces sulfur and displays zzso growth in the presence of zzso zzso hydrogen, and zzso Both strains grow at temperatures between 5 and 40 degrees zzso zzso is capable of growth at zzso zzso as high as zzso The present zzso zzso analysis suggests that both strains are members of the zzso subdivision of the division zzso with zzso most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso B most closely related to members of the zzso zzso The isolation of these two novel zzso sulfur bacteria from oil field brine suggests the presence of a subterranean sulfur cycle driven entirely by hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and zzso
