Several zzso including the gene regulatory protein zzso factor zzso have been shown to contain tandem repeats of sequences of approximately equal to 30 zzso acids that are believed to form structural zzso around bound zinc zzso zzso zzso The consensus sequence for these repeats is zzso zzso or zzso zzso where zzso is any zzso zzso Comparisons with zzso with known structures have allowed the development of a detailed three-dimensional model for these zzso consisting of an zzso zzso followed by an zzso The proposed structure provides a basis for understanding the detailed roles of the zzso zzso and allows construction of a model for the interaction of these proteins with zzso acids in which the proteins wrap around the zzso acids in the major zzso
