zzso cells have zzso zzso for at least zzso billion years in an apparently mutually beneficial zzso Studies on the zzso important crop trait zzso male zzso zzso have suggested the semblance of a zzso relationship between the nuclear and zzso zzso but molecular evidence for this is zzso Key players in zzso systems are the fertility zzso zzso genes required for the development of a functional male zzso in plants carrying a zzso zzso zzso In the majority of cases, zzso genes zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso We show that most zzso for which extensive zzso sequence data exist contain multiple zzso genes related to zzso zzso These zzso genes show a number of characteristic features compared with other zzso zzso including zzso zzso and unique patterns of evolution, notably high rates of zzso to synonymous zzso suggesting diversifying zzso The highest probabilities of diversifying selection were seen for zzso acid zzso 1, 3, and 6 within the zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in zzso processing, and mapping the selection data to a predicted consensus structure of an array of zzso motifs suggests that these zzso are likely to form zzso contacts to the zzso zzso We suggest that the selection patterns on zzso genes reveal a molecular zzso between the nuclear and zzso zzso that has persisted throughout most of the evolutionary history of zzso
