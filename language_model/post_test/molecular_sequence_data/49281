A novel human zinc finger protein gene that contains both ring finger and zzso domain was first isolated by zzso differential display between the zzso of fertile adults and zzso patients followed by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso Total 6 zzso of the human gene span a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence that was mapped to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The mature processed zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with a zzso ring finger and three zzso zzso zzso analysis of the human gene identified two zzso signals in zzso 6 resulting in alternative zzso zzso zzso of Northern zzso and zzso of zzso extracted from multiple zzso revealed that the gene has two transcripts of which the shorter transcript was expressed abundantly in fertile adult zzso but much less in zzso of zzso patient, fetus as well as other human zzso These data suggest that the gene may play a role in human zzso and male zzso
