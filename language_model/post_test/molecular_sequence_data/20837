zzso genes zzso DNA binding proteins that play pivotal roles in the determination of complex zzso Members of one zzso zzso function as zzso genes and play key roles in the retinal development of all seeing zzso zzso within the zzso zzso including fly zzso mouse Small eye and human zzso lead to severe retinal defects in their respective zzso In zzso zzso and twin of zzso play zzso roles in the developing zzso One particularly interesting characteristic of these genes is that, although expression of either gene can induce zzso eye formation in zzso zzso there are differences in the location and zzso at which the eyes zzso zzso zzso much larger zzso eyes, at higher zzso and in a broader range of zzso than twin of zzso In this report we describe a series of experiments conducted in both zzso and flies that has identified protein zzso that are responsible for the differences in tissue zzso These zzso appear to contain zzso zzso and zzso activity of distinct zzso We propose a model in which the selective presence of these activities and their relative strengths accounts, in part, for the disparity to which zzso eyes are induced in response to the forced expression of zzso and twin of zzso The identification of both zzso zzso and zzso activity within the zzso protein zzso our understanding of how this gene family regulates tissue zzso
