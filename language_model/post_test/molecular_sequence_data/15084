zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso family are zzso zzso with similar three-dimensional zzso However, their zzso relationship is difficult to detect on the basis of sequence zzso We have previously described the discovery of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso which required a combination of manual and zzso techniques applied to predicted protein zzso 

Here we describe how the use of gene structure analysis and comparative zzso enabled a more extensive understanding of these genes early in the discovery zzso More recently, additional zzso zzso sequences have shown that there are between one and potentially nine copies of zzso zzso genes in each zzso and that several species have single zzso versions of the zzso zzso zzso 

The variable number of single zzso zzso zzso in zzso along with recently identified genes in zzso zzso to zzso allows a story of zzso evolution to be zzso This model suggests that the gene zzso and single zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are positively selected for within a zzso These characteristics are also shared with the fish zzso and could be responsible for the generation of the zzso family and also the single zzso zzso zzso
