zzso acid is an important building block for zzso and zzso zzso strategies to increase the chances of finding zzso capable of zzso at the C2 position and to avoid the degradation of zzso acid via the usual zzso zzso acid, were zzso Three bacterial strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated from enrichment cultures with zzso acid as the sole source of carbon and zzso zzso characterization of these strains indicated that they represent new bacterial zzso All three strains completely zzso zzso acid, and evidence is presented that the first step in the degradation zzso of strain zzso zzso is zzso at the C2 zzso zzso cells of this strain grown on zzso acid also zzso zzso acid at the C2 position, but did not further degrade the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest degree of zzso zzso sequence similarity to members of the zzso zzso and zzso
