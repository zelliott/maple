Little is known about what determines patterns of host association of zzso transmitted zzso over evolutionary zzso We examine the evolution of associations between zzso zzso flies zzso zzso particularly in the zzso and zzso species groups, and their zzso transmitted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso species were identified by molecular characterization of zzso collected from zzso zzso In addition, DNA sequence data is used to zzso the zzso relationships of both host zzso zzso zzso II, zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Host and zzso zzso are not zzso with patterns of host association resulting from frequent and sometimes rapid host zzso zzso zzso are not zzso and host switches have occurred between zzso and zzso related zzso zzso zzso There is evidence for some zzso association between zzso and zzso with some zzso zzso associated with certain host zzso Overall, these host associations are highly zzso and appear to be driven by a combination of repeated opportunities for host colonization due to shared breeding sites and large potential host ranges of the zzso
