zzso different point zzso in zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso of the human zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso cause the early onset zzso DNA depletion disorder, zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso region of pol gamma revealed a cluster of four zzso zzso at highly zzso zzso in the thumb zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso at less zzso positions in the adjacent palm zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso forms of pol gamma revealed that zzso zzso in the thumb zzso reduced zzso activity more than zzso relative to the zzso zzso whereas the palm zzso zzso retained zzso zzso zzso zzso All six zzso zzso retained physical and functional interaction with the pol gamma accessory zzso zzso and none of the six zzso exhibited defects in zzso zzso in zzso However, differential DNA binding by these zzso suggests a possible orientation of the DNA with respect to the zzso during zzso To our knowledge this study represents the first zzso analysis of the thumb zzso in pol gamma and examines the consequences of zzso disease zzso in this zzso
