The structures of the zzso part of zzso isolated from eight zzso coli zzso zzso type 1 hybrids have been determined using sugar and zzso analysis plus zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso The hybrids express parts of the zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso repeating unit because of the presence of zzso a zzso expressing an zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso The various classes of hybrids are the result of zzso zzso 1000 insertions in zzso zzso different zzso zzso The following structural elements were zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso zzso a class I zzso zzso Class IV zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Class V zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural sequences are identical to those found in the zzso from native zzso zzso type zzso In the hybrid zzso the terminal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso core is fully zzso by zzso zzso type 1 repeating units, or parts zzso
