A protein II zzso gene from zzso zzso was cloned in zzso coli and characterized by DNA sequence zzso As with other reported zzso zzso this gene contains an zzso initiation zzso which is out of frame with respect to the remainder of the zzso zzso acid zzso A zzso fusion was constructed in zzso coli which linked the zzso sequence to the signal zzso of zzso This zzso fusion differs from the zzso protein only in the first seven zzso at the N zzso In zzso coli, the zzso fusion product exhibits properties analogous to those of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso fusion product is a major component of the zzso coli outer membrane and it is exposed on the cell zzso The zzso fusion protein also exhibits the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
