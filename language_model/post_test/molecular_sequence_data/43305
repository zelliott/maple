The master two-dimensional gel database of human colon zzso cells currently lists cellular proteins from normal zzso and the zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso 1990, 11, zzso zzso et zzso zzso 1994, 15, zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso maps of cellular proteins from zzso zzso cells, acquired under both zzso and reducing conditions, are zzso Fifteen cellular proteins are identified in the reducing zzso gel map, and seven in the zzso gel map, along with a tabular listing of their zzso zzso and mode of zzso We also include our mass zzso based procedures for identifying zzso resolved zzso This procedure relies on a combination of zzso column zzso zzso internal zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso sequence analysis by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and protein identification using available database search zzso These data, and descriptions of the zzso employed in this laboratory for identifying zzso resolved proteins can be zzso via the zzso zzso zzso
