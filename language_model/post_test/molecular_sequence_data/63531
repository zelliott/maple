zzso cell zzso factor zzso also known as zzso is a highly zzso zzso protein found in living species from bacteria to zzso Originally a curiosity identified zzso in zzso studies but having no obvious functional importance, zzso has now been shown to exert three distinct activities of central importance to cellular zzso and innate zzso Within the cell, zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso the zzso step in a salvage zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By virtue of this role, it can regulate cellular levels of zzso and so impact not only cellular zzso but also zzso zzso such as zzso Although it lacks a signal zzso zzso is released by a variety of cells, and elevated levels can be found in the systemic circulation of patients with a variety of inflammatory zzso As an zzso zzso zzso can induce the cellular expression of inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso has been shown to be an zzso expressed by fat cells that exerts a number of insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso in a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases including zzso acute lung injury, zzso arthritis, inflammatory zzso disease, and zzso zzso and plays a key role in the persistence of inflammation through its capacity to inhibit zzso zzso This review summarizes the admittedly incomplete body of emerging knowledge about a remarkable new zzso of innate zzso
