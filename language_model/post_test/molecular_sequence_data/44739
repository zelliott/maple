zzso of zzso zzso express at their cell surface zzso proteins zzso that are believed to contribute to the protection of the zzso from zzso and other host defense zzso In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the gene zzso a zzso zzso originally designated zzso that is expressed by the zzso zzso zzso clone zzso The gene was isolated by probing a zzso library with a zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The zzso gene specifies a zzso Da protein with features common to all previously reported zzso including a high zzso and zzso content, a highly zzso zzso zzso domain and little similarity in the remaining zzso zzso zzso of the predicted sequence with the zzso sequence of zzso zzso revealed the absence of an zzso zzso extension from the mature zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso clone was found to undergo zzso changes resulting in the formation of two additional zzso zzso Free zzso groups were not detected in zzso zzso indicating that all zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso Possibly as a consequence of this zzso was found to be fairly resistant to zzso zzso Although zzso is able to bind zinc following zzso to a zzso zzso other analyses with both the zzso and cell associated zzso have failed to confirm significant zinc zzso binding to this zzso The latter result questions the assumption previously made by other authors that zinc binding to zzso constitutes an important structural and functional aspect of these zzso
