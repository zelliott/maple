A zzso zzso has been isolated from the corpus zzso of the Indian stick insect zzso zzso The zzso causes zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and is related to the previously isolated zzso zzso by zzso apparently by a zzso on the zzso zzso This appears to be the first example of such substitution on a zzso zzso
