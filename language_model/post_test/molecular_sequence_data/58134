zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso can be expressed by many types of zzso cells in response to diverse signals acting zzso including zzso and microbial zzso We previously showed that induction of zzso in mouse zzso by zzso gamma zzso and zzso zzso was at the zzso zzso From a mouse zzso library, we now cloned a zzso zzso from the zzso region of the zzso zzso and used zzso zzso mapping and primer extension to identify the zzso zzso start site within zzso The zzso initiation site is preceded by a zzso box and at least 22 zzso elements zzso to consensus sequences for the binding of zzso factors involved in the zzso of other genes by zzso or bacterial zzso These include 10 copies of zzso response zzso 3 copies of zzso zzso 2 copies each of nuclear zzso B, zzso response element, zzso protein 1, and tumor necrosis factor response zzso and one X zzso zzso in which all or the downstream one half or one third of this region of zzso were linked to a reporter gene zzso zzso zzso were zzso into cells of the zzso zzso zzso All these zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso but only the construct containing all zzso zzso zzso synergistic zzso by zzso plus zzso
