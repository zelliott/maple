Ole e 9 is an olive zzso zzso belonging to group 2 of zzso zzso The protein is composed of two zzso independent zzso an zzso domain zzso with zzso activity, and a zzso domain zzso that binds zzso We have determined the three-dimensional structure of zzso e 9 (101 zzso zzso which consists of two parallel zzso forming an angle of approximately 55 degrees , a small zzso zzso with two short zzso and a zzso zzso turn, all connected by long zzso zzso resembling a novel type of folding among zzso Two regions surrounded by aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been localized on the protein surface, and a role for sugar binding is zzso The zzso mapping of zzso e 9 shows that zzso zzso are mainly located on zzso although some of them are contained in secondary structural zzso Interestingly, the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso or zzso rather than zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso e 9 might help to understand the underlying mechanism of its zzso function and to determine possible zzso zzso
