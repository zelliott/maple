zzso G from a patient zzso from acute zzso zzso zzso bound specific zzso sites in early zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prevented zzso zzso The zzso was zzso and identified as an zzso approximately zzso protein with a zzso of zzso that strongly activated complement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Shimizu, and zzso zzso 1992, zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso was zzso by affinity zzso using zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso on an zzso zzso zzso was monitored by zzso and Western zzso using the binding characteristics of the specific zzso present in zzso zzso The molecular weight of the zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso was an zzso approximately zzso protein and the internal zzso acid sequence was found to be zzso to those of the zzso zzso zzso of group A zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity and zzso binding zzso Using zzso rabbit zzso the zzso was found to be present in the zzso of 22 of 22 patients in the early stage of zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated in human zzso zzso for the first time using zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was found in the zzso of 46 of 50 zzso patients within 3 months of zzso These results led us to speculate that zzso bound to the zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso via zzso and complement zzso
