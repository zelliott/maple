zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and we showed earlier that zzso zzso of zzso are zzso In this study, zzso was treated with zzso M zzso which resulted in removal of 14 zzso zzso zzso including 4 clustered zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso After intravenous injection into rats, zzso zzso was cleared within 10 zzso by the liver zzso cells zzso of the zzso In contrast to native zzso zzso was rapidly zzso after liver association zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso within 10 zzso zzso of zzso to isolated zzso liver cells was zzso with a zzso of 186 zzso zzso zzso This is in striking contrast to the binding of native zzso zzso 10 zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso of rats with 20 zzso of zzso of body weight reduced the liver association of zzso low density zzso zzso by zzso whereas zzso had no effect at this zzso With isolated zzso liver cells, zzso was a more effective competitor for zzso binding than native zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso versus zzso zzso Selective modification of the zzso of zzso with zzso reduced the liver association by approximately zzso and abolished the capacity of zzso to inhibit the binding of zzso zzso in zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that the zzso cluster of zzso at positions zzso is involved in its massive, low affinity association of zzso with the liver, possibly to zzso but is not essential for the zzso of zzso remnant zzso The zzso sequence at positions zzso which resembles the binding site of zzso zzso may mediate the high affinity binding of zzso and block the binding of zzso to the remnant zzso with high zzso
