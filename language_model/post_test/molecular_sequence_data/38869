zzso such as zzso via production of zzso oxide and an increase in zzso can induce zzso smooth muscle relaxation without zzso reduction in zzso light chain zzso zzso or zzso zzso These findings suggest that regulatory systems, other than zzso zzso and zzso partially mediate zzso zzso In zzso carotid artery, we found that a zzso zzso analogue induced relaxation without zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso the zzso zzso relaxation was associated with a reduction in zzso consumption, suggesting that the interaction between zzso zzso and the thin filament was zzso zzso relaxation was associated with a zzso increase in the zzso of a protein on zzso We identified this protein as heat shock protein 20 zzso a member of a family of proteins known to bind to thin zzso When zzso of zzso zzso were zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso may increase its affinity for the thin zzso We noted that a domain of zzso is partially zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of skeletal zzso zzso The zzso zzso which contains this domain, bound to zzso filaments only in the presence of zzso a characteristic of zzso zzso High zzso of zzso abolished zzso force in zzso zzso carotid zzso zzso also partially decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso on zzso may have a role in smooth muscle relaxation without zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso sequence at zzso acid zzso zzso that inhibited force production in zzso carotid zzso We zzso that zzso of zzso regulates force independent of zzso zzso via binding of zzso to thin filaments and zzso of zzso zzso
