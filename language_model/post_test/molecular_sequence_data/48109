We have constructed a physical map of the zzso DNA of a zzso male sterile zzso sugar beet line, zzso and compared it with that published for normal fertile sugar beet zzso zzso to clarify the differences between the zzso and normal zzso zzso The zzso zzso is present as a single circular zzso of zzso zzso or as two molecules of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be highly rearranged relative to the normal zzso zzso with at least zzso zzso and/or inversion events being required to align the two zzso Analysis of zzso patterns of known zzso genes and rearranged regions revealed six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose expression is altered in the zzso line relative to the normal zzso Of these six, only the zzso transcript pattern differs between zzso and zzso zzso making it likely that the zzso locus is involved in zzso zzso in sugar zzso
