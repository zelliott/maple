Novel methods for molecular zzso of zzso crude drugs zzso were established based on zzso zzso length zzso zzso and direct sequencing of zzso zzso Two regions inside the zzso zzso were selected as molecular markers for identification and discrimination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The Region 1 zzso zzso zzso amplified from zzso and zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso gave 2 bands of 180 zzso and 80 zzso on zzso gel zzso after zzso with a restriction zzso zzso whereas the zzso amplified from zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso remained zzso which allowed zzso identification of zzso By direct sequencing of Region 2 zzso zzso and comparison of the zzso sequence data sets we could not only discriminate zzso and zzso but also identify the original plant species of each crude drug zzso A simple and reliable protocol for rapid preparation of DNA suitable for zzso from as little as 1 zzso of zzso crude drugs was also zzso
