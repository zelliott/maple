zzso variation at the zzso region encompassing the zzso protein genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso was surveyed in two populations of zzso zzso one from Europe and the other from zzso We found that the European population shows an zzso and large zzso structure, which extends throughout the approximately zzso surveyed zzso zzso This structure is depicted by two major zzso groups segregating at intermediate frequency in the sample, one zzso with nearly no variation, and the other at levels more typical for this zzso This pattern of variation was incompatible with neutral predictions for a population at a stationary zzso Nevertheless, neutrality tests contrasting zzso and divergence data fail to detect any departure from the standard neutral model in this species, whereas they confirm the zzso behavior previously observed at the zzso gene in zzso zzso Although positive zzso selection may have been responsible for the observed unusual zzso variation structure, zzso simulation results do not allow rejecting the hypothesis that the pattern was generated by a recent bottleneck in the history of European populations of zzso zzso
