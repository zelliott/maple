We report the fist genetic transformation system, shuttle zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso transformation zzso we have successfully transformed zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso For plasmids with a single zzso recognition site, dam zzso of zzso DNA (in zzso or in zzso was found to enhance transformation efficiency from 7- to zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso the replication origin cloned from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carries a cloned zzso zzso DNA fragment, zzso possibly of zzso origin, that supports maintenance of zzso as a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicated two regions required for zzso zzso a zzso zzso segment containing a zzso imperfect, zzso repeat sequence and a second region zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also evaluated two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for use as zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso The plasmids zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and structurally stable in zzso zzso for greater than 60 generations of growth under zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in zzso zzso zzso carrying either zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso like the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso These studies provide the basic tools for the genetic manipulation of zzso zzso
