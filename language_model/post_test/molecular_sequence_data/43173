A prior genetic study indicated that activity of Sir zzso proteins at a hypothetical zzso locus is essential for long life zzso In this model, the zzso zzso would direct the Sir protein complex to the zzso zzso giving rise to a long life zzso We show by indirect zzso that zzso and zzso are redirected to the zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso is dependent on both zzso a novel zzso gene that extends life span, and its zzso zzso zzso the Sir complex is zzso from zzso to the zzso in old zzso zzso We propose that the zzso is the zzso locus and that zzso function is compromised in old zzso cells in a way that may be zzso by targeting of Sir proteins to the zzso
