The type b capsule of zzso zzso zzso is a critical factor for zzso zzso survival in the blood and the establishment of invasive zzso Other zzso factors associated with type b strains may also play a role in invasion and sustained zzso leading to the seeding of deep zzso The gene zzso zzso is the only zzso gene found to be specific to type b strains until zzso Here we report the discovery of an approximately zzso genetic zzso zzso that is present primarily in type b zzso zzso gel zzso and Southern zzso were used to map this new locus between zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso in Rd, a zzso zzso of a zzso d zzso It is inserted at the 3' end of zzso and has regions whose zzso content differs from the average zzso zzso content of zzso zzso An zzso zzso which encodes a zzso like zzso is located downstream of zzso zzso zzso based on the sequences within the zzso locus have been used to screen 61 zzso zzso strains (2 type zzso 22 type zzso 2 type zzso 1 type zzso 3 type zzso 7 type zzso and 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso from our zzso This zzso locus exists in all 22 type b strains and two zzso strains and is likely to have been acquired by an ancestral type b zzso
