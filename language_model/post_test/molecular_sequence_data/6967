The proliferation of human zzso zzso cells is zzso regulated in the presence of certain members of the zzso family of zzso This includes zzso 8 zzso and zzso factor 4 zzso which in combination are able to zzso resulting in cell suppression at very low zzso of these zzso A series of zzso and zzso zzso proteins were analyzed in an in zzso colony formation zzso for zzso zzso cells to assess zzso of these proteins that are required for zzso zzso of either of the two zzso motifs within zzso resulted in an inactive zzso zzso within the zzso zzso interface region also resulted in zzso that were incapable of suppressing colony zzso A class of zzso zzso consisting of zzso of either zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso were observed to inhibit zzso cell proliferation at zzso which were between zzso and zzso lower than either the zzso or zzso zzso proteins zzso These zzso zzso possessed activities that were comparable to or better than the activity observed when zzso and zzso were added together in zzso One of these highly active zzso proteins was observed to be zzso more active than either zzso or zzso alone in suppressing not only the proliferation but also the cell cycling of zzso zzso cells following intravenous injection of the zzso into zzso zzso of additional zzso zzso in the colony formation zzso which centered on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in the observation that the highly active zzso zzso required both zzso acid at zzso acid zzso 4 and either zzso or zzso at zzso zzso Single zzso at either of these positions resulted in zzso with zzso activity equivalent to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso were observed to be significantly reduced in their ability to activate isolated human zzso suggesting that separate mechanisms may exist by which zzso zzso cells and zzso are affected by zzso
