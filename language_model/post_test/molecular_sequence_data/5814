zzso plays an essential role in protecting the pulmonary system from toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel protein capable of zzso the zzso zzso bond of zzso and of converting zzso C4 to zzso zzso A rat zzso of zzso was identified and was found to be highly expressed in cultures of zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso predicts a zzso acid protein with zzso identity to human zzso zzso was zzso expressed in normal trachea but was strongly induced by zzso growth factor in cultures of zzso zzso zzso was also highly expressed in lung tumors induced by inhalation of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso 1) is expressed in normal zzso cells, 2) can be induced by zzso growth factor, and 3) is elevated after chemical zzso The induction of high levels of zzso may play an important role in protecting the lung from zzso stress or other toxic zzso
