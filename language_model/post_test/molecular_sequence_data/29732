zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso can stimulate zzso and inhibit cell proliferation directly and independently of binding zzso or indirectly by forming complexes with zzso and zzso that prevent them from zzso the zzso zzso to stimulate cell survival and zzso To date, zzso actions only have been demonstrated in a limited number of cells that do not zzso or respond to zzso To assess the general importance of zzso mechanisms, we have generated human zzso zzso that cannot bind zzso or zzso by substituting zzso for six zzso in the proposed zzso binding site, zzso and expressing the zzso zzso construct in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso to zzso was reduced zzso The zzso zzso zzso still was able to inhibit DNA synthesis in a mink lung zzso cell line in which zzso by zzso zzso previously had been shown to be exclusively zzso zzso only can act by zzso mechanisms since it is unable to form complexes with the zzso that inhibit their zzso We next compared the ability of zzso and zzso to stimulate zzso in zzso zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso cells are known to zzso and respond to zzso so that zzso could potentially act by either zzso or zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso zzso cell death and zzso zzso DNA fragmentation to the same extent and with the same concentration dependence as zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso mechanisms are major contributors to zzso zzso in zzso cells and may play a wider role in the zzso and zzso actions of zzso
