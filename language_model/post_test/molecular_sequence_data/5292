A zzso sequence within the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso that directs initiation of zzso DNA replication is identified in this zzso zzso zzso was localized within a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is situated immediately upstream of the gene zzso the major zzso zzso The activity of zzso was investigated in a transient replication zzso in which the ability of zzso zzso to promote DNA replication was zzso zzso of zzso plasmids was autonomous and resulted in the generation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso replication was found to depend on viral DNA zzso activity supplied by zzso zzso The sequence required for zzso function was found to reside within a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence is highly complex, containing 23 direct repeats zzso and 16 zzso repeats zzso of lengths greater than 10 zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso are exceptionally large, being 80 and 88 zzso in zzso zzso In addition, two sequence elements (of zzso and 120 zzso with zzso symmetry were identified within zzso Although the sequence similarity of zzso zzso with its human zzso counterpart is zzso there is a striking resemblance in the overall organization of several zzso and zzso within both zzso
