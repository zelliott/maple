The zzso protein zzso is required for the zzso of group A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, K, and N) across the cell envelope of zzso zzso zzso in zzso can render cells tolerant to these zzso and cause hypersensitivity to zzso and certain zzso as well as a tendency to leak zzso zzso zzso contains a long zzso domain which connects a membrane anchor to the zzso domain, which is required for zzso zzso The functional role of the zzso domain was tested by deletion of zzso 56 to 169 zzso zzso 166 to zzso zzso zzso or 54 to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso which removed the zzso half, the zzso half, or nearly the entire zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso were expressed from a zzso in an zzso coli strain producing no zzso zzso zzso Cellular sensitivity to the zzso zzso was increased for each deletion zzso zzso that more than half of the zzso zzso domain is necessary for cell envelope zzso zzso of either the zzso or zzso half of the zzso domain resulted in a slight zzso zzso decrease in zzso of the zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and N compared to cells producing zzso zzso when these zzso were expressed alone or with zzso zzso and zzso In cells containing zzso zzso the zzso of zzso A and zzso was decreased by a factor of zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso A and N was not zzso In contrast, for zzso E1 action on zzso zzso cells, there was little decrease in the zzso activity zzso or the rate of zzso zzso which was similar to that from zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso by which cellular zzso of zzso E1 is zzso by the zzso protein differs from that for zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso explanations for the distinct interaction and unique zzso mechanism of zzso E1 are zzso
