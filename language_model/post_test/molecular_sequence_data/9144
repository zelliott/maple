Nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso is an important zzso factor for the production of zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is an important target for inflammatory disease zzso and graft zzso A novel cell permeable zzso zzso zzso has been identified from a human zzso factor, and zzso zzso to zzso or zzso protein was efficiently delivered into cells in zzso and in zzso A cell permeable form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and showed zzso effects on human zzso or zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso activity suppression and zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso asthma model alleviated zzso and zzso zzso of inflammatory cells in the lung and caused airway zzso and airway zzso These results suggest that cell permeable zzso zzso has clinical potential as an zzso agent for inflammatory zzso
