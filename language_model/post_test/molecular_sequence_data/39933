The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso which are termed zzso I and zzso zzso Both function as effective electron donors to copper zzso zzso zzso in zzso As a first step towards identifying the zzso relevance of these electron transfer proteins in the zzso process, the gene zzso zzso zzso I was zzso and its expression with respect to zzso zzso We show that the zzso gene from zzso zzso is zzso and its expression is increased when cells are grown under zzso conditions in the presence of nitrate or zzso The expression pattern of zzso was similar, though not zzso to that of the zzso zzso zzso which encodes copper zzso and is in zzso with both gene products being zzso when the zzso zzso zzso zzso I was exported to the zzso of the zzso host zzso coli, was zzso at very high levels zzso zzso zzso protein per zzso and was fully loaded with zzso zzso donation from reduced zzso zzso to zzso was indistinguishable from the activity determined with the native zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that in zzso zzso zzso expression is coordinated with zzso and zzso zzso I is processed and matured in the zzso of zzso coli in the same way it is in zzso zzso
