zzso of zzso acids by zzso coli requires the genes zzso and zzso which were previously mapped between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Troy, zzso zzso zzso zzso This organization is confirmed and extended by physical mapping zzso An open reading frame beginning 135 zzso from the zzso zzso stop zzso could code for a zzso zzso zzso predicted to contain 14 zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso is required for zzso acid zzso when expressed in zzso zzso is zzso to a putative zzso zzso by open reading frame zzso which maps between zzso and zzso in the zzso coli zzso However, unlike this hypothetical zzso or previously reported zzso zzso zzso contains a centrally located domain with two additional potential zzso segments plus one zzso zzso that may be important for the structure and function of zzso zzso
