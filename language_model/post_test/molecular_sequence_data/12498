A straightforward and extremely efficient reverse zzso painting technique is described which allows the rapid and unequivocal identification of any zzso zzso zzso zzso This procedure is used to determine the origin of unknown marker zzso found at prenatal zzso After zzso of the marker zzso and amplification of the dissected zzso by a zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso to zzso and normal zzso zzso with the zzso probe pool is zzso With this strategy, marker zzso present in zzso fluid samples were successfully identified in three zzso The origin of the zzso markers was zzso as zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since a specific FISH signal on zzso can be obtained within 2 working days using a probe generated without any zzso from one zzso zzso only and without additional image processing devices, this technique is considered to be highly suitable for routine application in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
