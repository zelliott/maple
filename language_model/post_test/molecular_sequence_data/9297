zzso zzso play a central role in many cellular processes that rely on the movement of zzso and organic molecules between the environment and the cell, and between cellular zzso zzso have been well characterized in plants and green algae, but little is known about zzso or their evolutionary histories in the red zzso Here we examined zzso expressed sequence tag zzso that zzso putative membrane zzso in the economically important red seaweed zzso zzso zzso These zzso are part of a comprehensive zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso we identified 30 trees that support the expected zzso of red and green zzso zzso the zzso zzso and 19 expressed sequence tag zzso that show evidence of zzso gene transfer involving zzso The majority zzso of analyzed zzso zzso zzso with unresolved zzso demonstrating the difficulty in resolving the evolutionary history of zzso We observed molecular features of many zzso transport systems in marine algae, and the potential for zzso of zzso zzso genes that are associated with fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although both the zzso and zzso locations of the zzso proteins require further investigation, our study provides red zzso gene candidates associated with transport functions and novel insights into the biology and evolution of these zzso
