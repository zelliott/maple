zzso zzso zzso proteins are important zzso factors in plant responses and signal zzso The zzso proteins can improve the drought and salt tolerance of plants, which provides an excellent opportunity to develop zzso genetically modified crops in the zzso In the present study, a novel zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was amplified by zzso zzso chain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully zzso The fusion protein was induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The purity of the final zzso zzso protein was zzso analysis and zzso stability tests were conducted to assess the zzso of the zzso zzso and acute toxicity tests were conducted in mice by oral administration of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that there was almost no similarity between the zzso protein and known zzso and the protein was immediately zzso in simulated gastric and zzso fluid within 15 zzso In addition, no observed adverse effects were found in mice after 14 zzso The results preliminary revealed that the protein is safe for human based on the current zzso
