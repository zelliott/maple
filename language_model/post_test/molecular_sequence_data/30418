The zzso protein is a likely candidate for structuring DNA in the bacterial zzso We have studied zzso leading to its binding to DNA (and in particular to zzso coli zzso and gal zzso in zzso through the pattern of attack of both zzso and the zzso complex zzso The binding of zzso depends on the primary sequence of zzso zzso also associates with recognition sites for specific zzso in particular with the zzso box and the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso box of the zzso zzso promoter does not change the pattern of zzso zzso with zzso In contrast, binding of zzso to the strong zzso promoter zzso Ps and zzso appears to change the zzso state of this zzso Similar changes in accessibility of the minor groove surrounding the respective binding sites were observed for both zzso and zzso zzso
