To control the spread of bovine zzso zzso in cattle through contaminated animal zzso screening of feed products is zzso We designed five pairs of zzso to identify specifically raw and heat-treated tissue from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso A forward common primer was designed based on a zzso DNA sequence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso were designed to zzso with a zzso DNA sequence for each species zzso All zzso were developed to create a specific zzso product small enough (less than 200 zzso to be suitable for heat-treated zzso To evaluate the effect of heat treatment, a severe zzso condition zzso degrees C at 300 zzso for 20 zzso was zzso zzso zzso were obtained from all types of heat-treated meat zzso Analysis of zzso vegetable meals revealed that the detection limit of the zzso was zzso for each species zzso This zzso analysis can be used as a routine method for detecting banned zzso ingredients in raw and heat-treated zzso
