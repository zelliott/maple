The zzso genes in zzso zzso are unique nitrogen fixation genes that zzso potential membrane proteins zzso zzso and zzso and potential zzso proteins zzso and zzso In this study, we first analyzed the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso By activity and zzso analysis of expression of zzso zzso to zzso coli alkaline zzso zzso protein was shown to span the zzso membrane with its zzso zzso regions exposed to zzso By alkaline treatment of membrane zzso and following zzso analysis using zzso against zzso proteins expressed in zzso coli, both zzso and zzso proteins were revealed to zzso at the periphery of the zzso zzso Second, mutual interaction of the zzso proteins was analyzed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso and their zzso zzso The contents in cellular zzso indicated that zzso and zzso stabilize each other and that the presence of zzso is necessary for stable existence of both zzso These results support a hypothesis that the zzso products are zzso of a membrane zzso Finally, we detected zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso by data base searches and in zzso coli by cloning of a zzso of an zzso zzso followed by a data base zzso Close comparisons revealed that zzso has potential binding sites for zzso and zzso which are similar to those found in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso show similarity to zzso of zzso zzso zzso We predict that the putative zzso complex represents a novel family of zzso zzso zzso
