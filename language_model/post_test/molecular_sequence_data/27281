The zzso signal recognition particle family zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is required for the correct zzso of zzso in several bacterial zzso Here, we zzso the regions of zzso zzso zzso that are required for its function and targeting to the old cell pole, and we present evidence for a mechanism by which zzso establishes zzso polar zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso motifs reduced zzso binding and the efficiency of zzso zzso and caused zzso zzso However, replacement of zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect, suggesting that while zzso binding influences zzso function, zzso activity might not be zzso zzso associated with the inner membrane in the absence of other zzso zzso and a functional zzso fluorescent protein fusion was targeted to the old cell pole where the zzso is zzso zzso targeting to the pole was zzso as no other zzso proteins were zzso Neither the zzso zzso zzso region nor the zzso zzso zzso was required for polar zzso though they were essential for zzso zzso zzso of the central zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso did however severely reduce the efficiency of zzso polar zzso as well as zzso zzso The intrinsic zzso of zzso to the old cell pole membrane suggested that zzso might function at an early stage of zzso zzso to test this, we assessed the effect of zzso on the zzso of the earliest zzso structural zzso the zzso ring protein zzso zzso of zzso to the pole required only zzso and no other zzso zzso zzso polar targeting was abolished in the absence of zzso and by deletion of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso establishes the site of zzso assembly at the old cell pole membrane by recruiting the earliest zzso structural component zzso
