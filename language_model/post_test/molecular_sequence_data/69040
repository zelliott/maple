The previously defined binding motif of zzso class I zzso zzso peptides consists of a Y zzso in position zzso and a zzso zzso with a large zzso side chain zzso I, or zzso in position zzso of optimal zzso or zzso zzso We show now that the presence of a charged or a F zzso in position zzso reduces the zzso competitor activity of several zzso T zzso zzso zzso and model zzso at a degree comparable to A zzso for the zzso or the zzso anchor zzso Various charged, zzso aromatic, and zzso zzso acids were zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in its zzso zzso zzso form, whereas a more restricted panel of zzso was tested in the zzso zzso influenza zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of all the zzso zzso so far defined also revealed an zzso zzso at this zzso These additional structural constraints present in the zzso binding motif may thus improve the prediction of new zzso recognized by T cells in the context of this zzso zzso
