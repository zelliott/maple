The development of the nervous system of zzso was investigated at the cellular level based on the expression of the zzso marker gene zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that an zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in individual cells within the neural plate, but the cells exhibited no obvious arrangements in early zzso without distinct zzso However, in zzso with zzso zzso cells were clustered along the zzso axis in close register with the boundaries of zzso resulting in reiterated cell arrangements that became evident along the zzso Furthermore, zzso cell clusters appeared one by one along with the development of underlying zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis with the zzso gene revealed that the cell clusters contain zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression was also observed outside the zzso probably in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has a large number of putative sensory cell precursors as early as the early zzso zzso Taking recent gene expression studies and anatomical studies into consideration, we discuss zzso and zzso features of the zzso nervous zzso
