We isolated and zzso a nuclear gene and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of 19 zzso and 18 zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The predicted zzso protein shows zzso zzso acid identity with zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso is highest in the mature leaves and lowest in the zzso zzso expression zzso in zzso from zzso zzso leaves demonstrated that the putative zzso transit zzso of zzso encodes dual targeting signals directing the protein into zzso and zzso This strongly suggests that zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso genes from two different plant zzso zzso zzso transcripts have two potential translation initiation zzso An in zzso translation zzso indicated that a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso fused to an zzso produced two zzso translated from the first and second initiation zzso This implies that the dual targeting of zzso protein is zzso in part, at the level of zzso We have designated this protein zzso
