We have examined whether a precursor form of zzso B, a zzso protein that plays a role in the zzso control of several zzso including zzso zzso light chain and zzso zzso alpha zzso could be activated in zzso by protein zzso zzso activity of zzso B was induced in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells by incubation with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or protein zzso C zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso did not activate zzso B in nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with the human natural zzso cell line zzso which can be induced to express the zzso zzso alpha zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso from zzso cells were incubated with zzso or zzso zzso fraction for 30 zzso at 30 degrees C, zzso B was zzso into the zzso This zzso did not occur at 4 degrees C and was inhibited by wheat germ zzso but not by zzso zzso Our findings support the conclusion that zzso B exists in the zzso of zzso cells in an inactive form that can be converted by exposure to zzso or zzso to an active zzso form that can zzso to the zzso
