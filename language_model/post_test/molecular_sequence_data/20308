The number of zzso zzso that comprise the human zzso is not zzso This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the total number of distinct zzso and zzso structures in the human zzso as well as limited information about the zzso zzso recognized by zzso proteins zzso which include zzso zzso zzso microbial zzso zzso and zzso Available evidence indicates that zzso binding sites may accommodate zzso zzso made up of 2 to 6 linear zzso together with their potential side chains containing other zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso comprise repeating zzso zzso where a linear sequence of 5 to 6 zzso may be required for zzso Based on our current knowledge of the composition of the zzso and the size of zzso binding sites, zzso and zzso may contain approximately zzso zzso zzso with an additional approximately zzso theoretical zzso sequences in zzso These numbers provide an achievable target for new chemical and/or zzso zzso and raise new challenges for defining the total zzso and the zzso recognized by zzso
