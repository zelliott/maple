The zzso zzso is a major compartment of storage protein and zzso zzso zzso synthesis of these storage compounds occurs during seed development with breakdown occurring during zzso In this study, we have isolated four independent preparations of zzso from both developing and zzso seeds of zzso bean zzso zzso and used zzso zzso and a combination of zzso and zzso sequencing, to zzso and identify differences in protein complement at both zzso zzso protein spots in the developing seeds are zzso and 19 individual proteins were identified, the majority of these are zzso of seed storage synthesis and protein zzso The detection of these zzso storage proteins in the zzso is discussed in terms of protein trafficking and zzso In zzso seed zzso 15 spots are zzso 5 of which were identified, amongst them was zzso zzso which is a component of the zzso which is believed to originate from the zzso zzso no proteins involved in complex zzso zzso were identified in the zzso soluble zzso fraction indicating that they are probably all integral membrane zzso
