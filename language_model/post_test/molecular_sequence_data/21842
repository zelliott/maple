zzso coli is one of the best studied organisms in all of biology, but its zzso structure has been difficult to resolve with current data and zzso zzso We analyzed single zzso zzso in zzso of representative strains to reconstruct the zzso of its zzso 

The zzso of zzso coli varies according to the segment of zzso zzso zzso between extant zzso coli groups is largely limited to only three intergroup zzso 

zzso zzso most likely are legacies of a complex zzso zzso However, zzso coli are now in an zzso in which they no longer broadly share zzso Using the definition of species as organisms that freely exchange genetic material, this zzso dormancy could reflect either the end of zzso coli as a species, or herald the zzso of zzso coli groups into new zzso
