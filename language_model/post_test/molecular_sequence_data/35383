Resistance to zzso zzso isolate zzso was evaluated in 102 zzso families derived from a cross between the resistant soybean zzso zzso 15 and the susceptible zzso Williams and zzso using simple sequence repeat zzso zzso The segregation ratio of zzso zzso and susceptible zzso in the population suggested that the resistance in zzso 15 was dominant and zzso Twenty-six zzso zzso markers were identified on soybean zzso 17 zzso linkage group zzso zzso zzso which were linked to the resistance gene based on zzso segregation analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso flanked the resistance gene at a distance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also screened in this zzso This is the first zzso resistance gene mapped on zzso 17, which is designated as zzso Eight putative genes were found in the mapped region between markers zzso and zzso Among them, two candidate genes zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso 15 and Williams were identified and zzso And the differences in zzso sequence and the putative zzso acid zzso respectively, were identified within each candidate gene between zzso 15 and zzso This novel gene zzso and the linked markers should be useful in developing soybean zzso with durable resistance to zzso zzso
