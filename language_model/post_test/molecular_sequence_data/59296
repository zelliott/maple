zzso zzso have an essential role in the removal of terminal zzso acid zzso from zzso and are distributed widely in zzso The human zzso zzso occurs in complex with zzso and protective zzso A zzso and is deficient in two genetic zzso zzso caused by a structural zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in which the loss of zzso activity is secondary to a zzso of zzso We identified a full-length zzso clone in the zzso data base, of which the predicted zzso acid sequence has extensive zzso to other zzso and bacterial zzso including the zzso domain and zzso In zzso zzso localized the human zzso gene to zzso band zzso a region known to contain the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso in deficient human zzso showed that the zzso is zzso in zzso and restored zzso activity in a zzso zzso The authenticity of the zzso was verified by the identification of three independent zzso in the open reading frame of the zzso from clinically distinct zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso failed to generate zzso activity, confirming the zzso effect of the zzso These results establish the molecular basis of zzso in these patients, and clearly identify the zzso protein as zzso zzso
