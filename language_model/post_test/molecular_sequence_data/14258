zzso bacteria are capable of zzso diverse zzso substances from within the cell by use of zzso zzso pumps in which the zzso inner membrane zzso is connected to the outer membrane channel protein via the membrane fusion zzso In this work, we describe the crystal structure of the membrane fusion protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso pump in the zzso ring zzso zzso zzso study on the zzso complex of zzso and the outer membrane protein zzso reveals that zzso makes a zzso interaction with zzso which suggests a zzso model for zzso and zzso This zzso model agrees well with genetic results and depicts detailed zzso Opening of the zzso channel is accompanied by the simultaneous exposure of a protein structure resembling a zzso zzso which zzso with the complementary zzso structure in the zzso zzso Taken together, we suggest an assembly and channel opening model for the zzso zzso This study provides a better understanding of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
