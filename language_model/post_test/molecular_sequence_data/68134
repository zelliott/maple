zzso zzso A zzso proteins comprise a family of zzso coded for by at least three genes with zzso variation and a high degree of zzso between zzso The synthesis of certain members of the family is greatly increased in zzso However, zzso is not often used as an zzso marker despite being at least as sensitive as zzso zzso zzso proteins can be considered as zzso since they associate with plasma zzso mainly within the high density range, perhaps through zzso zzso zzso It is not known why certain subjects expressing zzso develop secondary systemic zzso There is still no specific function attributed to zzso however, a popular hypothesis suggests that zzso may zzso metabolism of high density zzso zzso This may impede the protective function of HDL against the development of zzso The potential significance of the association between zzso and zzso needs further zzso
