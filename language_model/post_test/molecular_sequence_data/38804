A zzso coding zzso zzso zzso which was isolated from a pig liver zzso contained a zzso zzso open reading frame and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was zzso identical to those of human and rat zzso The pig zzso gene spanned about 21 zzso and was divided into 10 zzso The sites of zzso junctions were completely identical to those in the human and rat zzso zzso Five zzso boxes, but not a zzso box, were found in the zzso region of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso responsive elements were also found in this zzso The main zzso start site determined with the zzso method with zzso zzso from the liver and zzso was located at 143 zzso upstream from the initiation zzso in both zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that an approximately zzso zzso zzso which is produced through the use of a zzso signal zzso located at zzso zzso downstream of the stop zzso was expressed in all the zzso examined in zzso The zzso levels were much higher in the liver and zzso than in the zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, after the onset of zzso a smaller size of zzso (about zzso zzso was found in the zzso but not in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was produced through the use of an unusual zzso signal zzso located at 28 zzso downstream of the stop zzso
