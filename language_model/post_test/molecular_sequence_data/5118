We have used gene targeting in the zzso cell line to create a cell line which expresses a fusion between zzso and a mouse steroid zzso and which behaves as a conditional loss of function zzso of zzso Under restrictive conditions these cells arrest at the zzso junction and after a delay of approximately zzso h die by zzso These results indicate that zzso is either necessary for zzso zzso movement or for zzso a signal which triggers zzso function during zzso Our approach is simple and zzso to a wide range of proteins with general cell autonomous functions in zzso
