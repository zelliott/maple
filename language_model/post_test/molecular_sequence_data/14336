zzso family small zzso are involved in diverse signaling processes including zzso growth, and zzso The activity of zzso zzso is regulated by cycling between zzso zzso zzso inactive and zzso zzso zzso active forms, in which zzso zzso exchange factors zzso predominantly function to promote zzso of the zzso In animals, most zzso zzso possess a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain which functions as a zzso zzso However, no proteins with the zzso domain have been identified in plants so zzso Instead, zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain responsible for zzso activity have been found to constitute a large family in zzso In this study, we found rice zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso with rice zzso zzso zzso an important signaling factor for immune zzso The zzso domain of zzso exhibited the zzso activity toward zzso as found in animal zzso zzso indicating that plants have the functional zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso enhanced zzso production of zzso oxygen species in zzso Reduction of zzso and zzso zzso levels by zzso interference resulted in the suppression of zzso zzso defense gene expression and zzso zzso Thus, it is likely that zzso regulates immune responses through zzso of zzso
