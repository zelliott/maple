A reduced zzso serves as the natural electron donor for key zzso of the zzso aromatic metabolism in the zzso zzso zzso zzso It contains two zzso clusters and belongs to the zzso zzso type of zzso zzso which differ from the zzso type by a zzso acid zzso between two successive zzso and a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso zzso properties of both zzso clusters from zzso zzso zzso have been investigated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso revealed the presence of two zzso transitions at zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso recorded at zzso where only one cluster was reduced zzso than zzso zzso indicated the presence of a spin mixture of S zzso zzso and zzso spin states of one reduced zzso zzso No typical S zzso zzso zzso signals were zzso At lower zzso (less than zzso zzso the more negative zzso cluster displayed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 20 K which were typical of a single S zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster with a zzso of zzso However, when the temperature was decreased zzso to 4 K, a magnetic interaction between the two clusters gradually became zzso as a zzso splitting of both the S zzso zzso and S zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso where both clusters were reduced, additional zzso zzso signals were observed which can only be assigned to spin states with spins of zzso The results that were obtained establish that the common typical zzso acid sequence features of zzso zzso determine the unusual zzso properties of the zzso zzso The observation of different spin states in zzso zzso zzso is novel among zzso zzso
