A new virus isolated from red raspberry plants and detected in the main production areas in northern Washington State, USA and British Columbia, Canada was fully zzso and found to be a novel member of the family zzso The virus was designated as zzso zzso virus zzso based on the fact that it is zzso when present in single infections in several zzso virus indicators and commercial raspberry zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso divided into 10 zzso zzso The length of the zzso segments zzso was similar to those of other zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso except zzso have the zzso terminal sequences zzso A point zzso at each zzso of zzso resulted in the sequences zzso zzso repeats adjacent to each zzso zzso as well as stem zzso and extended pan handles were identified by analyses of secondary structures of the zzso zzso All zzso except zzso and zzso contained a single open reading frame zzso on the positive sense zzso Two zzso overlapping zzso were identified in segments zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso alignments of the putative proteins zzso by the main zzso in each segment revealed a high identity to several proteins zzso by zzso from different zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso the most zzso protein among zzso revealed a zzso zzso identity between zzso and Rice ragged stunt virus zzso the type member of the zzso zzso indicating that these two viruses are closely zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso clusters with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso belong to the zzso zzso which includes zzso with spiked core particles zzso zzso In addition, two zzso binding zzso regarded as zzso sequences among zzso zzso were also found in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a novel zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
