The activity of zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso sites are expected at 2 highly zzso zzso zzso zzso A functional truncated zzso zzso containing the zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso proteins were expressed in a zzso cell zzso All the zzso proteins had decreased zzso efficiency zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso of less than zzso zzso to zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso with zzso zzso with unchanged zzso Although zzso had a zzso of zzso zzso the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased zzso and the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher than zzso zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso was zzso higher than that of zzso zzso The zzso for zzso was zzso higher than zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso binding sites are zzso but not zzso involving both common and different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed low activity in a metal zzso zzso however, their zzso activities were increased zzso to zzso in buffers containing zzso zzso or zzso This observation indicates that zzso zzso acids in the second zzso motif might not be involved in binding zzso zzso but may serve other functions such as zzso or inhibitor binding in zzso
