zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso DNA binding protein zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso have been obtained by a batch method from material obtained by zzso digest of full-length zzso The zzso zzso grow as zzso prisms to a zzso size of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is zzso with unit cell zzso a zzso zzso A and c zzso zzso zzso There are either three or four molecules of zzso per zzso zzso To improve the zzso of zzso zzso protein has been produced using a zzso expression system and shown to crystallize under the same zzso
