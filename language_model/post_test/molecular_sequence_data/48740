The limited locations of zzso zzso are crucial for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, our analysis of the nuclear zzso of an zzso red zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the first evidence of zzso zzso genes that contain zzso and/or multiple zzso Some genes exhibited both zzso and zzso structures in which the zzso of the zzso coding sequence lies upstream of the zzso and an zzso is inserted into either zzso These highly disrupted zzso zzso which account for zzso of all nuclear zzso zzso are expressed via the orderly and sequential processing of zzso zzso motifs at zzso junctions and zzso of zzso zzso zzso probably by a zzso zzso zzso zzso with an unidentified zzso zzso The results revealed a considerable diversity in zzso zzso zzso properties and zzso zzso which will help to zzso the acquisition mechanism of the zzso disrupted zzso zzso
