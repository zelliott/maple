The objective of this study was to profile gene expression in cells of the chicken immune zzso A zzso zzso zzso was constructed that contained genes with known functions in the chicken immune system, in addition to zzso sequence tags zzso zzso with zzso immune system zzso which were systematically characterized by zzso zzso Genes and zzso that met the zzso criteria were amplified and placed on a zzso The zzso contained 84 immune system gene zzso As a means of zzso the zzso was then used to examine gene expression in chicken B cells after zzso zzso zzso gene expression was observed at 6, 12, and 24 h but not at 48 h after zzso The results were validated by zzso zzso chain zzso The zzso showed a high degree of zzso as demonstrated by zzso and zzso correlation zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso developed in this study may be used as a tool for monitoring gene expression in the chicken immune zzso
