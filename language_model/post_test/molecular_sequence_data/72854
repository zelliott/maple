zzso DNA zzso a zzso acid type I zzso zzso the zzso and rejoining of DNA strands through a zzso zzso To identify zzso acids that participate in the zzso reaction, we introduced zzso zzso at 39 positions within a zzso zzso acid segment upstream of the zzso zzso zzso wild type and zzso proteins were compared with respect to their activities in relaxing zzso zzso The majority of zzso proteins displayed wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso that relaxed DNA at reduced rates were subjected to kinetic analysis of the strand zzso and zzso steps under zzso and equilibrium zzso For the wild type zzso the observed zzso zzso rate constant zzso was zzso zzso and the zzso equilibrium constant zzso was zzso The most dramatic zzso effects were seen with zzso removal of the basic side chain reduced the rates of zzso and zzso by factors of zzso and zzso respectively, and shifted the zzso equilibrium in favor of the zzso bound state zzso zzso zzso Introduction of zzso at position 223 restored the rate of zzso to zzso that of the wild type zzso We conclude that a basic zzso is essential for zzso zzso and suggest that zzso is a constituent of the active zzso zzso zzso effects were observed at two other positions zzso and zzso at which zzso zzso slowed the rates of strand zzso by 1 order of magnitude and shifted the equilibrium toward the zzso bound zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in all members of the zzso type I zzso family; zzso is zzso among the zzso zzso
