Five independent zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were identified in a partially zzso deficient patient with zzso and in four zzso zzso Using the zzso chain reaction zzso technique coupled with direct sequencing, the zzso sequences of the entire zzso coding region amplified from the zzso and also of each zzso amplified form the zzso DNA were zzso Three independent point zzso in the coding region were detected in the partially zzso deficient patient zzso 1) and in two zzso patients zzso 2 and zzso resulting in single zzso acid zzso The family study of Case 3, utilizing a zzso restriction site created in the zzso zzso indicated that the mother was a zzso and a sister and a fetal brother had inherited the normal zzso gene from the zzso In two other zzso causing zzso syndrome, a portion of the zzso gene was deleted, and zzso zzso was missing in both zzso A zzso deletion at the zzso end of zzso 4 resulted in formation of three different types of abnormal zzso zzso zzso The other zzso zzso 5) produced abnormal zzso including 26 zzso of zzso 8 instead of the deleted 58 zzso at the zzso end of zzso 9, because of a zzso deletion from zzso 8 to zzso zzso
