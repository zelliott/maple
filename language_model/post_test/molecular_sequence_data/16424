Evidence is accumulating to strongly suggest that drug zzso are one of the zzso factors governing the zzso profile of zzso Effort has been made to identify genetic variation in drug zzso zzso In particular, genetic variations of the human zzso zzso gene have been most extensively zzso zzso more than fifty single zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been zzso However, at the present time, information is still limited with respect to the actual effect of those genetic zzso on the function of zzso In this context, we have undertaken functional analyses of zzso zzso To zzso the impact of genetic zzso on the zzso specificity of zzso we have developed a high-speed screening system and a new zzso relationship zzso analysis zzso This review addresses functional aspects of the genetic zzso of zzso and provides the standard method to evaluate the effect of zzso on the zzso
