Very small zzso zzso are problematic for zzso zzso because of the proximity of their 3' and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the recognition of a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso I gene that resides quite close to the adjacent upstream zzso The zzso failed to be included in spliced zzso when placed in a zzso gene unless accompanied by the upstream zzso The requirement for the upstream zzso disappeared when the zzso was internally expanded, suggesting that the zzso sites bordering the zzso are compatible with those of other zzso zzso zzso and that the small size of the zzso impaired zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site of the natural upstream zzso did not result in either zzso skipping or zzso of a cryptic zzso zzso site, the normal zzso zzso for such zzso Instead, a spliced zzso accumulated that still contained the upstream zzso In zzso the zzso failed to assemble into zzso complexes unless either internally expanded or accompanied by the upstream zzso Thus, impaired usage of the zzso in zzso was accompanied by impaired recognition in zzso and recognition of the zzso was facilitated by the presence of the upstream zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso the zzso in zzso and in zzso properties of the zzso zzso suggest a mechanism for the recognition of this zzso in which initial recognition of an zzso unit is followed by subsequent recognition of the zzso
