In zzso zzso production is restricted to zzso zzso This cell zzso zzso is considered to involve cell zzso expression of the zzso zzso Recently, there have been several reports that sequences in the zzso zzso region of the mouse zzso gene are responsible for cell zzso expression of the zzso in zzso As the first step in the study of the evolution of the regulatory mechanisms for zzso gene function in zzso we constructed a fused zzso zzso which includes a zzso zzso zzso sequence of the human zzso gene fused with mouse zzso zzso By introducing the fused gene into zzso eggs of zzso mice, we obtained two mice that exhibited pigmentation in the skin and eyes and established a transgenic line from one of zzso Further analyses revealed that the zzso was expressed cell zzso in these transgenic zzso We zzso therefore, that the zzso zzso zzso upstream region of the human zzso gene contains zzso zzso essential for cell zzso expression of the zzso genes in mice and zzso zzso of our study may provide a clue to zzso the evolutionary process of regulatory mechanisms of the zzso zzso
