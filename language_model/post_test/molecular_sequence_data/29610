zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prevalent airborne zzso zzso A zzso major zzso component from zzso zzso has been identified as an alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, also known as zzso zzso 13 zzso by zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso 

In the present study, zzso zzso 13 was further characterized in terms of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activity, zzso release and zzso zzso with alkaline zzso zzso zzso from two other prevalent zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a zzso alkaline zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso has zzso and zzso zzso The previously determined zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso major zzso is identical to that of zzso zzso of the zzso Starting from zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso of the mature alkaline zzso zzso has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso with two zzso and two putative zzso zzso It has 83 and zzso sequence identity with the alkaline zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 13 was recovered from inclusion bodies and isolated under zzso zzso This zzso protein reacted with zzso zzso in serum from an zzso patient and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that reacted with the zzso component from zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso native zzso zzso 13 is identical to that determined previously for the zzso major zzso in crude zzso zzso zzso The zzso native zzso zzso 13 has zzso activity with zzso as the zzso at pH zzso This zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 13 was also able to degrade gelatin and collagen but not zzso zzso from 5 zzso patients released zzso zzso when exposed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, zzso for zzso zzso 13 was able to compete with zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso c 13 or zzso zzso 13 in a zzso zzso 

These results demonstrated that the zzso major zzso of zzso zzso is an alkaline zzso zzso These results also indicated that zzso patients primarily zzso by either of these prevalent zzso species may develop allergic symptoms by exposure to other environmental zzso due to zzso zzso zzso against this zzso
