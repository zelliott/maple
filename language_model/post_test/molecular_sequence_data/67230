zzso of a zzso library of the hop zzso zzso 72 and zzso cloning were used to isolate members of an zzso of zzso genes that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso known to be valuable medicinal compounds present in hop zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso members showed more than zzso and zzso identity on zzso and zzso acid levels, respectively, and retained all zzso zzso acids that form the zzso center characteristic for zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter exhibited low sequence zzso in addition to conservation of all predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene with the zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso leaves with zzso zzso zzso led to a zzso increase of the zzso activity when zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene with zzso led to an increased zzso of zzso zzso as observed by zzso reverse zzso chain zzso zzso lines of zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene showed unusual patterns of zzso pigmentation and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of transgenic leaves of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso genes arranged as a tandem led to quick pigmentation within 12 h after zzso zzso It is indicated that the zzso promoter contains functional zzso zzso an efficient response to zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in hop zzso It can be expected that the zzso factor could significantly influence the expression of the zzso zzso in transgenic hop and modify the hop zzso
