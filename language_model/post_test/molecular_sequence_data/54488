zzso acid bacteria zzso are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as zzso in the zzso However, the zzso relationships among zzso species remain under intensive debate zzso to disagreements among different data zzso 

We performed a zzso analysis of zzso species based on 232 genes from 28 zzso zzso zzso Regardless of the zzso methods used, combined analyses yielded an zzso zzso tree zzso with strong supports for all zzso The zzso species examined were divided into two zzso Group 1 included families zzso and zzso Group 2 included families zzso and zzso Within Group 2, the zzso species were divided into two zzso One zzso comprised of the zzso complex of zzso zzso and two other species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso complex, zzso zzso separated first, while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were clustered into a sister zzso The other zzso within Group 2 consisted of the zzso zzso including five species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this zzso zzso zzso was positioned most zzso followed by two zzso one corresponding to zzso zzso zzso pair and zzso and the other including zzso pair and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than zzso The genes identified as useful were related to translation and zzso structure and zzso zzso and a zzso set zzso genes zzso zzso resistance protein B zzso DNA zzso III zzso and zzso binding protein zzso zzso 

Our zzso analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of zzso species, and also revealed the zzso utility of several zzso We zzso that the occurrence of zzso independent adaptation events in zzso species, have resulted in their occupation of various zzso Further analyses of more genes from zzso representative zzso species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of zzso species to various environmental zzso
