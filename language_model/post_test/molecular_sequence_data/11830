zzso encodes a zinc finger DNA binding protein required for the zzso of the zzso zzso HO zzso and zzso encodes a zzso DNA binding zzso In zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso and zzso proteins have demonstrated that zzso and zzso bind zzso to the HO zzso In this report we investigate the regions of the zzso and zzso proteins required for cooperative DNA zzso The analysis of each protein gives a similar zzso the zinc finger or zzso DNA binding zzso are each sufficient for in zzso DNA zzso but additional regions of each protein are required for cooperative DNA zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments were conducted with promoters with altered spacing between the zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso that increased the distance between the two binding sites had minimal effects on either in zzso cooperative DNA binding or in zzso upstream zzso sequence zzso These observations suggest that the interaction zzso of zzso and zzso are flexible and can tolerate an increase in distance between the two binding zzso The mechanism of the cooperative DNA binding by zzso and zzso is zzso
