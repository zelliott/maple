The San Nicolas Island fox zzso zzso zzso is genetically the most zzso sexually zzso animal population yet reported and has no variation in zzso genetic zzso Such low levels of variation imply lower resistance to zzso reduced zzso and problems in distinguishing kin from zzso In zzso the zzso contains genes that influence disease resistance and kin recognition and may be under intense balancing selection in some zzso zzso genetic variation at the zzso might persist despite the extreme zzso shown by neutral zzso We examine variation of five zzso within the zzso of San Nicolas Island zzso and find remarkably high levels of zzso Further, we show by simulation that genetic zzso at neutral zzso and high zzso variation could arise only through an extreme population bottleneck of zzso individuals, approximately zzso generations ago, accompanied by unprecedented selection zzso of zzso on zzso zzso These results support the importance of balancing selection as a mechanism to maintain variation in natural populations and expose the difficulty of using neutral markers as surrogates for variation in zzso zzso
