The structure of a full-length zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution and shows that the 20 zzso extension at the C zzso forms a zzso zzso loop on the surface of the zzso zzso zzso of the extension are bound to the zzso site, possibly competing with zzso zzso The binding mode of these zzso is compared with that of zzso and zzso zzso The observed structure helps to zzso the observations that full-length mature zzso binds zzso zzso with reduced zzso
