The zzso alpha zzso zzso density zzso zzso protein zzso zzso binds several classes of zzso zzso at independent zzso In addition, alpha zzso can bind multiple copies of the zzso zzso protein zzso Both zzso and zzso fragments of zzso exhibit zzso and the fragments apparently bind to different sites on the zzso zzso completely zzso the binding of all presently known zzso zzso whereas several zzso such as alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso are poor zzso of zzso zzso Since zzso is largely an zzso zzso that normally does not occupy alpha zzso at the cell surface, we hypothesized that an established zzso zzso might bind to those sites on the zzso capable of binding the zzso zzso We found complete zzso between zzso zzso fragments and fragments of zzso zzso containing the recently identified binding domain for alpha zzso zzso zzso Nielsen, zzso zzso zzso Meyer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited the binding of several alpha zzso zzso in a pattern similar to that of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso was a poor competitor of binding of the zzso zzso fragment, whereas it zzso effectively with zzso for binding to the zzso The results provide evidence that zzso zzso binds to the site on zzso also available for binding of the zzso domain of zzso and suggest that zzso may bind to or overlap the site available for the zzso domain of zzso
