DNA zzso is an important zzso zzso zzso of gene expression in cells and therefore actively involved in gene regulation, zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play a major role in the zzso of proteins that have an zzso zzso catalyzing both the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a type II zzso which zzso zzso has been shown to have a pivotal role in pole zzso assembly and germ cell development in zzso and also to be an associate factor of zzso for germ cell development in zzso Here, we report a zzso of zzso identified in zzso zzso zzso which was detected in the brain, zzso muscle, heart, liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of adult fish by reverse zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso is restricted to zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso transcripts were detected as early as the zzso stage and in all the zzso of zzso during zzso In zzso zzso is a maternal zzso factor of zzso of zzso possibly playing an important role in zzso and zzso in adult zzso
