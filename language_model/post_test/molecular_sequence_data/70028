zzso also called simple sequence repeats zzso have yielded an important class of DNA markers most notable for mapping zzso zzso To study the occurrence of zzso and their inheritance in zzso a search was made of 280 zzso zzso zzso Six zzso were chosen and unique zzso zzso were designed for zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Eight different zzso zzso were studied with these six primer pairs and a mean of zzso zzso patterns occurred within the expected size zzso For five of these putative zzso the segregation in a zzso restriction zzso length zzso mapping population was zzso Four of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes from which the primer sequences were zzso The fifth primer pair zzso showed segregating zzso but the products were larger than zzso To verify the existence of the original zzso in the segregating zzso products, a CT zzso containing a CT zzso and an arbitrary leader zzso was used to zzso these zzso The four zzso that zzso with the original gene were zzso as anticipated, whereas a suspicious zzso product obtained when using the zzso zzso could not be zzso Based on these results it is concluded that zzso can be a valuable tool for zzso zzso
