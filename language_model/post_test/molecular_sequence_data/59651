Using a differential screening strategy, a 2 zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso wing discs zzso The available reading frame of zzso zzso specifies a conceptual protein with two distinct zzso a 395 zzso acid region corresponding to 105 repetitions of the zzso zzso forming unit arranged in 9 zzso of zzso zzso zzso by short interruptions of zzso zzso and a zzso domain of 175 zzso acids zzso of zzso These characteristics suggest that the zzso protein is a new member of the collagen zzso the first one characterized in zzso Northern blots reveal a unique zzso zzso zzso in zzso wing discs, zzso and zzso In wing discs, the zzso zzso transcripts accumulate during the last zzso zzso and the spinning zzso In zzso studies reveal that this zzso is dose dependent and zzso within 1 h in response to zzso which acts without de zzso protein zzso A model of regulation of transcript zzso with regards to the hormonal level is zzso
