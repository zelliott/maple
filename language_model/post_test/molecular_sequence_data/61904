zzso zzso is a member of the zzso gene family and has been suggested to relate to brain zzso The structure of the rat zzso gene was studied to understand the mechanism for the expression of multiple forms of zzso zzso which were revealed in the zzso zzso and DNA sequencing analysis of a bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso together with analysis of a zzso start site by a zzso hunting, indicated that the zzso gene spans about 39 zzso zzso and consists of 19 zzso in which the first and second zzso were first found in zzso An alternative promoter usage at different zzso start sites may produce three types of messages, zzso zzso and zzso and there is a zzso that lacks zzso 18 for each type of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified to be zzso These six zzso might explain the zzso of the zzso protein in the zzso The zzso without zzso 18 were revealed in the embryonic and early zzso brains while those with zzso 18 were detected in the maturing and adult zzso zzso hybrid mapping suggests that the rat zzso gene is located on zzso 19 at zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the rat zzso gene to those of the zzso mouse and human genes suggests that the zzso binding site is a candidate regulatory zzso
