The genetic engineering of zzso zzso strains is an approach that is emerging and ready to become established as a successful methodology in developing zzso of the original, zzso important, natural products obtained from the zzso The current report highlights this zzso by demonstrating the high-level production of novel zzso The zzso pathways of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were combined by transferring the genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso antibiotics that were produced possessed structural features characteristic of compounds from both of the zzso zzso
