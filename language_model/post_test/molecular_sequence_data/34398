zzso zzso sequences were determined and subjected to comparative analyses from two fish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso originating from the white sturgeon zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso isolated from the black zzso zzso zzso are recently approved species of the zzso zzso of the family zzso 

An almost zzso fragment, spanning between the genes of the DNA zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso from each zzso 

The size, position and orientation of 2 partial and 3 full open reading zzso contained in the studied zzso fragment, proved to be similar to their counterparts in zzso the type species of the zzso zzso Thus, a zzso zzso gene block was zzso In the members of two other zzso zzso and zzso of the family zzso no such gene block could be zzso the location and orientation of the zzso genes showed significant zzso 

The results of zzso calculations were in good agreement with the zzso arrangements zzso as zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and separated from the lineages of the other two zzso The new sequence enabled the inclusion of a zzso zzso zzso that of the Australian zzso into a zzso zzso
