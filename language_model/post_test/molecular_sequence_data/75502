The gene zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been cloned in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA obtained by partial zzso with zzso were zzso into the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso coli zzso cells were transformed with the resulting zzso zzso zzso for clones which produced zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with zzso raised against the zzso zzso A positive colony was found which produced complete chains of zzso zzso as concluded form zzso gel zzso of the zzso zzso stained for protein or used for Western zzso After zzso of the zzso insert of this zzso the structural gene could be located on a zzso DNA zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso sequence of the gene consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso including the zzso start zzso and the zzso stop zzso It is preceded by an zzso region of 85 zzso and the structural gene for zzso A putative zzso site and promoter sequence are zzso The derived zzso acid composition is in excellent agreement with that previously published for the isolated zzso The predicted relative molecular mass is zzso including the zzso The overall zzso with the zzso coli zzso is high with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso From a comparison with the three-dimensional structure of the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it appears that essential zzso in all four zzso have been zzso The zzso is strongly zzso although expression does not depend on the zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso is, in all the respects tested, identical with the native zzso
