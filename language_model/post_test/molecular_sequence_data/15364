zzso zzso and zzso tissue develop from duct zzso and share expression of several zzso factors and other molecular markers also involved with the development of neural zzso We examined rat pancreatic tissue from fetal life until adulthood for the expression of zzso downstream regulated gene 4 zzso a gene shown to be expressed during zzso cell zzso zzso pancreatic ducts from zzso rats were maintained in culture and gave rise to clusters of cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso which subsequently contained zzso zzso Using reverse zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso expression and zzso protein presence for zzso in cultured zzso cells, and brain of zzso zzso By zzso cloning of the zzso zzso DNA the molecular form of zzso expressed in pancreatic ducts and zzso rat pancreatic cells was identified as zzso and its presence in intact zzso of fetal and zzso rats was demonstrated by zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso and zzso while decreasing DNA synthesis and promoting the appearance of zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso on DNA synthesis and the zzso effect on zzso differentiation were reversed when the translation of zzso was prevented using zzso These findings indicate that zzso is expressed in pancreatic duct cells under zzso control and may be related to a reduction in proliferation and the onset of the zzso cell zzso
