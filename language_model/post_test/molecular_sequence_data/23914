DNA displacement synthesis by reverse zzso during zzso replication is required for the production of the linear precursor to zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was used to probe for the extent of DNA melting by human zzso virus, type 1 zzso reverse zzso in front of the primer zzso in model zzso displacement zzso zzso of the two base pairs downstream of the primer zzso and zzso zzso requires the presence of the next correct zzso indicating that DNA melting only occurs after the formation of the zzso complex with the zzso tightly clamped around the zzso The amount or extent of DNA melting is not significantly affected by the length of the zzso strand or the base composition of the DNA beyond the zzso zzso The zzso zzso form of zzso reverse zzso which is partially impaired for displacement zzso exhibits a reduction in the amount of melting at the zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate the importance of the observed melting to displacement synthesis and suggest that the zzso reaction is zzso by an intimate association between the fingers region of the zzso and the DNA in the closed clamp zzso of the zzso
