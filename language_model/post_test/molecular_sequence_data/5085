A highly repeated DNA sequence family, zzso with zzso arranged repetitive units zzso of approximately zzso has been identified in soybean zzso max zzso zzso Five related clones showing tandem repeats of a zzso zzso were isolated from a soybean zzso zzso zzso of Southern zzso experiments using three of the clones as zzso onto zzso DNA zzso with different restriction zzso were in agreement with a tandem arrangement of these sequences in the zzso A total of 12 zzso were zzso showing considerable sequence zzso A consensus sequence of 126 zzso was obtained that exhibits an average similarity of zzso to the zzso zzso In three of the clones identified, zzso units are significantly more similar to each other than to units from different zzso in the remaining two zzso however, similarity between the two units observed is low zzso while the overall similarity between the two clones is high zzso This indicates that in these cases the repetitive unit may be the zzso rather than the zzso Based on the presence of direct repeats within each zzso we suggest that the zzso zzso may itself have evolved by zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso The zzso family distribution is limited to annual soybeans and is not found, at least at zzso number, in related perennial soybeans or other members of the tribe zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso using four of the clones as zzso shows that the number of zzso locations differs depending on the stringency conditions and goes from two to eight when the stringency is progressively zzso The estimated copy number for one of the clones is from zzso to zzso but this may just represent a lower boundary for the whole family in consideration of the high sequence divergence observed within the zzso FISH and sequence analysis therefore indicate that different zzso as well as zzso repeat units are present in the zzso family, very much like those in zzso alpha satellite DNA, and that some of the zzso seem to exhibit divergence on a zzso zzso
