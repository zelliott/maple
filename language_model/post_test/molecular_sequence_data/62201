zzso a member of the zzso cassette zzso zzso is the central membrane zzso of the zzso V zzso system in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of zzso were identified as critical zzso for both zzso V zzso and zzso zzso zzso By zzso degradation with zzso and a mixture of zzso zzso a stable zzso zzso domain (which showed zzso zzso activity when zzso was zzso Such zzso activity was zzso and zzso and could be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso At low zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso (but not zzso significantly enhanced zzso activity, suggesting that the size of the zzso is important for zzso Together with comparisons of the sequences of members of the zzso zzso family, these results indicate that zzso and zzso are the critical zzso in the zzso zzso domain for the zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso zzso
