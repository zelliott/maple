Recent findings concerning the structure of the zzso zzso complex formed by DNA zzso I and its DNA zzso as well as the nature of interactions with zzso that bind zzso to this zzso complex, have led to two proposed models for the binding of the zzso inhibitor zzso to the zzso I zzso zzso While these models differ in many regards, they both suggest the involvement of the zzso group of zzso in a donor hydrogen bond with an zzso side chain functional zzso zzso five zzso of zzso that differ only at zzso have been evaluated for their ability to bind to the zzso zzso zzso complex and thereby inhibit zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso bound as well to the zzso zzso complex as zzso despite the absence of a zzso at zzso capable of contributing a donor hydrogen zzso
