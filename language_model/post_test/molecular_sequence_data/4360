Snow Mountain virus zzso is the reference strain for zzso 3 as determined by immune electron zzso of the human zzso that are associated with epidemic zzso In order to establish the genetic relationship of its zzso protein with those from other human zzso the sequence of the open reading frame 2 zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein was zzso The zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso in length and the deduced protein of zzso zzso acids had a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence showed approximately 48 and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso proteins of the Norwalk zzso 1) and Hawaii zzso 2) human zzso reference zzso respectively, a finding consistent with its zzso zzso Furthermore, the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was found to share highest sequence identity zzso with the zzso human zzso in database zzso
