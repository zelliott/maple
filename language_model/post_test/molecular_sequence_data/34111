zzso methods have become an important tool for studying feeding interactions under natural zzso Despite their growing importance, many zzso aspects have not yet been evaluated but need to be considered to fully exploit the potential of this zzso Using feeding experiments with high zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we investigated how zzso zzso temperature affects prey DNA detection success and how zzso zzso methods differ in their zzso Moreover, the zzso of prey DNA detection among individual zzso zzso was tested using zzso and zzso that had zzso their prey for extended times zzso By screening all predators for three differently sized prey DNA fragments zzso zzso zzso we found that only in the longest zzso product, a marked decrease in prey detection success zzso zzso maximum zzso temperatures by 4 zzso resulted in significantly increased prey DNA detection rates in both zzso zzso Among the three zzso zzso methods, an zzso difference in sensitivity was zzso zzso screening of predators increased the total number of samples scoring positive, although the proportion of samples testing positive did not vary significantly between different zzso The present findings demonstrate that zzso sensitivity, in combination with other zzso factors, plays a crucial role to obtain robust zzso interaction zzso Future work employing molecular prey detection should thus consider and minimize the zzso induced variation that would also allow for better zzso zzso
