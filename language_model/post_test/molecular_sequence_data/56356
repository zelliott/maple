zzso zzso image processing and zzso sequence analysis were used to investigate the structure of the short zzso of zzso zzso This zzso an zzso of zzso is an zzso that binds the zzso zzso to the bacterial zzso Short zzso were isolated from zzso cells in which zzso is zzso and assembled correctly, but not incorporated into zzso zzso in negative zzso these zzso molecules are approximately 38 zzso in total zzso with an zzso head zzso 10 zzso long by 6 zzso zzso a zzso zzso of uniform zzso zzso zzso zzso and a small, seemingly flexible, zzso The primary sequence contains a domain consisting of tandem zzso each about 40 zzso long, extending from approximately zzso 50 to zzso zzso zzso mass analyses by scanning transmission electron zzso confirm that the zzso is a zzso The masses of the head, zzso and tail zzso are consistent with zzso zzso the zzso the repeat region, and the zzso zzso When short zzso are zzso extending from zzso their heads are zzso zzso zzso zzso that it is the tail that remains in contact with the zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso properties detects three zzso these suggest how the short zzso may be initially zzso in a compact zzso in the zzso state of the zzso from which it converts to the extended zzso when the zzso switches into its zzso zzso
