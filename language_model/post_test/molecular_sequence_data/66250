Lakes formed because of coal mining are characterized by low pH and high zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is often separated into an upper zzso zone zzso 3; zone I) with large amounts of zzso iron and a deeper slightly zzso zone zzso zzso zone zzso with smaller amounts of zzso In this study, the impact of pH on the zzso activities in both of these zzso zones was investigated, and molecular analyses that zzso the zzso microbial diversity were zzso zzso was formed in zone I and III zzso zzso at rates that were approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A shift to pH zzso conditions increased zzso formation in zone I by a factor of zzso A shift to pH 3 conditions inhibited zzso formation in zone zzso zzso libraries revealed that the majority of the clones from both zones zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso at zzso ranging from 2 to 5, zzso might be involved in the cycling of iron zzso zzso products specific for species related to zzso revealed that there were higher numbers of zzso related to cultured zzso or zzso species in zone III than in zone zzso From the zzso products obtained for zzso bacteria, only one zzso with a level of similarity to zzso zzso of zzso was zzso Using primer sets specific for zzso zzso products were obtained in higher DNA zzso from zone III than from zone zzso zzso analysis of clone libraries obtained from zzso enrichment cultures grown at pH zzso revealed that the majority of clones were closely related to members of the zzso primarily species of zzso Our results demonstrated that the upper zzso zzso was inhabited by zzso or moderate zzso which can also reduce zzso under slightly zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso inhabiting the slightly zzso zzso had only minor capacities to be active under zzso zzso
