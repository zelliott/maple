zzso derivatives with high specificity toward the reverse zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso were zzso The most potent compound, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso at a 50% zzso concentration of 90 zzso in zzso In cell culture zzso similar 50% zzso zzso were obtained with high specificity for zzso These substances were equally active against a zzso zzso No zzso effect was observed with an zzso zzso zzso zzso resistant to the zzso were generated in cell culture, and the zzso sequences of the respective zzso genes were analyzed zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences with the zzso sequence showed an zzso acid change at position 181 zzso to zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso as well as zzso and/or zzso by zzso zzso led to resistance against the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acids at positions 179 to 190 from zzso acquired only partial zzso to zzso zzso
