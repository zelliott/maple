We have studied the zzso chains of the zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso zzso by gel zzso and zzso zzso and structurally characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso in combination with chemical composition zzso The two zzso zzso obtained each proved to be homogeneous in their zzso and zzso in their zzso zzso The fraction representing the zzso zzso site of the zzso was found to contain zzso type zzso with structures zzso linked to zzso The other zzso fraction contained the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso attached to zzso Its zzso structures are of the zzso zzso zzso zzso see zzso This structure includes revisions of multiple structural features published for the zzso anchor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by Schmitz et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
