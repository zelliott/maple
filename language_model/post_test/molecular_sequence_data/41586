zzso zzso zzso are zzso involved in the transformation of the recalcitrant fraction of organic matter in zzso These zzso are also able to transform certain aromatic pollutants such as zzso aromatic zzso zzso and are known to be inhibited by zzso zzso This study aims to test the potential of some zzso strains newly isolated from natural environments subjected to high zzso pressure such as coastal zzso to produce zzso tolerant zzso Three strains were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (a zzso and the zzso produced by these zzso were zzso inhibited by zzso zzso compared with previous data from zzso Moreover, we tested their zzso towards various zzso which are widespread zzso zzso They were able to transform zzso to zzso and we determine zzso as the threshold of zzso potential for zzso zzso by these zzso
