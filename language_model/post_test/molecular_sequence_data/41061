zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and the pathogen of zzso zzso disease zzso zzso As a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso harbors ABC zzso that play important roles in exchanging chemical compounds between zzso zzso zzso and its zzso Here, we analyzed all the ABC zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso We identified 14 ABC zzso systems and predicted their structures and zzso zzso zzso sequence and structure analysis including multiple sequence zzso zzso tree zzso and structure comparison further support their function zzso Our study shows that this zzso could use these ABC zzso to import zzso zzso acids and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso iron, zzso and zzso resist to organic zzso heavy metal, and zzso drugs, maintain the composition of the outer membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the features of most ABC systems could be deduced from the abundant experimental data on their zzso we reported several novel observations within ABC system zzso Moreover, we identified seven zzso ABC systems that are likely involved in zzso gene expression regulation, zzso zzso regulation, and DNA zzso Our analysis reveals several candidates for further studies to understand and control the disease, including the type I zzso factor zzso system and its zzso that are likely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the ABC zzso systems responsible for bacterial zzso zzso that are good drug zzso
