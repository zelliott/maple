Two low molecular mass zzso from zzso zzso were zzso to zzso by zzso and zzso zzso They exhibit molecular masses of zzso zzso I) and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso points of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso display remarkable pH zzso zzso At 40 to 55 degrees C zzso II is more zzso than zzso I but less active on zzso In contrast to zzso I, zzso II is able to zzso zzso zzso Neither of these zzso zzso zzso They bind on zzso cellulose but not on zzso zzso Analysis of reaction zzso by high pressure liquid zzso revealed that both zzso cleave zzso the internal zzso bonds of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus the zzso zzso appeared to be true zzso The zzso terminal sequences of zzso I and II show to zzso zzso I shows high similarity with alkaline low molecular mass zzso of family zzso
