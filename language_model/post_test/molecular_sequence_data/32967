To zzso the molecular basis of control of the zzso gene in cell zzso zzso during normal cell zzso and in cancer cells lacking zzso zzso the mechanisms responsible for regulation of human zzso gene expression have been zzso Recently, naturally occurring zzso transcriptions have been reported to regulate gene expression through a variety of biological zzso zzso zzso transcribed from the opposite strand of the zzso gene was zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso to the zzso strand in human cancer cell lines and normal zzso was examined by zzso reverse zzso chain zzso The zzso and zzso of the transcript were determined by the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso A, followed by quantitative analysis of both sense and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso to the zzso coding strand was found to start within the first zzso of the zzso zzso and the expression coincided with zzso gene expression in various cultured cells and normal zzso This novel gene was named zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso A zzso zzso from the zzso zzso 1 promoter, while it increased the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso transcribed from the opposite strand of the zzso gene might be involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
