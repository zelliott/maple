zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso are small DNA viruses with zzso closed zzso zzso zzso infecting zzso Despite their extreme sequence zzso zzso a highly zzso region in the untranslated region zzso allows both viruses to be amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso infection was detected in 88 of 100 human plasma zzso amplified sequences were differentiated into zzso and zzso by analysis of melting profiles, showing that both viruses were similarly zzso zzso with zzso zzso also detected frequent infection with zzso viruses in a wide range of apes zzso zzso zzso zzso and African monkey species zzso zzso zzso These findings support the hypothesis for the zzso of zzso viruses with their hosts over the period of zzso zzso potentially analogous to the evolution of zzso zzso
