The ability to control specific zzso interactions zzso in zzso would be extremely helpful for analyzing zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) modular protein binding zzso are found in many signaling proteins and they play a crucial role in signal zzso by binding to zzso zzso 

Random in zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso screening was used to identify zzso in the second zzso domain of zzso that render interaction with its zzso temperature zzso Four of the zzso were functionally temperature sensitive in zzso cells, where temperature sensitivity was correlated with a pronounced instability of the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Two of the zzso affect zzso zzso in the zzso core zzso and zzso suggesting a general strategy for engineering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding positions in another zzso domain, that of zzso rendered the full-length zzso protein temperature sensitive for function and stability in zzso zzso 

Construction of zzso zzso zzso is a novel approach to regulating the function of zzso zzso in zzso Such zzso will be valuable in zzso zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, the methodology described here to isolate zzso zzso should be widely zzso to any domain involved in zzso zzso
