Plant zzso and zzso zzso that can disrupt zzso cellulose have great potential for applications in conversion of zzso Recent studies have been mainly focused on zzso zzso zzso that show relatively low activity in the promotion of cellulosic zzso Our aim was to isolate a novel zzso with greater disruptive activity, to establish an efficient way of producing zzso zzso and to zzso the procedure using zzso in zzso of cellulosic zzso 

A novel gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It consisted of a family 1 zzso module zzso followed by a zzso connected to a family 45 zzso zzso Using the zzso I promoter, zzso zzso was efficiently produced in zzso zzso with a yield of 105 zzso and showed significant disruptive activity on zzso zzso zzso reaction with both zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso cellulose zzso by approximately zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso can produce nearly twice as many reducing zzso as without zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso the zzso of cellulose was also studied using a zzso binding zzso 

We present a novel zzso zzso with considerable disruptive activity on zzso zzso and develop a better procedure for using zzso in zzso cellulosic zzso We thus provide a new approach for the effective zzso of cellulosic zzso
