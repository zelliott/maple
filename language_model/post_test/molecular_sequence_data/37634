A third zzso protein zzso zzso gene has been isolated from the human malaria zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The gene consists of five zzso and four zzso The open reading frame resulting from removal of the four zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso termed zzso consists of four distinct zzso characteristic of a member of the zzso family and displays the highest zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso to zzso the second zzso of zzso zzso The zzso variable domain is rich in zzso and zzso and contains multiple consensus zzso sites for a range of protein zzso The zzso domain possesses all zzso motifs of the protein zzso family except for the highly zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso VIII, which is replaced by a zzso zzso The sequence of the junction domain zzso 31 zzso acid zzso is less zzso The zzso regulatory domain contains four zzso zzso zzso each consisting of a loop of 12 zzso acid zzso which is flanked by two zzso Southern zzso of zzso DNA zzso showed that the zzso gene is present as a single copy per zzso zzso A 2900 zzso transcript of this gene is expressed specifically in the sexual zzso stage, indicating that zzso is involved in sexual zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso may serve as a link between calcium and zzso of zzso zzso
