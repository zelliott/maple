Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recently identified in zzso zzso and found to be localized as solo genes within large zzso zzso regions mainly composed of zzso truncated and zzso by zzso point zzso zzso The zzso resistance gene has been overcome within 3 years in outdoor experiments in France and, here, we investigate the molecular basis of evolution toward zzso at the zzso zzso A region of 235 zzso was zzso in a virulent isolate and showed the deletion of zzso and three divergent mosaics of zzso zzso was found to be absent from zzso of 70 virulent zzso with multiple events of zzso The sequencing of virulent zzso in 24 zzso revealed a few cases of point zzso that had created stop zzso in the zzso The most frequent zzso events, however, were zzso leading to the modification of 4 to zzso of the bases compared with the zzso zzso and generating 2 to 4 stop zzso Thus, zzso is described for the first time as an efficient mechanism leading to zzso and the multiple patterns of zzso observed suggest that multiple zzso events could occur independently in a single field population during 1 zzso
