The zzso zzso plays an important role in control of the abundance of cell cycle zzso Mice lacking zzso an zzso protein and zzso recognition component of an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were zzso Although zzso animals are viable, cells in the zzso mice contain markedly enlarged zzso with zzso and multiple zzso and show a reduced growth rate and increased zzso zzso cells also exhibit increased zzso of both zzso E and zzso The elimination of zzso E during S and zzso zzso is impaired in zzso cells, resulting in loss of zzso E zzso zzso studies showed that zzso interacts specifically with zzso E and thereby promotes its zzso and degradation both in zzso and in zzso These results suggest that specific degradation of zzso E and zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso complex, and that zzso may control zzso replication and zzso zzso by determining the abundance of cell cycle zzso
