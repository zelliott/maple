To evaluate whether zzso in zzso serves as a signaling factor regulating zzso zzso zzso studies were performed using a novel normal rat zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso to block zzso channels, exposure of the zzso membrane to zzso significantly increased the zzso current zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The response to zzso is zzso by zzso zzso transport because it is inhibited by 1) the zzso channel zzso zzso acid (1 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso or 100 zzso in the zzso chamber, 2) the zzso channel blocker zzso (5 zzso or 3) the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Other zzso zzso an increase in zzso with a rank order potency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso A zzso zzso a rat zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a liver zzso library, and functional expression of the corresponding zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in the appearance of zzso currents with a similar pharmacological zzso Northern analysis identified zzso zzso transcripts in zzso as well as other cell types in rat zzso These findings indicate that exposure of polarized zzso to zzso results in zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso receptors in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso may serve as an zzso or zzso signal regulating zzso zzso zzso
