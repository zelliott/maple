zzso how proteins and their complex interaction networks convert the zzso information into a dynamic living zzso is a fundamental challenge in biological zzso As an important step towards understanding the systems biology of a complex zzso we zzso zzso of the predicted zzso zzso zzso by detecting zzso proteins from zzso redundant and zzso distinct zzso zzso This unprecedented high zzso coverage for a complex zzso was achieved by combining sample diversity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso feedback zzso zzso data collection is guided by statistical analysis of prior zzso We show that high-quality zzso data provide crucial information to amend zzso zzso and to confirm many predicted gene zzso We also present zzso identified zzso peptides matching approximately 50% of zzso zzso gene zzso This library of zzso peptides should enable fast, targeted and quantitative zzso studies to zzso the systems biology of this model zzso
