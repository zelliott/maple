The Japanese morning glory carrying the zzso zzso speckled zzso with the dominant zzso bears zzso flowers with fine and round colored spots distributed over the zzso whereas the plant without the zzso produces pale yellow zzso Previous chemical analysis has indicated that a zzso in the gene for zzso zzso zzso is a likely candidate for the speckled zzso However, the zzso zzso without sequence zzso accumulates normally in the pale yellow flowers, indicating that the speckled zzso is neither the zzso gene nor a regulatory gene acting on the zzso gene zzso
