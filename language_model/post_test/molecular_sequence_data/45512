An zzso zzso zzso was zzso to apparent zzso from liquid state cultures of the zzso fungus zzso zzso by zzso and a combination of gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso The molecular masses of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso as determined by zzso and mass zzso zzso It was more active at 60 degrees C and pH zzso and showed high stability at 50 degrees C with zzso of 7 zzso However at 60 and 70 degrees C, zzso was much less stable with half lives of approximately 20 and 3 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was also investigated by zzso and circular zzso zzso Fluorescence revealed that the unfolding transition region was observed between 45 and 70 degrees zzso A major decrease in the stability was found at 70 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH between zzso and zzso showed a transition temperature zzso range of zzso degrees zzso The zzso analysis of these results showed that zzso is zzso stable protein exhibiting maximum stability zzso of zzso and zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso zzso The apparent zzso value on zzso from citrus fruits was zzso zzso zzso exhibited no zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, it showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso was detected in the pure zzso It was activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso showed zzso with a zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso
