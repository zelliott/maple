zzso mice develop a systemic zzso disease similar to systemic lupus zzso in zzso The mice show progressive zzso due to the zzso of an unusual population of zzso zzso alpha zzso T zzso We bred zzso mice with mice lacking zzso or zzso T cells by gene targeting via zzso zzso in zzso stem cells to determine the roles of these cells in the zzso zzso No difference in survival or zzso levels was noted between zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso mice have a reduced level of zzso zzso T cells despite the fact that the degree of zzso was zzso zzso zzso mice had a diminished zzso disease with a reduction in zzso production and skin zzso and increased survival compared to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso mice had an enhanced zzso that developed zzso by zzso weeks of age (5 to 8 greater than zzso control zzso due to the zzso of zzso zzso T zzso In addition, there were no differences in peripheral zzso zzso enlargement, although the proportion of zzso zzso T cells was about twofold higher in the zzso zzso zzso These cells were zzso identical to the zzso population in control zzso mice, indicating that the accumulating zzso T cells can be zzso from the zzso disease in these zzso zzso our results reveal that the zzso disease is dependent on zzso but not zzso T cells, and that many of the zzso zzso T cells traverse a zzso zzso zzso
