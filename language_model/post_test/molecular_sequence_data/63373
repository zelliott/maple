The human zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso are G zzso receptors that play key roles in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show using a quantitative assessment of zzso production as a function of cell surface zzso expression that the zzso possesses greater zzso zzso activity than the zzso Further studies were undertaken to test the hypothesis that different potential zzso motifs identified in zzso of the zzso and zzso contribute to their different zzso zzso zzso Although mutating the receptors to interchange their potential zzso motifs reversed their relative activities, we show this to be due to the swapping of one zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso dynamics simulations show that the effect of the zzso zzso switching the structural features of the zzso toward those of the zzso is greater than the switching effect of the zzso zzso toward the zzso The structural model of the zzso zzso can be considered as a hybrid of zzso zzso zzso and zzso active zzso zzso zzso In this zzso zzso zzso adopts a structure similar to zzso of the zzso zzso but it shares with the zzso zzso active zzso the zzso exposure and the zzso arrangement of zzso 3, 5, and 6, including the weakening of the zzso native zzso zzso Our results suggest a zzso structural connection between zzso and the zzso extension of zzso Thus, zzso contributes significantly to the inactive and active state ensembles of these G zzso zzso
