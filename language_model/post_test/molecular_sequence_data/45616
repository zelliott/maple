A third zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were similar to those of the zzso system zzso components zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains important zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso showed high similarity to various zzso and to a member of zzso zzso family zzso zzso and structural analysis also revealed that these four genes were organized in a putative zzso that differed from two zzso previously isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso regulator for this zzso was not found, and the zzso complexes for zzso were zzso separately by three genes zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso had a molecular weight estimated to be zzso Da by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso activity at pH zzso and 40 degrees C, and displayed enhanced activity in the presence of zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be essential for zzso zzso
