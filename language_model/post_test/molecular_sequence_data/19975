Laboratory detection of zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso is an important zzso in the zzso zzso The study was designed zzso to establish a new zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technology with melting curve analysis zzso A total of 224 zzso zzso were used to verify the zzso zzso The zzso with zzso method using the zzso zzso zzso B gene zzso was rapid and zzso the total run is approximately 3 zzso and the sensitivity and specificity relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso results were zzso and zzso zzso zzso identification system was not able to identify the zzso from the new zzso zzso zzso opposite to the real-time zzso This zzso was validated to be accurate with an overall sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso this rapid and accurate zzso zzso with zzso will help to manage and control infections with zzso zzso
