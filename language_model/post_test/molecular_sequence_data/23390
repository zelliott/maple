The work from our laboratory on complex zzso Chinese zzso cell zzso is zzso Several zzso groups with a complete zzso have been zzso Three of these are due to zzso zzso and the zzso genes for two have been zzso We describe zzso zzso in the genes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso They represent small integral membrane proteins localized in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Carroll, zzso zzso zzso Shannon, zzso zzso The nuclear zzso zzso of complex I from bovine heart zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both are absolutely essential for assembly and activity of complex zzso zzso versions of these proteins can be expressed from a zzso zzso to complement the zzso or to be zzso with the zzso proteins in other zzso cell lines zzso or wild zzso or human zzso zzso analyses can be performed with proteins altered by zzso zzso A cell line has been constructed in which the zzso zzso is zzso zzso opening a window on the zzso of assembly of complex zzso Its zzso import into zzso and orientation in the inner membrane have also been zzso The two proteins have recently been shown to be the targets for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso of complex I from bovine heart zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins can be zzso with other complex I zzso
