In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family includes more than 300 zzso zzso Its single functional gene encodes zzso an zzso of zzso Because of its manageable size, this family is a good model for the study of zzso cohesion and zzso By sequence comparison of several zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have obtained evidence that zzso the zzso family still generates new zzso we note in each species the beginning of a process of zzso evolution since the zzso of one zzso on average cluster more with one another than they do with those of the other zzso and zzso the zzso family contains diversified zzso These findings suggest a certain level of zzso and zzso of the zzso independent of the functional gene which may result from various zzso The homogenization we observe may be due to the zzso themselves zzso evolution in a strict zzso which explains the occurrence of long-term homogenization of old sequences and zzso zzso
