zzso zzso proteins have important functions during embryonic patterning as zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and presumably as zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is localized in zzso raft zzso platforms for the localized concentration and zzso of signaling zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and a highly related zzso which we have termed zzso are recruited into these zzso through association with the zzso zzso target site of zzso zzso of zzso with soluble zzso zzso zzso causes the formation of large raft patches that also contain zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso activity is recruited into zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso proteins provide a scaffold for the assembly of a zzso signaling complex downstream of zzso zzso
