The distribution of zzso Y zzso zzso was studied in human frontal cerebral zzso from surgical biopsy specimens by zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in all cortical zzso except zzso zzso The stained zzso were of the zzso zzso round or triangular form with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were considered to be cortical zzso due to their zzso form, and since their processes could be followed zzso particularly in direction to superficial cortical zzso The zzso precursor zzso is processed to zzso by a zzso zzso and zzso is further zzso zzso before release and zzso zzso can be zzso zzso raised against zzso recognize zzso zzso not zzso with zzso zzso These zzso and zzso revealed the presence of a population of zzso cells zzso indistinguishable from the zzso cells in the human frontal zzso By comparing the number of zzso cells in adjacent zzso it appears that the number of zzso cells was higher than those zzso to zzso Also, the density of zzso fibers was much higher compared with the number stained with zzso zzso The present zzso study indicates that zzso in its zzso form is contained in a zzso of human cortical zzso zzso and may participate as an active zzso within the human cerebral zzso
