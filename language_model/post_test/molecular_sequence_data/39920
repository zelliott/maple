The zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso both members of the Order zzso have been cloned and their zzso organization, as well as the functional characteristics of their zzso products, zzso In both bacterial species, the zzso gene was found to be zzso together with another four zzso zzso or three zzso zzso upstream zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was able to bind promoters of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene but not to that of the zzso zzso zzso protein and crude cell extracts from zzso zzso were unable to bind promoters governing the expression of either its zzso or zzso zzso In agreement with these zzso no functional copy of the zzso zzso zzso box, corresponding to the zzso zzso seems to be present in the zzso zzso zzso Giving support to the proposal that the evolutionary branching order of the Order zzso is very close to that of zzso bacteria, the zzso zzso zzso protein was still able to recognize the previously described zzso sequence for zzso zzso
