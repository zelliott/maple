zzso of zzso zzso with DNA in B and non-B zzso was investigated using plasmids containing zzso in which the non-B zzso zzso could readily be prepared by zzso I zzso relaxation in the presence of zzso DNA sequences in the zzso zzso and H zzso were shown to be zzso by zzso at the zzso position of zzso or the zzso position of zzso in a manner that was indistinguishable from the reaction of zzso with the same sequences in the B zzso Electronic factors rather than zzso factors, therefore, appear to dominate zzso of DNA by zzso
