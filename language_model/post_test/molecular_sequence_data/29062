Southeast Asian zzso zzso human red cell zzso contain similar proportions of normal band 3 and a zzso band 3 with a nine zzso acid deletion zzso 3 zzso We employed specific chemical modification and zzso zzso to probe the structures of band 3 in normal and zzso zzso When the zzso were modified specifically at zzso zzso with zzso band 3 zzso was not modified in normal zzso but zzso modified in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed different patterns of band 3 zzso zzso zzso many sites zzso in normal zzso were not zzso in zzso zzso despite the presence of normal band 3 in these zzso The zzso band 3 changes the structure of essentially all the normal band 3 present in the zzso zzso and these changes extend throughout the normal band 3 zzso The results also imply that band 3 in zzso zzso is present as zzso or higher zzso The dominant structural effects of band 3 zzso on the other band 3 zzso have important consequences on the functional and zzso properties of human red cells zzso for band 3 zzso Analysis of the altered profile of zzso and zzso zzso sites suggests the location of exposed surfaces in the band 3 membrane domain and identifies likely interacting regions within the zzso Our approach provides a sensitive method for studying structural changes in zzso membrane zzso
