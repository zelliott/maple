zzso is the zzso protein in human zzso It is zzso by the zzso zzso of the seminal zzso as a 461 zzso acid precursor zzso Following zzso of a predominantly zzso signal zzso the zzso protein contains zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso has a repetitive structure, but it displays no significant zzso to any other characterized translation zzso In the seminal zzso zzso zzso occurs in zzso high molecular mass complexes together with two less abundant 71 and 76 zzso zzso These proteins have a very close zzso and structural relationship to zzso but contrary to zzso one or both of these zzso proteins are also expressed by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso proteins are the major proteins involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso common to these proteins are zzso to the zzso parts of the zzso The zzso become progressively zzso when zzso proteins are fragmented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the gel zzso
