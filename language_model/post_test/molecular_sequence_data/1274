Natural zzso of zzso zzso exhibit a robust zzso behavior known as zzso A form of zzso swarming is characterized by a zzso coordinated progression of a bacterial population across a zzso As a collective bacterial process, swarming is often associated with zzso formation and has been linked to zzso factor expression in zzso zzso While the swarming zzso has been well documented for zzso species, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible remains largely isolated to zzso zzso To better understand how swarming is controlled in members of the zzso zzso we investigated the effect of a series of gene deletions on swarm zzso Our analysis revealed that a strain deficient for the production of zzso and zzso zzso activity did not swarm or form zzso While it is known that zzso a zzso zzso functions in swarming zzso by reducing surface tension, this is the first report demonstrating that general zzso zzso activity also has an important zzso These results not only help to define the factors involved in zzso swarm migration but support the idea that swarming and zzso formation may have overlapping control zzso
