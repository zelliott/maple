The zzso sequence of human zzso virus type 1 zzso was determined for 11 Thai zzso between 1995 and zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso all subjects were infected with zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso protein diversity among zzso Thai reference sequences from 1990 to 1992 zzso the diversity among the zzso zzso was approximately double zzso The zzso tip of the zzso loop was zzso for 10 of the 11 zzso and identical to that observed in sequences derived from the zzso zzso However, in the zzso region, sequences from 2 of the 11 subjects demonstrated more than 5 zzso acid changes relative to the reference zzso This may represent the zzso of the zzso epidemic seen in other endemic zzso These findings may have substantial implications for vaccine development and evaluation for both zzso zzso and zzso T zzso repertoire zzso
