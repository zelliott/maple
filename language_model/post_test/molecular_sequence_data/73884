To zzso whether gene zzso of zzso I zzso I) exist in zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso analysis was performed in zzso zzso tissue zzso Gene zzso of zzso I were sought in three regions, near zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso where point zzso have been found in resistant tumor cell lines selected by chronic zzso zzso In addition, nuclear zzso I contents were determined by zzso No mobility shifts were observed compared to the pattern observed in a normal control at any of the three regions in any sample, whereas zzso I levels showed an approximately zzso zzso The variation is remarkably large compared to those seen in previous in zzso and in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso of zzso I may not contribute to intrinsic resistance of zzso to zzso but low zzso I levels may account, at least in part, for the zzso
