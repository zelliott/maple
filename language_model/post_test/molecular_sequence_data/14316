This is the first description of a functional zzso gene within the zzso Here we report of the zzso expression of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso zzso The resulting protein zzso zzso and was hence classified as zzso zzso zzso The protein characterization revealed a specific activity of 75 zzso using zzso zzso as zzso The optimal activity of the zzso was measured at pH zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso is zzso According to zzso acid sequence similarities zzso are attributed to the two zzso zzso families 18 and zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso gene differed from sequences of these two zzso zzso zzso However, within a zzso tree of protein zzso the zzso sequence of zzso zzso clustered in close proximity to members of the zzso zzso family zzso
