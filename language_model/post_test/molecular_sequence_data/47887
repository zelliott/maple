The zzso zzso homocysteine zzso gene was cloned by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The coding sequence of the zzso zzso gene shows a high similarity to the zzso zzso zzso Very little similarity is found in the zzso and 3' untranslated zzso However, one finds short DNA stretches in the promoter of the zzso zzso gene which are identical to the zzso sequences implicated in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso This could explain strong zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso host, and indicates a substantial conservation of the zzso regulatory system between both zzso zzso
