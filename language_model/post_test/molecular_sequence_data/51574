Several observations in the characterization of zzso are zzso First, sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which induce strong in zzso T cell zzso responses are zzso from sequences which induce zzso Strong in zzso responses were detected only to zzso zzso zzso Second, T cells specific for zzso of zzso are unresponsive in zzso Third, zzso V beta 8 gene usage is associated with zzso T zzso V beta zzso bearing zzso from a zzso line exhibited enhanced zzso to zzso zzso but were unresponsive unless presented zzso on zzso zzso zzso We propose that these findings reflect self, zzso discrimination of the zzso on zzso zzso and examine the hypothesis that zzso containing V beta 8 have enhanced zzso for zzso zzso with zzso zzso but that these V beta 8 zzso T cells appear unresponsive in zzso due to mechanisms of zzso involving zzso zzso
