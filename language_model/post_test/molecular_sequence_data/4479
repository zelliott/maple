Three distinct strains zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso bacteria able to use carbon zzso or zzso zzso as sole energy zzso were identified as novel strains of zzso zzso Evidence for their identity as zzso of zzso zzso and as close relatives of zzso zzso is based on their DNA zzso total sequencing of the genes for their zzso zzso zzso profiles, zzso acid composition of zzso zzso of zzso degradation by zzso possession of large plasmids zzso zzso and zzso zzso 450 zzso and zzso transfer between the strains and with zzso zzso and zzso zzso No functions have been identified for the zzso to zzso plasmids of strains zzso and zzso but curing strain zzso of its zzso did not affect growth on carbon zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the formal description of zzso zzso is zzso zzso growth on carbon zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso Evidence is presented for initiation of carbon zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso extracts zzso zzso zzso zzso of oxygen in the presence of carbon zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso The activity was not zzso at 50,000 zzso zzso zzso in zzso carbon zzso metabolism were shown by zzso and zzso to include zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso but zzso production of zzso and zzso from carbon zzso did not zzso zzso of zzso extracts showed zzso that were unique to growth on carbon zzso common to carbon zzso and zzso zzso or found after growth on carbon zzso zzso zzso or zzso The possible identity of these as proteins involved in sulfur compound metabolism is zzso
