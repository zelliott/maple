Previously, we showed that zzso of protein zzso zzso are zzso as one of three types of zzso structures zzso turns, tight turns, and zzso which, compared with zzso are evident by distinctive zzso zzso In this study, we report the analysis of more than zzso zzso zzso in zzso crystal structures from which we identified 70 wide turns (29 zzso and 41 zzso Based on differences in the zzso and zzso profiles, we show that wide turns can be zzso into three distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso that differ with regard to the number and position of backbone i zzso zzso zzso formed zzso to the zzso or signature zzso or zzso zzso Although wide turns generally produce changes in zzso direction of 20 degrees to 30 degrees and a lateral shift in the zzso zzso some of the zzso zzso are associated with changes of zzso degrees zzso We also show that the distinct architectural features of wide turns allow the zzso bond of the zzso zzso which is located on the widened loop of a wide turn, to be directed away from the zzso zzso This provides regions of flexibility within zzso regions zzso for example, unique opportunities for zzso zzso including interactions with zzso zzso zzso and for zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, differences in zzso zzso usage by related protein family members, such as the zzso receptors zzso and the zzso zzso can significantly affect the orientation and position of zzso critical for zzso binding and zzso zzso
