A simple statistical model describing the folding of zzso acids is zzso For long sequences the real zzso of the secondary structure is a zzso equilibrium state that cannot be zzso by minimal free zzso This is because the time required to achieve complete zzso equilibrium considerably exceeds the zzso of the zzso The formation of the secondary structure is represented as a random walk process in the space of all possible molecular zzso The zzso equilibrium structure is obtained by successive linking and disruptions of zzso segments with probabilities determined by the rate zzso of corresponding zzso zzso The probabilities of zzso consisting of all possible compatible zzso are zzso zzso of some zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
