Despite significant progress, the general functional and evolutionary significance of the untranslated regions zzso of zzso transcripts remain zzso Particularly mysterious is the common occurrence of zzso zzso in transcript zzso because zzso zzso is not necessary for restoration of transcript coding zzso In general, it is not known to what extent such zzso performs an important function or merely represents zzso zzso We conducted the first analysis of evolutionary conservation of zzso zzso Among 4 species from zzso zzso species complex, we find high levels of conservation of zzso zzso boundary zzso strongly suggesting that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso We estimate that zzso of zzso boundaries are maintained by zzso zzso site sequences are more highly zzso than zzso zzso and zzso boundaries are more zzso in zzso zzso than in 3' zzso In addition, we report a variety of differences between patterns of zzso zzso in zzso and corresponding patterns in animals and zzso These results focus attention on the functional roles of zzso zzso and deepen the mystery of zzso zzso zzso
