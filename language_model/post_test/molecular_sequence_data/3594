zzso are large zzso respiratory proteins found in many zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess a highly zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso that consists of at least seven distinct zzso types zzso a to zzso However, many zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso differ from the standard zzso scheme and have 2 zzso zzso zzso Here we report the complete primary structure of the 2 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as deduced from zzso sequencing, gel zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso Six distinct zzso types (1 through 6) and three additional zzso sequences were zzso Each 1 zzso zzso zzso most likely is composed of zzso zzso with zzso 1 linking the two zzso via a zzso bridge located in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso all belong to the zzso zzso whereas the other six types zzso have been lost in zzso The reconstruction of a complex zzso from a single zzso zzso which commenced about 190 million years ago and was completed about 90 million years ago, might be explained by zzso and behavioral changes that occurred during the evolution of the zzso zzso
