zzso zzso is a ubiquitous electron transport zzso The zzso viral zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso was predicted to zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso we confirm this protein has identical spectral properties to zzso human zzso zzso and additionally that the viral zzso can substitute for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 51 zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a single domain, zzso four zzso zzso four zzso zzso and a zzso zzso which is similar to that found in larger zzso zzso zzso As a product of a horizontal gene transfer event involving a zzso of the host zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to have zzso in function and is likely to have evolved an entirely new role for the virus during zzso Indeed, lacking a zzso zzso anchor, zzso encodes the first zzso zzso zzso zzso The lack of requirement for membrane attachment (in contrast to all other zzso zzso zzso may be a reflection of the small size of the host cell, further emphasizes the unique nature of this virus gene product and draws attention to the potential importance of zzso zzso zzso activity at the extremes of cellular zzso
