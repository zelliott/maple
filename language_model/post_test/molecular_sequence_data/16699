No zzso zzso has so far been identified and zzso 

zzso samples were collected from patients with a suggestive case history of adverse reactions to zzso and other zzso zzso from fresh and frozen strawberries were zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso Western zzso and mass zzso Patient blood samples were zzso for zzso of zzso binding and zzso zzso 

Several zzso proteins could be zzso In more than half of the patient zzso a zzso zzso band was observed in Western zzso These two bands were excised and zzso by mass zzso showing the presence of proteins belonging to the zzso v 1 family of zzso zzso of the zzso binding to the zzso zzso was obtained by addition of two zzso expressed zzso belonging to the zzso v 1 family zzso v 1 and Mal d 1) and zzso protein zzso In a zzso zzso of patient blood samples, zzso zzso could be induced by zzso protein extract and by zzso v 1 and Mal d zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso to zzso v 1 may be zzso of importance for adverse reactions to zzso
