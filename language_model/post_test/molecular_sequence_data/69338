zzso brain zzso channels are regulated by zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso Using synthetic peptides and protein zzso we have determined that the alpha zzso of rat brain zzso channel is selectively zzso by zzso in zzso and in intact cells on 4 zzso zzso in the zzso loop connecting zzso zzso I and zzso zzso was most rapidly and extensively zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to lesser zzso In contrast, zzso 687 was most extensively zzso in zzso cells zzso with the alpha zzso of type zzso zzso channel in response to an increase in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso these sites zzso zzso rapidly and extensively zzso zzso and also zzso zzso zzso and zzso to lesser zzso zzso 2A selectively zzso zzso Together these results indicate that zzso of zzso zzso channel activity and therefore zzso zzso by zzso zzso results from selective zzso and zzso of four sites in the zzso loop connecting zzso zzso I and II of the alpha zzso
