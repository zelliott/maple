zzso zzso expression libraries are made to reproduce protein sequences present in the zzso source zzso However, there is no control over which frame of the zzso is zzso because translation of the zzso must be initiated on zzso zzso In a library of zzso cloned zzso only some zzso of the protein sequences produced are expected to be zzso zzso cloning can increase this by a factor of two, but it does not solve the frame zzso We have therefore developed and tested a library construction methodology using a novel zzso zzso with which translation in the correct reading frame zzso zzso resistance on the zzso Following zzso selection, the zzso libraries contained zzso open, zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso libraries, showed a zzso increase in the number of matches between the zzso proteins made by the bacteria and database protein zzso zzso sequencing programs will benefit from the enrichment for correct coding zzso and screening methods requiring protein expression will benefit from the enrichment for authentic translation zzso
