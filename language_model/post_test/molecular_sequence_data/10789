Using the zzso zzso zzso as a probe, we have cloned the putative zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso We have isolated two zzso with different zzso zzso that contain a complete open reading zzso These two zzso zzso two proteins with distinct zzso regions corresponding to two zzso The zzso zzso is obviously related to the zzso zzso of other insects, but shares only zzso and zzso zzso acid identities with the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Its expression pattern has been examined in the zzso during the last zzso zzso and zzso stage of zzso zzso in correlation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed two transcripts of 7 zzso and zzso zzso detected in most stages during metamorphosis and corresponding to the A and B1 zzso These two zzso are highly evident just before the rise of each zzso peak both in zzso and in zzso They show almost the same expression pattern in zzso except for the second part of the zzso stage, during which only the A zzso is zzso
