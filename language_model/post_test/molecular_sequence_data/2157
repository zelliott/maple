The zzso promoter and structural gene from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso protein sequence deduced from the coding sequence of the cloned gene was identical to that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicating that the export of this protein is not directed by a zzso processed zzso signal zzso A sequence that was zzso to that of a consensus zzso 28 zzso zzso recognition site lay upstream of the proposed zzso start zzso zzso of this promoter region on a zzso zzso resulted in the formation of long, zzso cells that accumulated zzso zzso The zzso locus containing the zzso zzso zzso was replaced with a defective zzso of the gene zzso zzso that contained a zzso zzso Transport analysis of various zzso gene zzso expressed in the zzso deletion strain suggest that the extreme zzso portion of zzso is functionally involved in export of the zzso
