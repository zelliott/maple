zzso zzso zzso protein is a bacterial zzso protein that is essential for the correct folding and zzso bond formation of zzso or cell zzso zzso zzso introduces zzso bonds into folding zzso and is zzso through interaction with its zzso partner zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso expresses a zzso protein ( zzso an zzso protein that has its zzso anchored in the cell zzso Since zzso is an essential zzso crucial for zzso bond formation, research of zzso may provide a target of a new class of zzso drugs for treatment of zzso zzso In the present work, the crystal structures of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso were determined in both its reduced and oxidized zzso The overall structure of zzso zzso can be divided into two zzso a classical zzso domain with a typical zzso active site, and an zzso zzso It largely resembles its zzso coli zzso zzso however, it possesses a truncated binding zzso in addition, its active site is surrounded by an zzso rather than zzso zzso In our zzso activity zzso zzso zzso exhibited a different zzso specificity when compared to zzso Moreover, structural analysis revealed a second zzso bond in zzso zzso which is rare in the previously reported zzso structures, and is assumed to contribute to the overall stability of zzso zzso To investigate the zzso formation zzso in zzso we modeled zzso Vitamin K zzso zzso zzso zzso a binding partner of zzso zzso to zzso zzso
