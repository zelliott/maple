The zzso tail fiber of zzso T4 is made of three gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Chaperone zzso is normally required for folding zzso peptides into a zzso zzso however, a zzso zzso in T4 zzso that suppresses this requirement at 30 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C was found in gene 37 zzso zzso Bishop and zzso zzso Wood, zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso of zzso gene 37 inserted into its zzso portion zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We noticed that the zzso segment encompassing this zzso in the zzso zzso has a sequence typical of a coiled zzso and hypothesized that its extension would relieve the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso To test our hypothesis, we crossed the T4 zzso zzso with a zzso zzso an engineered zzso coiled zzso Each of the six zzso that we examined retained two amber zzso in gene 38 and had a different zzso sequence varying from three to five zzso While the sequences zzso all maintained the zzso zzso motif and produced plaques at up to 50 degrees zzso This finding strongly suggests that the zzso motif is a critical factor in the folding of zzso The presence of a terminal zzso sequence in the tail fiber genes of 17 additional zzso zzso implies the conservation of this zzso The increased melting temperature should be useful for zzso to initiate the folding of zzso zzso in zzso and as an in zzso screen to zzso zzso and characterize zzso coiled zzso
