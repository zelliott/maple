zzso provides a convenient tool for amplification of zzso sequences from zzso DNA containing zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso products can be labeled zzso and zzso in zzso and the zzso origin of the clones can be zzso This avoids time-consuming gel zzso of the zzso artificial zzso and the zzso procedure of labeling whole zzso DNA containing the zzso The application of zzso to zzso colonies permits the mapping of zzso at a very early stage of their zzso In zzso zzso can detect clones with zzso fragments of DNA, and these can be discarded without further time-consuming zzso To increase further the potential of the method, we show the application of zzso zzso zzso
