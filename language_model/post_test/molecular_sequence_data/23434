The results reported here have identified zzso as the essential gene involved in irreversible binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso First, a deletion in an zzso zzso strain, covering most of the zzso zzso could be zzso by a zzso copy of zzso inserted at zzso Second, disruption of zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso resulted in a zzso resistance zzso regardless of the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely distributed in zzso zzso The protein zzso which also serves as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso belongs to the same zzso zzso encodes a membrane protein of approximately 120 zzso detected in zzso together with smaller forms that may be processed products arising from zzso of its long zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the surrounding genes indicated that zzso is part of an zzso which includes at least the upstream genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of each of the genes in the zzso allowed efficient irreversible zzso provided that zzso expression was zzso Under these conditions, however, smaller plaques were produced, a zzso which was particularly noticeable in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, such reduction in plaque size was not correlated with a decreased zzso zzso Overall, these results provide the first demonstration of a zzso protein acting as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso and suggest an additional involvement of the zzso zzso in a step subsequent to irreversible zzso
