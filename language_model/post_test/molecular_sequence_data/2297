Two zzso sequences of the zzso regions of zzso B surface zzso were zzso chemically and used in zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in serum from patients with acute and chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated well with the presence of zzso and was no longer zzso on zzso of viral zzso after natural recovery and after successful treatment with zzso zzso proteins were also lost after treatment with zzso The results show that the zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in serum provides additional useful markers for assessing patients with acute and chronic zzso B infection and for monitoring the response to treatment with zzso
