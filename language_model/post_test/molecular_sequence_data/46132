The zzso signaling zzso is an attractive therapeutic target for cancer and chronic inflammatory zzso In this study, we report the first strategy to achieve zzso zzso with a zzso inhibitor loaded into zzso zzso with the use of a simple zzso mixing approach that zzso an zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso strategy for cargo zzso A stable zzso complex is formed zzso constant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso signaling and downstream gene expression zzso is demonstrated in zzso zzso This zzso cargo loading strategy enables the use of a generic synthetic or zzso zzso zzso for drug zzso that permits flexible zzso of types and doses of peptides and/or other materials as diagnostic or therapeutic agents for zzso incorporation and cellular zzso
