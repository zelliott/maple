zzso is critically important for cellular zzso It plays essential roles in zzso zzso including zzso The liver is central to zzso copper zzso zzso zzso is the major route of zzso for zzso copper and serves to regulate the total amount of copper in the zzso An extensive network of proteins manipulates copper disposition in zzso but comparatively little is known about this protein zzso zzso exists in two zzso zzso most zzso copper is zzso and most, if not all, zzso copper is zzso Typical zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind copper as zzso zzso the recent discovery that the ubiquitous protein zzso binds zzso exclusively raises the question as to what role zzso may play in zzso zzso This issue is particularly important in the liver and zzso In humans, zzso disease, due to zzso in zzso exhibits progressive liver damage from copper zzso in some zzso zzso zzso in zzso are associated with chronic zzso liver disease, clinically distinct from zzso zzso It seems unlikely that zzso which generates zzso oxygen species through the Fenton reaction, has a zzso role zzso however, zzso might be the preferred state of copper for elimination from the cell, such as by zzso zzso We argue that zzso zzso in the normal disposition of copper within the zzso and we speculate about that zzso zzso may contribute to the mechanism of zzso zzso of copper by virtue of binding zzso Additionally, or zzso zzso may be an important component of an zzso system for utilizing zzso or for detecting and detoxifying zzso
