zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso huge amounts of the zzso zzso and is a plant pathogen affecting zzso among them the model plant zzso zzso zzso is produced as a zzso agent at industrial scale by zzso of zzso In an approach based on zzso gel zzso protein samples from different growth zzso were characterized to zzso analysis of the zzso zzso The zzso gels were stained with zzso Diamond zzso stain to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins were excised from the gel and analyzed by mass zzso Three proteins were confirmed to be zzso the zzso zzso that is important for zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso that is involved in zzso and an zzso factor zzso zzso that was so far zzso in zzso The growth phase in which the samples were collected had an influence on protein zzso in zzso particular distinct in case of zzso which was zzso during the transition from the late exponential growth phase to the stationary zzso
