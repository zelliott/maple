zzso outbreaks annually occur in many parts of zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso and zzso diversity of zzso zzso zzso from recent outbreak zzso in Iran and to characterize the zzso zzso sequence of zzso The zzso sequence of all zzso was analyzed and compared with the reference zzso sequences for El zzso and classical zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso was determined and genetic zzso among zzso and also with those previously reported from Iran was zzso Ten out of zzso zzso were identified as El zzso zzso and one single isolate belonged to classical zzso All zzso except three possessed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All the zzso zzso in this study zzso and El zzso zzso possessed the zzso sequence of classical zzso zzso providing zzso of El zzso zzso Eight out of 11 zzso zzso showed identical zzso zzso Each of the remaining three zzso showed distinct zzso zzso with more than three band zzso zzso zzso was corresponded to an isolate zzso with classical zzso The result demonstrated diversity in zzso gene content of strains with identical zzso patterns and also provided zzso of the import of a zzso zzso strain with classical zzso from out of our country as no classical zzso strain has been previously zzso reported from zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso with Classical zzso after at least one decade in Iran is alarming due to fear of expansion of zzso zzso strains with high zzso potential and zzso the need to monitor and analyze all new cases in countries with zzso outbreaks or even sporadic cases as this could conceivably affect the zzso countries and may expose the world to the seventh pandemic with Classical zzso zzso
