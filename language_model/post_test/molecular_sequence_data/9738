The deduced zzso acid sequence of the open reading frame 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso terminal repeat zzso of zzso zzso exhibits a significant zzso with the consensus sequence of the class II family of the zzso zzso (AP) zzso The analysis of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso named zzso obtained from the expression of the zzso zzso in an zzso coli zzso zzso expression system revealed that the sequence codes for a protein with zzso activity specific for zzso (AP) zzso Data are also presented showing that in zzso expression of the zzso protein zzso viability by zzso to zzso coli zzso III deletion zzso zzso zzso We propose that the biological function of the zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein may be connected with the introduction into the DNA of free 3' ends that could be used as zzso for the integration, along the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso element and that the zzso could be a general mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso terminal repeat zzso
