The locus zzso region zzso contained within 30 zzso of zzso zzso the human zzso gene zzso has recently been shown to be essential for high level zzso gene zzso To determine the effect of fragments containing zzso sequences on zzso gene zzso zzso from a marked zzso gene linked to zzso fragments was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hypersensitive site II zzso zzso located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso was required for high level zzso gene zzso We also showed that a 46 zzso zzso element within HS II was necessary and sufficient for the increased zzso gene expression observed with zzso induced zzso maturation of zzso zzso These results zzso a distant regulatory element important for zzso of zzso genes during human zzso cell zzso
