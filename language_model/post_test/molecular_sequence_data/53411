Plants zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a unique reaction and, like other organisms, use zzso as a zzso donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine zzso These reactions comprise the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso specifying zzso that mediate the zzso zzso Met reaction zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso and zzso by zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso and by detecting zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that these zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by single copy zzso The deduced zzso are similar in size zzso zzso share a zzso zzso lack obvious targeting zzso and are zzso identical to each zzso The zzso zzso exist as zzso zzso and zzso both zzso zzso or zzso as a zzso donor in zzso and have higher affinities for zzso Both zzso also use either zzso donor in zzso because both restore the ability to zzso zzso or zzso to a zzso zzso zzso However, zzso is strongly inhibited by Met, whereas zzso is not, a difference that could be crucial to the control of flux through the zzso reaction and the zzso zzso Plant zzso is known to transfer the zzso zzso group of zzso This enabled us to use zzso zzso to establish that the other zzso of the zzso cycle, zzso zzso introduces the zzso zzso zzso These opposing zzso suggest a way to measure in zzso flux through the zzso zzso
