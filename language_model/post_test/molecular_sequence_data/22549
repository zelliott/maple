A DNA technique has been established for the identification to species level of zzso The test on the shell of the animal was used to identify samples from the species zzso zzso A total of 100 tortoise shell specimens collected from the National Council of Agriculture zzso Taiwan, were used in this zzso zzso pairs were designed to amplify partial DNA fragments of zzso b within the zzso zzso The DNA data showed that among the 100 samples, there were four distinct zzso DNA zzso within which there were a total of 90 variable zzso Between zzso I and II, there was only 1 zzso difference at position zzso Between zzso I and III, 65 zzso differences were zzso zzso I and IV, 62 zzso zzso and zzso III and IV, 56 zzso differences were zzso There were 66 and 63 zzso differences between zzso II and III and zzso II and IV zzso All four zzso were compared with the DNA sequences held at the zzso and zzso zzso The most similar species were zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and their respective zzso similarities were zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, as zzso III was only zzso zzso with zzso zzso it would seem that this zzso shows only a limited relationship with a similar species registered currently in these zzso The method established by this study is an additional method for the identification of samples protected under Convention International Trade in Endangered Species zzso and will improve the work for the preservation of the endangered zzso
