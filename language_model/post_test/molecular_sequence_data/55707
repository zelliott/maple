zzso binding of zzso is initiated via its zzso zzso zzso To identify a candidate zzso zzso protein or zzso in the zzso a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso membrane binding domain was zzso to zzso zzso and found to specifically label a zzso zzso This protein was zzso by appending an affinity tag to the zzso probe so that the zzso complex could be isolated via affinity zzso zzso indicated that the zzso protein was the zzso zzso carrier zzso This result was further confirmed by the ability of an zzso to the zzso to zzso the zzso complex, by the ability of certain zzso of the zzso to block zzso and by membrane zzso to show that complex formation occurred essentially exclusively in the zzso zzso While the zzso bound the zzso zzso in a specific manner both in zzso and in zzso its zzso to the inner membrane of the zzso zzso its being a zzso binding zzso An analysis of zzso binding in zzso was consistent with this zzso Thus, use of a zzso zzso revealed an unexpected and previously unidentified binding capacity of the zzso most likely related to the ability of zzso fatty zzso zzso As to serve as zzso zzso The zzso nature of the zzso zzso zzso suggests alternative strategies for uncovering zzso membrane binding zzso
