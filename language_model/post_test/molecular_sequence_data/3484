zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors assemble from two zzso zzso and zzso This zzso which involves a zzso zzso interaction, ensures efficient surface trafficking and zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we took a closer look at the implications of the zzso C zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso We generated a series of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and tested them for physical interaction, surface trafficking, zzso to zzso zzso and zzso inwardly zzso zzso channels in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells as well as on zzso calcium channels in sympathetic zzso of the superior cervical zzso zzso We found that the zzso interaction contributes only partly to the zzso assembly of the zzso indicating the presence of an additional interaction zzso The described zzso zzso retention signal within the C zzso of zzso functioned only in the context of specific zzso zzso which constitute part of the zzso zzso zzso This finding may provide a link between the retention signal and its shielding by the coiled zzso of zzso In zzso cells, we observed that the two well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso function as inverse zzso The C zzso of zzso and zzso strongly influenced zzso zzso zzso although they were not necessary for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso described here demonstrate that the active zzso zzso is stabilized by the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may determine its zzso activity, which could be a therapeutic target for inverse zzso
