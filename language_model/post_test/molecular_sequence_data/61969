zzso zzso was originally zzso with rod zzso zzso zzso and shown to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Other studies showed that zzso can interact with several small zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which are zzso as well as the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso regulator and zzso which are not zzso We show by zzso with a zzso zzso that zzso is present in rods and zzso We find by zzso zzso screening with a zzso bait that it can interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is essential for this zzso In zzso binding zzso indicate that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso fusion zzso Using zzso resonance energy transfer techniques exploiting the intrinsic zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as fluorescent zzso we show that zzso specifically binds zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our experiments establish that zzso functions as a zzso protein interacting with multiple zzso zzso
