A simple method is described for generating zzso deletions from any fixed point in a cloned zzso Starting with a zzso zzso template, T4 DNA zzso is used to extend an zzso zzso This leads to a fully zzso circular zzso with a zzso or small gap just zzso to the zzso zzso III zzso progressive zzso from the resulting 3' zzso zzso of timed zzso and zzso with a zzso specific zzso leads to a series of linear zzso fragments having a common end corresponding to the zzso end of the zzso These molecules are zzso and used to transform cells, providing large numbers of deletion clones with targeted zzso The zzso procedure involves successive additions to tubes, beginning with a zzso template and ending with zzso no zzso zzso or zzso are zzso zzso are comparable to those obtained with standard zzso zzso deletion zzso but there is no requirement for restriction zzso zzso or for highly zzso zzso DNA starting zzso This procedure provides a strategy for obtaining zzso deletions in either direction both for DNA sequencing and for functional zzso
