Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, zzso and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses form a tight zzso within the larger zzso zzso These viruses zzso a zzso expression strategy, resulting in zzso mature zzso zzso the conservation at synonymous sites along the zzso coding sequence reveals strong conservation zzso at the very zzso end of the coding zzso and also at the zzso end of the sequence zzso the zzso zzso Such zzso are generally indicative of functionally important zzso sequence zzso The second peak zzso to a predicted stable zzso structure whose biological importance is supported by zzso zzso that preserve the zzso The zzso is preceded by a zzso slippery zzso zzso zzso zzso thus forming a classical zzso motif for zzso zzso zzso We zzso therefore, that the functional importance of the zzso is to stimulate a portion of zzso to shift zzso zzso into a short zzso zzso zzso overlapping open reading frame, termed zzso Since zzso at the zzso boundary is known to require synthesis of zzso in zzso the resulting zzso fusion protein is predicted to be zzso We zzso that this may explain the origin of the previously identified zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso known as zzso
