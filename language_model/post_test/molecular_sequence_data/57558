Both zzso A and B associate with and thereby activate zzso protein zzso zzso We have investigated which component in the zzso complex determines its zzso zzso The A- and zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso in an indistinguishable manner, irrespective of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, only the zzso zzso complexes zzso the zzso zzso protein in zzso Likewise, binding studies revealed that zzso zzso complexes bound zzso to zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso complexes did not zzso associate with zzso under identical zzso zzso zzso to zzso required both zzso A and a zzso as neither zzso alone bound to zzso These results demonstrate that although the zzso zzso provides a necessary component for zzso it is the zzso zzso that plays the critical role in targeting the complex to zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso in zzso at most of its sites that are also zzso in human cells, suggesting that the zzso zzso complex is a major zzso for zzso in zzso
