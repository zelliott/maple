The major zzso protein zzso of zzso expressed zzso or in infected cells has the intrinsic ability to form zzso particles zzso which display zzso zzso necessary to elicit zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that the zzso gene of human zzso type zzso zzso can be expressed efficiently in zzso zzso zzso as zzso However, when we attempted to express the zzso gene cloned from the closely related zzso in zzso few zzso were observed in crude zzso The lower expression level of zzso zzso protein was found to result from a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Since sequence requirements for zzso termination in zzso are still zzso the zzso zzso gene was used as the basis for the complete synthetic reconstruction of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso hybrid zzso gene in zzso resulted in predominantly full-length zzso zzso and a zzso zzso increased level of production of zzso zzso compared to that expressed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were shown to display the zzso zzso important to elicit zzso zzso
