The promoter of the human zzso zzso has been the first cellular target shown to be subject to regulation by the zzso zzso zzso zzso also has binding sites in other promoters regulated by cell proliferation and during the cell zzso We have analyzed zzso zzso for the presence of an zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso carrying the zzso binding site of the zzso or the zzso zzso promoter showed zzso activity in zzso zzso A zzso factor, designated zzso binds specifically to the zzso consensus sequence and was partially zzso from zzso zzso zzso showed identical contact points within the zzso binding site as authentic zzso protein from zzso zzso The results suggest that the existence of an zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso
