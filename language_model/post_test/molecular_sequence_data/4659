Our experiments were designed to identify initial zzso and biological changes that occur during pancreatic zzso zzso an zzso zzso pancreatic zzso cell line, was treated in zzso for up to 11 weeks with the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso These treated cells were designated zzso + zzso The growth of zzso and zzso + zzso cell lines was investigated in soft zzso and in zzso zzso The resulting tumor from zzso + zzso was zzso in zzso and designated zzso + zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes, expression of transforming growth factor alpha zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso and several zzso markers were examined in all cell zzso zzso + zzso but not zzso cells grew in soft zzso and produced an invasive tumor in zzso However, there were no differences in cell growth rate, DNA flow zzso or zzso findings between the zzso and transformed zzso zzso zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso cells all expressed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in a comparable zzso DNA sequence analysis following zzso chain reaction showed that neither zzso nor zzso + zzso cells has a zzso of zzso or zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso + zzso cells had more zzso abnormalities compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was not essential for zzso in zzso pancreatic zzso cells in zzso In conclusion, zzso of the zzso cells caused expression of zzso to the same extent as in zzso zzso zzso and zzso patterns were the only differences detected between the zzso and zzso zzso
