It is known that zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso gene occurs in the zzso during T cell development and consequently results both in the deletion of DNA between the variable zzso and zzso segments and in the formation of a circular DNA with zzso signal zzso Here, we provide evidence that V alpha zzso zzso gene zzso take place in zzso sites, such as bone zzso liver, and zzso but not in zzso because we were able to detect frequent productive and zzso V alpha zzso coding and signal sequences as a result of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Similar findings were also detected in zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the relative amounts of V alpha 14 zzso signal sequences in zzso zzso are higher than those in zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso of V alpha zzso T cells, which are known to develop in the zzso were mainly detected in the zzso zzso patch, and zzso but not in other zzso zzso showing patterns distinct from V alpha 14 zzso zzso These findings are evidence of zzso development of V alpha zzso T zzso zzso characteristic zzso zzso patterns also indicate that distinct zzso zzso are generated in different zzso zzso
