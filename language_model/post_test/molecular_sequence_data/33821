Several zzso zzso zzso limited plant zzso bacteria, have been shown to contain zzso DNA zzso molecules zzso a replication associated protein zzso similar to that of zzso a major group of single stranded zzso DNA plant zzso On the basis of that observation and of structural similarities between the zzso proteins of zzso and the Satellite tobacco necrosis virus, it has been recently proposed that zzso evolved from zzso zzso by acquiring a zzso protein coding gene from a zzso plant zzso zzso 

Here we show that this hypothesis has to be rejected because zzso the zzso zzso zzso is not of zzso origin but has been acquired by zzso through horizontal transfer from a zzso or its zzso and zzso the evolution of zzso zzso protein in land plants implies missing zzso while the analysis of zzso data suggests an alternative scenario zzso a more ancient evolution in marine zzso 

The hypothesis of zzso evolving in plants from DNA molecules of zzso origin contrasts with other zzso An alternative scenario concerning the origin and spread of zzso coding zzso zzso is presented and its implications on the epidemiology of zzso are zzso
