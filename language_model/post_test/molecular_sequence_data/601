The zzso skeleton of the zzso zzso the zzso is composed of hundreds of zzso scales centered on zzso bodies, and presents a complex set of zzso zzso which belong to a zzso zzso The repeated zzso observed in the zzso zzso zzso present an interesting model of the organization and evolution of a zzso family within a single zzso 

To study this zzso family, we used zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso method defines 5 groups of zzso in the zzso zzso A refined analysis by zzso zzso Analysis zzso identifies structural characteristics of 51 zzso defining five separate groups, and three zzso Depending on the sequential arrangement of their structural zzso the zzso are defined as zzso zzso or zzso The zzso data aid in this zzso in the identification of putative regulating sequences such as zzso or zzso zzso When specific zzso experiments were conducted using sequences from either zzso or zzso classes, zzso were zzso Local effects show either disrupted or zzso zzso zzso In either case, this results in aborted cell zzso Using structural features, we show that 4 zzso are also present in another zzso zzso zzso Their affiliation with the distinctive structural groups of zzso zzso demonstrates an zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso family illustrates the history of zzso zzso in zzso This study provides a framework which can guide functional analysis of zzso the major components of the membrane skeleton in zzso We show that this set of proteins handles an important zzso information in zzso since maintenance of zzso organization is crucial for cell zzso
