zzso derivatives of zzso A zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso A have been used for years as zzso of cellular zzso The altered binding and biological activities of these derivatives relative to native zzso Con A have generally been attributed to their reduced zzso However, the present study shows that zzso and zzso A possess lower affinities than zzso Con A toward certain zzso zzso which are found on the surface of zzso It has previously been shown that native zzso Con A possesses zzso enhanced affinities toward zzso zzso zzso respectively, relative to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Brewer, zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (which binds with about zzso higher affinity than zzso zzso and is the major Con A binding zzso on zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso are shown to bind to zzso zzso Con A at pH zzso and zzso and zzso A at pH zzso with affinities equal to those of native zzso Con zzso However, a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were shown to bind to zzso zzso Con A and zzso and zzso A with affinities only about zzso higher than the zzso zzso in contrast to the higher affinities of native zzso Con A for these zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
