A human zzso line zzso expressing the zzso gene from the human zzso virus type 1 zzso isolate was used to examine the distribution of the zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic studies with zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso cells revealed that a small fraction of zzso is in the nucleus and it is localized in specific zzso tracks that extend between the nuclear envelope and the zzso An examination of the sequence of the zzso zzso gene revealed a putative nuclear targeting sequence that was previously found in several other zzso zzso zzso The nuclear zzso of zzso suggests a potential nuclear function for this zzso The presence of zzso in distinct nuclear tracks suggests that zzso is transported along a specific zzso that extends from the nuclear envelope into the zzso A previous study zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) Cell 70, zzso has shown that the zzso protein of rat liver cells zzso zzso from the zzso to the nuclear envelope on distinct zzso The present study has suggested that the transport of a zzso protein may also occur on distinct nuclear zzso
