Brown zzso tissue zzso zzso is a fundamental zzso response to zzso it involves an acute phase of zzso cell growth followed by a prolonged differentiation zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are key regulators of fatty acid metabolism and zzso differentiation and may therefore mediate important zzso changes during zzso zzso In the present study we have investigated zzso zzso expression in relation to zzso proliferation in rat BAT during cold zzso By zzso zzso we show that the number of zzso per zzso volume and zzso zzso zzso density remained constant zzso increasing in parallel with tissue mass and cell zzso during the initial zzso phase and the acute zzso response but increased after 14 days of cold exposure, zzso with terminal differentiation of zzso A pronounced decrease in BAT zzso and zzso zzso levels was found within hours of exposure to cold, which was reversed after 14 days, suggesting a role for either or both of these zzso in the proliferation and induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels increased progressively during cold zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells demonstrated an zzso stimulation of zzso zzso response element reporter activity via zzso establishing a role for these nuclear receptors in hormonal regulation of gene zzso in zzso
