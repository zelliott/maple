zzso spores of the various zzso species, including zzso zzso are 5 to 50 times more resistant to zzso radiation than are the corresponding growing zzso This elevated spore zzso resistance is due to: a) the zzso of DNA within spores, as zzso generates few if any zzso zzso but rather a zzso zzso 1) called spore zzso zzso zzso and b) DNA repair, in particular zzso repair, during spore zzso The novel zzso zzso of spore DNA is largely due to its zzso with a group of small, zzso proteins zzso which are unique to spores and whose binding alters the DNA zzso and thus its zzso zzso repair is also unique to spores and is carried out by a zzso zzso an zzso protein that zzso zzso to catalyze SP zzso without DNA backbone zzso
