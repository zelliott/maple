In animal zzso zzso and other zzso zzso are principally produced from zzso through the zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso The first reaction is the generation of zzso zzso by transferring an zzso group zzso at zzso position of zzso to the zzso group of zzso This reaction is zzso by zzso zzso The discovery of zzso zzso revealed the existence of zzso zzso which are capable of catalyzing this zzso The second reaction is the release of zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso D zzso The zzso belongs to the zzso family and specifically zzso zzso Recent studies, including analysis of zzso mice, led to the discovery of zzso pathways for the zzso zzso
