A low percentage of free zzso is a common feature of zzso zzso zzso although, in theory, all zzso zzso should be involved in zzso zzso A differential zzso method was developed to determine the percentage of free zzso at each zzso zzso of four zzso zzso zzso Free zzso was first zzso with zzso zzso zzso Free zzso resulting from the reduction of zzso bonds, was then zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso containing peptides that were modified by zzso zzso acid showed a molecular weight that was 2 Da higher than the same zzso that was modified by zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the same zzso zzso that were modified with both zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Analysis by mass zzso resulted in two partially overlapped zzso series for each zzso containing zzso corresponding to modification by zzso acid with zzso or zzso The percentage of free zzso was then calculated using the two zzso series at each zzso zzso A low percentage of free zzso was detected at every zzso zzso in the four zzso zzso Although different zzso contained different levels of free zzso similar distribution of free zzso in the domain structures was observed in the four zzso
