The zzso domain, zzso 146 to zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is required for zzso zzso and viral zzso This domain contains a stretch of 20 zzso called the major zzso region zzso which is zzso across zzso and is essential for viral zzso zzso and zzso The crystal structures of zzso and zzso reveal that the zzso domain is composed of four zzso and an extended zzso zzso zzso zzso through parallel packing of zzso 2 across a zzso The zzso is distinct from the zzso interface and instead forms an intricate zzso network that zzso strand 1 and zzso 1 and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain provides a model for the intact protein and extends models for assembly of the central zzso core of zzso
