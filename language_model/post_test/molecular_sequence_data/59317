A major mechanism maintaining immune tolerance is the deletion of potentially zzso zzso by zzso during development in the zzso Previous reports suggest that zzso is induced by high zzso signals zzso via the T cell zzso however, the role of signals zzso by other cell surface receptors during zzso selection remains poorly zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, has been shown to induce zzso in mature peripheral T zzso however, the effects of zzso on negative selection of zzso have not been previously zzso Using a sensitive terminal zzso zzso method to detect zzso cells, we found that zzso zzso molecules in zzso mice decrease the sensitivity of zzso to T cell zzso zzso and that blockade of zzso zzso interactions in zzso can inhibit zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Thus, we have shown that zzso in conjunction with zzso signals, can zzso zzso during negative selection of zzso
