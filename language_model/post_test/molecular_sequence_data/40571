The rapid adoption of zzso next generation sequence data in biological research is presenting a major challenge for sequence alignment zzso the efficient alignment of vast amounts of short reads to large references in the presence of differences arising from sequencing errors and biological sequence zzso To address this challenge, we developed a short read zzso for zzso zzso data that is tolerant of errors or zzso of all zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso a zzso approach in which zzso indexing is used to identify candidate regions for alignment with dynamic zzso A template is a pair of gapped seeds, with one used with the read and one used with the zzso In this article, we focus on the development of template families that yield zzso indexing up to a given zzso A general zzso for finding those families is zzso and a zzso construction that creates families with higher error tolerance from ones with a lower error tolerance is zzso
