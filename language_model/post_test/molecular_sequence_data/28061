In zzso aging at pH zzso 37 degrees C causes natural sequence zzso human growth hormone zzso zzso zzso and human zzso growth hormone to become zzso for bovine brain protein zzso zzso an zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso group present at zzso zzso zzso The zzso capacity of zzso increased at a rate of zzso zzso zzso molecules of zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso of zzso zzso of aged zzso revealed two altered peptides not present in zzso of control zzso These two fragments, which had the zzso acid compositions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained the majority of the induced zzso sites, 22 and zzso zzso zzso can result from zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso of zzso the only candidate site in zzso was zzso by zzso of the altered zzso with the synthetic zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Evidence is presented that the altered zzso zzso is a mixture of two peptides resulting from zzso of zzso to form zzso zzso and zzso zzso at this zzso The position of zzso in the altered zzso zzso was deduced from mass zzso which indicated a single zzso zzso from zzso zzso which indicated only one zzso zzso and from automated zzso degradation, which showed an absence of zzso and a low yield of zzso at position zzso These results show that zzso formation from both zzso and zzso is a zzso and possibly the major, source of spontaneous zzso zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso zzso provides a powerful tool for assessing this type of zzso
