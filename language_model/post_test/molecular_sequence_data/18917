It is well established that zzso proteins are key regulators of multiple stress signal zzso zzso However, the biological functions of soybean zzso zzso especially in plant drought response, are not yet zzso In this study, we characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in plant development and drought zzso zzso expression was greatly induced by drought stress, as evidenced by the quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in decreased drought tolerance during seed zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso the most zzso zzso gene of zzso led to enhanced drought tolerance at both the seed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic lines showed reduced water loss and zzso rates compared with zzso plants, which was demonstrated to be the consequence of the decreased zzso zzso At the same time, the smaller zzso due to zzso zzso led to a relatively slow net photosynthesis rate, which led to a growth penalty under drought zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso caused deficits in root hair formation and development, and thereby reduced the water intake capacity of the transgenic root zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso the transcript levels of zzso marker zzso Finally, we also investigated the zzso zzso of zzso by using a zzso activity zzso zzso the results presented here confirm that zzso plays a dual role in drought stress responses through its involvement in the regulation of zzso size and root hair zzso
