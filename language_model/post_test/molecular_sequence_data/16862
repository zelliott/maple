The cat family zzso was used as a species tree to assess the zzso performance of zzso and their embedded zzso zzso within the zzso region of the Y zzso zzso zzso segments from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were amplified in 36 species of zzso These genes are located within the zzso region of the zzso and are thought to be molecular zzso that ceased conventional zzso with the X zzso early within the zzso zzso zzso The pattern and tempo of evolution at these three genes is significant in light of the recent, rapid evolution of the family over approximately 12 zzso and provides exceptional support for each of the eight recognized zzso zzso as well as clear diagnostic zzso identifying nearly all zzso zzso support and zzso zzso probabilities are zzso high for defining each of the eight zzso zzso Further, the preferential use of specific zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso is zzso supported by sequence analyses of zzso embedded within the three zzso zzso zzso is thought to explain the contradiction between zzso zzso and results of the zzso zzso zzso that unites zzso related zzso Overall, our data suggest zzso genes within the zzso are singularly powerful markers and offer a valuable zzso perspective in species zzso
