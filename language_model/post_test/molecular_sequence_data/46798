zzso human milk zzso were zzso by zzso zzso on AG zzso and by an improved gel zzso procedure that allowed the separation of large zzso on zzso zzso 40 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the resulting zzso zzso by zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso revealed several neutral and zzso zzso zzso So far unknown zzso zzso containing up to 20 zzso were detected in a molecular mass range of zzso zzso Furthermore, neutral structures containing up to 35 zzso were identified after zzso on zzso zzso 40 zzso and subsequent zzso zzso demonstrating the suitability of the applied method for the preparation of zzso in this zzso zzso The composition of the detected zzso was found to be the same as those previously identified in zzso of lower zzso However, an enormous structural zzso was observed when zzso and neutral zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection zzso From our analysis we may conclude that each molecular mass identified by zzso zzso to a variety of zzso zzso The total number of zzso occurring in human milk may consequently be much higher than estimated zzso
