The zzso is a metabolically active organ that regulates the interaction between blood or zzso and the vessel or the surrounding zzso Blood zzso has been the object of many investigations whereas zzso zzso biology is yet poorly zzso This report deals with a zzso approach to the characterization and comparative analysis of zzso and blood vessel zzso cells zzso By zzso we zzso the protein profiles of zzso extracts from the zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso and zzso duct of zzso zzso The three obtained zzso were then analyzed by specific software, and 113 quantitative and 25 qualitative differences were detected between the three zzso zzso The cluster analysis of qualitative and quantitative differences evidenced the protein pattern of zzso zzso to be more similar to the zzso than to the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were interestingly found showing a protein expression profile more similar to the zzso zzso than to the zzso zzso We also identified 64 protein spots by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and three reference maps of bovine zzso were zzso The functional implications of the identified proteins in vascular zzso biology are zzso
