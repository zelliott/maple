The zzso zzso zzso modification of proteins is dynamic and abundant in the nucleus and zzso Several zzso factors, including zzso have been shown to contain this zzso however, the functional role of zzso in these proteins has not been zzso In this paper we describe the use of the previously characterized zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso as a model to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso relevant zzso interactions with the zzso factor zzso and zzso When the model zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells, this zzso domain of zzso was found to contain a dominant zzso zzso at high zzso which allowed the mapping and zzso of this zzso zzso In zzso interaction studies between this segment of zzso and zzso zzso or zzso indicate that the zzso modification functions to inhibit the largely zzso interactions between these zzso In zzso cells, the zzso at the mapped zzso site was zzso for zzso zzso We propose the hypothesis that the removal of zzso from an interaction domain can be a signal for protein zzso zzso may thereby prevent untimely and zzso zzso
