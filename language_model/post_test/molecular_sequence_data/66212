zzso zzso complexes are motifs that regulate biological functions in both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso coli, zzso an zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso regulates the zzso replication by recognizing through zzso interactions zzso the zzso primer that binds to the zzso DNA to initiate the zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein interacts with this transient zzso kissing zzso A surface zzso resonance zzso zzso was used to investigate this zzso acid zzso complex, at 5 degrees C, in experimental conditions such as the protein binds either to the zzso complex while it zzso or to a saturated stable zzso zzso The results show that zzso hairpin zzso from the zzso surface 110 times slower in the presence of zzso than in its zzso zzso binds to zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso resulting in a binding equilibrium constant equal to 31 zzso A zzso analysis of the interaction monitored by zzso confirms a zzso complex of zzso and zzso as observed for zzso zzso zzso
