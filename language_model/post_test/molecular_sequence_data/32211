The paired zzso zzso are the first integration centers for odor information in the insect zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso like in other zzso insects, they are formed during zzso To further understand mechanisms involved in the formation of this particularly well investigated brain area, we performed a direct zzso profiling of a well defined cell group (the lateral cell zzso of the zzso lobe throughout development by zzso mass zzso Although the majority of the about 100 obtained zzso signals represent still unknown zzso this first zzso characterization of this cell group indicated the occurrence of 12 structurally known zzso Among these peptides are zzso 1, zzso 2, 3, and 4, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I, II, and III, zzso zzso I, and zzso zzso peptides zzso III, zzso and zzso The identity of two of the zzso zzso 3 and 4) and zzso were confirmed by tandem mass zzso zzso During development of the zzso zzso number and frequency of zzso signals including those representing known peptides generally increased at the onset of zzso formation at zzso Stage zzso with zzso 2, zzso 1, and zzso V being the zzso zzso 2 showed transient occurrence mainly during the period of zzso formation, zzso 1 was restricted to late zzso and adults, while zzso V occurred exclusively in adult zzso zzso The power of the applied direct mass zzso profiling lies in the possibility of chemically identifying zzso of a given cell population in a fast and reliable manner, at any zzso stage in single zzso The identification of zzso in the zzso zzso now allows to specifically address the function of these signaling molecules during the formation of the zzso lobe zzso
