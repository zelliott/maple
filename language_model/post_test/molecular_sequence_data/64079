zzso zzso zzso express a zzso zzso which is a zzso of two zzso proteins that share zzso with zzso zzso a zzso and zzso protein of zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in mature zzso and zzso mouse zzso while the other, zzso is expressed in zzso cone cells of the invading zzso Although the functions of these three proteins remain unknown, their structural similarity to zzso zzso suggests that they may be involved in cell killing, the inflammatory response or tissue zzso zzso with these proposed functions, the zzso gene family shows the signature of positive zzso selection zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains the zzso zzso domain of zzso supporting the idea that zzso is a zzso protein of the zzso innate immune zzso The zzso of zzso are zzso as are those of zzso The conservation among zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows that zzso proteins represent a novel, ancient protein family of probable zzso zzso
