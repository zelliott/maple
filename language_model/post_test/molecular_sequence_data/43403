abnormal zzso a gene required for normal zzso structure and function in zzso zzso lies immediately adjacent the gene zzso at zzso It encodes a zzso zzso with a predicted zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso directs the synthesis of a zzso terminally truncated or internally deleted zzso of approximately 124 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso with zzso and is not released by salt zzso known to zzso most other zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso zzso acid zzso which has a number of potential zzso sites for zzso and zzso zzso strongly binds to zzso The central zzso acid segment of the zzso contains one short motif zzso to sequences in a number of zzso bundling proteins and a second motif present at the zzso binding sites of several zzso zzso studies show that the zzso zzso protein is localized to the polar regions of the zzso immediately surrounding the zzso These findings are discussed in relation to the known zzso abnormalities in asp zzso
