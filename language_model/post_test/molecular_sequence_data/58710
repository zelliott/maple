Three zzso genes were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein products have zzso identity to the previously cloned zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso contain 12, 10 and 11 zzso zzso The position of several of the zzso is zzso among all 5 zzso The 5 genes appear to be zzso zzso and message has only been detected for zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was determined by zzso and 8 bands ranging in size from approximately zzso to zzso zzso were resolved of which 2 appear to be zzso The 5 zzso genes have been mapped to specific bands resolved by zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso to a band of approximately zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are on a zzso of approximately zzso zzso and zzso is on a zzso of approximately zzso zzso
