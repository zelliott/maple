zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso prepared by zzso zzso or represented by zzso zzso c from different species, were employed to map the functional boundaries of a number of mouse zzso zzso zzso specific for the major zzso region on the self zzso zzso around zzso 62 and the minor zzso region around zzso zzso The zzso mouse zzso c tested were, unlike the zzso zzso zzso at position 72, and included the zzso which was zzso at the zzso zzso a zzso that was zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso with the following single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these, only the zzso zzso affected the binding of zzso to the region previously localized to the vicinity of zzso 44, thus confirming that zzso Loss of the zzso group at the zzso zzso affected the binding of most of the zzso to the region around zzso zzso The other zzso had little, if any, affect on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso binding the region around zzso 62 were shown in this study to have similar functional zzso This site on the self zzso which encompasses at least three zzso segments of the zzso chain, is comparable in size to zzso on other protein zzso that have been mapped by X-ray zzso and is similar to an zzso in the corresponding region of the foreign zzso horse zzso zzso that has been mapped by zzso zzso In addition to the zzso binding the regions around zzso 44 and 62, a third group of mouse zzso zzso zzso known to be broadly zzso with zzso zzso c and that represents a minor portion of the zzso was tested for binding the zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso None of these zzso were affected by the zzso indicating the presence of at least one more zzso region on the self zzso in an area not zzso by these zzso that is structurally highly zzso
