The zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso B zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were replaced with three zzso AT zzso that are believed, based on sequence zzso to be specific for zzso The three zzso AT zzso were zzso zzso from module 2 of a type I zzso zzso zzso gene cluster isolated from the zzso producer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT isolated from a zzso gene cluster of the zzso producer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from module 14 of the zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso These changes led to the production of novel zzso derivatives by the engineered strains of zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso A, which lacks the zzso group at zzso of the zzso ring, was produced by the strains in which the resident zzso domain was zzso and zzso A and zzso A, both of which lack the zzso group at zzso of the zzso ring, were produced by the zzso strains in which the resident zzso domain was zzso All of the novel zzso derivatives exhibited zzso activity against zzso zzso The production of the zzso derivatives through AT replacements confirms the computer predicted zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso AT and the zzso specificity of zzso zzso deduced from the structure of zzso Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that at least some AT zzso of the complete zzso B zzso of zzso zzso can be replaced by functionally related zzso from different organisms to make novel, zzso zzso
