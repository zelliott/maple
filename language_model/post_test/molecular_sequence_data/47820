A new class of sequential zzso carriers zzso for zzso zzso peptides has been zzso The carrier, formed by the repetitive zzso zzso is designed to display a predetermined zzso structure, so that the attached peptides would obtain a defined spatial zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso adopt a distorted zzso structure, while the coupled peptides preserve their original zzso zzso zzso to the carrier may also result to the enhancement of one zzso of the anchored zzso It is concluded that the structure of zzso offers an optimal presentation of the attached zzso so that potent zzso or zzso are zzso
