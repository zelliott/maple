We have characterized a gene specifically expressed in the floral zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso screening led to the isolation of a floral zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso indicated that its zzso transcript is 1450 zzso long and specific to the flower zzso In zzso zzso and zzso showed that its zzso and protein are localized specifically to both the lateral and median zzso of zzso The zzso codes for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso The protein was named zzso zzso after floral zzso zzso zzso was located in the zzso of zzso cells in the zzso and was also observed in zzso at a much lower zzso The level of the transcript increases with flower development, especially during zzso development, but decreases abruptly with the opening of the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that at least three copies of zzso genes were present in the zzso of zzso zzso but that only a single copy was present in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows similarity to zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is expressed mostly in zzso The function of the gene is speculated to be involved in the zzso of a plant secondary zzso in the floral zzso
