Environmental stresses limit plant growth and crop production zzso We attempted to isolate rice genes involved in zzso tolerance to environmental stresses by using a transgenic zzso population expressing full-length zzso of zzso Among these lines, a zzso line, zzso was zzso The rice zzso inserted in zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, zzso This protein was localized in the nucleus and showed zzso activity at the zzso zzso expression was not induced by zzso but highly induced by zzso in rice zzso zzso pressure and zzso oxygen species levels also induced zzso zzso The seeds of zzso transgenic zzso showed enhanced tolerance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso and real-time reverse zzso chain reaction analyses showed zzso expression of some zzso zzso including the zzso gene zzso in zzso transgenic zzso Thus, zzso may play an important role in zzso responses to zzso zzso
