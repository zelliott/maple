zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in maintaining the appropriate zzso of zzso zzso in brain and zzso particularly during long-term stress, long-term drug treatment, or neurodegenerative zzso Its expression is controlled by both zzso and zzso zzso In a previous report, we showed that treatment of rat zzso slice zzso cultures or mouse zzso cells with zzso analog or zzso leads to induction of zzso protein without zzso induction of zzso zzso We further showed that zzso activates mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso translation via zzso sequences within its zzso region zzso In the present report, we extend these studies to show that zzso zzso proteins bind to the same zzso zzso zzso domain that is required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping demonstrates binding of proteins to a zzso zzso sequence within this zzso A specific zzso within the zzso sequence zzso protein binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies identify a approximately zzso protein as a major zzso zzso zzso binding factor, and zzso zzso the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We show that zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso domain that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein without zzso induction of zzso zzso These results support a model in which zzso zzso zzso leading to increased interaction with its zzso zzso binding site in the zzso zzso zzso This increased interaction presumably plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso translation by zzso in zzso zzso
