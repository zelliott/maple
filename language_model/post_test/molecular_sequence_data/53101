A synthetic gene zzso twelve B cell zzso six zzso zzso zzso and three zzso T zzso zzso zzso from nine zzso zzso representing the zzso liver stage, asexual zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was constructed by assembling overlapping zzso followed by zzso extension and zzso A three-step zzso protocol using twelve long zzso was employed to generate a zzso zzso synthetic zzso the identity of which was confirmed by zzso This synthetic zzso named zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso protein was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso System zzso The selection of zzso zzso for inclusion in this vaccine construct was based on zzso studies in malaria endemic area, in zzso and in zzso protection studies in model zzso The 41 zzso zzso zzso protein reacted with mouse zzso specific for individual B cell zzso in the vaccine construct and with zzso from clinically immune Kenyan zzso An zzso study in three strains of mice that differ at the zzso locus demonstrated that the zzso zzso protein is zzso the candidate vaccine zzso induced high zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that individual B and T cell zzso can be assembled to create synthetic genes that zzso proteins capable of zzso specific zzso and T cell zzso
