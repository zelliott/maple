The crystal structure of a complex between zzso human zzso A zzso and zzso A zzso has been determined from a novel zzso crystal form that contains only one zzso of complex per zzso unit rather than five in the previously determined zzso zzso The structure has been refined at zzso A resolution to a zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso is practically unchanged with respect to the zzso zzso A certain number of previously undefined zzso have been located in the electron density and a very detailed picture of the ordered zzso structure has been zzso The interactions between zzso and zzso are zzso A network of the possibly zzso zzso contacts is zzso The structure of zzso in the zzso complex is similar to that of the zzso complex, but shows a few small differences in the so-called zzso domain of zzso probably due to differences in crystal zzso The fact that this zzso crystal form can be obtained shows that the formation of zzso or zzso complexes is not a generally observed phenomenon and is not a prerequisite for biological zzso
