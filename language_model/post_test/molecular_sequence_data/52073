Crystal structure analysis of zzso zzso in proteins has been carried zzso High resolution crystal structures were selected from the zzso Data zzso Apart from the standard internal zzso some parameters which are specifically related to the bend in the zzso due to zzso have been developed and zzso Finally the position and nature of these zzso and their interactions with the rest of the protein have been zzso
