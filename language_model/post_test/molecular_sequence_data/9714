Using an zzso zzso zzso expression cloning of a zzso for the zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso zzso mouse melanoma zzso zzso with zzso T zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used as a recipient cell line for the zzso library zzso A zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso library prepared from rat brain zzso using the zzso expression zzso The isolated zzso clone zzso predicted a type II membrane protein with 4 zzso acids of zzso domain, 21 zzso acids of zzso region, and a large zzso domain with zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso clone into a mouse melanoma line zzso previously zzso with a zzso zzso gene resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso of the cell line with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso resulted in the expression of zzso as well as zzso Moreover, introduction of zzso into L cell zzso zzso zzso previously zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in the zzso expression of zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso were zzso as previously suggested based on zzso zzso In Northern blots of the zzso zzso gene with total zzso from various rat zzso a zzso zzso was strongly expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the expression level of the gene in the adult brain tissue was not especially zzso On the other hand, this gene was expressed at high levels in the rat brain of zzso day 12, and reached a peak at around birth, then fell to low level in the adult zzso
