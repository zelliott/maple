zzso zzso zzso C zzso generates two important second zzso zzso zzso and zzso The recently cloned rat zzso beta 4 zzso is highly zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have mapped the zzso beta 4 gene expression in rat brain tissue sections by in zzso zzso The zzso beta 4 gene is expressed at high abundance in zzso zzso cells and zzso of the zzso zzso the median zzso bodies and the zzso zzso zzso beta 4 transcripts are also detected in the zzso zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso The specific pattern of gene expression we have observed should help to clarify the relationships between the zzso beta 4 and various constituents of zzso systems involved in zzso mechanisms triggered by the stimulation of seven zzso domain zzso The strong gene expression in zzso cells and retinal zzso suggests that zzso beta 4 may be involved in the zzso of mouse and human neurological diseases characterized by zzso and retinal zzso
