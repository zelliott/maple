To explore the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso of vascular cell zzso zzso 1 zzso expression in zzso zzso cells zzso we examined the effect of zzso stress on zzso gene zzso and assessed the zzso elements involved in this zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso at the zzso level as defined by nuclear zzso zzso and transient zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso on the zzso deletion zzso revealed that the zzso element is contained between zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the zzso initiation zzso zzso shift zzso using overlapping zzso zzso of this region showed that zzso containing a double zzso consensus sequence zzso formed distinct complexes with nuclear proteins extracted from zzso zzso zzso of either one or both of two zzso consensus sequences completely abolished the ability of the promoter to respond to zzso zzso These results suggest that fluid zzso stress zzso the zzso of the zzso gene via an upstream zzso a double zzso consensus zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
