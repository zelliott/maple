We identified zzso sequences of potential utility in the house sparrow zzso zzso and assigned their predicted zzso zzso These sequences included newly isolated house sparrow zzso which we fully zzso Many of the newly isolated zzso were zzso in two other species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zebra zzso zzso zzso In total, we identified 179 zzso markers that were either isolated directly from, or are of known utility in, the house zzso zzso of these markers were designed from unique sequences that we isolated from a house sparrow zzso zzso These new markers were combined with 36 house sparrow markers isolated by other studies and 76 markers isolated from other zzso species but known to be zzso in the house zzso We zzso sequence zzso to assign zzso locations for these zzso in the assembled zebra zzso zzso One hundred and zzso zzso were assigned to 25 different zzso and eight zzso to the Z zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso house zzso for 37 of the new zzso revealed a zzso locus and an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso previously reported as zzso was found to be zzso These zzso enable the creation of powerful and cost-effective house sparrow multiplex primer sets for population and parentage zzso They can be used to create a house sparrow linkage map and will aid the identification of quantitative trait zzso in zzso zzso
