DNA containing alternating zzso and zzso repeats has the potential to adopt the zzso structure, one of the well-studied structures besides A- and zzso Despite a number of molecular models that have been proposed to explain the mechanism for zzso transition, there is continued discussion on the mechanism and zzso role of this zzso In this study, we have found that the zzso zzso zzso exhibits a remarkable ability to cause the zzso transition of zzso at low salt zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso transition induced by zzso is both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso might effect the zzso of zzso which leads to the zzso zzso Interestingly, an intermediate CD between the B and Z forms was observed in the zzso transition in the presence of the zzso The unique structure and characteristics of the zzso designed in this investigation will be useful for the study of zzso
