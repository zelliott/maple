zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of the highly active zzso donor zzso zzso a key intermediate in zzso zzso We have determined the high-resolution crystal structure of human zzso zzso 1 zzso An unexpected reaction zzso with a tightly bound zzso and zzso at the active site has been captured in the zzso An zzso zzso revealed that zzso possesses low zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso Our structural and zzso results suggest that consuming the second zzso zzso bond of zzso could protect the zzso product zzso during zzso zzso We solved another zzso structure with zzso zzso at the active zzso Comparing the two structures, we were able to define the zzso zzso site of the zzso The detailed mechanism of the zzso zzso step and the exact function of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso reaction are zzso
