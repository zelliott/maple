zzso proteins form a family of zzso protein zzso that are considered potential drug targets against zzso Here, we present the first characterization of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso an zzso agent of American zzso zzso that has been the subject of many studies focused in the development of therapeutic zzso The protein has high sequence identity with other zzso Silent information regulator 2 Related zzso 1 zzso and was named zzso The gene exists as a single zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso of approximately 41 zzso that has zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in total protein zzso in zzso zzso and in the zzso material of both zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso extracts revealed the presence of a major enriched protein of approximately 66 zzso that was recognized by an zzso serum, suggesting that a zzso zzso could be zzso in zzso
