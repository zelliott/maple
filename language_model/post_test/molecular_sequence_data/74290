The zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso transmission requires a sodium zzso An zzso zzso of binding proposes that zzso anchors the zzso positive charge but ignores the direct role of sodium in zzso binding seen in the only representative structure, the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we built structural models of human zzso of zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso sites are highly zzso We examined the possibilities for zzso binding given the available experimental evidence, including examples of zzso zzso in X-ray structures of protein and other zzso We conclude that a zzso zzso of binding with direct interaction between the zzso zzso and sodium is a valid alternative, with consequences for pharmaceutical zzso In the modeled zzso zzso complexes, zzso is placed where it could select for zzso through hydrogen bonding to the zzso zzso
