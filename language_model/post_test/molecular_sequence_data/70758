zzso express three major zzso zzso of zzso a zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso and gamma are integral membrane zzso whereas alpha is zzso When truncated zzso human zzso proteins were added to zzso zzso zzso nuclear assembly reactions at high zzso a domain common to all zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited membrane binding to zzso whereas the zzso and zzso region zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso At lower zzso of the common domain, zzso attached to zzso with a unique zzso zzso but these zzso neither accumulated zzso nor zzso At lower zzso of the zzso and zzso region, nuclear envelopes and zzso zzso but zzso failed to enlarge and zzso on average zzso zzso better than zzso This enhancement was not due to zzso as shown by density substitution experiments, suggesting the hypothesis that zzso is a downstream zzso of zzso assembly in promoting replication zzso Overall, our findings suggest that zzso proteins mediate zzso attachment and zzso zzso and may promote replication by influencing zzso zzso
