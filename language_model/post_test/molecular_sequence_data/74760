zzso is a putative zzso zzso zzso identified in a zzso screen for zzso regulatory zzso It zzso between the zzso and nucleus, concentrating in zzso and zzso to the zzso in response to DNA zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is an unusual zzso zzso that is essential in early embryonic development to prevent zzso zzso This protein has a zzso inactive zzso domain and two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso that catalyze zzso zzso zzso To address in zzso function, we generated a zzso mouse model of zzso zzso that incorporates a zzso reporter gene under control of the zzso zzso Animals zzso for zzso zzso are zzso normal with no overt change in development, growth, zzso or zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso die prior to zzso Although normal numbers of zzso zzso are present at embryonic day zzso these zzso zzso in culture as a result of massive zzso Using zzso zzso as a marker for protein zzso we demonstrate that zzso is predominantly expressed within the central nervous system and the early stages of limb bud formation of the developing zzso In adult animals, the most intense zzso is found in zzso cell bodies and cells lining the zzso zzso In zzso zzso is a dual function zzso zzso essential for prevention of zzso in early zzso
