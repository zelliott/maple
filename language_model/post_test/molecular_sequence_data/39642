Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso C causes zzso of all zzso infections worldwide, and an estimated zzso of all transmissions occur zzso with zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso is highly desirable to evaluate candidate AIDS vaccines in nonhuman zzso To this end, we generated zzso a molecular clone from a zzso infant isolate that carries zzso zzso C zzso zzso was adapted by serial passage in five zzso three of which developed peripheral zzso zzso zzso After the first zzso monkey developed AIDS at week 137 zzso transfer of its infected blood to a zzso animal induced memory zzso depletion and zzso within 3 months in the zzso In zzso zzso DNA from the blood donor was amplified to generate the late zzso clone zzso To increase the zzso capacity of zzso an extra zzso binding site was engineered into its 3' long terminal zzso giving rise to zzso This virus was exclusively zzso zzso and zzso more zzso in zzso peripheral blood zzso cells than zzso in the presence of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso of Indian and Chinese origin were next zzso zzso with zzso this virus zzso vigorously in both sets of zzso We conclude that zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that represents a valuable tool to test candidate AIDS vaccines targeting zzso zzso C zzso
