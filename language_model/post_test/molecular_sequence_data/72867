The influence of zzso zzso and zzso on the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso B zzso was studied using zzso wild type and zzso zzso preparations and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso domain was measured as the zzso of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bound with affinities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similar values were obtained using zzso expressed and zzso from zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso The influence of synthetic zzso derivatives of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the activity of zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit the zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso at zzso zzso In contrast, zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso activity zzso stimulation at zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein lacking the zzso domain was not affected by zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso binds zzso zzso and zzso with high zzso and suggest that the products of the zzso zzso can act as both a membrane anchor and zzso of zzso zzso The data also provide further evidence for a link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
