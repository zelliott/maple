zzso type 1 zzso is an inherited disease characterized by severe zzso zzso and caused by zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso sodium channel zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso beta zzso that causes loss of zzso function and zzso replaces a zzso that is zzso in the zzso of all members of the zzso gene zzso We now report an investigation of the mechanism of channel zzso by this zzso zzso zzso introduced into zzso beta or gamma zzso all significantly reduce zzso sodium channel currents recorded in zzso zzso zzso zzso determination of the number of channel molecules present at the cell surface showed no significant differences in surface expression of zzso compared with zzso zzso Single channel zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso channels were identical to that of zzso These results suggest that the decrease in zzso Na currents is due to a decrease in channel open probability zzso suggesting that zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso change zzso channel zzso which would explain the disease zzso Single channel recordings of channels containing the zzso alpha zzso zzso directly demonstrate a striking reduction in zzso We propose that this zzso favors a gating mode characterized by zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that determination of the gating mode of zzso is a key regulator of channel zzso
