zzso complementary DNA zzso copies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso segments of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso strains D, zzso and S were zzso using zzso chain reaction and were cloned downstream of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso produced typical zzso symptoms when zzso on soybean zzso zzso and zzso zzso California zzso zzso Using either zzso or in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The properties of these zzso were tested by comparing the induced symptoms, virus zzso and systemic zzso These studies revealed a direct involvement of zzso genetic information in zzso zzso formation and in breakage of zzso resistance in zzso zzso between zzso or zzso components further affected the biological features of zzso zzso zzso The true nature of the zzso was confirmed by zzso of the parental strains from the corresponding zzso zzso zzso
