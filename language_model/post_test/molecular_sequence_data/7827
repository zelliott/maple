This chapter has briefly reviewed the current status of investigations on the hormonal regulation of zzso growth and maturation in fish (see zzso 4 and zzso zzso zzso are of primary importance in triggering these processes in fish zzso In both cases, however, the actions of zzso are not zzso but are zzso by the zzso production of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso or 20 zzso zzso zzso Investigators have established that both zzso beta and 17 zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso via an interaction of two cell zzso the zzso and zzso cell layers zzso zzso The zzso cell layers are the site of production of these two zzso zzso but their production depends on the provision of precursor steroids by the zzso cell zzso A distinct zzso shift from zzso beta to 17 zzso zzso occurring in zzso zzso zzso immediately prior to zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the growing zzso to enter the maturation stage, and requires a complex and integrated network of gene regulation involving cell zzso hormonal regulation, and zzso zzso The zzso for most of the zzso zzso responsible for zzso beta and 17 zzso zzso zzso have been cloned from rainbow trout zzso Our next task is to determine how zzso and other factors act on zzso zzso cells to turn the expression of these specific genes on and off at specific times during zzso growth and zzso zzso evidence now suggests that a variety of zzso zzso and zzso factors may also be involved in the regulation of zzso in fish zzso zzso zzso biological technologies should be applied to identify these zzso Of considerable interest is the finding that zzso unlike most steroid hormones, acts on its receptors at the surface of zzso Further studies of the association of the zzso zzso complex with a zzso zzso probably resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso should lead to a discovery of a new mechanism of steroid hormone zzso The early steps following zzso action involve the formation of the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso Fish zzso like that of zzso and zzso consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in fish zzso differs from that in zzso and zzso because the appearance of zzso B protein is a crucial step for 17 zzso zzso zzso maturation in zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
