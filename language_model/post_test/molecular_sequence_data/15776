DNA sequences of the envelope zzso gene of the bovine leukemia virus zzso were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso promoter, were used to construct four expression plasmids zzso either a sequence of the surface zzso zzso or a zzso + zzso zzso The expressed zzso gene products were characterized by Western zzso analysis and competitive zzso By means of Northern zzso analysis the zzso level of zzso zzso was zzso The highest expression rate was obtained from zzso zzso zzso 94 zzso a zzso zzso 630 base pair zzso containing zzso of the zzso but lacking the N zzso well as the zzso promoter including zzso signal sequence and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was partially zzso but the zzso signal zzso did not seem to be zzso zzso No zzso material could be found in the zzso or in the culture zzso By means of zzso zzso directed against eight different zzso of viral zzso all four sequential zzso zzso were detected in the zzso 216 zzso zzso expression zzso
