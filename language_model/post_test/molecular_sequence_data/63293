zzso the zzso immune responses of the zzso such as zzso and spatial expression of zzso peptides may help in the development of a zzso zzso unable to transmit zzso In zzso several small zzso peptides are activated locally in the zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso the major urban malaria zzso in India, has been considered as an important insect model to study zzso zzso however, so far no reports are available on the zzso peptides from this zzso zzso In the present study, we report identification and molecular characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso like zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso base pair long, bearing an open reading frame of 96 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a signal zzso sequence of 24 zzso acids followed by zzso acids long putative zzso domain and a zzso acid mature zzso domain carrying zzso acid long zzso sequence signature of insect zzso zzso zzso of zzso carries six zzso zzso zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso and zzso point of zzso characteristic features of zzso zzso zzso acid sequence similarity and zzso analysis indicated a higher variation in the zzso region, as compared to the mature zzso zzso assuring the presence of finely tuned immune responses to counter zzso
