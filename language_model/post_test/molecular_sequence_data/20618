The zzso island zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an zzso and zzso element zzso that carries genes required for a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso and zzso of proteins that regulate zzso transfer by zzso sensing in zzso and zzso Introduction of zzso cloned on a zzso induced zzso of zzso in all cells, a zzso increase in the production of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase in zzso zzso These effects were dependent on zzso but not zzso zzso of expression from the zzso and zzso promoters required the presence of zzso zzso and either zzso or 100 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso expression or zzso activity is zzso in zzso cells by a mechanism that can be overcome by additional copies of zzso The zzso gene formed an zzso with hypothetical genes zzso and zzso that were essential for zzso zzso and zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso regulates zzso and transfer of zzso through expression of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were present on putative zzso in several zzso indicating a zzso role in ICE zzso and zzso
