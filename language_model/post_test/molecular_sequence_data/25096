To investigate the mechanism of two forms of messages zzso and zzso zzso in mouse zzso a gene zzso for the zzso chain of zzso zzso zzso 5, we analyzed approximately 40 zzso of zzso DNA containing the sequences from the first zzso to the 23rd zzso to the 3' zzso zzso With the zzso rapid amplification of zzso end zzso and primer extension technique using zzso from mouse kidney and zzso zzso cells, we found that the smaller message starts at the zzso base of the zzso within the 19th zzso zzso sequences of this alternative start site showed the promoter activity in the reporter zzso with the zzso form of alkaline zzso zzso We also identified a novel alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso that includes two stop zzso These results revealed two possible additional open reading frame that are different from the previously described alternative human zzso zzso zzso the mechanism for generating smaller message and the event of alternative zzso are quite distinct between mouse and human zzso although zzso organization is highly zzso The significance of the presence of alternative message is zzso
