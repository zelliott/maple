Two new members zzso and zzso of the zzso gene family have been identified from a flower bud zzso library of zzso zzso and their functional characteristics were zzso The two clones differ from each other at 14 positions of the 193 zzso acid zzso deduced from their coding zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso are most closely related to the zzso family, genes that function early in the process of zzso budding from the zzso zzso zzso The sequences contain all the zzso motifs of the Ras zzso zzso zzso as well as the distinctive structural feature near the zzso that is zzso zzso Our zzso analysis confirmed that these two clones can indeed be considered members of the zzso family and that they have a close relationship to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, zzso with a zzso zzso prepared against zzso zzso zzso zzso It also exhibited zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis, using the zzso regions of the zzso zzso as zzso revealed that the two zzso clones are members of a zzso zzso zzso family that consists of 2 to 3 zzso zzso zzso analysis, using the same zzso zzso showed that both genes are expressed with similar patterns in most zzso of the plant, including zzso zzso zzso and flower zzso Furthermore, when we placed the two zzso genes under the control of the zzso zzso promoter into the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso they suppressed the zzso which consists of a zzso in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso the zzso activity, and the functional suppression of the zzso zzso suggest that the zzso proteins are functional zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso and that they may perform similar biological zzso
