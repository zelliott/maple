A comparison of the major zzso complex zzso region between human and mouse highlights both stability and zzso The class II and class III regions are zzso they probably existed in the zzso in a similar organization and were not subjected to major zzso The class I zzso by contrast, are definitely zzso having been reorganized several zzso As long as only class I genes were identified, the class I regions of human and mouse were difficult to compare zzso The identification of zzso I genes has allowed a comparative map to be drawn, which shows that the class I region is zzso between human and mouse as zzso The lack of zzso specifically applies to the class I zzso However, the comparative map shows that the zzso class I sequences occupy zzso locations with regard to the zzso zzso I propose a model to explain this zzso The zzso genes may represent samples of a dense zzso of genes whose zzso are zzso The zzso positions occupied by class I genes would thus represent the few zzso places allowing major zzso The evolution of the class I zzso by zzso and zzso independently in the two species, has taken place within the scope defined by the zzso zzso at the zzso places, and expansion by creation of class zzso DNA by duplication, thus pushing back the boundaries of the zzso
