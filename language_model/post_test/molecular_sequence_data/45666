zzso cell death is defined by distinctive zzso characteristics that are displayed by dying cells zzso zzso zzso Harmon, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cellular events that transpire during necrosis to generate these zzso traits are poorly zzso Recent studies in the zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso develops during necrosis and is required for cell death zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the origin of zzso zzso remains zzso We show that the zzso of zzso and zzso compartments ameliorates zzso cell death triggered by diverse zzso In addition, zzso in genes that result in altered zzso zzso and function markedly affect zzso zzso We used a genetically zzso fluorescent marker to follow zzso fate during zzso in zzso zzso we found that zzso fuse and zzso exclusively around a swollen zzso In the advanced stages of cell death, the nucleus zzso and zzso toward the periphery of the cell, whereas green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso fade, indicating zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate a prominent role for zzso in cellular destruction during zzso cell death, which is likely zzso in zzso
