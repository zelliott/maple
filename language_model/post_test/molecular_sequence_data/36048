Nerve growth factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso are structurally related survival and differentiation factors for distinct sets of peripheral and central zzso The regulation of zzso gene expression has been extensively studied in zzso mouse zzso zzso cells also express the zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis revealed 4 discrete zzso zzso species in zzso cells and rat zzso after induction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and all 4 zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with both agents induced zzso zzso to a much larger extent than the zzso zzso The induction of the zzso zzso was zzso with nearly zzso levels by 1 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso induction occurred later and peaked at 4-6 zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso induction were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, inhibited only zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly decreased zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso and had no effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso or zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso did not interfere with the serum induction of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that 2 genes which zzso closely related zzso factors are zzso regulated in zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms which bring about this differential regulation remain to be zzso
