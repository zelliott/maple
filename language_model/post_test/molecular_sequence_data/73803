We have isolated the gene zzso a zzso in rice zzso zzso zzso and determined the zzso zzso sequence of about a zzso zzso zzso The cloned gene zzso was found to contain four zzso interrupted by three zzso The first zzso begins the zzso translation start zzso and the four zzso code for a protein composed of 112 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which constitutes an active site of zzso coli and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso sequence contained consensus zzso and zzso boxes, and two zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of rice zzso DNA suggests that there are two copies of the zzso genes in zzso
