The zzso actions of zzso result from its engagement with the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is regulated by free fatty acids zzso A zzso zzso expression library was screened to identify a zzso clone expressing zzso 1 zzso binding to the zzso element zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso inhibited zzso promoter activity via effects at two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated specific association of zzso with the zzso zzso inactive zzso retained zzso activity on the zzso promoter and excluded the possibility that the effect on the zzso promoter was an indirect effect secondary to zzso actions on the zzso metabolism of zzso zzso expressed zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso established that zzso zzso both to the zzso and the zzso zzso demonstrated zzso region maintenance zzso nuclear export and the presence of a functional nuclear export signal in zzso The domain of zzso responsible for the effect on the zzso promoter was localized to the zzso portion of the zzso The in zzso significance of zzso effect on zzso expression was suggested by decreased liver zzso zzso expression in mice on a high-fat diet zzso with increased zzso abundance of liver zzso zzso Our results identify and characterize zzso as a novel zzso regulator of zzso gene zzso thereby establishing a unique zzso role for a zzso and expanding the potential biological roles of this protein zzso
