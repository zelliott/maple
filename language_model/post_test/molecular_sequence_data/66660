zzso zzso P is composed of an zzso zzso and a single protein zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We constructed zzso zzso zzso strains that zzso express the zzso P protein under control of the zzso promoter zzso In one strain zzso zzso expression was efficiently zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso leading to cell growth zzso Growth could be restored by a second functional zzso zzso This is the first zzso P protein zzso strain, providing the first direct proof that the zzso gene is essential in zzso zzso and, by zzso in other zzso We further show zzso that, in the zzso context, zzso expression is attenuated by zzso polarity and zzso that translation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso can be initiated at two alternative start zzso zzso zzso P protein zzso are functional in zzso and permit zzso of in zzso zzso by affinity zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso P zzso and zzso protein increased zzso P zzso zzso zzso overproduction of zzso P protein in strain zzso is compatible with cell zzso
