A gene zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso was identified by analyzing an open reading frame of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso retaining the zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso could be zzso to apparent zzso by one step of metal affinity zzso and further zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso toward zzso oxide, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The optimal zzso activity toward zzso oxide occurred at pH zzso and 45 degrees zzso The zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso oxide with zzso excess of more than zzso and zzso yield after zzso incubation at an optimal zzso The zzso zzso of zzso oxide was also confirmed by the analysis of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso rates of the zzso zzso toward zzso zzso were not affected by as high as 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso
