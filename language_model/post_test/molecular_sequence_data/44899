The crystal structures of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and its complex with zzso have been solved at zzso A zzso These structures are compared with the corresponding crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso which has a 30,000 times higher affinity for zzso as a result of nine replacement zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso of the combining site occur upon binding of zzso to the zzso zzso whereas zzso binds to the mature zzso by a zzso fit zzso The reorganization of the combining site that was zzso by zzso binding is further zzso by zzso zzso that occur up to 15 from bound zzso These results suggest that the binding potential of the primary zzso repertoire may be significantly expanded by the ability of zzso zzso to adopt more than one zzso zzso with both zzso binding and zzso zzso stabilizing the zzso with optimal zzso zzso
