The zzso protein is located in the retinal zzso zzso cells and plays an important role in the visual zzso Although numerous experimental results demonstrate that it zzso in the visual cycle, its detailed structure and function are not clear yet because of difficulties in isolation and zzso This paper describes a zzso modeling study to propose a three-dimensional zzso structure and suggest a possible mechanism for the function of the zzso The zzso server is used to obtain the preliminary zzso structural model of the zzso zzso The coordinates of the side chains are obtained from the zzso zzso Finally, two software packages, zzso and zzso with the zzso force field are used to fix and refine the preliminary structural zzso Based on the obtained zzso structural model, a possible mechanism for the protein function is zzso
