zzso designed zzso targeting different positions within the same zzso display widely differing zzso We have performed a statistical analysis of 46 zzso identifying various features of the zzso duplex that correlate significantly with functionality at the zzso zzso level and verified these results against an independent data set of 34 zzso recently reported by zzso Features that consistently correlated positively with functionality across the two data sets included an asymmetry in the stability of the duplex ends zzso as the zzso differential of the three terminal zzso at either end of the zzso and the motifs S1, zzso and zzso The presence of the motifs zzso or zzso was associated with lack of zzso A selection zzso based on these findings strongly differentiated between the two functional groups of zzso in both data sets and proved highly effective when used to design zzso targeting new zzso human zzso
