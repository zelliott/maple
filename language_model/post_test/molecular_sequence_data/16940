To identify molecules that might contribute to V2 zzso zzso zzso trafficking or zzso we searched for novel interacting proteins with this zzso zzso data, using the zzso C zzso as bait in a zzso zzso screen, revealed zzso as a binding zzso Because zzso interacts with other G zzso zzso we explored this interaction and its possible functional relevance in greater zzso A zzso zzso interaction occurs between zzso zzso and the zzso as well as the zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso C zzso revealed an involvement of an zzso sequence in this zzso zzso studies showed that a zzso zzso of the zzso C zzso containing the zzso sequence binds to zzso in a zzso zzso manner with a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso binding of the zzso C zzso to zzso was used to estimate a zzso value of approximately 200 zzso for this entire zzso sequence as expressed in zzso zzso zzso canine kidney II cells zzso expressing either wild type or a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso sequence was zzso to zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the AAA zzso resembled that of the wild type zzso in polarized zzso canine kidney II zzso zzso binding of zzso similarly was unchanged in the AAA zzso as was the concentration response for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Most interestingly, zzso increases in zzso zzso observed for the wild type zzso were virtually eliminated for the AAA zzso Taken together, the data suggest that a zzso region of the zzso important for zzso interaction is also important in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso a prerequisite for zzso fusion of zzso zzso with the zzso surface of zzso zzso zzso
