zzso nuclear zzso zzso 4 zzso is a zzso zzso factor family member that has a unique zzso and spatial pattern of gene expression in the developing and adult zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To characterize zzso further, mouse zzso clones were isolated and zzso The zzso gene is zzso on a zzso region located on the zzso end of mouse zzso 11 and consists of two zzso and one zzso Unlike most zzso zzso the DNA binding domain is divided between two zzso and the zzso position zzso precisely to the site of gene zzso involving two known human zzso zzso Multiple putative zzso start sites are identified in a zzso sequence that does not contain zzso or zzso zzso Within zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence are three identical E boxes and multiple putative zzso factor binding zzso zzso of plasmids containing zzso zzso zzso sequence linked to a reporter gene results in promoter activity in lung zzso cells but not in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that this zzso zzso sequence can function as a promoter with the proper zzso zzso
