zzso analysis of the zzso protein genes of five strains of mouse zzso virus zzso disclosed that the 3' region of the zzso protein gene contains highly zzso sequences unique to zzso We designed a pair of zzso to amplify zzso from such sequences of zzso by using the zzso chain reaction zzso Six zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were amplified successfully and detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence identity of zzso products was readily verified by confirming target size and a zzso site within the zzso The sensitivity of our zzso zzso was estimated to be sufficient to detect a single cell infected with zzso This new approach may permit more sensitive and rapid detection of zzso in zzso materials than current methods such as virus isolation, the infant mouse zzso and the mouse zzso production zzso
