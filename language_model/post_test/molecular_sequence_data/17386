In an zzso zzso membrane zzso a deteriorated enhanced biological zzso removal zzso community was developed (as determined based on the chemical profiles of organic zzso soluble zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso observations revealed the dominance of zzso organisms zzso of which the majority stained positively for zzso under zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso of total zzso were the most dominant zzso A zzso zzso gene clone library specific for the zzso indicated that most zzso zzso gene clones zzso of total zzso were closely affiliated with zzso zzso forming a cluster within zzso 1 of the zzso Combined zzso zzso and FISH with specific zzso designed for the members of the zzso cluster suggested diversity within this zzso zzso and that these zzso were newly identified zzso organisms in zzso zzso However, these zzso zzso were only seen in low abundance in 12 different zzso and zzso systems, suggesting that they were not the key populations responsible for the deterioration of zzso zzso zzso
