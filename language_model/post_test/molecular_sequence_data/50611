The zzso sequences of the envelope protein of the zzso 1 strain of Japanese encephalitis zzso virus and a zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso were zzso Two zzso acid differences, zzso at zzso 364 and zzso at zzso zzso distinguished zzso 2 from zzso zzso Six zzso zzso were selected from these two strains using a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso All zzso had a single zzso acid substitution at zzso 52 and significantly reduced zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso derived from zzso 2 strain showed reduced zzso in zzso mice after peripheral zzso but were as virulent as the parent virus when zzso zzso These zzso also showed altered early zzso interaction but not replication and reproduction in zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso at zzso 52, zzso and zzso affect early zzso interaction in zzso cells and zzso in zzso
