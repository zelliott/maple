zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso binds to multiple sites zzso in the zzso The binding normally requires participation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso When zzso zzso appears zzso and is inactive in zzso zzso On reaction with zzso a species active in zzso binding is formed and found to be zzso To test whether the zzso can reduce zzso zzso was used to replace the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The hybrid protein zzso the zzso operator zzso indicating that zzso can zzso in zzso A further increase in zzso activity was seen in zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with a zzso reduction of zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso defective in zzso still depend on zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that no longer require zzso for zzso binding remain zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso dependence of zzso activity is not solely zzso to zzso zzso Our results are most simply explained by a zzso zzso change in zzso zzso that activates zzso zzso This zzso change also results in reduced zzso zzso
