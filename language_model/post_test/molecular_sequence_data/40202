zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso constraining the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Both zzso suppress zzso by selectively zzso their consensus zzso regulatory zzso In addition to zzso zzso can suppress zzso by a unique zzso zzso mechanism that involves tight binding of zzso to zzso to form stable zzso In this review, we discuss how zzso regulators, zzso and zzso interactions interplay to govern the activity of zzso and zzso and their ability to inhibit zzso In particular, based upon the published results of structural and zzso analysis of zzso and zzso we attempt to chart the zzso networks in zzso and zzso that govern their zzso and ability to inhibit zzso We also discuss how the published three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso with an zzso member sheds light on the structural basis of zzso recognition by protein zzso
