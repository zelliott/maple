zzso zzso genes are present near the end of the short arm and, to a lesser extent, near the zzso of the B zzso of some populations of zzso zzso The internal transcribed zzso zzso was amplified by zzso from total leaf DNA using zzso within the zzso regions zzso the zzso and zzso stable zzso zzso zzso of zzso amplified zzso sequences from several individual plants without B zzso with corresponding sequences derived from zzso B zzso revealed two consistent differences between the zzso of A and B zzso One of these differences produced an zzso restriction site that was present only in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso from total zzso DNA from plants with and without B zzso showed an additive relationship between the amount of zzso product containing the zzso site and the number of B zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the proportion of total nuclear zzso present on a single B zzso varied between 2 and zzso in different A zzso zzso Similar experiments, with appropriate positive and negative controls, using reverse zzso zzso of the equivalent region within the zzso precursor zzso suggested that the zzso zzso was not zzso Similarly, zzso of reverse transcribed total zzso from plants containing B zzso using zzso specific for the B zzso zzso was unable to detect a transcript from the B zzso
