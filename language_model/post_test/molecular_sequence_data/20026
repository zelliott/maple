zzso are small zzso viruses that zzso zzso fish and pose a considerable threat to marine aquaculture zzso These viruses possess a small zzso termed zzso which binds to and protects zzso zzso This prevents zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and subsequent production of small interfering zzso zzso which would otherwise induce an zzso response against the zzso In this work, we have performed zzso scanning zzso of the B2 protein in order to identify zzso required for zzso binding and zzso While the majority of the 19 zzso B2 zzso were required for zzso zzso binding and protection in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were essential for both zzso zzso experiments in fish cells confirmed these findings by showing that zzso in these zzso abolished zzso of both the zzso and zzso components of the viral zzso in addition to preventing any significant induction of the host zzso zzso zzso Moreover, an obvious positive correlation was found between zzso binding and protection in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in fish cells, further zzso the importance of the selected zzso acid zzso The same trend was also demonstrated using an zzso zzso system in zzso cells, with zzso zzso and zzso being essential for suppression of zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso of zzso dramatically enhanced the zzso of a B2 zzso In addition, we found that B2 is able to induce zzso in fish cells but that this was not the result of zzso zzso
