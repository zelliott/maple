The anterior zzso is thought to be unable to zzso zzso zzso except under experimental conditions where a zzso zzso zzso activity, the zzso step of its zzso has been zzso In this work, we tested whether the zzso described as active under particular conditions comes from de zzso zzso gene zzso or from a pre-existing zzso zzso poorly translated or untranslated under zzso zzso zzso we searched for the presence of zzso zzso in normal female rat zzso using the zzso chain reaction following reverse zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The zzso lobe zzso of the zzso was used as negative zzso since it is thought to be unable to zzso zzso As expected, no zzso zzso could be seen in the neural lobe zzso However, scarce zzso cells were found in the intermediate lobe zzso confirming the positive results observed in the zzso by zzso The anterior lobe zzso also presented zzso zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso gene expression in sparse cells of the zzso is discussed in regard to the ability of the zzso to zzso zzso under particular conditions from a pre-existing zzso
