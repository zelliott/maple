The zzso activity of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso growth factor domain and the zzso domain was compared with the activity of high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso times less active than zzso zzso in a zzso plate method, in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in a plasma zzso zzso zzso Time course experiments in a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso was less sensitive to zzso by zzso than zzso zzso This was confirmed in a zzso zzso test, which showed that at a concentration of 40 zzso zzso zzso required a zzso higher zzso concentration for 50% zzso in 20 zzso than did zzso zzso zzso experiments in the presence of zzso M zzso showed zzso zzso zzso for the zzso by zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, standard zzso was observed at zzso M zzso showing a zzso lower zzso efficiency for zzso zzso than for zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is about three times slower than the zzso of zzso zzso This explains, at least zzso the lower zzso activity of zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso
