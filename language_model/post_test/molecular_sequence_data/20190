zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso To further zzso the replication initiation of zzso DNA at high temperature, the interaction between the replication zzso zzso and the putative origin zzso in this zzso was zzso We found that efficient binding of zzso to zzso at high temperature requires zzso at least two neighboring zzso boxes, zzso the specific feature of the zzso zzso IV and zzso the zzso of zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso IV by the counterpart of zzso coli zzso or disruption of its zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso abolished the zzso activity of zzso at 60 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees zzso Moreover, zzso but not zzso or the zzso zzso was able to unwind the zzso zzso The minimal zzso required for this duplex opening in zzso was demonstrated to consist of zzso boxes zzso and an unusual zzso zzso Interestingly, although no typical zzso box was found in this zzso region, it was exclusively bound by zzso and acted as the zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, we propose that zzso of zzso and simultaneously binding of several zzso boxes and/or zzso region may be generally required in replication initiation at high zzso
