zzso eggs normally require zzso maturation to be competent for zzso A necessary prerequisite for this event is zzso zzso and we show that under normal zzso conditions this property is acquired at, but not before, zzso zzso zzso zzso do not bind zzso but injection of total egg zzso zzso into immature zzso zzso zzso binding in the absence of zzso zzso Using an expression cloning approach we have isolated a single zzso from egg zzso zzso that can induce zzso binding in immature zzso The zzso was found to zzso zzso zzso a protein that previously has been shown to function in initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle zzso This unanticipated finding provides evidence of a link between a regulator of the cell cycle and zzso in cell surface properties that affect zzso zzso
