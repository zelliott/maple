zzso of zzso activity has been reported in zzso flies and zzso during zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso in stationary phase is correlated with zzso of the zzso zzso into their zzso and zzso zzso However a recent report showed that upon entry into the stationary phase, zzso zzso zzso zzso from the nucleus into mobile zzso structures called zzso storage zzso zzso Whether zzso zzso in zzso are assembled into active complexes remains an open question that we addressed in the present zzso We showed that a particular zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso a zzso lid zzso already known to exhibit zzso zzso zzso in zzso is unable to form zzso and displays a reduced viability in stationary zzso Full restoration of long-term survival and zzso formation in zzso cells can be achieved by the expression in trans of the last 45 zzso acids of the zzso domain of zzso which was zzso found to zzso with zzso In addition, another zzso zzso leading to seven zzso acids change in the zzso zzso domain, which exhibits zzso zzso is able to form zzso but with a delay compared to the wild type zzso Altogether, our findings indicate that zzso are formed of fully assembled zzso zzso and suggest a critical role for the zzso protein in this zzso
