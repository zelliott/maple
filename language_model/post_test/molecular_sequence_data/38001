zzso zzso zzso represent the most prevalent class of genetic markers available for linkage zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso may be labeled with fluorescent zzso and used to rapidly and accurately differentiate among zzso that are defined by a zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso detection of zzso based on primer mismatch during zzso amplification of zzso target zzso zzso are labeled with different zzso at their zzso zzso with their 3' zzso at the transition zzso that defines zzso variation at the target zzso Each primer perfectly matches one of the two available zzso for each zzso zzso detection permits characterization of the product both by size and zzso This report demonstrates some of the capabilities of this zzso including zzso determination and zzso zzso
