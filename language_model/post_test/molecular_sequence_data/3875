In order to identify genes that are involved in the defense reaction against pathogen attack, we screened for examples that are regulated during the hypersensitive response zzso to infection by tobacco mosaic virus zzso of tobacco ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the N zzso which zzso resistance to zzso Among seven genes initially identified by fluorescent differential display, one clone was further characterized because its transcripts accumulated rapidly and zzso after the onset of zzso Its full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso consisting of 258 zzso zzso The deduced protein contained a single zzso domain, a zzso zzso motif and a zzso zzso showing high similarity to zzso a member of the family of zzso zzso factors in zzso The gene was thus designated zzso A zzso fusion protein was found to zzso to the nucleus upon introduction into zzso cells of zzso zzso expressed zzso was able to bind to the zzso zzso element that is recognized by other zzso zzso but zzso zzso showed it to be unable to activate reporter gene expression by zzso zzso transcripts were induced in zzso zzso transgenic tobacco plants, in which salicylic acid fails to zzso Neither zzso applied salicylic acid nor mechanical wounding induced zzso transcript zzso These results indicate the presence of salicylic zzso pathways for zzso signal zzso in which a novel type of zzso zzso may play a critical role for the zzso of zzso
