In the zzso zzso activated protein zzso C zzso zzso accumulate either selectively at the zzso contact zzso and zzso or at the entire plasma membrane zzso and zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying these various zzso locations are not zzso Here, we demonstrate the existence within zzso of a zzso contact targeting sequence zzso that, upon zzso is capable of targeting zzso zzso and the zzso C1 domain to the zzso zzso We show that this selective targeting of zzso is lost upon zzso of zzso fused to a zzso (where zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting a zzso effect of the zzso zzso on targeting zzso zzso contains a putative zzso zzso a zzso site, and the zzso zzso acid, involved in targeting zzso We show that the integrity of the zzso is important for zzso but that zzso is not involved in targeting zzso However, zzso zzso is increased when zzso interaction is zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso may initiate two sets of zzso functions, those depending on zzso and those depending on zzso to zzso zzso Thus, zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso via its zzso site, in zzso zzso via the zzso and in selective zzso targeting at the zzso contact via zzso
