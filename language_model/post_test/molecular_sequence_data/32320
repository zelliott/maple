The 10th human zzso type III domain zzso is one of several protein scaffolds used to design and select families of proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to zzso zzso To date, the highest affinity zzso zzso have been selected by zzso display of libraries generated by zzso all three zzso region -like zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso affinities of such zzso mimics have been attributed to the extremely large size of the library accessible by zzso display zzso unique zzso Here we describe the selection and affinity maturation of zzso zzso mimics with zzso zzso as low as 350 zzso selected from significantly smaller libraries zzso different zzso which were constructed by zzso only 14 zzso zzso The finding that two adjacent zzso in human zzso provide a large enough variable surface area to select zzso zzso mimics is significant because a smaller zzso from zzso zzso sequence is associated with a higher stability of selected zzso zzso Our results also demonstrate the utility of an zzso strategy that led to a zzso improvement in affinity by maximizing sampling of sequence space close to the original selected zzso zzso A striking feature of the highest affinity zzso mimics selected against zzso is a pair of zzso on adjacent zzso in positions 28 and 77, which are critical for the affinity of the zzso zzso for its target and are close enough to form a zzso zzso The selection of this zzso pair is structurally analogous to the natural evolution of zzso bonds found in new zzso receptors of zzso fish and in zzso zzso variable zzso We propose that future library designs incorporating such an zzso zzso will further facilitate the selection of zzso highly stable zzso mimics from libraries accessible to zzso and zzso surface display zzso
