zzso zzso in plants has been described at the molecular level for most of the zzso steps in the zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso which is known to occur in zzso has remained a mystery since its discovery five decades zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso we have taken a genetic zzso approach to clone the tangerine locus from zzso Fruit of tangerine are orange and accumulate zzso zzso instead of the zzso which normally is zzso in the wild zzso Our data indicate that the tangerine zzso designated zzso encodes an authentic zzso zzso that is required during zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso structurally related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso of tangerine have been zzso In zzso loss of function is attributable to a deletion zzso in zzso and in zzso expression of this gene is zzso zzso from tomato is expressed in all green zzso but is zzso during fruit zzso and in zzso The function of zzso zzso in plants presumably is to enable zzso zzso to occur in the dark and in zzso zzso
