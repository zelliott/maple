The zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso growth factor zzso is zzso by an integral membrane protein coded for by the zzso early zzso unit of group C zzso The zzso protein appears to block recycling of zzso zzso zzso causing them instead to traffic to zzso where they are zzso zzso of functional zzso receptors is also regulated by protein zzso C zzso which directly zzso the zzso zzso at zzso The goal of this study was to determine potential interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso since zzso zzso activity is elevated by the zzso zzso zzso Our results show that although tumor promoters which activate zzso cause a coordinate induction of zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso degradation, the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso functions independently of zzso and other zzso that are inhibited by zzso This suggests that in contrast to other mechanisms that zzso zzso expression zzso zzso and zzso the zzso protein is not regulated by zzso but is zzso zzso We also report that zzso degradation is the preferred zzso in infected cells zzso with zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso
