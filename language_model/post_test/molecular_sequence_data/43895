The dominant exported proteins and protective zzso of zzso tuberculosis are a zzso of related gene products called the zzso 85 zzso zzso Each has also been implicated in disease zzso through its zzso zzso A zzso domain was found within the zzso acid sequences of zzso B, and C, and each protein acted as a zzso involved in the final stages of zzso cell wall zzso as shown by direct zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the use of an zzso zzso zzso of this activity demonstrates that these proteins are essential and potential targets for new zzso zzso
