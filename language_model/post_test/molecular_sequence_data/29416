zzso mediate the zzso passage of water over zzso and are present in zzso zzso and in plasma zzso zzso of plant zzso Knowing their expression in different zzso is valuable when assessing their contribution to plant water zzso A zzso has been cloned from developing female zzso of zzso zzso a conifer displaying an zzso different from the zzso zzso were made from zzso regions of the zzso gene and used for in zzso zzso to examine the gene expression pattern in developing female zzso zzso Early during development high transcript expression was found in the zzso tissue zzso the developing female zzso in cells of the future seed coat of young zzso and in vascular tissue of the zzso zzso At later stages a strong signal was seen in zzso jacket cells surrounding egg cells and, still later, at the time of storage protein zzso in storage zzso cells of the zzso as zzso These zzso probably participate in regulating water balance in the cells although they could also be permeable to other molecules than zzso
