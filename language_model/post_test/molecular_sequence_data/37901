The recruitment of zzso zzso to sites of tissue injury is one of the earliest events during host zzso Several zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso are thought to be implicated in this kind of zzso Especially those zzso zzso that are stored in blood zzso and become immediately released upon zzso are likely to dominate zzso host defense at the onset of zzso The major zzso zzso zzso are the zzso and zzso factor 4 zzso which are both released into the blood at zzso zzso The availability as well as the functional activity of these zzso appear to be subject to tight control by diverse regulatory zzso These include zzso processing of zzso zzso zzso formation, and the differential usage of zzso zzso zzso we review our work on early zzso regulation by zzso the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and its major precursor zzso zzso zzso III zzso We zzso propose a model to assess the contribution by either of these zzso to coordinated recruitment and zzso of zzso in response to acute tissue zzso
