The zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso region zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as judged by Western zzso However, the location of the zzso within this region is not zzso In the present study, we used zzso mass zzso to map the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso or zzso and then subjected to zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso of the zzso peptides were determined directly from the immune complexes by zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the two zzso generated a zzso zzso fingerprint that covered approximately zzso of the zzso domain zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso fingerprint showed two masses, zzso and zzso Da representing zzso zzso and zzso respectively, determined from a theoretical database search and confirmed by direct zzso zzso using a zzso digest yielded a single, zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso suggesting the importance of zzso zzso in forming the zzso A synthetic zzso to zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso and blocked zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso segments were observed to be adjacent and surface exposed in the zzso domain model, and together with the above results suggest that zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso represent a zzso zzso for zzso Furthermore, based upon zzso zzso we speculate that zzso zzso make a substantially greater contribution to the binding energy for this zzso
