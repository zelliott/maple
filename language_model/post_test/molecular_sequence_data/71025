We have cloned the full-length zzso for the human zzso binding cassette zzso 1 zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids resulting in a deduced molecular weight of 220 zzso The zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso to the human rim ABC zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of human zzso with highest expression levels found in zzso liver, zzso adrenal zzso and fetal zzso We demonstrate that the zzso expression is induced during differentiation of human zzso into zzso in zzso In zzso both the zzso zzso and protein expression are zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso expression is reversed by cholesterol depletion zzso by the addition of zzso zzso zzso Our data, demonstrating zzso regulation of zzso in human zzso suggest a novel role for this zzso zzso in membrane zzso zzso
