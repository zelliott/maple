Although DNA has not been found responsible for biological zzso many artificial DNA zzso have been created by zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a new selection approach to assess the influence of four common zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on sequence diversity, metal zzso and zzso proficiency of zzso zzso Numerous zzso DNA sequences were isolated, a majority of which were selected using zzso or zzso as the zzso metal zzso We found that zzso and zzso zzso were strictly metal specific, while those selected by zzso and zzso were less zzso Further zzso by in zzso evolution resulted in a zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that DNA has sufficient structural diversity to facilitate efficient zzso using a broad scope of metal zzso utilizing zzso
