Many zzso species produce one or more zzso important zzso zzso and the relative level of toxicity of these compounds is determined by the pattern of zzso and zzso or zzso on the core zzso zzso Previous studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso defined the zzso gene and demonstrated that it was required for addition of the oxygen at the zzso position during zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized the zzso gene from zzso zzso and found that it encodes a zzso zzso zzso The disruption of zzso blocks production of zzso zzso and leads to the zzso of zzso the same zzso observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso do not complement one another when zzso and the zzso gene sequence restores zzso toxin production in both zzso and zzso The DNA sequence zzso zzso contains another new zzso zzso Thus, zzso encodes a zzso zzso and is located either in a new zzso portion of the zzso gene cluster or in a second separate zzso gene zzso
