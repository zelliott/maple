To facilitate zzso and species level identification of a broad range of bacteria without the requirement of zzso zzso we have developed a unified set of zzso and zzso chain reaction conditions to amplify zzso regions between the zzso and zzso genes in the zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso regions within these zzso show a significant level of length and sequence zzso across both zzso and species zzso A generic pair of zzso sequences was selected for the amplification of these zzso from highly zzso sequences in the zzso and zzso genes occurring adjacent to these zzso zzso This single set of zzso and reaction conditions was used for the amplification of zzso zzso regions for over 300 strains of bacteria belonging to eight zzso and 28 species or zzso including zzso zzso and zzso species and additional species related to these zzso zzso When the zzso amplification products were resolved by zzso the resulting patterns could be used to distinguish all of the species of bacteria within the test zzso zzso elements in the amplification product patterns generally clustered at the species level, although some zzso characteristics were also zzso On the basis of the results obtained with our test group of 300 bacterial zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso region is a suitable process for generating a data base for use in a zzso chain zzso identification method, which can be zzso applied to the bacterial zzso
