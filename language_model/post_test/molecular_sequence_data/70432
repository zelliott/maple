The development of functional layers in the brain involves zzso and temporally regulated gene zzso Through zzso library zzso we have identified genes that are expressed in a zzso manner during brain zzso zzso and expression data indicate that one of the zzso zzso is the chick zzso of zzso a human zzso gene found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso contains multiple motifs that are known to regulate zzso stability in response to zzso signals, and these motifs are zzso between the chick and human zzso zzso is found to be expressed at peak levels during early development of the zzso and zzso and is expressed in other regions including the zzso spinal cord, and zzso root zzso This study demonstrates both spatial and zzso regulation of zzso expression in the zzso which is associated with early events in brain development, including zzso zzso
