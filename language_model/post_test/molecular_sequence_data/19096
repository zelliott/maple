In this study, we describe the clinical features and provide experimental analyses of a novel point zzso affecting the penultimate zzso of the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene identified in a 26-year-old female who also carries a zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of this point zzso on the zzso activity of the zzso gene using a combination of an initial in zzso prediction followed by in zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso The analyses revealed that the zzso zzso zzso G point zzso causes the zzso of a cryptic zzso site located 49 zzso upstream of the zzso boundary in both zzso long and short zzso thus generating a zzso and a premature termination zzso between zzso 48 and 49 in the second zzso A rapid degradation of the zzso spliced transcripts by the nonsense zzso zzso zzso surveillance system is highly indicative of an zzso zzso zzso However, the abnormal zzso may not be entirely zzso since the zzso presents a slight zzso that could be the sign of extra vascular zzso
