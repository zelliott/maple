The zzso fish zzso zzso zzso with its compact zzso is an ideal model zzso for comparative zzso Sonic zzso zzso is a key protein in the patterning of zzso cells during embryonic zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso gene and compared it with the zzso and zzso zzso identifying a number of novel zzso zzso sequences upstream of zzso one and within the two zzso Additional zzso sequences serve to delineate zzso regions and enhancers previously characterized through functional zzso Control elements can thus be rapidly and effectively predicted by comparative methodology in its own right as well as zzso other, functional zzso This work demonstrates the value of using zzso in comparative zzso which has allowed identification of new putative regulatory zzso as well as corroborating enhancers identified by the more traditional deletion mapping zzso
