zzso zzso leads to the synthesis of a zzso set of zzso with a leader sequence derived from the zzso end of the zzso The zzso are produced by a zzso zzso in which the leader is linked to the zzso coding zzso This process is regulated by zzso sequences zzso preceding each zzso including a highly zzso core sequence zzso with high identity to sequences present in the virus zzso and at the 3' end of the leader zzso The role of zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso using a full-length infectious coronavirus zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso was zzso for the generation of zzso zzso zzso but its presence led to zzso levels at least zzso higher than those in its zzso The data obtained are compatible with a zzso mechanism including three steps: zzso formation of zzso complexes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning of the nascent negative zzso strand by the zzso and zzso template switching during synthesis of the negative strand to complete the negative zzso This template switch takes place after copying the zzso sequence and was predicted in zzso based on high zzso score between the nascent negative zzso strand and the zzso and minimum zzso
