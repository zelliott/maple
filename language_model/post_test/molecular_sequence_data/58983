zzso initiation of zzso can lead to loss of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso the proper spatial and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is essential for maintaining the integrity of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is implicated both in the zzso assembly checkpoint and control of zzso zzso To identify other proteins involved in these controls, we have isolated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the characterization of one of these, zzso zzso in zzso zzso is presented zzso zzso is not an essential zzso but in a zzso zzso background zzso the function of the zzso assembly checkpoint is zzso If assembly of the zzso is zzso zzso cells do not arrest, the activity of zzso zzso zzso and cells form a division zzso without completing a normal zzso zzso cells also show an increased rate of zzso loss during exponential zzso Upon zzso expression from an zzso promoter, zzso delays progress through zzso and zzso zzso formation, giving rise to zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a component of the zzso assembly checkpoint, required to prevent zzso formation and premature exit from zzso if zzso function is zzso
