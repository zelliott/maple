The zzso regulatory system zzso of zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of the zzso host plants zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein shares zzso with the zzso whereas the zzso protein is a member of the zzso zzso We report here the identification of a new zzso zzso DNA region that is able to suppress the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso provided that this region is expressed from a foreign zzso The minimal zzso region, which itself is not essential for zzso in a zzso background, consists of one gene designated zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product shows a high degree of zzso to zzso The zzso B gene is preceded by a long open reading frame, zzso whose putative product appears to be a zzso zzso of zzso an open reading frame zzso a second putative zzso was zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso DNA also in other zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso gene was found to be expressed rather zzso in zzso zzso This low level of expression is obviously not sufficient to compensate for a zzso zzso whereas strong zzso of zzso is a condition that leads to suppression of the zzso zzso
