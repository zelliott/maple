A group of three zzso zzso zzso of distinct zzso zzso with an apparent zzso of 96 zzso has been previously identified as a target of protective immunity both in humans and in monkeys zzso et zzso 1987, zzso et zzso zzso These zzso are produced during the late stages of asexual zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso the 96 zzso has a zzso of zzso is zzso and is released in the culture zzso zzso et zzso zzso We report here the cloning and expression in zzso coli of the gene coding for this zzso zzso raised to the zzso 96 zzso zzso exclusively the 96 zzso indicating that the other two zzso of 96 zzso are the zzso of distinct zzso Northern and Southern blots as well as DNA sequencing of the gene showed that the 96 zzso zzso is identical to proteins identified in other laboratories as the zzso binding protein zzso 130 zzso 1984, zzso et zzso zzso and zzso 78 zzso et zzso zzso The zzso zzso is produced at the zzso stage and more actively in the zzso It is released in the culture zzso at the time of zzso zzso together with two minor products, forming a characteristic zzso This zzso was also detected in zzso of zzso An approximate zzso on zzso indicated that the largest proportion of the protein is found in the culture zzso a minor fraction being loosely associated with zzso By zzso and zzso zzso intense signals were observed in the zzso zzso The zzso acid repeats were found in all strains zzso the protein showing some size zzso The zzso was detected in the serum of infected monkeys as well as in that of infected zzso
