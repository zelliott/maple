The zzso zzso surface protein zzso is a zzso but it also interacts with zzso acid zzso to increase internal calcium ( zzso ) in the zzso zzso A region of the zzso zzso termed zzso 2 zzso zzso has zzso acid charge zzso with other zzso binding zzso The zzso 2 sequence was zzso and two zzso zzso proteins were developed, one containing the zzso 2 region zzso zzso zzso and one without it zzso zzso zzso On Western zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso recognized the 64 zzso band corresponding to zzso in zzso intact zzso and, under reducing conditions, recognized the whole 67 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso specifically bound to zzso surface zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso fragments of zzso 2 zzso bound to the head of live zzso zzso zzso was bound by zzso 2 and by zzso extracts in a zzso binding zzso and this binding was inhibited by zzso fragments of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso protein and this binding was inhibited by zzso 2 zzso but zzso did not bind to the zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso 2 zzso inhibited the increase in zzso induced in zzso zzso by zzso Our results suggest that the zzso 2 region of zzso is involved in binding zzso which results in the cell signaling events related to the zzso of zzso during zzso penetration of the zzso
