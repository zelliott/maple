The 3' zzso region of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso component of zzso zzso contains a 113 zzso repeated zzso This zzso successively zzso zzso times, includes the region for intrinsic zzso In zzso termination of zzso occurs mostly at the first zzso zzso Analysis of deletions at the 3' zzso region revealed that the second zzso zzso and third zzso are functional in zzso and that the sequences preceding the region coding for an zzso hairpin and zzso 3' tail are essential for efficient zzso zzso terminating at zzso and zzso were also processed at the 3' end in a manner similar to those terminating at zzso
