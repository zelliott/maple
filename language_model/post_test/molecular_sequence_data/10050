The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso group to a single zzso in cellular proteins which terminate in the sequence zzso where C is zzso A is an zzso zzso acid, and X is most often zzso or zzso zzso include the zzso zzso nuclear zzso and a series of retinal zzso To date, a limited number of zzso for the zzso have been identified, predominantly by demonstration of the attachment of a zzso group to previously identified zzso clones which zzso proteins containing an appropriate zzso zzso We describe here the use of a zzso fusion protein expression library, together with zzso in zzso zzso zzso as a means of identifying novel zzso zzso One candidate zzso was fully cloned and found to be a zzso of the zzso coli heat shock gene zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of this protein was found to terminate with the zzso zzso which zzso to the consensus sequence for recognition by zzso and was shown to undergo in zzso zzso This zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel and zzso expressed zzso zzso and is the newest member of the zzso of zzso proteins which are zzso modified by protein zzso
