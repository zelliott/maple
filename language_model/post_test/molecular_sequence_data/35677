The zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso strain encodes functions that are essential for zzso on tomato and for the zzso of the hypersensitive response on zzso In this study, we present the zzso sequence of one of the zzso genes zzso located at the zzso end of the cluster and we show that zzso encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of zzso zzso zzso has a coding capacity for a zzso zzso which shows significant similarity to several zzso zzso zzso including the zzso protein of zzso coli, the zzso protein of zzso zzso and the zzso protein of zzso zzso The predicted zzso gene product belongs to a family of bacterial regulators different from the previously described zzso protein of the zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence demonstrates that the zzso gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative zzso units of the zzso gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this zzso We also show in this paper that the zzso of zzso is induced in minimal medium and is partly zzso
