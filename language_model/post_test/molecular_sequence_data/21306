zzso are a rich source of natural products with interesting biological zzso Many of these are peptides and the end products of a zzso zzso However, several zzso zzso classes were recently shown to be produced through the zzso zzso and zzso modification of short precursor zzso A new class of zzso produced through the zzso zzso and zzso of precursor proteins was recently identified from marine zzso Here we show the widespread occurrence of zzso gene clusters in zzso through comparative analysis of 58 zzso zzso A total of 145 zzso gene clusters were discovered through zzso zzso These clusters zzso 290 putative zzso zzso They ranged in length from 28 to zzso zzso acids with very little sequence conservation of the core zzso The gene clusters could be classified into seven groups according to their gene organization and domain zzso This zzso is supported by zzso analysis, which further indicated independent evolutionary zzso of gene clusters in different zzso Our data suggests that zzso are a prolific source of zzso weight zzso modified zzso
