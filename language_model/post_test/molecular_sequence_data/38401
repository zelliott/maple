The fourth zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso yet its close association with the zzso zzso makes it the zzso of the zzso zzso To investigate zzso and structural contributions of zzso to zzso zzso we systematically zzso zzso a zzso zzso that has been labeled by zzso zzso and evaluated changes in rate zzso underlying zzso binding and channel gating zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso selectively affect the channel gating step, slowing the rate of opening two- to zzso and speeding the rate of closing zzso to zzso Additionally, kinetic modeling shows a second doubly zzso open state for aromatic and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso largely preserve the zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, rapid and efficient gating of the zzso channel depends on a hydrogen bond involving the side chain at position 422 of the zzso zzso zzso
