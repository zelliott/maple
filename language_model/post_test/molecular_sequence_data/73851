The binding of zzso to zzso zzso and the effect of zzso on the binding of zzso to target peptides were examined using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso binds to zzso sites I and IV of zzso in the absence of zzso and that zzso site III displays the lowest affinity for zzso In contrast to the marked structural transitions induced by zzso zzso zzso binding causes only localized zzso changes within the four zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso does not seem to be able to cause significant structural effects required for the interaction of zzso with target zzso The presence of excess zzso (up to 10 zzso does not change the order and zzso of zzso binding to zzso and as expected, the structure of zzso zzso is not affected by the presence of zzso However, we found that the binding of zzso zzso to target peptides is affected by zzso with the binding affinity decreasing as the zzso concentration zzso Three different zzso corresponding to the zzso binding domain of skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso zzso were examined and show different reductions in their affinities toward zzso The zzso affinity of the zzso zzso in the presence of 50 zzso zzso is approximately zzso lower than that seen in the absence of zzso and a similar response was observed for the zzso zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso also shows a zzso zzso though to a much lower zzso The zzso decrease in the affinities between zzso and its target peptides is an intrinsic property of zzso rather than a zzso zzso effect, as other metal zzso such as zzso do not completely replicate the effect of zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the formation of complexes between zzso and its targets may contribute to the specificity of zzso in target zzso in response to cellular zzso concentration zzso
