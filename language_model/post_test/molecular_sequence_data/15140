To investigate the genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and to look whether these strains were distributed to geographical zzso 

Random amplification of zzso DNA zzso was used to discriminate between 58 zzso strains and 21 strains from various other countries of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of olive knot zzso zzso were separated into three groups by cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis of zzso fingerprint data obtained with three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Group 1 contained zzso from the southeast of zzso and European zzso Group 2 comprised strains isolated from the north of zzso exclusively while group 3 zzso the majority of zzso obtained from five zzso located in the zzso of zzso 

The results indicated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were genetically distinct according to geographic zzso zzso grouped zzso derived from the same zzso as zzso 

This is the first application of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
