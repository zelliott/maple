We previously demonstrated that a point zzso in the last zzso of the human zzso zzso causes a significant increase in its expression and transforming zzso Here we establish the basis of this zzso Using gene reconstruction experiments, we have identified a zzso element in the zzso that is completely zzso by the zzso The effects of other zzso zzso introduced into this region suggested that the negative element might constitute an alternative zzso zzso containing this putative zzso were identified and zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso prevents their zzso The abundance of these transcripts is low, apparently due to message instability and/or defective zzso The predicted product of the alternative transcript is suggested to lack transforming zzso Our findings demonstrate that alternative zzso normally operates to suppress zzso expression and that this negative control is abolished by a variety of zzso that interfere with this zzso
