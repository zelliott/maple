zzso zzso adaptation and survival in its host involve integrated regulation of zzso pumps zzso which are essential in calcium zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and sequencing of two genes zzso and zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso an agent of African zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso against the proteins and against zzso tags introduced into each protein showed that zzso zzso with the zzso zzso to the zzso while zzso localized to the plasma zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses revealed that zzso and zzso are zzso during blood zzso zzso and zzso suppressed the zzso hypersensitivity of a zzso of zzso zzso that has a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were functionally characterized by using zzso zzso interference zzso methodology to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso form zzso except that the zzso system was leaky and zzso and protein levels recovered with zzso The induction of zzso zzso caused gross zzso zzso and growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso against zzso but not against zzso caused elevated levels of zzso zzso and decreased zzso of zzso from zzso stores following zzso zzso These results establish that zzso zzso zzso are essential for zzso viability and validate them as targets for drug zzso
