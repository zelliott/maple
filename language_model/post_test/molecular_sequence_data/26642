zzso evidence has suggested that linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso directed to zzso zzso might provide clues to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study mapped zzso of zzso in zzso from patients with zzso zzso (with or without zzso and primary zzso aiming to analyze certain zzso associated with the development of zzso zzso 

Six zzso linear fragments, covering the whole zzso acid sequence of a single chain of zzso were produced from zzso zzso zzso from 17 patients with zzso zzso 17 patients with zzso zzso but without clinical evidence of zzso and 64 patients with primary zzso were collected at zzso Of the 17 patients with zzso zzso 12 also had zzso at zzso The zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso by using the zzso fragments as zzso zzso 

Compared with patients with zzso zzso but without clinical zzso zzso from zzso zzso patients showed significantly higher zzso against the zzso zzso of zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso to zzso versus zzso zzso to zzso zzso and could recognize a significantly higher number of fragments zzso zzso to four) versus one zzso to zzso zzso Compared with zzso from primary zzso patients, zzso from zzso zzso patients had significantly higher zzso to the P zzso and the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso respectively), and could recognize a significantly higher number of fragments zzso zzso to four) versus one zzso to zzso zzso Among the 12 zzso zzso patients with sequential samples, the number of fragments recognized in zzso was significantly less than that in initial onset zzso zzso to four) versus none zzso to zzso zzso 

Linear zzso of zzso molecules might be associated closely with zzso zzso In particular, the P and zzso fragments may be important zzso in zzso zzso
