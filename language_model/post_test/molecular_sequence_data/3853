The zzso associated with zzso processing zzso 1/2 zzso is essential for the transport of zzso peptides from the zzso into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso bovine TAP zzso activity, as a means of zzso zzso class I expression on the cell surface, and hence evasion of the zzso zzso response of the zzso Identification of zzso zzso responsible for TAP zzso and zzso of the mechanism of TAP zzso zzso cloning and high-level expression of zzso and zzso In this study, we cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from bovine peripheral blood zzso cells was used for zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends was used to amplify the zzso and the 3' ends of zzso zzso Based on the zzso and 3' zzso zzso were designed and the full-length zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The full-length zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso has approximately zzso zzso at the zzso acid level, to its zzso zzso Similar to human zzso zzso consists of seven putative zzso segments followed by an zzso zzso As expected, the level of zzso zzso expression was zzso by treatment with zzso bovine zzso In Northern zzso analysis, zzso transcripts were detected in several bovine zzso with the highest level observed in zzso zzso when expressed as a green fluorescent fusion zzso exhibited a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso
