We isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by differential display zzso using rat normal and zzso zzso zzso The most marked properties of zzso were zzso expression and a striking response to zzso injury in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous zzso For instance, zzso and spinal nerve zzso zzso corpus zzso zzso and zzso treatment increased zzso zzso expression in the injured zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress failed to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells partially inhibited zzso zzso probably because of the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso through the zzso activity of zzso These data provide insight into the mechanism of how injured zzso protect themselves against zzso zzso
