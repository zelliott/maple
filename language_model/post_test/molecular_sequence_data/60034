A molecular model of the complex between zzso and its zzso was generated to better understand the location and putative effects of zzso zzso analyze interactions at the zzso zzso and identify contact zzso The modeling study was conservative in the sense that regions in zzso and its zzso which could not be predicted with confidence were omitted from the model to ensure accuracy of the zzso Using the model, it was possible to map four of five zzso zzso sites in zzso and zzso and to study 10 of 11 zzso previously identified by zzso as important for zzso zzso involving six of these zzso could be analyzed in detail and their importance for binding was rationalized based on the zzso The predicted structure of the zzso interface was consistent with the zzso established importance of these zzso for zzso In addition, five previously not targeted zzso were identified and predicted to contribute to binding via zzso zzso Despite its limitations, the study provided a much improved basis to understand the role of zzso and zzso zzso for binding compared to previous zzso mapping studies using only a molecular model of zzso
