zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the two regulators of zzso copy zzso It acts as a zzso zzso at the essential zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso prevents zzso zzso from the zzso and the zzso promoter, thereby indirectly increasing the amount of zzso the second regulatory zzso zzso binds as a zzso to a nearly zzso operator with the consensus sequence zzso Previously, a zzso structural model was built and used to identify zzso acids involved in DNA zzso These data showed that zzso is a zzso protein belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and allowed the identification of two zzso acids involved in specific DNA zzso Here, we describe zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso and CD zzso to verify the model predictions concerning zzso acids involved in zzso With this approach, the zzso interface could be located between zzso acids zzso and zzso F5 located at the zzso is additionally required for proper zzso and could, therefore, not be unequivocally assigned to the zzso zzso CD zzso at protein zzso well below zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso is zzso
