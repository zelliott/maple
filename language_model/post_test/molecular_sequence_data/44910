zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso Gene cloning and sequencing analysis of the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso of zzso were found to be zzso zzso which suggests that gene expression is zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the zzso region of the alpha zzso to have a typical zzso zzso cluster motif zzso which is similar to that present in the delta zzso of other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the alpha zzso of zzso has a mosaic structure composed of features characteristic of the zzso beta and delta zzso from zzso and zzso zzso was zzso in zzso incubated zzso coli cells and the crude zzso was extracted under zzso zzso The optimal temperature for activity of zzso zzso was 70 degrees C and the zzso of this zzso in the presence of air was 15 zzso at 25 degrees zzso
