Three overlapping zzso clones covering the entire primary sequence of the zzso salt zzso zzso in human milk were isolated from a human breast zzso zzso zzso library by screening with the rat pancreatic cholesterol zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso showed that the human milk zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso including a zzso signal zzso The human milk zzso zzso is highly zzso to rat pancreatic cholesterol zzso suggesting that the milk zzso may be identical to the cholesterol zzso in human zzso This conclusion was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of the zzso for human pancreatic cholesterol zzso Analysis of the sequence for the human cholesterol zzso zzso revealed similarities to other zzso zzso in three distinct regions of the zzso These zzso may represent the active site zzso of these zzso
