zzso zzso is an zzso fungus with a growing potential for zzso control in different zzso zzso Such potential brings the necessity of developing a strain specific typing zzso In a previous study, we reported the identification of molecular zzso in zzso DNA zzso zzso in 15 North American zzso zzso indicated a highly zzso zzso zzso showing only two zzso zzso zzso In this study we used whole zzso DNA from 18 zzso of zzso zzso two unidentified zzso zzso and one each of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from more diverse zzso By doing zzso and zzso zzso zzso of total zzso DNA with zzso and zzso and then probing with zzso the predominance of zzso A and B was observed again, along with three newly described zzso zzso to zzso Additionally, by using whole zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso as probe, we further demonstrate up to nine different zzso within zzso zzso With either of the two zzso distinguished between members of the zzso zzso and from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis could not however distinguish zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso suggesting a close genetic relation between the three species of the zzso Altogether, these results show high zzso in zzso zzso which can be useful as a reliable tool for the zzso industry for both species and isolate specific zzso
