Members of the zzso zzso zzso associated with various cellular zzso are found in all zzso of life and they are involved in very diverse cellular zzso including protein degradation, membrane fusion or cell zzso The zzso zzso encodes approximately 140 different proteins that are putative members of this zzso although the exact function of most of these proteins remains zzso Using affinity zzso on zzso with zzso zzso we zzso a 50 zzso protein zzso by zzso with similarity to the zzso family gene 1 protein from zzso zzso analysis showed that the protein possesses a single zzso characteristic for members of the zzso zzso and that this contains all features specific to proteins of the zzso family gene zzso zzso In zzso pull-down as well as zzso zzso corroborate zzso binding of the protein to zzso The zzso binding domain could be located to a region of 20 zzso acids within the zzso in close proximity to the Walker A zzso Our analysis further showed that the protein is localized in both zzso and zzso further supporting the incorporation of both zzso zzso into the zzso network of the zzso zzso of the same zzso protein into zzso and zzso could be a means to provide a coordinated regulation of processes in both zzso by calcium zzso
