Genes zzso zzso proteins are diverse and abundant in zzso zzso Although some have been shown to have roles in zzso regulation of the expression of specific zzso few of these proteins have been studied zzso We have used an affinity tag to isolate each of the five members of the zzso family of zzso proteins in zzso zzso and DNA zzso to zzso identify the associated zzso zzso groups of zzso different zzso with striking common themes in the functions and zzso zzso of the proteins they zzso are associated with each of the five zzso zzso zzso binds nearly exclusively to zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and components of the zzso pole zzso We identified distinct sequence motifs in the zzso regions of the zzso bound by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the role of these motifs in specific zzso interactions in zzso The results suggest that zzso tagging of transcripts by specific zzso proteins may be a general mechanism for coordinated control of the zzso translation, and zzso of zzso and thus an integral part of the global gene expression zzso
