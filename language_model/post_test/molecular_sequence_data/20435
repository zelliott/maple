For a number of zzso channels, including the zzso zzso inward zzso channel from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso export motifs have been zzso These motifs consist of two zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso separated by any zzso zzso To specify the role of single zzso zzso acids for efficiency of zzso export, we zzso a sequence of zzso that included the originally identified zzso zzso export motif zzso plus an additional D just upstream of the zzso zzso Analysis of single, double and triple zzso of the zzso zzso acids of the zzso motif revealed a gradual reduction of zzso export depending on the number of zzso zzso zzso The amount of reduction in zzso export was not related to the position, but only to the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show that a zzso motif is essential for efficient zzso export of zzso zzso of the zzso motif probably involves cooperative binding to zzso
