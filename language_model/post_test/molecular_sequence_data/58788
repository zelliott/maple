In the present study we show that zzso from dogs naturally infected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso contain zzso that specifically react with the zzso zzso zzso Using synthetic peptides covering the complete sequence of the protein we located the linear zzso zzso within the 40 zzso zzso acids of the zzso In addition to the complete form of the protein zzso two regions of the zzso zzso zzso were expressed as zzso zzso the zzso zzso containing the 39 zzso zzso acids and the zzso zzso containing the 90 zzso zzso Competition experiments using the protein zzso zzso as competitor confirmed that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are confined to the zzso zzso This domain, which is believed to be exposed on the zzso surface, is also the most zzso divergent region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso do not react with zzso zzso an indication that the zzso response zzso during zzso infection is triggered by the zzso zzso The results of the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso in canine zzso zzso together with the zzso characteristics of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso protein zzso may be of use for diagnosis of canine zzso
