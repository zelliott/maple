zzso zzso of proteins has been shown to be a hallmark of signal zzso mechanisms in both zzso and zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are also the underlying mechanism of zzso and zzso signal zzso in zzso the third branch of the living zzso Cloning and sequencing of the region upstream of the zzso zzso known to be required for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso has identified zzso and zzso zzso which appear to form part of an zzso which also includes zzso and the following open reading frame of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins have zzso and zzso sequence identity compared with the known signal zzso proteins zzso and zzso from zzso coli, zzso The zzso activities of both zzso and zzso were investigated following their expression in zzso isolation and zzso zzso zzso could be zzso in a zzso manner in the presence of zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso remained zzso zzso zzso was zzso rapidly by the addition of zzso zzso The zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso and zzso signal zzso in the zzso zzso therefore, is similar to the zzso signaling system known from zzso in the zzso zzso
