The promoter region of the zzso zzso gene has been isolated using a zzso zzso library derived from human zzso It lacks typical zzso regulatory elements such as zzso and zzso boxes, but it contains two potential zzso binding sites and three putative zzso binding zzso The region up to zzso zzso in relation to the zzso zzso initiation site exhibits promoter activity as judged by zzso zzso zzso and the activity is enhanced both by zzso and by zzso zzso Northern zzso and Western zzso analyses have revealed that expression of the zzso gene is also zzso by both of these compounds in cultured zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso of zzso DNA separately zzso with various zzso gives a discrete single band in each case when the zzso region of the zzso zzso is used as a zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is zzso by a unique gene whose expression is zzso by zzso and by zzso zzso
