Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso from the clinical isolate zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso resistance zzso zzso is located on a zzso composite zzso element, zzso The ends of zzso are zzso direct repeats of an zzso zzso designated zzso zzso a putative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso with zzso imperfect terminal zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso central region is zzso identical to the previously zzso zzso resistance region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It encodes the zzso resistance zzso zzso and an zzso zzso to the zzso end of the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso with regions zzso the zzso sites were recovered from the zzso zzso zzso by a zzso rescue zzso zzso of zzso created zzso target site zzso A zzso zzso zzso was found to carry the zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso in zzso the zzso is inserted in a region similar to replication and zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso
