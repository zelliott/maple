The focus of this work is on the nitrogen zzso stress responses operating in a plant symbiotic zzso A zzso array profiling analysis was conducted on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifty-one unique zzso out of zzso redundant arrayed zzso were zzso expressed by at least zzso in response to N zzso Only two N zzso zzso nitrate zzso and a zzso ammonium zzso found among zzso expressed zzso All the other N status responsive genes code for as yet unidentified hypothetical proteins or components not directly involved in N zzso or zzso especially zzso binding proteins and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso A subset of zzso array data were confirmed and extended by Northern zzso analysis, which showed that most of the latter components respond not only to zzso but also to carbon source zzso
