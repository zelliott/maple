For zzso zzso and after zzso the methods reviewed in this article exhibit a probability index zzso of correctly predicted zzso per predicted zzso of zzso according to the methods employed with a standard zzso of zzso for three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These present limitations in the accuracy of prediction are related both to the limited number of known structures and to the effect of long-range zzso The methods based on sequence similarity can improve the accuracy of prediction by expressing the zzso of the protein to be predicted explicitly with proteins in the zzso Under these circumstances, the probability index can reach zzso with a standard zzso of zzso This property was used for zzso zzso proteins by assisting in zzso acid sequence zzso Examples will be given for the alignment of zzso zzso
