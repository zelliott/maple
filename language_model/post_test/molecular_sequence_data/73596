We report here an investigation of the role of zzso in zzso interactions using techniques based around the use of the zzso zzso In the present case such a study is of particular interest, since in contrast to other proteins previously studied with this method, the zzso is a small, highly charged protein that forms extensive zzso pairs upon binding zzso We have investigated the salt dependence of the binding constant for specific association and for a variety of models for zzso zzso The results indicate that, in line with the models proposed by Manning and zzso the zzso of zzso release accounts for a significant fraction of the salt dependence of the binding free energy, though this is perhaps due to fortuitous cancellation of other contributing zzso The zzso effects of a number of specific zzso zzso were also investigated, and partly rationalized in terms of favorable zzso interactions in the major zzso of zzso Investigation of the zzso of the free energy of association indicates that the zzso contributions become increasingly favorable as the temperature zzso For this particular system, however, there appears to be no significant zzso contribution to the zzso zzso of zzso Finally, an analysis of the free energy of interaction when the zzso is moved ca one zzso length from the DNA suggests that pure zzso forces are able to steer the zzso into a partially correct orientation for binding to the zzso
