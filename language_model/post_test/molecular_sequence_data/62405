The zzso products of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso share considerable zzso at the DNA and zzso acid zzso The high similarity at the protein level suggests that one zzso protein might be used as a single zzso to protect dairy cows against infections with the contagious zzso zzso and the environmental zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite their similarities, zzso with the zzso zzso zzso did not protect dairy cows from a challenge with zzso zzso suggesting the presence of regions in zzso that are involved in zzso zzso To produce a single zzso that can be used to protect against all zzso zzso infections, we constructed a zzso zzso protein using the zzso zzso zzso product as the backbone followed by zzso zzso regions from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that the zzso zzso protein retains the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we fused the zzso to the zzso and zzso transport sequences of zzso coli and the zzso zzso were present in membrane zzso of zzso zzso These extracts could be the basis of an zzso preparation for use in zzso zzso
