zzso DNA zzso by zzso II zzso zzso is induced by many zzso zzso Although human cells express two genetically distinct zzso II zzso thus far the role and zzso of drug-induced DNA zzso have been examined only for zzso Here we report the first high-resolution study of zzso zzso induced DNA breakage by human zzso II beta zzso and zzso from zzso and a direct comparison with the zzso alpha zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso and zzso DNA was induced by alpha or beta in the absence or presence of the zzso agent zzso and sites were mapped using sequencing gel zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso human alpha promoted DNA breakage at sites akin to those of zzso although some sites were only zzso by one zzso and different zzso were observed at some zzso However, statistical analysis of 70 drug-induced sites for beta and 70 sites for alpha revealed that both zzso share the same base preferences at 13 positions relative to the zzso zzso site, including a very strong preference for A at zzso The result for zzso alpha zzso is in agreement with previous studies using alpha zzso from human cell zzso Thus, alpha and beta proteins apparently form similar zzso complexes with zzso and zzso Previous studies have emphasized the importance of DNA zzso II zzso the results presented here demonstrate that beta is an in zzso target with similar site zzso strongly suggesting that beta should also be considered a target of zzso in zzso
