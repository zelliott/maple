zzso alternative zzso is an important mechanism for controlling gene zzso zzso 4, 5 and 6 of the human zzso common zzso zzso gene are included in B cell zzso but excluded from zzso zzso by differential zzso In order to study this zzso alternative zzso we constructed zzso that contain only a few of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Mouse B cells and zzso were zzso with these zzso zzso and the structures of zzso were determined by primer extension zzso The results show that the same primary transcript is spliced alternatively in B cells and zzso This finding suggests that there is a zzso zzso factor that regulates the alternative zzso of zzso zzso By making various deletion zzso zzso necessary for zzso zzso were confined within the alternatively spliced zzso and their immediate zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso scanning analysis shows that there are at least three distinct zzso within the zzso zzso 4 sequence that are required for zzso alternative zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso alternative zzso are zzso
