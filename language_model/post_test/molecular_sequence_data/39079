Homer zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso interact with zzso motifs in the zzso regions of group 1 zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the Homer zzso domain zzso with a zzso from zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso the bound zzso zzso assumes an unusual zzso in which the side chains of the zzso tandem are oriented away from the Homer surface, and the zzso forms a unique zzso This unusual binding mode zzso zzso features of both Homer and Homer zzso that are not shared by other zzso zzso zzso zzso confirms the importance of specific Homer zzso for zzso zzso These results establish a molecular basis for understanding the biological properties of zzso zzso
