zzso zzso zzso the gene zzso the zzso of zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The full-length gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso sequence is zzso identical to the corresponding protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a component of a gene zzso which includes zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso coli zzso zzso could be zzso by introduction of the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso coli and the zzso can be assembled into functional zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso is consistent with those of spontaneously arising zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso tuberculosis at certain critical zzso This suggests that the natural resistance of zzso zzso to zzso may be due to the primary zzso sequence of its zzso
