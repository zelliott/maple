zzso zzso and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene were carried out in five zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso revealed that zzso location of the zzso zzso gene was zzso in a single locus at a zzso which was assigned to zzso 1 by the zzso relationship with zzso In sequence analysis, the repeating units of the zzso zzso genes in the zzso species were variable in size from zzso zzso to 300 zzso In sequence comparison of our results to the results with other zzso plants as published by others, the coding region was highly zzso but the zzso regions varied in size and zzso T stretch regions, just after the end of the coding zzso were more zzso in the zzso species than in two other zzso High G zzso C rich regions, which might have similar functions as that of the zzso islands in the genes transcribed by zzso zzso were observed after the T stretch zzso Although we could not observe the zzso like zzso an AT rich segment at zzso to zzso was detected in the zzso zzso genes of the zzso zzso Species relationship among the zzso species was also studied by the sequence comparison of the zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed one zzso zzso zzso was revealed to be an intermediate species between the former three species and zzso zzso
