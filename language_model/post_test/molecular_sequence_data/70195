The intact zzso mouse zzso zzso has a theoretical molecular weight of approximately 96 zzso based on zzso acid zzso but on zzso gel zzso it zzso as a protein of approximately 98 zzso It is not known where the unusual primary structure or zzso modification responsible for this anomalous migration is located within the zzso acid zzso In the course of examining the pattern of fragmentation of zzso zzso receptors from Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells containing amplified mouse zzso zzso we have found a localized region in the zzso half of the zzso that accounts for this anomalous zzso zzso zzso treatment of the intact zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and containing all of the identified zzso zzso within the zzso We find that the only large resolvable zzso zzso zzso produced after complete zzso zzso zzso of intact receptors zzso with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 35 zzso Because the apparent difference between the theoretical and the zzso observed molecular weights of this zzso zzso zzso is essentially the same as the difference between the theoretical and experimental molecular weights of the intact mouse zzso zzso we propose that some feature lying within this zzso accounts for slower zzso Although the existence of an additional zzso site lying within the 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso domain has been zzso we also demonstrate that this zzso of the mouse zzso zzso is zzso in zzso upon incubation of zzso cells in growth medium containing zzso
