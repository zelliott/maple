The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso couples the reduction of zzso with electrons derived from hydrogen to the synthesis of zzso by a zzso mechanism using sodium zzso as zzso zzso but the zzso involved remain to be zzso Previously, the electron transfer zzso zzso and zzso were found to be involved in zzso zzso By inverse zzso we identified three genes upstream of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a potential zzso A zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and -C are located together with zzso and zzso on one zzso message, indicating that zzso zzso and zzso are also part of the zzso zzso zzso The genetic data suggest an initial zzso zzso of zzso by zzso To prove the proposed function of zzso the protein was zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso activates zzso to zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso The zzso has broad pH and temperature zzso and requires zzso for zzso In addition to zzso it can use zzso zzso and zzso as zzso with 50, 15, and zzso respectively, of the activity obtained with zzso zzso of the car zzso is induced not only by zzso zzso zzso and zzso but also by zzso There is no induction by zzso or zzso
