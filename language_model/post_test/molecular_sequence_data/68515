The region of the zzso of zzso zzso encompassing the gene zzso zzso zzso a general zzso protein of the zzso zzso system, was cloned and zzso zzso of the sequence revealed a unique arrangement of the zzso zzso In all other bacterial species characterized thus far, the zzso gene is part of a zzso zzso that includes the gene zzso zzso zzso I of the zzso zzso system; the zzso zzso zzso gene is part of a zzso zzso that is situated between two open reading frames unrelated to zzso zzso system zzso The gene immediately upstream of zzso codes for a zzso and the open reading frame immediately downstream of zzso although not zzso to any previously identified zzso contains a signature sequence characteristic of zzso zzso DNA zzso The product of the zzso gene has characteristics similar to the zzso protein produced by zzso zzso it has a greater sequence similarity to zzso of zzso bacteria than to those of zzso organisms, it is zzso by a protein zzso derived from zzso organisms, and it zzso sugar zzso activity in zzso zzso The high calculated zzso point zzso zzso zzso and the absence of zzso zzso in the zzso region distinguish the zzso zzso zzso from all previously described zzso
