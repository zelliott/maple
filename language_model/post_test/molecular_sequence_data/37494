zzso zzso A zzso has a zzso zzso activity of unknown zzso zzso We now demonstrate that this zzso activity triggers the degradation of the zzso membrane protein type zzso zzso a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is important because its level in the zzso membrane is a zzso step of zzso zzso defective in zzso show reduced rates of zzso degradation, higher levels of zzso and higher rates of zzso Restoration of zzso zzso activity increases rates of zzso degradation, reduces levels of zzso zzso and reduces rates of zzso zzso associates with zzso on the zzso membrane and zzso zzso near the boundary between the zzso and zzso zzso In addition to the well-studied role of zzso in targeting and protecting two zzso zzso we have defined a role for the zzso activity of this zzso zzso
