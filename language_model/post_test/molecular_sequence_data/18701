To develop zzso zzso for zzso diseases, knowledge of the molecular structure of targeted zzso hotspots will guide the production of zzso to inhibit and halt production of zzso specific attack zzso To this end we have identified three zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that contribute to the zzso sensitive zzso hotspot on the zzso termed the main zzso region zzso zzso zzso and zzso This region is the target of greater than 50% of the zzso zzso in serum from patients with zzso zzso zzso and animals with experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso Many zzso zzso zzso raised in one species against an electric organ zzso cross react with the zzso zzso zzso in several zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso a disease inducing zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso we have determined that two of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a complex providing the signature components recognized by zzso zzso These two segments zzso a third, zzso that seems not to contribute specific side chains for zzso recognition, but is necessary for optimum zzso zzso This third segment appears to form a foundation upon which the three-dimensional zzso zzso is zzso
