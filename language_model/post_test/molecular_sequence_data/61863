We developed a zzso of the intermediate sequence search method zzso for detection and alignment of zzso similar pairs of protein zzso zzso relates two query sequences by an intermediate sequence that is potentially zzso to both zzso The improvement was achieved by a more robust overlap score for a match between the queries through an zzso The approach was zzso on a data set of zzso sequences of known structure with insignificant sequence similarity to each other zzso zzso larger than zzso zzso of these sequences had a related structure in the zzso zzso performed significantly better than both zzso and a previously described intermediate sequence search zzso zzso could not detect correct zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso assigned a correct zzso as the top hit for 121 of these zzso zzso while incorrectly assigning zzso for only nine zzso it did not assign zzso for the remainder of the zzso By estimate, zzso may be able to assign the folds of zzso in approximately zzso of the approximately 500,000 sequences zzso by zzso with zzso specificity (1 - false zzso zzso In addition, we show that the 15 alignments with the most significant zzso zzso include the nearly best alignments constructed by zzso
