zzso binding protein zzso can induce zzso in human prostate cancer cells directly without zzso zzso and zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for the zzso actions of zzso remain zzso zzso a zzso zzso can be zzso and zzso to the zzso It binds to the nuclear zzso X zzso zzso zzso to zzso has been proposed to be required for zzso to induce zzso The present study tests this hypothesis in the zzso human prostate cancer cell zzso zzso cells express zzso and zzso is induced by incubation with zzso zzso A zzso region in zzso zzso zzso contains a nuclear zzso zzso and binding zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Different combinations of the 11 zzso acids in this region that differ from zzso a related zzso which does not zzso to the nucleus or bind zzso were zzso to the zzso zzso By zzso imaging, zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso diminished its nuclear zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso only was lost when all 11 sites were zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso did not transport zzso zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso that can bind zzso to the nucleus even after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso still induced zzso in zzso cells in an zzso manner as determined by flow zzso analysis of zzso V zzso We conclude that in zzso cells, zzso is not required for the nuclear zzso of zzso and that zzso can induce zzso in human prostate cancer cells without binding zzso
