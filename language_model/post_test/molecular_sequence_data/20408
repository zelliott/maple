zzso diversity of the zzso within the four zzso strains was analyzed by comparing the full-length sequences of cloned zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Because the zzso characteristics of four zzso zzso zzso strains were different, strain identification was conducted via sequence comparison of the internal transcribed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the ITS regions revealed that the four strains were closely clustered with the reference strain of zzso zzso while they were more zzso related to other common zzso species, indicating that they were likely zzso zzso zzso comparison among zzso from Korean zzso zzso strains revealed that similarities of the zzso and zzso genes ranged from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso respectively, at the protein zzso Their corresponding zzso sequences showed zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso the zzso gene had more zzso suggesting the presence of genes possessing different evolutionary rates within the zzso zzso zzso comparisons with other known zzso showed that the four Korean zzso were clustered together at the next lineage zzso zzso why two strains zzso and zzso containing identical ITS sequences and zzso display different zzso should prove zzso
