zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso containing both zzso binding and zzso zzso In both zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso domain activates the zzso zzso domain, generating the second zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso process is an zzso zzso zzso directly binds to a defined zzso module zzso sequence motif in the zzso and through zzso bridges the events of zzso binding and signal zzso These zzso sequence motifs are respectively represented by zzso and zzso in the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Through genetic zzso techniques, we now show that zzso in zzso and the corresponding zzso in zzso are critical for zzso and zzso zzso and other zzso zzso have minimal effect in the respective signaling zzso
