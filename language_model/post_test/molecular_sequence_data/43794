In zzso plants of the zzso the specificity of zzso rejection is controlled by a single zzso zzso zzso tube growth is inhibited in the style when its single zzso matches either zzso present in the zzso zzso Each zzso encodes an zzso with a unique zzso zzso are zzso into the zzso zzso of the zzso tract which guides zzso tubes toward the zzso Although it is known that zzso are the zzso of zzso specificity in the zzso it is not known how zzso information is zzso in the zzso zzso we exchanged zzso between zzso with different recognition zzso and expressed the zzso proteins in transgenic plants to determine their effects on zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso were prepared in which zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Among these nine zzso the entire zzso sequence was sampled by exchanging single variable zzso as well as larger blocks of zzso zzso The zzso zzso retained zzso activity and were expressed at levels comparable to control zzso expressing zzso and zzso However, none of the zzso zzso caused rejection of either zzso or zzso We conclude that the recognition function of zzso can be disrupted by zzso in many parts of the zzso It appears that the recognition function of zzso is not localized to a specific zzso
