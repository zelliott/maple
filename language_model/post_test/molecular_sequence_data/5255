To correlate structural features with zzso properties, a zzso zzso alignment was constructed using information from zzso and zzso domain zzso The zzso domain is composed of three zzso folding units, the most zzso and least zzso of them being missing in the most stable zzso The role of zzso in stabilizing the most zzso folding unit, the only one where zzso zzso with unchanged activity have been made, is zzso zzso in both length and composition of zzso zzso are correlated with stability and selectivity zzso Two new zzso zzso are defined by using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests an ancient bacterial origin for the zzso zzso zzso in length of the belt surrounding the active site, degree of zzso and length of the zzso probably zzso to evolutionary steps that increase stability and zzso levels of zzso zzso
