On the basis of kinetic data on zzso protein zzso the mechanical energy for zzso of the zzso complex is thought to be provided by zzso zzso of an zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso in zzso We have obtained zzso reconstructions of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso providing a structural basis for analyzing the zzso mechanism of zzso Using the zzso group as a distinct marker, we observe zzso changes of zzso that are due strictly to zzso zzso These movements are likely representative of native zzso motions in a zzso context and are sufficient to zzso the zzso complex from two universally zzso bases in the zzso decoding center zzso and zzso in zzso zzso during zzso zzso of these data provides a detailed zzso model of zzso that begins with the zzso zzso zzso motion of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso then zzso the zzso complex from the decoding center so zzso of the zzso zzso may be completed by a head rotation of the small zzso
