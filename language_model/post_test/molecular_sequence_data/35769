A simple zzso zzso test for normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso is based on zzso zzso zzso which allows the simultaneous detection of DNA zzso zzso with different zzso from one zzso zzso DNA was liberated from dried blood zzso normally used in zzso screening zzso by boiling in alkaline zzso A 138 zzso region including the site of zzso delta zzso which is present on about zzso of zzso zzso zzso was amplified using the zzso chain reaction zzso The presence or absence of normal and zzso zzso was then determined in a solution zzso using zzso specific zzso zzso zzso either with zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso A common zzso probe was used for binding the hybrids onto zzso zzso coated with zzso Some 5 zzso zzso molecules of the normal zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso molecules of the zzso zzso zzso could be detected simultaneously in a single zzso zzso The zzso was simple to perform and made it possible to reduce the number of zzso needed to interpret the sample as being normal, carrier or zzso with regard to the zzso delta zzso
