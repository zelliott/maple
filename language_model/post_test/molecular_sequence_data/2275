We have previously suggested that zzso zzso by zzso zzso II can be blocked when the nascent zzso is folded into a zzso structure followed by zzso As an approach to test this suggestion in zzso several zzso zzso with zzso zzso were chemically zzso and inserted following the zzso 2 major late zzso These zzso were transcribed in zzso using zzso whole cell zzso The transcripts of the synthetic zzso can potentially form zzso structures with zzso energy from 0 to zzso zzso followed by 3, 5, and 8 U zzso The results obtained show that zzso zzso is blocked by these synthetic zzso and that the extent of the zzso block is directly correlated to the zzso of the potential zzso structure and the proceeding number of U zzso Three levels of zzso blocks were zzso a brief pause of the zzso occurs when the zzso could be folded into a secondary structure or when there were 5-6 T zzso on the sense DNA zzso An extended pause occurred when the number of T zzso on the sense DNA strand was increased to zzso zzso zzso with a partial release of the attenuated transcript occurred when a stable zzso secondary structure zzso G zzso zzso zzso was followed by 8 U zzso The zzso of these in zzso results to the in zzso mechanism of a zzso zzso block is zzso
