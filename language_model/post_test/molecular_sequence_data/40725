zzso virus zzso is a zzso zzso distributed in Canada, the northern USA and the zzso region of zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso endemic to the western hemisphere, where it is transmitted mainly between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Deer tick virus zzso a zzso of zzso that has been frequently isolated from deer ticks zzso zzso appears to be maintained in an zzso cycle between these ticks and zzso mice zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from ticks in several regions of North America, including the upper Midwest and the eastern zzso The zzso of human disease due to zzso is apparently zzso Previous analysis of zzso zzso endemic to North America have been limited to relatively short zzso zzso We therefore assessed the evolutionary dynamics of zzso using newly generated complete and partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed two zzso zzso zzso lineages corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso skyline plots based on zzso data indicated no significant population size change for either virus zzso zzso zzso selection analyses showed evidence of zzso selection in both zzso Positive selection was detected in zzso sequences for both lineages and envelope sequences for zzso Our findings confirm that zzso and zzso sequences are relatively stable over time, which suggests strong evolutionary zzso and support field observations that suggest that zzso zzso populations are extremely stable in zzso zzso
