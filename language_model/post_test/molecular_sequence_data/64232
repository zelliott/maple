zzso zzso zzso and more than 200 zzso that zzso 24 zzso are collectively called zzso zzso These plants form a symbiotic relationship with the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The plants provide the bacteria with carbon sources in exchange for fixed zzso but this zzso exchange in zzso zzso has not been well zzso We isolated an alder zzso from a zzso zzso library by differential screening with zzso versus root zzso and found that it zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family, zzso zzso zzso was detected only in the zzso and not in other plant zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso protein is localized at the symbiotic zzso The zzso zzso was determined by its zzso expression in two zzso zzso zzso zzso injected with zzso zzso showed an outward current when zzso with zzso or zzso and zzso was able to complement a zzso zzso zzso coli zzso Using the zzso coli system, zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso with a zzso of 70 zzso for zzso It also transported zzso zzso and zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the first zzso zzso to be isolated from the zzso of symbiotic plants, and we suggest that it may supply the zzso bacteria with zzso as carbon zzso
