The zzso inner membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso is required for zzso processing of certain zzso and zzso proteins during their export from the zzso into the inner membrane or the zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso complex is composed of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso are thought to function in membrane association, interaction and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have zzso inner membrane zzso zzso and zzso to gain more insight into the functions of various zzso and investigate the basis of zzso zzso The results suggest that certain zzso zzso zzso in the second and third zzso regions of zzso and zzso are important for zzso of the zzso complex and for the zzso activity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso parts of the zzso zzso are important for their zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso a predicted second zzso segment, is zzso for the stability of zzso and zzso and cannot functionally substitute for the zzso segment of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site in zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso reveals the specificity of the zzso zzso In addition, we have identified zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a new zzso for zzso Failure to cleave the zzso precursor may contribute to the pet zzso of certain zzso zzso zzso is associated with the inner zzso and is essential for growth on zzso zzso Suggested functions of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso characteristics of the zzso sites of zzso and implications for the zzso of zzso zzso are zzso
