A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, designated zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso pile and was characterized by means of a zzso zzso Growth occurred with 0-3 % zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and at zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso The main respiratory zzso was zzso The zzso polar lipids were zzso zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain zzso should be assigned to the zzso zzso and was related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarity zzso zzso The result of the zzso zzso experiment revealed a low zzso zzso zzso between the isolate and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso analyses clearly indicated that strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso zzso
