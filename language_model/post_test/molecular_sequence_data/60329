The first gene of a family of zzso zzso with a specificity for zzso zzso bonds has been identified in zzso zzso The gene named zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso which releases the terminal zzso from zzso containing turnover products of the cell wall zzso zzso This reaction turned out to be essential for survival, since disruption of the gene results in zzso during the stationary growth zzso zzso to a zzso in zzso recycling the unusual zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso The dramatic decrease observed in overall zzso of the zzso is explained by the increased incorporation of zzso zzso They can only function as zzso and not as donors in the crucial zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso recycling is a promising target for novel zzso zzso
