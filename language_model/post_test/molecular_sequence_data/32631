Identification and characterization of zzso zzso are important for zzso the mechanisms involved in zzso immune responses in allergic diseases and zzso zzso While many zzso have been zzso little is known about zzso zzso inducing specific zzso following zzso In order to identify zzso from the zzso zzso zzso we generated an zzso B cell zzso from zzso zzso zzso mice and constructed a zzso zzso display library from zzso zzso We successfully cloned and expressed an zzso zzso zzso zzso that showed specific binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to the zzso of adult zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be detected in the serum of zzso zzso mice, but only for a short time and only following a challenge zzso In contrast, local administration of zzso during primary, secondary and zzso infections induced zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso amongst the high amounts of zzso total zzso low levels of zzso zzso responses are induced during primary zzso zzso Here, we show that even such low levels of zzso zzso are sufficient to prime mast cells in zzso and mediate zzso
