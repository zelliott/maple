The zzso zzso region of zzso rice, and zzso contains five genes in the order zzso zzso zzso and two A1 zzso in tandem zzso The zzso and A1 zzso are separated by approximately 20 zzso in rice and zzso and by approximately 140 zzso in zzso We analyzed the fate of the zzso region in zzso species of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso in the zzso region was interrupted by a break between the zzso and zzso zzso The A1 and zzso genes remained zzso in zzso zzso as in other zzso The zzso and zzso zzso also remained zzso but were zzso to a zzso zzso Gene zzso was duplicated on two zzso zzso and surprisingly, a zzso shared zzso much higher than that of the zzso copy to the zzso gene of other zzso No tandem zzso of A1 zzso was detected but zzso of A1 on a zzso barley zzso zzso was zzso zzso distances expanded greatly in wheat compared to zzso Wheat and barley zzso from each other 12 million years ago and both show similar changes in the zzso region, suggesting that the break in zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso expansion occurred in a common zzso of the zzso zzso
