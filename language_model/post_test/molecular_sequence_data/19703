The zzso of zzso to zzso requires a series of zzso reactions consisting of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the appropriate zzso with zzso is achieved by specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso has been previously shown to bind and function with the zzso zzso and zzso To decipher the sequence zzso of this specificity we have developed a quantitative zzso binding zzso based on zzso polarization and used this zzso to measure the affinity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning of the zzso binding interface identified four zzso on zzso and six zzso on zzso that contribute more than 1 zzso to the binding free zzso Two of the hot spot zzso from zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso but vary across other zzso To determine if these are key specificity determining zzso we attempted to induce a tighter association between the zzso zzso and zzso by mutating the corresponding positions in zzso to zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso had little effect, but rather a zzso at zzso position 4, which is not at a hot spot on the zzso zzso significantly strengthened zzso affinity for zzso This result indicates that zzso binding zzso are a function of both favorable interactions that promote zzso and zzso interactions that prevent binding with unwanted zzso
