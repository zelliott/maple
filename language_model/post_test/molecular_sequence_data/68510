zzso zzso extracts contain an activity zzso composed of at least two zzso protein components which bind to the zzso consensus sequence in the zzso of the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso This activity is zzso by zzso zzso even in the presence of protein synthesis zzso Although one component of this complex zzso is related zzso and zzso to zzso it nevertheless displays significant zzso properties which distinguish zzso from zzso zzso The second component of the complex, zzso interacts more efficiently with zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is increased within 2 h in zzso with T cells treated with zzso in the presence of protein synthesis zzso this increase in zzso activity is paralleled by the increased zzso zzso activity present in extracts of these zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso synthesis in zzso The zzso and the protein zzso nature of zzso zzso zzso suggests that this complex is involved in the earliest stages of zzso zzso
