zzso proteins were extracted from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by decreasing the concentration of zzso and zzso and the proteins were separated and zzso by zzso column zzso on zzso Ten proteins were zzso to zzso and three of these proteins were subjected to sequence zzso The complete zzso acid sequences of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were established by analyses of the peptides obtained by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso consist of 84, 115 and 95 zzso acid zzso with the molecular masses of zzso zzso zzso Da and zzso Da zzso A comparison of their sequences with those of other zzso proteins from other organisms revealed that protein zzso from zzso zzso is zzso to protein zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and tobacco zzso zzso as well as to protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not appear to be zzso to any other zzso proteins whose structures are so far zzso
