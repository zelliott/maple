Wood is mainly composed of secondary walls, which constitute the most abundant stored carbon produced by vascular zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms controlling secondary wall deposition during wood formation is not only an important issue in plant biology but also critical for providing molecular tools to zzso wood composition suited for diverse end zzso Past molecular and genetic studies have revealed a zzso network encompassing a group of zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors that are involved in the regulation of the secondary wall zzso program during wood formation in zzso zzso Here, we report the functional characterization of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso that are known to be master switches of secondary wall zzso in zzso In addition to the two zzso zzso and zzso two other zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be zzso zzso by zzso and zzso studies in zzso The functional roles of these zzso in regulating secondary wall zzso were further demonstrated in transgenic zzso plants showing an zzso deposition of secondary walls in zzso zzso and a reduction of secondary wall zzso in their dominant zzso Furthermore, zzso together with two other tree zzso the zzso zzso and the pine zzso were shown to zzso bind to and activate the eight zzso of the zzso zzso consensus zzso composed of zzso Together, our results indicate that the tree zzso zzso zzso and zzso are master zzso switches that activate the zzso sites in the promoters of target genes and thereby regulate secondary wall zzso during wood zzso
