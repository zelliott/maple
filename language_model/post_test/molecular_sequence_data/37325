A zzso zzso a putative African zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Multiple sequence alignment of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that the zzso had the highest identity with zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso sequence identity between the zzso and the African zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso analysis of part of the zzso gene revealed the presence of an zzso typically found in other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso and zzso as well as in zzso (the adrenal zzso in zzso Other zzso such as muscle, brain, zzso stomach, heart, and seminal zzso also contained zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in significantly increased zzso zzso levels in the absence of zzso zzso The zzso levels could be further elevated in response to zzso zzso salmon zzso human zzso human zzso and human zzso zzso zzso and human zzso however, were zzso We conclude that we have cloned a zzso zzso the zzso of the African zzso This zzso displays zzso activity but is still responsive to additional zzso zzso
