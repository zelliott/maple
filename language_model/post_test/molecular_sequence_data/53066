zzso dynamics simulations have been performed on zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso sequence of the zzso channel of the influenza A zzso zzso zzso channels, with one, two and four of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso were immersed in the zzso portion of a zzso zzso system, which provided a zzso zzso The simulations suggest that there could be two conducting states of the zzso channel corresponding to zzso containing one or two zzso zzso The more open structure of the doubly zzso state suggests it would have the higher zzso
