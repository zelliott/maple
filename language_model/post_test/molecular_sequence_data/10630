During a study of the prevalence and distribution of gastric zzso in domestic pets, a novel group of zzso organisms were zzso These zzso group zzso strains were initially distinguished from the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso by their cellular zzso and the type of zzso zzso zzso cells were only slightly zzso 5 to 7 zzso long, and zzso to zzso zzso wide and showed an unusual slow wavelike zzso Each cell had zzso of zzso zzso at one or both zzso zzso analysis by zzso zzso DNA sequence comparison revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, and the new group of zzso formed a distinct cluster with zzso similarity values of more than zzso These zzso were clearly separated from all other known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso group 2 strains are genetically homogeneous and distinct from other canine and zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso group 2 strains exhibit zzso zzso DNA zzso to each other, but zzso zzso zzso to the zzso related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose the name zzso zzso for the novel zzso group 2 zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
