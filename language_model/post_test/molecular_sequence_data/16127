We have identified two distinctive regions of the repetitive unit zzso sequence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso usage for the major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is distinctly different in these two regions, indicating that it is determined by the zzso zzso or gene structure but not by the zzso zzso Comparative computer analyses of zzso zzso in the unit sequence suggest that selection has operated on the zzso usage to zzso the secondary structure characteristic of the zzso zzso
