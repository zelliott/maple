zzso zzso (also called zzso zzso or zzso is a potent and selective inhibitor of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso During early clinical trials, in which patients initiated therapy with zzso zzso of zzso we monitored the emergence of viral resistance to the inhibitor by zzso and zzso characterization of primary zzso zzso Development of resistance coincided with variable patterns of multiple zzso among at least 11 zzso zzso acid zzso No single substitution was present in all resistant zzso indicating that resistance zzso through multiple genetic zzso Despite this complexity, all of 29 resistant zzso tested exhibited zzso of zzso zzso (to I or zzso and/or zzso (to A, zzso or zzso suggesting that screening of these zzso may be useful in predicting the emergence of zzso We also extended our previous finding that zzso viral zzso exhibit various patterns of zzso to a diverse panel of zzso zzso zzso Finally, we noted an association between the number of zzso zzso acid zzso and the observed level of zzso zzso No single substitution or pair of zzso tested gave rise to measurable viral resistance to zzso The evolution of this resistance was found to be zzso indicating the need for ongoing viral replication in this zzso These observations strongly suggest that therapy should be initiated with the most zzso regimen available, both to suppress viral spread and to inhibit the replication that is required for the evolution of zzso
