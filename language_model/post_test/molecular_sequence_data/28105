Although apparently inactive in the whole animal, the delta zzso genes from three species of Old World monkey zzso zzso and green zzso are all functional in an in zzso zzso zzso Their activities in zzso are similar to that of the functional human delta zzso A fourth monkey zzso from the zzso zzso is transcribed approximately fivefold less efficiently than the zzso This reduced in zzso activity results from a 20 zzso zzso which removes the normal site of zzso zzso When the deletion is repaired by zzso zzso zzso activity increases to the level observed for the other delta zzso We also report the complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso delta zzso zzso comparisons show that the delta and beta genes in the same species have not exchanged genetic information since the divergence of the human and monkey zzso zzso analysis of these sequences affirms that the Old World monkey delta genes are evolving more rapidly than their functional zzso Moreover, the rate of replacement zzso has risen to equal that of zzso DNA, as expected for genes no longer under selective zzso
