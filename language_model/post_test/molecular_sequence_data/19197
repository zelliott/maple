zzso resistance zzso is the most common and durable form of plant resistance to zzso zzso A successful example of zzso is the cloning of a zzso R gene zzso in rice and zzso its function in zzso bacterial streak resistance in transgenic rice zzso In order to understand the structural mechanism of zzso in rice, we built the model of the zzso interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein of rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, although a zzso zzso in rice zzso is present, it does not interact with zzso in zzso We have confirmed that the specificity of zzso interaction originates from the structured zzso rich repeat zzso domain of zzso zzso the recognition process, while the absence of such ordered zzso region makes zzso zzso to recognize zzso We zzso that the zzso complex formation is a three step process where zzso zzso shape zzso and short-range interactions play an important zzso The presence of the structural and zzso properties essential for the zzso recognition process zzso zzso to mediate zzso which the host protein zzso lacks and consequently loses its specificity to bind with zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the understanding of zzso in rice from the structural perspective of zzso zzso
