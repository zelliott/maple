zzso toxins have been shown to inhibit a component of gating charge zzso of maximum gating charge, zzso in native cardiac Na channels that has been identified with the zzso state kinetic zzso To investigate the role of the three zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in segment 4 domain IV zzso zzso zzso in gating charge inhibited by zzso zzso we recorded zzso and gating currents from human heart Na channels with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso All four zzso had zzso currents that activated over the same zzso range with slope factors of their peak zzso zzso relationships similar to those of zzso channels, although zzso of zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso zzso channels and fastest for zzso zzso zzso After Na channel modification by zzso zzso zzso of zzso were slowed to similar values for all four channel zzso zzso modification produced a graded effect on gating charge zzso of zzso channels, reducing zzso by zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso for the zzso zzso and by zzso for the zzso zzso only slightly less than the zzso reduction seen for zzso zzso zzso with these findings, the relationship of zzso to zzso was significantly zzso for zzso zzso than for zzso and zzso zzso Na zzso These data suggest that zzso toxins primarily inhibit gating charge associated with movement of the zzso in domain IV, and that the zzso zzso contributes the largest amount to channel zzso with other zzso contributing zzso
