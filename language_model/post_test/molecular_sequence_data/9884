A hidden zzso model for gene finding consists of zzso for coding regions, zzso sites, zzso zzso regions and possibly zzso It is described how to estimate the model as a whole from labeled sequences instead of zzso the individual parts independently from zzso It is argued that the standard maximum likelihood zzso criterion is not optimal for training such a zzso Instead of maximizing the probability of the DNA zzso one should maximize the probability of the correct zzso Such a zzso called conditional maximum likelihood, is used for the gene zzso zzso A new zzso zzso is zzso which finds the most probable prediction summed over all paths yielding the same zzso We show that these methods contribute significantly to the high performance of zzso
