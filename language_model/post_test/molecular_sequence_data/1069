Resistance to zzso drugs is a major obstacle in the treatment of leukemia and multiple zzso We have previously found that myeloma and zzso cells in transition from zzso log phase conditions to zzso plateau phase conditions export substantial amounts of zzso zzso II alpha from the nucleus to the zzso In order for zzso chemotherapy to function, the zzso target must have access to the nuclear zzso zzso the nuclear export of zzso II alpha may contribute to drug resistance, and defining this mechanism may lead to methods to zzso this avenue of zzso We have identified nuclear export signals for zzso II alpha at zzso acids zzso and zzso using zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso confirmation of both signals zzso and zzso was provided by zzso of human myeloma cells with plasmids containing the gene for a full-length human zzso fusion zzso zzso at zzso zzso acid zzso in the export zzso Of the six putative export signals tested, the two sites above were found to induce export into the zzso Export by both signals was blocked by treatment of the cells with zzso B, indicating that a zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso of two central zzso zzso in either export signal in full-length human zzso blocked export of zzso zzso II zzso indicating that both signals may be required for zzso Interestingly, this pair of nuclear export signals zzso and zzso also defines a zzso domain of the zzso II alpha zzso
