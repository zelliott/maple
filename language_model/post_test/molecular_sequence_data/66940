zzso factors often belong to zzso families and their individual contribution in a particular regulatory network remains difficult to zzso We identify and functionally characterize the pepper zzso zzso factor zzso gene isolated from pepper leaves infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression analysis of the zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso revealed that the zzso protein is localized in the zzso The zzso region of zzso fused to the zzso zzso domain is required to activate zzso of reporter genes in zzso The zzso transcripts are zzso expressed in the pepper root and zzso but not in the zzso stem and zzso The zzso gene is locally or zzso induced in pepper plants infected by either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso gene is also induced by zzso zzso and environmental zzso The zzso transgenic zzso exhibits a dwarf zzso indicating that zzso may be involved in plant zzso The zzso zzso in the transgenic zzso plants zzso enhanced resistance to zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso accompanied by expression of the zzso and zzso The transgenic plants also exhibit increased drought and salt tolerance during all growth zzso Moreover, the transgenic plants are tolerant to zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that the zzso zzso factor function as a possible regulator in enhanced disease resistance and environmental stress zzso
