We demonstrated previously that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is the least stable of three zzso and is the only zzso that is stabilized by zzso In order to understand how zzso zzso is stabilized by zzso we first sought to zzso the zzso that are responsible for the instability of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso contains four zzso elements zzso which are known to mediate zzso zzso We zzso a zzso reporter system to test whether these four zzso are responsible for the short zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that ARE elements in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso play a significant role in regulation of the stability of the zzso It is known that zzso mediate their effects on zzso stability through a number of zzso proteins that recruit the zzso a complex of zzso that degrades the zzso We identified zzso zzso as an zzso protein that may be involved in zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso
