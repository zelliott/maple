Our studies suggest that protein zzso C is involved in low calcium zzso zzso of zzso hormone zzso but not directly in high zzso zzso degradation of zzso to zzso zzso fragments zzso an important component of zzso zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to determine the presence of zzso zzso 84 zzso zzso and 80 zzso zzso in the bovine zzso and whether they could degrade zzso to zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso tissue using zzso raised against bovine heart zzso and zzso detected both zzso of zzso Western zzso of total bovine zzso cell protein prepared from primary cell cultures confirmed the presence of both zzso of zzso demonstrated by specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso was incubated in zzso with human zzso zzso and the zzso products were separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with an zzso with zzso sensitivity to zzso and zzso and peak areas zzso zzso produced a zzso peak from zzso which zzso with the major zzso zzso by zzso cells in zzso zzso production by zzso expressed as per cent area under the curve, increased from zzso in the absence of either zzso or zzso to zzso when a zzso zzso ratio of zzso to zzso was zzso zzso acid sequencing and analysis of the zzso zzso zzso products indicated the presence of two fragments of zzso in the zzso peak, zzso and zzso In zzso both zzso of zzso are present in the bovine zzso and zzso may play a role in the zzso degradation of zzso to zzso zzso zzso
