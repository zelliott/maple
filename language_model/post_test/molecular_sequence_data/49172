Blue flowers generally contain zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso which are formed only in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso gene therefore provides an opportunity to produce novel blue flowers for a number of ornamental plants missing blue flowering zzso However, our previous study indicated difficulties in obtaining good zzso of zzso derivatives in plants expressing zzso Here we report the isolation of a putative zzso zzso zzso from zzso bells zzso zzso and its expression in zzso Surprisingly, compared with other zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein with a unique primary structure that zzso high competence in the zzso of zzso derivatives (up to zzso of total zzso and produced novel purple zzso These results suggest that, among zzso H zzso zzso is the best genetic resource for the creation of fine blue flowers by genetic zzso
