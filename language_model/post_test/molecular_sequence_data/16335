The fast growing strain, zzso zzso zzso isolated from stem zzso of the tropical zzso zzso zzso can grow in the zzso state at the expense of molecular zzso Five point zzso impaired in nitrogen fixation in the zzso state have been zzso by a zzso containing the cloned zzso region of strain zzso zzso analysis of the zzso showed that one was impaired in zzso one in zzso and the three others in a new zzso located upstream from zzso and designated zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to obtain zzso insertions in zzso and zzso The four genes are required for nitrogen fixation both in the zzso state and under symbiotic zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was zzso The gene is transcribed independently of zzso and does not zzso to zzso recently identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the five point zzso showed that they zzso normal amounts of zzso zzso It is unlikely that zzso zzso and zzso are involved in electron transport to zzso zzso could be required for the formation of a functional zzso component zzso
