The zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso peptides were identified by zzso mass zzso in the zzso fragments obtained from zzso zzso without the zzso zzso to as the fully zzso zzso The presence of zzso prevented zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso The zzso degradation activity of the fully zzso zzso in the zzso system was significantly reduced, whereas almost no zzso was detected in zzso in the presence of zzso which prevented zzso of zzso and zzso On the other hand, the presence of zzso showed no protective effect on the zzso of zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso or zzso is discussed based on the zzso pattern and on molecular zzso
