zzso oxygen species, generated zzso and induced as a toxic response, produce several dozen oxidized or modified bases and/or zzso breaks in zzso and other zzso These zzso are predominantly repaired via the zzso base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso is initiated with zzso of oxidized or modified bases by DNA zzso leading to formation of zzso (AP) site or strand break at the zzso zzso zzso analysis by experimental and modeling approaches shows the presence of a zzso segment commonly localized at the zzso or zzso as a characteristic signature of zzso DNA zzso which is absent in their bacterial zzso Recent studies on zzso regions in DNA zzso proteins have indicated their essential role in interaction with other proteins and target DNA zzso In this review, we have discussed the unique presence of zzso segments in human DNA zzso and zzso zzso involved in the processing of zzso products, and their critical role in regulating repair zzso These zzso segments also include sites for zzso modifications and nuclear zzso zzso The zzso basis for their structural flexibility is zzso
