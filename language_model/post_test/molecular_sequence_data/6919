Using zzso zzso selection and zzso chain zzso zzso libraries, we analyzed the peripheral zzso heavy chain variable repertoire of three healthy adult zzso Here we report that most of the zzso circulating B cells expressed zzso zzso zzso By specific zzso family zzso we show that zzso gene family zzso in the periphery roughly zzso to the complexity of these families in the zzso and appears to be relatively constant among the analyzed zzso However, sequence data of clones picked at random from one zzso zzso library reveals that in spite of this zzso zzso the zzso gene expression in zzso circulating B cells is highly biased towards the expression of a limited set of zzso zzso As previously reported by others, this restricted mechanism is also found for the D and zzso zzso
