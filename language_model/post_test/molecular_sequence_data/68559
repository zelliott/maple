zzso zzso based on the use of zzso zzso to the class 1 outer membrane protein combined with techniques such as zzso zzso zzso remains the standard method of characterizing zzso during outbreaks of invasive zzso zzso We developed a rapid typing method based on the restriction zzso length zzso zzso within the zzso chain reaction zzso product of the zzso zzso which encodes the class 1 outer membrane zzso reflecting zzso rather than zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso of invasive zzso zzso obtained from October 1990 to April 1992 were studied after zzso and zzso Included among these were zzso from a local outbreak that resulted in a mass vaccination zzso zzso amplification for each isolate was followed by restriction zzso with the following zzso in the indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso different patterns were demonstrated on the basis of zzso whereas only seven groups were identified after standard zzso The most common isolate identified by zzso was zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thirteen zzso of these group C zzso shared a common zzso pattern after zzso with the five restriction zzso We were able to further differentiate strains of zzso with zzso type 5 from zzso types 1, 9, and 15 that occurred during an apparent zzso We were also able to characterize 15 zzso zzso which could not be zzso with zzso zzso Our method offers a convenient alternative to standard zzso procedures and is particularly useful in outbreak situations in which rapid characterization of zzso zzso is essential so that rational public health policy regarding preventative measures can be zzso
