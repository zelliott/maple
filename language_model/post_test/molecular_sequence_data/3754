The location and lineage of cells that give rise to zzso zzso during zzso has not been established nor has the origin or identity of adult zzso stem zzso We have employed an zzso zzso system to indelibly mark the progeny of cells expressing either zzso or zzso at different stages of zzso The results provide direct evidence that zzso cells are zzso zzso during zzso and in adult zzso In addition, we find that cells expressing zzso give rise to all three types of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso cells are derived from zzso zzso throughout zzso By contrast, the pancreatic duct arises from zzso zzso that are set aside around embryonic day zzso zzso These findings suggest that lineages for zzso zzso zzso and duct zzso are committed at zzso
