The zzso gene of a zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso DNA library by Southern zzso using a zzso zzso amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso method as the zzso The gene zzso a 36 zzso zzso whose zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity with that of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso acid changes between the two zzso proteins were zzso In the zzso acid composition of the zzso zzso zzso the number of Pro zzso was increased, the number of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso were replaced by zzso zzso by zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by Val or zzso These changes are supposed to stabilize the native protein zzso against heat zzso The zzso acid zzso in the zzso binding site of the protein and in the zzso interaction site responsible for the zzso formation were well zzso The zzso zzso gene has the ability to complement the ultraviolet light zzso sensitivity of a zzso coli zzso deletion zzso Thus, the zzso zzso has a zzso protein whose function will be common to the zzso coli zzso zzso
