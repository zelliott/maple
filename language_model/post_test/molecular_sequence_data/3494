zzso formation is generally characterized by the zzso of zzso substances that increase the natural color and durability of zzso Although there is evidence that these substances are zzso in aging zzso cells, little is known about zzso formation at the molecular zzso We monitored seasonal changes in zzso concentration across the stems of 23-year-old zzso zzso zzso trees by sampling growth rings extending from the zzso zzso to the zzso We also analyzed expression of zzso and zzso structural genes in these zzso In the zzso transition zone, zzso zzso was correlated with the zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We also observed correlations between zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso zzso gene transcript in October, January and zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes did not correlate with zzso zzso PAL genes were strongly expressed in the transition zone of samples collected in autumn, suggesting that their zzso in these zzso contributes to zzso zzso Western zzso showed that zzso of zzso protein correlated with the amount of zzso gene transcript, whereas zzso of PAL protein did not correlate with the the zzso levels PAL zzso zzso analyses revealed that PAL and zzso activities were higher in the transition zone than in the inner zzso in autumn, winter, and zzso Thus, zzso activity could be regulated mainly at the zzso level, whereas zzso modifications could zzso PAL zzso We conclude that zzso are zzso de zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells that are undergoing transformation to zzso
