We have used an zzso zzso gene tagging technique to generate new zzso zzso zzso that are defective in assembly of the zzso zzso zzso Among 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso two are zzso of the previously zzso zzso zzso one is an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and one represents a novel zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is of particular interest because it is essential for assembly of both the outer zzso arm and the outer zzso arm zzso complex zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso Beginning with the inserted DNA as a tag, the zzso gene and a full-length zzso were zzso The cloned gene zzso the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence predicts a novel zzso zzso protein with extensive zzso zzso The zzso contains three zzso direct zzso acid sequencing indicates that the largest of these zzso zzso to zzso This protein is likely to have an important role in the precise positioning of the outer zzso arms on the zzso zzso
