The human zzso for the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso a zzso zzso alpha chain zzso alpha zzso and a zzso beta chain zzso beta zzso Three zzso zzso of the alpha chain zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso tags were engineered and expressed in zzso zzso zzso Each zzso alpha chain was zzso into the zzso maximum expression occurring 72 h zzso The various soluble alpha chains were shown by affinity zzso labeling and competition with zzso zzso to bind zzso human zzso zzso specifically with an zzso of zzso zzso The zzso tag provided a simple zzso of the zzso from zzso medium using zzso zzso The zzso material had an apparent molecular mass of 43 zzso and was zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso association of the zzso zzso soluble zzso with its zzso resulting in the formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the soluble alpha chain existed with a significantly ordered structure consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Such analyses combined with zzso zzso suggested that zzso complex formation in solution resulted in minimal zzso changes, consistent with the suggestion that the zzso form of the alpha chain itself has minimal signal zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance studies of the interaction of the zzso alpha RED with immobilized zzso revealed a specific, zzso interaction with a zzso constant of 9 zzso zzso of an zzso cell line with the zzso alpha RED also zzso neutralized zzso zzso These data demonstrate that biologically active zzso zzso soluble zzso receptors are facile to produce in large quantities and may have therapeutic utility in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
