In this study we rediscovered and verified the presence of an infectious zzso and zzso necrosis virus zzso strain amongst cultured zzso prawns zzso zzso from 1993 in Australia on the basis of a zzso analysis with zzso specific zzso and sequencing of the resulting zzso A total of 7 previously published diagnostic zzso specific to zzso were tested against Australian zzso prawns and only 1 zzso a positive zzso zzso result with 16 out of 20 Australian zzso zzso samples zzso In comparison, all 7 zzso produced zzso zzso from the New zzso control zzso Analysis and comparison of the zzso zzso zzso derived from the Australian zzso strain zzso with other geographical zzso revealed that the Madagascar isolate shared the highest zzso similarity zzso and the Hawaiian and New zzso strain the highest zzso divergence zzso and zzso zzso The high zzso variation observed between the Australian and Hawaiian strains provides an explanation for the lack of zzso detection amongst Australian prawns with published zzso zzso and commercially available gene zzso as they are primarily designed on the basis of the Hawaiian strain zzso zzso indicated that zzso has been present in Australia for a long zzso and zzso time and that the virus is endemic in zzso prawns in the Australian zzso
