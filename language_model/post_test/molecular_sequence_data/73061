A zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso which showed zzso zzso zzso activity was cloned for the first time as the zzso zzso zzso from rat brain zzso zzso The deduced molecular mass of this rat zzso was 53 zzso and putative primary structure included several possible zzso spanning zzso At the zzso acid sequence level, rat zzso shared zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with already known zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso This rat zzso preferred zzso zzso acid as a zzso and its activity was strongly inhibited by zzso 4, zzso By zzso analysis of zzso cells zzso with the zzso for rat zzso a zzso band was zzso By zzso zzso the zzso protein was mainly localized in close association with the membrane of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The intense zzso expression of zzso was localized in the zzso zzso cells, the zzso body, and the inner segment of zzso zzso Additionally, very intense expression was detected in zzso zzso and zzso
