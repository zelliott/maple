zzso zzso in zzso zzso depends on expression of a putative zzso zzso zzso by zzso the last gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to an apparent zzso zzso determined with whole cells and severely slower growth on zzso as sole carbon zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso and subject to carbon zzso repression zzso by zzso and zzso Northern analysis of the zzso zzso reveals that a potential zzso structure located in the zzso region between zzso and zzso presumably acts as a zzso zzso as it leads to different amounts of the respective zzso zzso the zzso portion is very abundant, while the zzso portion constitutes only a fraction of zzso zzso has an apparent zzso constant zzso of zzso 100 zzso and is competitively inhibited by zzso with an inhibitor constant zzso of 16 zzso
