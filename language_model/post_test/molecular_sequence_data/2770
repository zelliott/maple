Using the synthetic zzso approach, we have identified a part of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso that is responsible for stimulation of T cell proliferation and induction of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso corresponding to zzso acids 1 to 27, zzso and 28 to 45, zzso Both peptides were tested for direct competition with SEA for zzso of SEA induced proliferation and production of zzso by T zzso Further, zzso were produced to the peptides and tested for their ability to bind to SEA and block SEA zzso SEA zzso but not SEA zzso blocked proliferation of human peripheral T cells and induction of zzso by the T cell line, zzso The zzso effects were specific, because SEA zzso did not inhibit the induction of T cell proliferation by the zzso zzso zzso with the direct zzso of function, zzso to SEA zzso but not SEA zzso neutralized the zzso activity of SEA on human zzso The data suggest that a functional site on SEA that is responsible for its zzso of T cell function involves the zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso 1 to 27 of SEA could potentially interact at either the level of the zzso or may block the proposed binding of SEA to class II zzso zzso based on recent data showing that these molecules are involved in zzso zzso
