zzso biology approaches often combine natural building blocks to generate new cellular zzso Here, we make use of two zzso elements to design a regulatory device with novel zzso The system is based on a zzso zzso zzso that zzso itself to generate a liberated zzso site and, thus, permits expression of a downstream zzso We connected a zzso zzso hairpin to the zzso and, thus, generated a zzso zzso that we call zzso Specifically, a zzso zzso thermometer zzso known to zzso small heat shock gene expression by zzso zzso and melting was fused to the zzso Following an in zzso screening approach, we isolated two functional zzso In zzso expression studies and in zzso structure probing experiments support a mechanism in which rising temperatures melt the thermometer structure zzso the zzso reaction of the zzso Since zzso zzso is necessary to liberate the zzso these engineered zzso shut off gene expression in response to a temperature increase and, thus, act in a reverse manner as the natural zzso Our results clearly emphasize the highly modular nature and zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso
