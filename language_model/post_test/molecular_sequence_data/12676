A novel crystal protein gene zzso has been cloned and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso The upstream promoter region of zzso was almost identical with that of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains zzso zzso acid zzso with an estimated molecular mass of 137 zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso with that of zzso proteins revealed that zzso is most closely related to zzso and zzso zzso has a high degree of identity with zzso in the region between zzso zzso and zzso sequence block 1, and with zzso in the region between zzso block 3 and zzso zzso inclusion zzso from a zzso strain of zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene was found to have a different zzso specificity from zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to be selectively toxic to zzso zzso and not active to zzso zzso
