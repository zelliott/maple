Despite the rapid zzso change that is typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the replication and expression of virus zzso contain zzso of zzso sequence zzso zzso with such motifs include zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The genes for these proteins form partially zzso zzso in large zzso of zzso A concept of the virus zzso as a relatively zzso stable zzso of zzso genes accompanied by a much more flexible zzso consisting mostly of genes coding for zzso components and various accessory proteins is zzso zzso of the zzso genes including zzso reorganization and zzso between remote groups of viruses is considered to be one of the major factors of virus zzso Multiple alignments for the zzso viral proteins were constructed and used to generate the respective zzso zzso Based primarily on the tentative zzso for the zzso zzso zzso which is the only universally zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso three large classes of zzso each consisting of distinct smaller zzso were zzso A strong correlation was observed between this grouping and the tentative zzso for the other zzso proteins as well as the arrangement of genes zzso these proteins in the virus zzso A comparable correlation with the zzso zzso was not found for genes zzso zzso components or for zzso expression zzso It is zzso that several types of arrangement of the zzso genes as well as basic mechanisms of expression could have evolved independently in different evolutionary zzso The grouping revealed by zzso analysis may provide the basis for revision of virus zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso viruses is zzso Some of the zzso derived divisions of zzso zzso viruses also include zzso zzso zzso indicating that in certain cases the type of zzso zzso acid may not be a reliable zzso criterion for zzso zzso evolutionary scenarios for zzso zzso viruses are zzso It is hypothesized that all zzso zzso viruses and some related zzso zzso viruses could have evolved from a common zzso virus that contained genes for zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that also functioned as the zzso zzso and possibly an zzso zzso
