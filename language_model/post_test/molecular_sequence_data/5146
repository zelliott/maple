zzso are zzso of the plasma membrane that have been implicated in organizing and zzso signal zzso zzso zzso a zzso integral membrane zzso is a principal structural component of zzso membrane in zzso Recently, we and other laboratories have identified a family of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso Here, we examine the zzso and zzso expression of zzso For this purpose, we generated a novel zzso zzso zzso probe that recognizes only zzso but not zzso and zzso A survey of cell and tissue types demonstrates that the zzso protein is most abundantly expressed in zzso cells, smooth muscle cells, skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells differentiated to zzso This pattern of zzso protein expression most closely resembles the cellular distribution of zzso In line with these zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso directed against either zzso or zzso directly show that these molecules form a stable zzso zzso The in zzso relevance of this complex was further revealed by zzso studies employing zzso laser scanning zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso 1 and 2 are strictly zzso within the plasma membrane and other internal cellular zzso zzso this pattern of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso as seen by zzso zzso Despite this strict zzso it appears that regulation of zzso expression occurs independently of the expression of either zzso or zzso as observed using two different model cell zzso Although zzso expression is zzso in response to zzso transformation of zzso zzso cells, zzso protein levels remain zzso Also, zzso protein levels remain unchanged during the differentiation of zzso cells from zzso to zzso while zzso levels are dramatically induced by this zzso These results suggest that expression levels of zzso 1, 2, and 3 can be independently zzso or zzso in response to a variety of distinct cellular zzso
