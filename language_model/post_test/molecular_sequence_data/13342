The signal zzso pathways regulated by zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso have been difficult to define because of the zzso observed when this zzso is expressed in different cell types by zzso and because pharmacological approaches are inadequate to distinguish zzso zzso zzso To study the zzso zzso in its zzso environment, we developed a zzso zzso to a zzso acid zzso corresponding to a unique sequence in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso routinely zzso zzso of the soluble zzso complex prepared from Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso of the complex from cells expressing other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also specially zzso and migrated as a broad zzso band on sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso The observation that zzso receptors from zzso zzso cells were zzso by the zzso and that receptors from zzso pancreatic zzso cells were not indicated that only the former expressed zzso zzso zzso Because reverse zzso chain reaction showed that zzso cells contained both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso permitted the zzso zzso to be separated from the other receptors zzso Two observations showed that G proteins were zzso with zzso receptors from zzso zzso First, zzso toxin zzso markedly decreased hormone binding in the zzso Second, the addition of 20 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso complex zzso the rate of zzso of bound zzso by zzso Interestingly, however, the zzso rate of approximately zzso of the zzso complex was unaffected by zzso In zzso we have developed an zzso zzso zzso and used it to show that zzso receptors zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells couple primarily to zzso zzso G zzso Furthermore, these receptors exist in two distinct high affinity states distinguished by their zzso zzso
