The zzso zzso of zzso coli is a paradigm for zzso membrane transport proteins that zzso free energy stored in an zzso zzso zzso into work in the form of a concentration zzso Although the zzso consists of 12 zzso zzso zzso in probable zzso zzso that traverse the membrane in zzso fashion connected by zzso zzso little information is available regarding the folded zzso structure of the zzso In a recent approach zzso zzso labeling is being used to study proximity relationships in zzso zzso The experiments are based upon zzso zzso labeling of combinations of paired zzso replacements in a zzso devoid of zzso zzso Since zzso exhibits zzso zzso if two molecules are within about zzso the proximity between paired labeled zzso can be zzso The results demonstrate that putative zzso VIII and IX are close to zzso zzso Taken together with other findings indicating that zzso zzso is close to zzso X and zzso the data lead to a model that describes the packing of zzso zzso to zzso
