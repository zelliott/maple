Diagnosis of zzso zzso in the definitive host is generally by microscopic detection of the zzso in zzso This method is insensitive and cannot differentiate between species because zzso lack specific zzso zzso The hypothesis suggested that molecular techniques provide better alternatives to classical detection of zzso zzso The sensitivity of two zzso zzso was compared to one another and to microscopic examination by conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso procedures for detection of zzso spiked into mice zzso zzso zzso using zzso & zzso zzso that amplified zzso zzso of the zzso gene was more sensitive than the zzso method using zzso and zzso zzso that amplified 334 zzso of a zzso zzso zzso gave positive results with 200 zzso of zzso suspension spiked with as little as 5 zzso compared to 75 zzso detected by zzso & zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive than conventional zzso zzso or zzso followed by sequencing or zzso analysis not only detected zzso zzso in feces but also enabled to ascertain the zzso of the species as zzso zzso
