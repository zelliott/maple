We have isolated the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and established that a zzso pair zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso reporter gene that zzso with the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso upstream negative regulatory region has been identified that zzso zzso negative regulation in a zzso system with a zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso I zzso identified several protected areas including zzso zzso and zzso response element zzso binding sites within the zzso core promoter region and zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding sites in the upstream regulatory zzso Whereas the zzso site was essential in zzso the negative activity of the upstream regulatory region in zzso but not in zzso cells, zzso of the zzso site decreased promoter activity in both cell zzso zzso mobility shift zzso analysis of proteins binding to the zzso site identified both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso increased the activity of both the core and the zzso promoter fragments, and this increase was zzso by zzso at the zzso zzso In zzso we have identified a zzso regulatory region zzso of the zzso core promoter that requires the presence of a functional zzso site within the zzso promoter for its zzso zzso
