The outer segment of zzso zzso is a specialized compartment that hosts all the signaling components required for visual zzso zzso to rod zzso is an unusual set of three zzso zzso proteins zzso as zzso two soluble forms, zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso part) of the B1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to interact with proteins at the rim of the disc zzso Here we characterized native zzso and zzso zzso from bovine rod zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso revealed structural features typical of zzso zzso zzso By using zzso techniques, including zzso zzso dynamic light zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso we showed that zzso indeed exhibit a large degree of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso showed that zzso exist in a zzso zzso The results suggested that the function of zzso proteins is linked to their structural zzso They may provide flexible zzso or zzso zzso the zzso zzso channel in the plasma membrane to zzso at the disc rim to produce a stack of rings of these protein complexes along the long axis of the outer zzso zzso proteins could then provide the environment needed for protein interactions in the rim region of zzso
