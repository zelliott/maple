Drug resistance remains a major hurdle to successful cancer zzso Many mechanisms such as zzso of zzso related zzso increased drug zzso decreased zzso and impairment of signal zzso zzso can contribute zzso resistance zzso Recent studies strongly suggest a close link between zzso and drug zzso To identify new targets involved in drug resistance, we established a zzso human breast cancer cell line zzso and examined the zzso profile using zzso zzso array zzso Among 120 zzso screened, zzso zzso and 13 other proteins were found to be markedly increased in drug-resistant zzso cell line as compared to sensitive zzso cell line, while 7 proteins were specifically reduced in drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso and zzso partially reversed the drug resistance of zzso to zzso and zzso while a zzso zzso against zzso had no significant zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso by zzso technology significantly enhanced drug sensitivity of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso or zzso expression by zzso increased the zzso resistance in zzso zzso Our data suggest that increased expression levels of zzso and zzso may contribute to zzso in human breast cancer zzso
