After zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso the zzso template is zzso by the zzso H activity of reverse zzso zzso generating a zzso zzso The zzso of some zzso contain sequences that could lead to zzso of their minus zzso zzso was prevented by zzso a DNA zzso to the 3' end of model zzso that corresponded to the 3' ends of the zzso zzso zzso from human zzso virus type 1 zzso type 2 zzso and human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso but zzso strand transfer to zzso molecules in solution was induced in zzso zzso and Hughes, zzso This zzso strand transfer involved the addition of a zzso base to the 3' end of zzso zzso that was part of a zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso A and C were added more efficiently than G and zzso Strand transfer to zzso in solution occurred only if the zzso base could form a zzso with the last base at the 3' end of the zzso If there was a zzso strand transfer did not zzso There was no zzso strand transfer to internal sites in the target zzso except to the second position from the 3' end of the DNA zzso when the sequences at the 3' ends of the two zzso allowed the formation of two zzso The zzso base addition and the zzso strand transfer were both affected by the salt concentration in the reaction, the nature of the reverse zzso zzso versus zzso zzso leukemia zzso and the sequence at the 3' end of zzso zzso NC reduced the efficiency of zzso strand transfer in zzso suggesting that NC may have a role in reducing zzso strand transfer in zzso
