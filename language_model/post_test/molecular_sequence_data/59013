The zzso surface zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso promote zzso zzso zzso outgrowth and zzso and are involved in growth cone zzso A direct binding between zzso and zzso has been demonstrated using isolated molecules zzso to the surface of fluorescent zzso By expressing zzso and zzso in myeloma cells and performing cell zzso zzso we found that zzso and zzso cannot bind when present on the surface of different zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso upon zzso capping of zzso on the surface of zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso and the selective chemical zzso of the two molecules in low density cultures of zzso root zzso zzso indicated a specific and direct binding of zzso and zzso in the plane of the same zzso zzso of the zzso translation by zzso zzso prevented zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso root zzso zzso cultured on an zzso zzso indicating that zzso outgrowth on zzso zzso requires zzso Based on these and previous results, which implicated zzso as the zzso zzso involved in zzso outgrowth on zzso zzso we concluded that zzso outgrowth on an zzso zzso depends on two essential interactions of growth cone zzso a zzso with zzso zzso and a zzso with zzso residing in the same growth cone zzso
