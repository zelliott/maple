The aim of this study was to develop a zzso chain reaction for specific detection of influenza A, B, and C zzso zzso Three primer sets were selected from zzso regions of the zzso coding for the zzso proteins and were tested on 61 influenza A zzso zzso 9 zzso and 30 zzso 11 influenza B, and three influenza C zzso zzso amplified products were obtained with all these strains after zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The specificity of the reaction was increased by zzso with zzso zzso When zzso acids from a variety of zzso from the respiratory tract were subjected to the zzso with these zzso no specific amplified products were zzso The sensitivity of the technique was found to be at the zzso zzso The zzso was applied to 21 clinical specimens from patients with a zzso proven influenza zzso Six influenza A positive patients and 13 influenza B positive patients could be confirmed in the zzso In two cases, influenza B positive IF specimens were found negative by the zzso No virus could be isolated on eggs or tissue culture from these zzso zzso is a specific and sensitive technique for the detection of influenza virus zzso
