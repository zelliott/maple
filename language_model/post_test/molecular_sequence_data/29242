zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso characterized by the presence of zzso zzso cells in the media surrounding distended vascular zzso We have shown that zzso zzso link to a zzso region in zzso zzso We also identified linkage zzso that allowed a narrowing of this zzso locus to zzso zzso zzso we report the identification of the zzso zzso zzso localized on the basis of the zzso and zzso zzso An incomplete zzso sequence for zzso had previously been designated zzso for zzso protein of 48 zzso The complete zzso for zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a predicted protein of 68 zzso The gene consists of 19 zzso in which we identified 14 different zzso zzso in patients with zzso In addition, we found a zzso zzso zzso zzso in affected tissue of a patient with an inherited zzso zzso Since all but one of the zzso result in premature stop zzso and since the localized nature of the zzso could be explained by zzso two-hit model, zzso are likely caused by complete loss of function of zzso The abnormal zzso of vascular zzso cells zzso in zzso suggests that zzso plays an important role in differentiation of these zzso zzso in vascular zzso in zzso zzso
