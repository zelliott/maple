zzso virus strains of zzso F have been circulating in China for zzso To identify genetic variation of zzso virus based on the complete zzso sequence of a zzso isolate of zzso zzso the complete zzso of the zzso F reference strain, zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso characteristics of this virus were analyzed and compared with the complete zzso sequences of others zzso available in zzso The genetic differences in zzso sites were also compared between the zzso F strain and the vaccine zzso The zzso differences between zzso zzso zzso and other zzso of zzso virus based on the whole zzso ranged between zzso and zzso The maximum and minimum difference was found between zzso zzso zzso and zzso A (the vaccine zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There were 26 zzso sites in the strain zzso zzso zzso and all other zzso of zzso virus, however, one zzso site was absent from the vaccine zzso which was at the zzso position zzso of the zzso zzso Variation was detected at some of the known zzso sites of zzso virus strain zzso zzso zzso and the vaccine zzso zzso variations were detected in the epidemic zzso virus strain in China as well as in other zzso of zzso virus strains and the vaccine strains across the complete zzso These results indicate the need to further strengthen the surveillance of genetic variation of wild type zzso zzso
