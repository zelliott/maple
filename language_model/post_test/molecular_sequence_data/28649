zzso syndrome is a rare zzso zzso disease characterized by a premature aging zzso zzso instability, and a dramatically increased zzso of cancer and heart zzso zzso in a single gene zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso have been shown to be responsible for the development of this zzso We have zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso that functions as an zzso This fragment, encompassing zzso zzso of zzso zzso exhibits the same level of zzso zzso activity as the previously described zzso zzso encompassing zzso zzso of the full-length zzso The zzso also contains a zzso DNA strand zzso activity at a zzso DNA junction and within zzso DNA, as well as a zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso We find zzso is in a zzso equilibrium in the absence of DNA when examined by gel zzso zzso and atomic force zzso Upon addition of DNA zzso zzso forms a zzso and interacts with the recessed zzso of the zzso Moreover, we find that the interaction of zzso with the replication protein zzso also causes this zzso zzso acid zzso region to form a zzso Thus, the active form of this minimal zzso zzso of human zzso appears to be a zzso The implications these results have on our understanding of zzso roles in DNA replication and repair are zzso
