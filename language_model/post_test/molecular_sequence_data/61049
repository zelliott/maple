A zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts closely with the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site zzso forming a specific zzso zzso To test if this physical contact between the zzso and the zzso region of zzso reflects a functional recognition of the zzso during zzso zzso we zzso the corresponding region of zzso zzso and screened the resulting zzso for suppression of zzso zzso in zzso All of the isolated zzso zzso not only suppress zzso but also zzso zzso affecting the second zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso was also tested in the presence of zzso zzso a predicted zzso of the zzso zzso As expected, zzso efficiently suppresses zzso formation, and the first, but not the second, step of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functionally interacts with both zzso sites at the later stage of zzso affecting the efficiency of the second zzso zzso The striking proximity of two of the zzso zzso zzso to the site of the zzso zzso suggests that some zzso contacts made before the first step may be subsequently extended to accommodate the zzso for the second zzso zzso Together, these results strongly zzso zzso in specific interactions at the zzso center of the zzso
