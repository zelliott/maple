zzso followed by lung zzso is a frequent complication of radiation therapy of chest zzso A hallmark of these zzso zzso is the excessive production and zzso of zzso zzso proteins such as type I zzso In addition to zzso zzso has been recognized as a potent zzso of collagen gene synthesis in zzso In this study, we analyzed the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso promoter by zzso in normal human lung zzso We provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to various sequences within the zzso and zzso zzso The regulatory function of these regions was tested by reporter gene analysis using zzso deletions of the zzso and zzso promoter fused to the zzso zzso zzso treatment of human zzso zzso zzso with zzso promoter deletion zzso resulted in zzso activity exceeding that of zzso zzso by zzso while zzso activity driven by the zzso promoter was enhanced by about zzso upon zzso zzso A combined action of zzso zzso and zzso essentially contributes to the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso An zzso site adjacent to the reverse zzso zzso consensus motif zzso zzso zzso is located within 205 bases from the zzso start site and seems to support the moderate zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso is mainly seen with the zzso zzso
