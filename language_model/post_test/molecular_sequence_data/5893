zzso of DNA is a prerequisite of zzso zzso and gene expression in many regulatory systems involving the assembly of specific zzso zzso We have investigated how the uniquely clustered Dam zzso sites, zzso in the origin of zzso coli replication zzso and their zzso status zzso the geometry of zzso and its interaction with architectural zzso such as integration host factor zzso factor for inversion stimulation zzso and zzso zzso zzso We note that 3 of the 11 zzso sites at zzso are zzso positioned within the zzso protected zzso zzso of the zzso enhances zzso binding and alters the zzso bend at zzso zzso motifs also contribute to intrinsic DNA zzso at zzso and the degree of zzso is modulated by zzso The zzso bend at zzso is further modified by zzso protein and zzso affinity for its binding site may be impaired by zzso binding to zzso within the zzso zzso Thus, zzso sites at zzso affect the DNA zzso and zzso in conjunction with the zzso zzso are critical zzso elements in specifying proper zzso of initiation factors in the early steps of DNA zzso
