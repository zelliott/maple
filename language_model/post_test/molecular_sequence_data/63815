To evaluate the influence of prolonged zzso culture on the zzso capacity of zzso zzso the zzso potential of four closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso for different periods of time, was evaluated comparing five zzso zzso Media with more alkaline pH values were slightly more zzso however, the composition of the respective zzso medium had only limited influence on the zzso potential, while a strong correlation of losses in zzso potential and times strains had been cultured zzso was zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that losses in zzso potential occur shortly after transfer into zzso culture to remain constant over many zzso
