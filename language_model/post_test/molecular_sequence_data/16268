The primary structure of zzso zzso zzso from rabbit liver was zzso The reduced and zzso zzso was treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting peptides were separated by zzso liquid zzso and zzso by automated zzso zzso With the exception of the zzso and zzso the complete sequence was established by means of overlapping zzso The zzso is blocked and thus not susceptible to zzso zzso The zzso composition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of other zzso zzso The zzso zzso of these zzso peptides on a reversed phase zzso column is also zzso thus suggesting also for the rabbit zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence zzso The zzso was demonstrated to have the sequence zzso by zzso degradation with zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso consists of 152 zzso and shows the expected zzso to other zzso zzso published so zzso The zzso and six zzso zzso known to complex the metal zzso are zzso at zzso zzso This also applies for the zzso zzso near the zzso which is supposed to direct the zzso zzso radical towards the active zzso of the zzso The zzso acid sequence of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso to those of other zzso in more than zzso of its zzso zzso From a total of 152 zzso zzso the rabbit shares with rat zzso with mouse zzso with horse zzso with pig zzso with cattle 130 and with man 131 zzso acids in zzso zzso However the zzso zzso zzso of closely related zzso like rats and mice differ in only five zzso acid zzso of their zzso A zzso closer zzso between zzso and zzso than between other orders of zzso could not be derived from the sequence data zzso Rather zzso and zzso are to be considered as two evolutionary independent orders of zzso
