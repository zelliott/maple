zzso a zzso primarily relevant for cell survival, and zzso a process invariably leading to cell death, are the two main mechanisms of cellular self-destruction, which are essential in cell growth, zzso tumor suppression, stress and immune zzso Currently, a potential zzso between zzso and zzso is subject to intensive investigations since recently some direct junctions became zzso The respective zzso interaction network, however, remains to be zzso in zzso The zzso acid type A zzso zzso protein zzso belongs to a family of proteins implicated in zzso transport events and was shown to be associated to zzso zzso Using a zzso display screening against the target protein zzso we identified the zzso protein zzso to be a potential zzso zzso In zzso binding studies, pull-down analysis, zzso zzso and zzso studies confirmed a direct interaction of both proteins in zzso zzso
