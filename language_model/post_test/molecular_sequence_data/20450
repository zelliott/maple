In the zzso cell, DNA zzso is achieved through its interaction with zzso zzso a zzso complex called zzso During zzso evolution, the different structural and functional constraints imposed on the zzso and zzso cell lines led to a unique process of specialization of the zzso nuclear basic proteins zzso associated with zzso in male germ zzso zzso zzso a zzso group of proteins which, since their discovery in the zzso century, have been studied extensively in different zzso However, the origin and controversial mechanisms driving the evolution of this group of proteins has only recently started to be zzso Here, we analyze in detail the zzso hypothesis for the vertical parallel evolution of zzso involving a zzso transition from a zzso to a zzso and finally zzso types zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the last one of which is present in the zzso of organisms at the uppermost tips of the zzso zzso In particular, the common ancestry shared by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso is discussed within the context of the diverse structural and functional constraints acting upon these proteins during zzso zzso
