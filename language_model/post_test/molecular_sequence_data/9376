Lack of zzso sequence data and the relatively high cost of tandem mass zzso have hampered zzso investigations into zzso such as resolving the mechanism underpinning globally reported zzso zzso zzso detailed mechanisms of resistance remain unknown for the majority of zzso zzso gene zzso and changes in gene and protein expression are proposed key aspects of zzso Comparative zzso analysis of drug-resistant and zzso zzso may reveal protein profiles reflecting drug-related zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as case study, we report the application of freely available expressed sequence tag zzso zzso to support zzso studies in zzso zzso zzso zzso were translated to theoretical protein sequences to generate a zzso zzso In conjunction with zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso zzso searching of databases enabled a cost-effective protein identification zzso The effectiveness of this approach was verified in comparison with zzso de zzso sequencing with searching of the same zzso protein database and subsequent searches of the zzso protein database using the Basic Local zzso Search zzso zzso to provide protein zzso Of 100 proteins from zzso gel spots, 62 were identified by zzso and zzso searching of the zzso zzso Twenty randomly selected spots were zzso by zzso zzso and MASCOT Ion zzso of the same zzso The resulting sequences were subjected to zzso searches of the zzso protein database to provide zzso of the proteins and confirm zzso in protein identity from both zzso Further confirmation of protein identifications from the zzso data were obtained by de zzso sequencing of zzso followed by zzso zzso searches of the zzso putative protein zzso This study demonstrates the cost-effective use of available zzso databases and zzso accessible zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso for reliable protein identification in zzso zzso
