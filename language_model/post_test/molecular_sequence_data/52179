A zzso gene from zzso zzso was cloned into zzso zzso in zzso coli strain zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso gene expressed zzso zzso zzso activity similar to that found in the native zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso exchange, zzso and gel zzso zzso and exhibited an apparent molecular weight of 80 zzso on zzso gel zzso zzso and 6 more zzso including zzso zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso indicating its putative zzso as an zzso zzso zzso The zzso was resistant to zzso by 2 M zzso zzso at 45 degrees C and active over a very unusual (for zzso zzso pH range, from 4 to zzso The zzso cloned zzso gave 4 closely zzso bands on an zzso focusing zzso at pH 4 to zzso The zzso 43 zzso acid sequence shows no zzso with other proteins in commercial zzso or in the literature, and from its zzso zzso appears to be a novel zzso unrelated in sequence to zzso from other zzso reported and unrelated to zzso from other zzso
