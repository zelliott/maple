zzso zzso receptors zzso are a family of receptors that have zzso and zzso functions and widely expressed by zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the identification of the zzso monkey zzso by screening of zzso zzso and zzso zzso libraries and zzso zzso We obtained eight different full-length clones with structural and functional diversity similar to human zzso including zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with truncated zzso tails containing positively charged zzso zzso in the zzso domain, and putative soluble receptors lacking zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso will facilitate use of this zzso zzso model for the study of the functional zzso of zzso including immune regulation through interaction with zzso zzso class I zzso
