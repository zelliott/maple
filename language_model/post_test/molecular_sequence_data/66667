The expression of 51 known genes clustered in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is organized as a zzso zzso class zzso comprises the master regulatory zzso zzso and zzso class II, controlled by zzso comprises zzso assembly and zzso zzso and class III comprises zzso and zzso genes requiring class II for zzso The expression of zzso is zzso throughout growth, whereas that of class II and class III genes is limited to exponential zzso A new zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso whose synthesis is confined to exponential growth, was shown to positively control swimming zzso No zzso of the receiver domain of Rem was required for its zzso Gene expression in tester strains with known deficiencies placed the zzso gene zzso zzso below zzso zzso zzso and above class II genes in the regulatory zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the Rem protein binds to class II gene promoters as well as to its own promoter, indicating that this protein is zzso An alignment of the zzso DNA sequences revealed a zzso binding motif of imperfect tandem repeats overlapping a predicted zzso promoter box by 3 zzso This new promoter was confirmed by mapping the zzso start site of a typical class II zzso zzso 5 zzso downstream of the zzso promoter zzso The zzso of zzso is under dual control of an upstream zzso class zzso promoter and a downstream zzso zzso zzso The central role of Rem as the zzso zzso zzso intermediate between the master regulator, zzso and the zzso and zzso genes is a new distinguishing feature of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso
