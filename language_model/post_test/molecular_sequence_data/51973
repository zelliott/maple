zzso surveying is a straightforward approach for identifying sequences in zzso clones expressed in specific zzso It has been applied to a zzso region of human zzso 19 zzso a region that contains several known expressed sequences including the locus for zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were selected from this region by probing a human zzso zzso library with a zzso zzso zzso zzso or human zzso clones were isolated from a zzso library constructed from a human zzso zzso zzso hybrid cell line using human repetitive DNA as zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso of specific zzso characteristically affected in zzso were depleted in repetitive sequences and used as zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso DNA from the zzso zzso clones was transferred to nylon filters and zzso with zzso to identify restriction fragments that were expressed in these zzso zzso restriction fragments were zzso zzso and demonstrated to be zzso zzso pairs complementary to zzso sequences were constructed and used for zzso amplification of zzso zzso from zzso of zzso affected in zzso zzso zzso products were zzso to verify the identity of expressed zzso DNA and its corresponding zzso
