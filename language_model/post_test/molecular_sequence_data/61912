As the limitations of zzso drug therapy, such as toxicity and resistance, become zzso interest in alternative therapeutic approaches for human zzso virus zzso infection is zzso We developed the first gene therapeutic strategy targeting entry of a broad range of zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso was inhibited at the level of membrane fusion by zzso expression of a zzso zzso derived from the second zzso repeat of the zzso zzso zzso zzso To achieve zzso expression and zzso activity, the zzso itself, the scaffold for presentation of the zzso on the cell surface, and the zzso zzso backbone were zzso This zzso construct effectively inhibited virus replication in cell lines and primary blood zzso The zzso zzso was also shown to bind to free zzso N zzso suggesting that zzso zzso C peptides have a mode of action similar to that of free zzso C zzso zzso toxicity and efficacy studies of this zzso zzso have been completed, and clinical trials are in zzso
