To understand how the zzso determined zzso polarity of the sea zzso zzso is established, we have begun to examine the regulatory apparatus of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that the pattern of zzso zzso zzso reflects the zzso zzso axis in that zzso is strongly zzso during early zzso in more animal zzso but not in those around the zzso specified vegetal pole of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso Development zzso zzso zzso Tests of zzso promoter function in zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporters define a regulatory region within several hundred zzso of the zzso initiation zzso This region is sufficient to mediate both strong expression in the early zzso and zzso correct zzso However, neither this region nor longer upstream sequences are sufficient to reproduce the zzso zzso after very early zzso stage that is observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso interactions within the regulatory region identify at least nine sites binding at least six different zzso These zzso elements include zzso (an zzso zzso zzso zzso and three unidentified zzso zzso and/or replacements of these zzso alone and in zzso indicate that no single factor is essential for zzso promoter activity, but instead that various combinations of zzso of these elements are capable of zzso levels of zzso similar to those of the zzso regulatory zzso This density of regulatory elements is consistent with the intense zzso of zzso zzso genes during zzso
