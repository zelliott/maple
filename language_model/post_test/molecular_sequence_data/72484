We report a bovine linkage map constructed with zzso zzso DNA markers and 14 zzso zzso and serum zzso The zzso map consists of a zzso X zzso linkage group and 29 zzso zzso linkage groups with an average zzso size of zzso zzso The map contains zzso new markers and zzso previously linked zzso providing a basis for zzso the four published bovine zzso Orientation and zzso assignment of all the linkage groups, except zzso and zzso was provided by 88 markers that were assigned previously to zzso This map provides sufficient marker density for zzso scans of populations segregating quantitative trait zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso selection zzso mating zzso
