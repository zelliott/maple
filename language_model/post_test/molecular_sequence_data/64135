The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso zzso with molecular mass of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso proteins of aging human zzso The experimental approach was to first separate the zzso zzso mass zzso zzso as individual spots by two-dimensional gel zzso and next analyze compositions of each zzso by zzso laser zzso zzso of flight and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins from zzso of zzso and 41-year-old subjects showed distinct zzso and zzso spots on two-dimensional gels, respectively, but the spots from zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed two types of zzso zzso in zzso and 41-year-old lenses, zzso the first type composed of fragments of eight different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the second type of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and two beaded filament proteins zzso and zzso The most commonly identified species in the complexes of 41-year-old zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three zzso modifications zzso zzso of Met and zzso conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso were observed in zzso fragment, and the first two modifications could zzso zzso Together, the results suggested that zzso zzso appeared early in life zzso 25 years of zzso and increased in number with aging, and the two beaded filament proteins form zzso complexes with zzso fragments in zzso
