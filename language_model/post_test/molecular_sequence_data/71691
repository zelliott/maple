The zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso which has specificity for both zzso and zzso shows significant zzso acid sequence similarity to the zzso zzso 2 zzso We constructed zzso zzso of zzso and used a three-dimensional model to investigate the basis for the dual zzso Introduction of zzso and zzso at positions 50 and 51, in order to restore the pattern of the zzso zzso did not seriously affect the specificity for zzso or zzso We show that the dual specificity probably originates from the loop situated around the position zzso to zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso in this loop in zzso alpha zzso compared with zzso and other zzso might orient the backbone to interact with the base A and zzso this zzso is zzso in all known zzso The zzso zzso the design of which was based on the zzso showed reduced affinity for zzso as predicted from the zzso Other zzso were intended to probe the integrity of the zzso loop, alter the polarity of a buried zzso and explore the importance of the zzso zzso Introduction of zzso to replace zzso which is mapped on the zzso loop, results in a zzso with decreased zzso possibly as a result of disruption of the interaction between this zzso and basic zzso in the zzso zzso at position 331 eliminates the last 60 zzso of the alpha zzso and this zzso has a reduced zzso efficiency compared with the zzso zzso efficiency is restored in the zzso zzso by the replacement of a potentially buried zzso at position 252 by zzso probably zzso to a higher stability resulting from the formation of a salt bridge between zzso and zzso
