zzso is a protein zzso zzso of the zzso family specifically expressed in T zzso zzso of T cells with zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso results in the appearance of slower zzso forms zzso of zzso To investigate the zzso sites on the shifted forms of zzso and to assess the role of protein zzso C in this zzso zzso cells were treated with a selective inhibitor of this zzso zzso zzso This inhibitor completely reversed the shift induced by zzso but only partially reversed the one induced after triggering with zzso To analyze the shift further, zzso was zzso from in zzso labeled cells treated either with zzso or with zzso zzso zzso were generated and analyzed by using a combination of thin layer zzso high zzso zzso gel zzso reverse phase zzso and zzso zzso We identified zzso 158 as a newly zzso site after zzso treatment and zzso 192 and zzso zzso in the major zzso zzso obtained after zzso zzso The three sites identified are located in the zzso domain of zzso this suggests that their zzso may regulate the interaction with other proteins or with other internal zzso in zzso
