Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 and zzso zzso were obtained from a previously isolated family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso to generate zzso and zzso respectively, both of which then serve as zzso for a final zzso step to yield zzso a prominent zzso zzso of zzso Neither zzso zzso the zzso or the zzso of zzso zzso indicating that prior zzso is required for efficient zzso to zzso Both zzso were zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso was shown to vary with zzso zzso comparison with other zzso zzso zzso confirmed that primary structure of this zzso type reveals little about function in zzso zzso Unlike previously identified zzso zzso involved in zzso production, these two zzso appear to act exclusively on partially zzso zzso zzso to divert the zzso zzso to zzso zzso
