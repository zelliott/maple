A rapid and accurate detection of zzso class II zzso is essential for transplantation and for the understanding of disease zzso Recent molecular genetic studies have revealed that the number of class II zzso and the number of zzso at these zzso are greater than had been previously zzso It is, therefore, of great importance to detect these extensive zzso A great deal of effort has been made on identification of individual zzso class II zzso at the DNA level, called zzso zzso What seems to be zzso however, is handling zzso Here we accomplished a simple method for zzso typing based on zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso to amplified zzso This method is called zzso protection zzso zzso By using 13 zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso lines and zzso from 80 healthy individuals were typed by zzso The results were completely consistent with those obtained by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso This method is suitable for mass screening because of its procedural simplicity and zzso
