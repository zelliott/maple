zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied using a novel approach based on the electron microscopic zzso analysis of zzso regions carrying DNA fragments of known molecular genetic zzso inserted by P zzso zzso zzso of such fragments predominantly into zzso makes it possible to clone zzso DNA by constructing zzso libraries from transformed strains and probing them with the insert zzso The transformed strain zzso has zzso in the zzso zzso on the left arm of zzso zzso This DNA consists of part of the zzso gene promoter fused to the coding region of the zzso zzso and is flanked on either side by P element zzso We constructed a zzso library from DNA of this strain and isolated a clone containing the insert and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso library of zzso strain was zzso with a zzso composed of zzso DNA zzso We have thus isolated a clone containing the entire native zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA was zzso and found to be zzso zzso with numerous regions of overlapping direct and zzso repeats, regulatory sites, and two overlapping open reading frames zzso
