zzso zzso differential display zzso zzso was used to identify genes that are specifically expressed by zzso zzso when it contacts the host insect zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso primer we identified a zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows zzso similarity to the well characterized zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are located on separate zzso Like zzso zzso is zzso as a large precursor zzso zzso deduced molecular mass zzso zzso zzso containing a signal zzso a zzso and the mature zzso zzso zzso deduced molecular mass zzso zzso zzso However, zzso possesses several zzso in the highly zzso sequences zzso the active sites of zzso In particular, the substitution of zzso by zzso is unique to zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is also very unusual, and we discuss the likely effects these changes will have on the zzso efficiency of zzso
