zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso occurs in all zzso initially but is down regulated in a zzso fashion at the end of zzso in a way that reveals the subdivision of the zzso before its derivatives are overtly zzso zzso is also expressed in the zzso of the prospective neural fold from stage 11, in a distinct band of cells surrounding the prospective neural plate, which we designate the neural plate zzso The deep and superficial zzso compartments zzso by zzso represent the prospective neural crest and the prospective roof of the neural tube, zzso zzso expression persists in neural crest cells during their subsequent zzso The role of the zzso promoter in creating this pattern of expression has been investigated by injecting zzso eggs with zzso containing the zzso upstream sequence of the gene fused to a zzso An element of 115 base pairs zzso to zzso relative to the zzso zzso is sufficient to drive appropriate reporter gene zzso The promoter does not contain a zzso or zzso box and does not have a high zzso content, but zzso synthesis starts precisely at 33 bases upstream to the zzso zzso The start sequence can be deleted so that zzso is initiated elsewhere without affecting the expression zzso The distribution of zzso promoter activity within the zzso examined using zzso zzso zzso is similar to that of the zzso zzso seen by in zzso zzso The contribution of elements within the zzso sequence have been assessed by comparing the expression patterns of zzso that have deletions in this zzso zzso from zzso to zzso are required for zzso expression and sequences from zzso to zzso are required for zzso zzso The zzso of the injected promoter zzso differ in one important respect from the zzso gene in that expression in an animal cap zzso is not zzso by zzso factors but is zzso by cells of the vegetal zzso
