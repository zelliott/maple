zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is produced in several cells and zzso zzso belongs to a large zzso gene family that includes, among others, zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso After zzso zzso becomes anchored on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso zzso There it zzso zzso in zzso zzso generating free fatty acids that can serve either as a direct energy source or can be zzso Through this action zzso plays a pivotal role both in energy and in zzso zzso zzso production is regulated in a zzso fashion by zzso zzso and nutritional zzso The recent availability of the regulatory sequences of the zzso gene will greatly facilitate these regulatory studies in the zzso In man, several zzso resulting in familial zzso zzso have been delineated at a molecular zzso The study of these zzso is not only very beneficial from a clinical point of view but also contributes in a major way to our understanding of the zzso relationship of zzso and other zzso In this review major attention is given to molecular studies relating to the regulation of zzso production, to the defects underlying zzso zzso and to zzso relationship of the zzso
