zzso zzso is zzso linked to the major zzso complex zzso class I heavy chain and interacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso class I heavy chains can bind human zzso zzso and zzso and such hybrid molecules are often used in structural and functional zzso The replacement of mouse zzso zzso with zzso has several functional consequences for zzso class I complex stability and zzso but the structural basis for this is presently zzso To investigate the impact of zzso zzso zzso on zzso class I zzso we provide a zzso comparison of zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is not affected by the zzso zzso zzso of the interface between zzso and the zzso zzso of the heavy chain in these two crystal structures reveals a marked increase in both polarity and number of hydrogen bonds between zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso We propose that the positioning of two hydrogen bond rich regions at the zzso interface plays a central role in the increased overall stability and zzso exchange capacity in the zzso zzso These two regions act as bridges, holding and stabilizing the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso enabling a prolonged zzso zzso of the zzso binding zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso in complex with either zzso or zzso provides a structural explanation for the differential binding of zzso to both zzso and zzso Our comparative structural study emphasizes the importance of zzso zzso at positions 3, 6 and 29 for binding to zzso and suggests that zzso hindrance by zzso zzso on zzso zzso the recognition of zzso by zzso Finally, comparison of the two zzso crystal structures implies that the zzso species may affect the strength of zzso recognition by affecting zzso zzso
