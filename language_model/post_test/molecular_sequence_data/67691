In this study, we analyzed the nuclear zzso zzso primary sequence and secondary structure in zzso and comparatively with 20 zzso zzso to test the zzso resolution of this marker and its suitability for molecular diagnosis at different zzso zzso zzso likelihood and zzso trees based on primary sequences were zzso with zzso zzso trees based on a combined model of zzso zzso zzso showed higher resolution below the zzso level, providing a zzso signal comparable to zzso gene fragments zzso times zzso zzso elements of the zzso zzso such as specific mismatch pairing and zzso base changes, provided further support for the zzso of some groups and for their zzso zzso zzso zzso folding is structured in six zzso zzso and shows five striking zzso zzso Two of them, the zzso and zzso zzso are common to zzso while the presence of both the zzso zzso and the zzso stretches occurs in five zzso of the two zzso orders zzso and zzso thus questioning their zzso zzso Our results validated the zzso as a suitable marker for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the significance of including secondary structure information for both applications at several systematic levels within zzso
