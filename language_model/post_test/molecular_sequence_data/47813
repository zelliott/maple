zzso evidence shows that the severity and zzso of onset of diabetic zzso are influenced by genetic zzso zzso of the zzso oxide zzso is altered in the retinal zzso in the early stages of diabetic zzso We analyzed the zzso distribution of a zzso zzso repeat within the zzso upstream promoter region of the zzso gene in samples of diabetic zzso In diabetic patients from Northern Ireland, the zzso zzso of the zzso marker was significantly associated with the absence of diabetic zzso zzso of this repeat had zzso the relative risk of developing diabetic zzso than zzso of this zzso They also had significantly fewer zzso and cardiovascular zzso The ability of differing numbers of zzso zzso repeats to induce zzso of the zzso gene was analyzed using a zzso reporter gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was most effective in zzso carrying the zzso zzso When cells were incubated in 25 zzso zzso to mimic the diabetic state, zzso induction was inhibited in all cases, but to a significantly lesser extent with the zzso zzso These unique properties of the zzso zzso may zzso selective advantages in diabetic individuals, which may delay or prevent zzso complications of zzso
