The complex zzso initiation factor 3 zzso was shown to promote the formation of the 43 S zzso complex by zzso 40 S and 60 S zzso zzso stabilizing the zzso complex, and aiding zzso binding to 40 S zzso zzso Recently, we described the identification of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso core complex in zzso In a screen for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an unknown gene corresponding to the open reading frame zzso was zzso When zzso the zzso gene product, named zzso was able to support, under restrictive conditions, growth of the zzso zzso zzso but not of a zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso was viable, but showed slight reduction of growth when compared with the zzso zzso Physical interaction between the zzso and zzso proteins was shown by zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso resulted in a synthetic enhancement of the slow growth zzso at a zzso zzso In a computer search, a significant zzso to the human zzso zzso of the zzso complex was zzso We assume that the zzso zzso protein zzso in translation initiation likely as a protein associated with the zzso zzso
