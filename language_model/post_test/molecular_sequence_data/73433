zzso particles each contain two copies of the viral zzso in the form of a zzso linked zzso zzso Earlier studies have mapped a zzso region near the zzso end of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso termed the zzso zzso which appears essential for initiation of zzso zzso as well as for interactions with the zzso zzso protein that are thought to target the zzso into nascent zzso This zzso zzso locus is proposed to be organized in four independent zzso zzso at least three zzso zzso and zzso contain binding sites for zzso and one of these zzso is implicated in zzso initiation through a zzso zzso In this study, we have created zzso zzso containing zzso zzso that affect in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or both, and we have characterized the effects of these zzso on viral assembly and zzso by using a zzso infectious zzso We find that various zzso which eliminate the zzso binding sites in zzso or zzso produce marked defects in zzso zzso packaging and viral zzso In each case, the reduced zzso content of the zzso zzso is associated with an increased content of spliced viral zzso suggesting that both zzso and zzso contribute to the discrimination between spliced and zzso zzso The structures, but not the specific zzso of the zzso and zzso stems appear critical for zzso zzso zzso of the stem or deletion of zzso also results in abnormal zzso zzso as assessed by zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso zzso carrying less extensive zzso in the zzso loop that are known to prevent in zzso zzso have impaired zzso despite normal zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso is not a prerequisite for zzso packaging but instead serves an independent function in the zzso infectious zzso
