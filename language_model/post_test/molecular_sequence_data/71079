zzso interactions between zzso zzso segments are important for folding and/or zzso of membrane zzso Previously, we have shown that most zzso zzso zzso of a set of zzso membrane proteins are structurally equivalent to soluble zzso zzso interaction zzso To establish a simplified model of these zzso zzso zzso we studied the zzso interactions of artificial zzso segments using different experimental zzso zzso an zzso but not an zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso in zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso was maintained when a zzso zzso type of zzso motif consisting of zzso zzso was grafted onto an zzso host zzso Analysis of point zzso or of a random sequence confirmed that the zzso motif of zzso mediates zzso of our artificial zzso zzso Further, a data base search identified zzso versions of this zzso motif within zzso segments of a variety of functionally different zzso For several of these natural zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso These results support various lines of previously reported evidence where these zzso segments were implicated in the zzso assembly of the corresponding zzso
