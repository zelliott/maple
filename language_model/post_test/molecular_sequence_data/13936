A family of zzso receptors is believed to mediate the recognition of odor zzso In order to identify potential zzso zzso we have applied correlated zzso analysis to zzso sequences from the zzso This method identifies pairs of sequence positions where zzso remain zzso or mutate in tandem, thereby suggesting structural or functional zzso The analysis supported molecular modeling studies in suggesting several zzso in positions that were consistent with zzso zzso Two of these positions, dominated by zzso zzso may play important roles in zzso binding and could zzso broad specificity to zzso odor zzso The presence of positive zzso selection at some of the identified positions provides additional evidence for roles in zzso zzso zzso groups of correlated zzso were also zzso Each group may interact with an individual zzso zzso and combinations of these groups may provide a zzso mechanism for zzso zzso
