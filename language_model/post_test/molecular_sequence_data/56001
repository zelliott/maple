A new search for zzso respiratory deficient zzso zzso has been undertaken in order to accumulate a large number of point zzso in the coding portions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso DNA which retains the zzso and lacks all the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I and of the zzso split genes has been introduced into a strain carrying a nuclear zzso zzso affecting the zzso zzso the zzso zzso which is known to prevent the zzso of large deletion petite zzso and this was used as the parental zzso After a moderate zzso zzso in order to limit multiple zzso 105 zzso zzso were isolated from 15,000 zzso clones in zzso zzso zzso were mapped to the three zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso gene (15 zzso More than 50% of the zzso tested still exhibited zzso translation products zzso I, II and zzso suggesting that they carry a zzso zzso rather than a nonsense zzso which would normally have led to a truncated zzso zzso in the zzso gene were allocated to four different zzso corresponding to zzso 4 and 8 or to groups of zzso zzso 1, 2, 3 or zzso 5, 6, zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso acid changes of the zzso zzso were located in the vicinity of the zzso alpha 3 zzso zzso zzso
