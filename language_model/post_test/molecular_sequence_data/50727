zzso zzso also known as zzso belongs to an emerging zzso family unrelated to other growth zzso We report here the first comprehensive study using in zzso zzso on the cellular distribution of this new zzso growth factor zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso not zzso and zzso zzso whilst no zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found in the nervous system throughout development, with a zzso peak of zzso In the adult nervous system, significant expression persisted in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in cortical zzso but also in different zzso cells types in various locations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells surrounding the zzso in sensory zzso zzso zzso was also found during development in the zzso of zzso gut, kidney and zzso zzso in bone and cartilage zzso in dental zzso in zzso and in several other zzso zzso was differently regulated in each location, but usually faded around zzso In the adult, zzso zzso was still present in the zzso the zzso the zzso cells of the zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso was also strongly expressed in the zzso layers of the tongue zzso which is the only zzso and zzso zzso to express zzso zzso and this only after zzso zzso is known to be a growth factor for zzso brain zzso and a zzso for zzso in zzso Recently, zzso effects on zzso cells and a role as a zzso growth factor have been zzso The mechanisms of regulation and the functions of zzso are however still zzso Its expression pattern during development suggests important roles in growth and zzso Moreover, the presence of zzso zzso in several adult zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso indicate that zzso also has zzso functions during zzso
