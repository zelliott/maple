zzso methods based on the zzso zzso gene sequence are used widely in microbial ecology to reveal the diversity of microbial populations in environmental zzso Here we show that a new zzso method using an engineered zzso and zzso zzso expands the scope of zzso sequences beyond those detected by standard methods using longer zzso and zzso zzso After testing the method in zzso to identify divergent zzso genes in previously cloned environmental zzso we applied the method to soil and microbial mat samples, which revealed novel zzso zzso gene sequences that would not have been detected with standard zzso zzso divergent sequences were discovered with high frequency and included representatives that define two new zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may reveal new dimensions of microbial zzso
