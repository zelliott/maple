zzso fluid was obtained from zzso zzso zzso wounds and analyzed for zzso growth zzso Two zzso growth factor activities were zzso a relatively minor one that was zzso from a zzso affinity column with zzso M zzso and a major one that was zzso with zzso M zzso These activities were not present in wound fluid 1 zzso after injury but appeared 1 day after injury, were zzso 2-3 days after injury, and were not zzso by 8 days after zzso The zzso growth factor zzso with zzso M zzso was identified as a zzso growth factor zzso activity by the use of specific zzso zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso with zzso M zzso was shown to be structurally related to zzso zzso growth factor zzso growth factor zzso by several criteria, including binding to zzso affinity columns and zzso with zzso M zzso competition with the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso triggering zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on a Western zzso and stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso is a major growth factor component of wound fluid and, since it is zzso for zzso and zzso that it might play an important role in wound zzso
