zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is a complex zzso found associated with tumors that appear and zzso on a seasonal zzso There are quantitative and qualitative differences in the amount of virus expression between developing and zzso zzso To understand the role of host cell factors in zzso zzso zzso I footprint analysis, zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and reporter gene zzso were zzso zzso I footprint analysis of the zzso region of the zzso long terminal repeat with nuclear extract prepared from a zzso cell line revealed protection of an zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso Additionally, three regions that contained no putative zzso factor binding sites were zzso zzso confirmed the specific binding of the protected sites and revealed three additional sites, zzso zzso and zzso not protected in zzso I footprint zzso zzso zzso of the individual sites, in the context of a zzso reporter zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites contributed to zzso zzso driven by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in an increase in zzso activity, suggesting the zzso site may function to bind a negative regulator of zzso zzso and zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso complex formation, indicating the presence of zzso and zzso in the zzso cell nuclear extracts and their participation in binding to the zzso zzso Interestingly, degenerative zzso repeats found in the zzso region are zzso protected in zzso I footprint analysis by the zzso cell line nuclear extract and zzso nuclear zzso zzso utilizing the zzso repeat probe revealed that there are similarities of binding with zzso cell and zzso nuclear extracts and that the binding differs from that observed with zzso nuclear zzso
