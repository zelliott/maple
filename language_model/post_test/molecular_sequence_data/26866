While a functional role for the zzso hormone zzso zzso in zzso has been recognized for decades, the identification of a zzso that mediates the action of this hormone remains zzso zzso reporter zzso were used in the present study to evaluate the ability of zzso zzso and other putative zzso to activate gene zzso associated with the zzso X zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells along with the reporter zzso significantly activated zzso gene expression in response to zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is indeed zzso zzso However, zzso was not activated by zzso zzso or other putative zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso produced zzso in response to zzso and this zzso was significantly enhanced when cells were also provided either zzso zzso or other putative zzso zzso This zzso among zzso and zzso zzso was not dependent upon the zzso zzso and did not correlate to a zzso response of zzso to zzso hormones zzso sex zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso along with compounds that are functionally similar to zzso zzso zzso with zzso to activate the zzso zzso zzso However, this effect appears to be unrelated to the ability of these compounds to stimulate male sex zzso
