zzso a zzso has been identified as the major zzso zzso in 65 European patients with positive zzso zzso food challenge results to zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso a 9 was shown to be a zzso zzso zzso in the United States, whereas preliminary data suggest the zzso transfer protein zzso as an important birch zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

We sought to recruit a group of European patients allergic to zzso without birch zzso zzso and to identify and clone the major food zzso in this study zzso 

We recruited 26 such Spanish patients, including 10 patients with zzso zzso zzso was performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a 8 was cloned by using a zzso strategy, zzso and subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso a 8, zzso a zzso and zzso a 2 zzso were further investigated by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were used to compare the zzso properties of natural and zzso zzso 

A zzso major zzso was identified in zzso zzso zzso sequencing, zzso zzso and zzso experiments identified it as an zzso The prevalence of specific zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso in zzso extract and zzso when zzso zzso was tested by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso extract showed that natural zzso a 8 and zzso a 8 shared identical zzso Only one patient had positive zzso to zzso a zzso and no patients had positive zzso to zzso a zzso Two zzso bound to zzso zzso The zzso was denominated as zzso a 8 and submitted to the zzso database of the World Health zzso Union of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso a 8 is a relevant zzso for a majority of Spanish patients with zzso zzso that can cause severe allergic zzso
