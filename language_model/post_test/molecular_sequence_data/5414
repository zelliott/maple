The structure of the fifth zzso domain zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso has been determined by two-dimensional zzso zzso binds to zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso and has been shown to have a novel zzso bonding pattern in a fully active zzso of zzso In zzso the zzso bonding pattern is zzso zzso while zzso has an zzso zzso zzso The structure of this novel domain, determined from zzso zzso distance zzso appears to have zzso from the common zzso zzso zzso of the 14 zzso structures of zzso gives an overall zzso of zzso A for the backbone zzso The central zzso zzso common to all zzso zzso is not present in zzso The A loop, zzso zzso to zzso is twisted away from interacting with the B loop, zzso zzso to zzso as in zzso and is close to the C loop, zzso zzso to zzso This twist causes the N and C zzso to be closer together in zzso than in zzso Most of the zzso that are important for activity lie on one face of the zzso which is likely to be the zzso surface of the zzso The structure of the C loop within the domain, which is a zzso similar to zzso is similar to the structure of a synthetic version of the loop bound to zzso as determined by transferred zzso zzso Despite the similarity in the structures of the zzso the zzso immediately following zzso are in different positions in the two structures suggesting that these zzso zzso may change zzso upon zzso zzso
