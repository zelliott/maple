zzso are zzso produced by the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and are associated with cancer in zzso In this study, we determined the zzso sequence of a zzso region of zzso zzso DNA and identified 18 zzso zzso genes zzso a cluster of five previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten of the newly identified genes downstream of the cluster were zzso with zzso genes and exhibited patterns of expression that were correlated with zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the predicted functions of proteins zzso by the 10 genes were consistent with activities expected for zzso zzso or zzso These data indicate that the 10 newly identified genes and the previously identified zzso genes constitute a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of two of the new zzso zzso longevity assurance factors, had no apparent effect on zzso production, but disruption of a third, zzso an ABC zzso had a subtle effect on ratios of zzso zzso
