Previously, we identified the rat zzso nuclear type II zzso binding site as zzso zzso and an unknown 35 zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso Studies using calf zzso zzso indicated that the 35 zzso protein was likely a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Further study of the type II site required methodology for producing sufficient quantities of zzso zzso which retained zzso zzso A variety of production methods produce sufficient quantities of zzso for binding analyses were evaluated prior to finding a successful zzso The present studies describe techniques for the production of zzso zzso that retain the zzso binding properties of type II binding zzso zzso studies with zzso protein mirrored zzso binding zzso with rat zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso specifically binds zzso with a low affinity zzso approximately 20 zzso and in a cooperative fashion zzso zzso zzso Hill zzso approximately zzso Although zzso zzso does not appear to bind zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pair produced a 35 zzso protein equivalent to the 35 zzso protein labeled with zzso in rat zzso nuclear extracts and calf zzso zzso These data confirm the identification of zzso zzso as a key component of the type II zzso Future studies with zzso proteins will lead to the identification of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and related zzso and zzso of their zzso control of gene expression and cell zzso
