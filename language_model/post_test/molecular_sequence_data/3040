zzso novel and known genes that are zzso expressed in breast cancer has important implications in understanding the biology of breast zzso and developing new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso In this study we have combined two powerful technologies, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a high zzso methodology designed to identify zzso clones that are breast zzso and zzso and are zzso in breast zzso zzso 2000 zzso clones generated from the zzso breast tumor library were arrayed on the zzso zzso The arrayed target zzso were then zzso with 30 pairs of zzso zzso zzso generated from breast tumors and normal zzso to determine the tissue distribution and tumor zzso zzso clones showing zzso in breast tumors by zzso were further zzso by DNA sequencing, zzso and zzso database searches, and quantitative real time zzso We identified several known zzso including zzso zzso 19, zzso and zzso type II zzso which have previously been shown to be zzso in breast tumors and may play an important role in the zzso of zzso We also discovered zzso which appears to be an zzso of zzso a breast zzso zzso Two additional clones discovered, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were not previously described for their zzso profile in breast zzso Thus, combining zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso allowed for an efficient way to identify and validate genes with elevated zzso expression levels in breast cancer that may potentially be involved in breast cancer zzso These zzso expressed genes may be of potential utility as therapeutic and diagnostic targets for breast zzso
