The tolerance of mismatched zzso between the cohesive ends of insert and target zzso in gene cloning has been zzso An zzso duplex with a cohesive end zzso or variation was zzso to the zzso end of a zzso zzso The zzso mixture was used in the transformation of zzso zzso A zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated in the cloning of the zzso duplex, with efficiency lower than the fully complementary zzso zzso mismatch zzso or zzso resulted in further decrease of cloning zzso Via a similar approach, a zzso resistance gene was successfully inserted into a zzso zzso
