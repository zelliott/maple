zzso zzso in zzso have a reduced affinity for DNA and a reduced ability to induce zzso We describe a zzso with the opposite zzso an increased affinity for some zzso sites and an increased ability to induce zzso The zzso function requires zzso zzso by zzso The zzso has an altered sequence specificity and selectively fails to activate zzso zzso Loss of zzso feedback results in zzso of the zzso but the zzso kills better than zzso zzso even in zzso zzso Thus the zzso zzso is due to a combination of decreased zzso feedback control and increased or unbalanced expression of other zzso zzso target zzso To identify these zzso DNA chips were screened using zzso from cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Two potential new zzso of zzso zzso were identified, zzso and zzso which are induced better by zzso than zzso zzso and not induced by zzso The zzso zzso kills zzso zzso but not zzso mouse zzso zzso and kills zzso cells irrespective of zzso zzso It may thus expand the range of zzso which can be treated by zzso gene zzso
