A zzso zzso the human zzso acid zzso zzso beta 2 zzso has been cloned and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso shows only a single zzso acid change from the rat sequence zzso in zzso zzso in zzso Using zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso products from human zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid zzso the gene has been assigned to human zzso zzso By expressing zzso human zzso receptors containing different beta zzso zzso 1, beta 2 or beta 3) in both zzso cells and zzso zzso we have been able to determine the influence of the beta zzso on the pharmacology of the zzso For a number of zzso binding site compounds, a zzso and several zzso neither the affinity nor the efficacy of the compounds is influenced by the type of beta zzso present in the zzso zzso These data suggest that the beta zzso does not significantly influence the zzso zzso or zzso site zzso of human zzso zzso zzso
