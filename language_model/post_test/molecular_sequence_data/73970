Two zzso important bacteria in marine pulp mill zzso enrichment cultures were zzso These organisms were zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso produced zzso zzso for the breakdown of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It also zzso a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso and volatile fatty acids for zzso zzso zzso did not zzso natural zzso but it could grow on a variety of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It also zzso methanol and aromatic zzso The surfaces of both organisms were covered by zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses placed both organisms in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso They were related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso although a close association with any of these bacteria was not zzso The zzso contents of strain zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso these zzso were different enough so that they could be considered members of new zzso Thus, the following two new zzso and species are zzso zzso zzso with type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
