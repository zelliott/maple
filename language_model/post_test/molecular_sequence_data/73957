The zzso zzso inactive specific zzso gene plays an essential role in X zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms controlling zzso expression and X zzso we examined in zzso zzso interactions in the zzso promoter region in a female mouse cell line zzso which has distinguishable zzso zzso In zzso zzso was accomplished by treatment of cells with zzso zzso or ultraviolet light, followed by zzso zzso chain reaction of zzso zzso The expressed zzso on the inactive X zzso and the silent zzso on the active X zzso were separated by the use of a restriction zzso length zzso prior to zzso zzso chain zzso The zzso structure of the zzso promoter was found to be consistent with the activity state of the zzso zzso The silent zzso (on the active X zzso showed no zzso while the expressed zzso (on the inactive X zzso showed zzso at a consensus sequence for a zzso box, two weak zzso sites, and a weak zzso zzso
