The membrane fusion process zzso by the zzso zzso envelope zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso was addressed by a flow zzso zzso detecting exchanges of fluorescent membrane zzso zzso and zzso between cells expressing the zzso envelope proteins zzso and target zzso zzso cells were detected when target cells expressed the type of zzso zzso zzso or zzso matching the type of zzso surface envelope zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso cells were observed when the zzso interaction was blocked by zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso repeat zzso of zzso resulted in parallel zzso of the formation of zzso and zzso cells, indicating that zzso had a direct role in the exchange of fluorescent zzso In contrast, three zzso in the loop region of the zzso zzso located on either side of the zzso motif zzso M and zzso or at the zzso end of zzso zzso had limited or no apparent effect on membrane zzso mixing between zzso and target cells, while they blocked formation of zzso and markedly reduced the exchanges of zzso fluorescent zzso The loop region could therefore have a direct or indirect role in events occurring after the merging of zzso such as the formation or zzso of fusion zzso Two types of zzso of zzso entry, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso had limited effects on membrane exchanges at zzso blocking or markedly reducing zzso zzso This finding confirmed that zzso can inhibit the late steps of membrane fusion zzso zzso and brought forth an indirect argument for the role of the zzso loop region in these steps, as zzso zzso resistance to zzso were mapped in this region zzso or zzso
