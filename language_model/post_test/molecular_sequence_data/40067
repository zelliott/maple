zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the metabolism of, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have reported earlier zzso zzso of brain zzso system in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the structural and functional properties of zzso zzso and the distribution of zzso zzso and activity in zzso zzso The gene is located in zzso 9 and consists of 15 zzso The zzso acid composition of the active center resembles both human zzso and zzso The zzso displayed the highest zzso specificity for zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocked the activity of the zzso with equal zzso zzso zzso zzso which was present in several zzso and zzso displayed differential distribution in the zzso zzso cell clusters had low to moderate levels of zzso activity, whereas the highest levels of zzso activity were detected in zzso and zzso cell groups and the zzso pathway, including its zzso projection to the zzso zzso zzso The results of this study confirm the presence of functionally active zzso in zzso brain and other zzso and characterize the neural systems that express zzso and areas of intense activity in the zzso They also suggest that zzso toxicity not related to zzso may affect the zzso zzso
