zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to positions 4 and 6 respectively of the zzso zzso of zzso We showed previously that zzso zzso from rat zzso and zzso zzso both transfer zzso efficiently to position 4 of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here the specificity of zzso and zzso in terms of zzso acid zzso recognition around the zzso zzso to which zzso is zzso When zzso formed from zzso after incubation with zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso a major part of the zzso was recovered in zzso zzso and the remainder distributed to zzso and larger zzso indicating that zzso mainly transferred zzso to position 4 of the zzso zzso located at the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and larger zzso zzso indicated that zzso mainly transferred zzso to the zzso zzso adjacent to the reducing side of the zzso zzso On the other hand, when zzso formed from zzso after incubation with zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso a major part of the zzso was recovered in zzso larger than zzso indicating that zzso transferred zzso to the zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and larger zzso zzso indicated that zzso showed very little preference for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso differ from each other in the recognition of zzso acid zzso adjacent to the targeted zzso zzso
