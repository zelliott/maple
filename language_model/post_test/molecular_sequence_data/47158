zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains carry a zzso island zzso which mediates zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso in sequence and organization, while the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso differs zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was completed and compared to that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A common zzso region zzso content, zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso between zzso zzso This region carries genes for zzso zzso regulation, and zzso and thus can be considered the functional zzso of the zzso In contrast, the second part of the zzso is AT rich and completely different in two evolutionary lineages of the zzso being zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The variable part acquired one zzso element in the zzso zzso and accumulated four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso ERIC sequence zzso the structure of the promoter of the zzso zzso regulator in the zzso zzso In contrast to the precise zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso suffers imprecise zzso The zzso zzso is zzso integrated in one of the three zzso zzso copies in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso probably due to zzso of the putative zzso The zzso zzso of the 3' end of the zzso zzso are present in both zzso zzso The zzso attachment site is unoccupied in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is a composite and widely spread zzso element with a highly zzso zzso functional zzso and a zzso evolved variable zzso
