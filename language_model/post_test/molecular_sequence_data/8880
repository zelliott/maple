zzso zzso B zzso has been often detected in zzso of zzso and weaned zzso Because it is difficult to serially cultivate zzso in cell culture, the number of available sequence data for zzso segments other than zzso and zzso in especially zzso zzso is still zzso We performed genetic analysis focusing on zzso protein 2 zzso using several zzso zzso zzso which were detected in zzso feces collected around Japan during zzso zzso of zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences from zzso zzso strains exhibited low identities zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso to those of other zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed the presence of four clusters zzso including human plus zzso bovine and zzso clusters with zzso values of zzso at the zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso genes of zzso zzso were divided into three zzso of which some zzso zzso belonged into zzso zzso and zzso which belonged to same pig farm, might be identical in zzso gene as shown sequence identity of zzso nevertheless both had different zzso genes each zzso Thus, this data demonstrates the occurrence of gene zzso among zzso zzso derived from same pig zzso Our findings presented here would provide more valuable information to zzso evolution of zzso
