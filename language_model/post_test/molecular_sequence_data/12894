zzso into the zzso gene locus by the zzso zzso zzso zzso had been observed in distinct tumor cell zzso We analyzed the locus in zzso from 7 different zzso leukemia cell strains which were originally generated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso mice at a dose of 3 zzso and maintained by in zzso zzso In one leukemia cell strain out of 7 such cases, zzso of an zzso of the zzso gene was zzso zzso analysis after cloning from the zzso library showed that a type I delta 2 zzso element was inserted in the region upstream of the zzso gene in the head-to-head zzso This suggests that the locus in zzso cells is sensitive for integration of zzso zzso Additionally, an unusual long target zzso of 82 zzso zzso larger than normal one, was found at the junction of the zzso This suggests the possibility of a zzso integration mechanism which is distinct from normal zzso
