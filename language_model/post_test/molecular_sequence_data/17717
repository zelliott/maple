zzso DNA zzso is zzso cells is represented not only as zzso DNA but also as circular DNA existing both in the nucleus and in the zzso According to its size zzso could be divided into two major zzso small zzso circular zzso and large circular zzso Small zzso circular zzso sized from 150 to 20,000 base pair are found both in the nucleus and in the zzso Large circular zzso from 150,000 to 900,000 base pair are found in the nucleus zzso Small zzso circular zzso contain mainly repetitive sequences but occasionally they may contain very low repetitive sequences or unique zzso Such sequences may result from zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso or fragmentation of zzso DNA by zzso zzso Large circular zzso are known to consist mainly of amplified sequences of zzso or zzso zzso which result from the deletion of appropriate regions of zzso The number of copies of zzso is greater in the zzso cells and in cells at certain stages of zzso The increase in copy number of zzso reflects the intensity of processes in the zzso zzso replication of small and large circular zzso is evident in tumor cells, although not all zzso can replicate zzso The presence in tumor cells of zzso molecules of zzso which are distributed in daughter cells independently of zzso DNA, determines presumably the high rate of zzso of these cells to environmental conditions zzso and resistance to zzso zzso It is quite possible that the existence of amplified copies of zzso and some other genes in the form of zzso can determine some zzso characteristics of the transformed zzso
