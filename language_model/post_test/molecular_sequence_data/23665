zzso zzso bacteria that are zzso zzso and zzso positive are regularly isolated from the airways of horses with clinical signs of respiratory zzso On the basis of the findings by a zzso approach, we propose that these strains be classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a new member of the family zzso zzso zzso reduces nitrate to zzso but is otherwise zzso zzso this includes the lack of an ability to zzso zzso and other zzso Growth is zzso and the zzso have a distinctive colony zzso with the colonies being dry and zzso and looking like a zzso particle that can be moved around on an zzso plate without losing their zzso zzso zzso data and zzso zzso analysis, including zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso sequencing, clearly placed zzso zzso as a new zzso in the family zzso In all the zzso trees constructed, zzso zzso is on a distinct branch displaying approximately zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso sequence divergence from its nearest relative within the family zzso High degrees of conservation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences exist within the species, indicating that zzso zzso zzso not only are zzso homogeneous but also are genetically zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso
