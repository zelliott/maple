The zzso zzso axis of sea zzso zzso is zzso evident at the zzso stage of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are arrayed along the zzso zzso The vegetal zzso zzso into the zzso zzso and functions as a signaling zzso To date, no zzso or zzso specified gene with restricted expression in the zzso at the zzso stage has been zzso We performed zzso zzso and dot zzso zzso using zzso zzso extracted from the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in order to identify zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso identified in this screen, we isolated four similar but distinct zzso clones from a library, which corresponded to a group of genes that we refer to as the zzso zzso The zzso family zzso putative zzso factors with a zzso which had zzso identity between family zzso The most highly zzso protein was zzso by zzso from zzso zzso zzso identity among family zzso Northern zzso zzso and in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was zzso activated during the early zzso stages and that the transcript was restricted to the zzso Thus, the expression domain was complementary to that of zzso along the zzso zzso The zzso gene family has at least six zzso including zzso zzso which are probably clustered in the zzso zzso and zzso constitute a novel family of zzso class zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso evolved exceptionally zzso
