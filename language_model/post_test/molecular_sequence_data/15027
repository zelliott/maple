We have reported that the zzso interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso alters zzso zzso However, the zzso involved in the interaction are largely zzso To address this issue, we examined in more detail the zzso association by means of zzso overlay zzso and zzso involving zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso in zzso zzso The formation of the zzso complex was detected by zzso using both zzso against zzso and zzso Although the zzso zzso containing the region ranging from zzso to zzso was zzso to zzso the same did not occur when another construct containing zzso to zzso was zzso This observation was consistent with the result of the overlay zzso indicating that zzso lacking the zzso zzso segment retains the ability to associate with zzso whereas the zzso region loses this zzso Although the zzso zzso was recognized by one zzso zzso that has the ability to zzso zzso it was not recognized by another zzso incapable of zzso zzso The zzso of the latter zzso was mapped to the zzso region, which is located on the zzso of zzso Taken together, the results obtained suggest that 1) zzso and zzso are a pair of zzso in proximity to each other and 2) either the zzso domain or the surrounding region plays a role in the interaction with zzso whereas the zzso zzso region does not contribute to this zzso
