The zzso gene cluster of zzso strains of zzso coli produces proteins involved in bacterial attachment to and invasion of the zzso host zzso The crystal structure of a construct of zzso coli zzso possessing an additional zzso extension of 13 zzso zzso including a zzso tag, has been solved at a resolution of zzso zzso The protein forms zzso zzso through the exchange of the zzso zzso which participate in the zzso zzso fold of each zzso This structure confirms that zzso is able to act as an zzso in the zzso zzso mechanism of fiber formation but, in contrast to zzso zzso its native sequence does not have a donor zzso therefore, zzso can only be located at the tip of the zzso
