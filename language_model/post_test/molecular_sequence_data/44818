The zzso protein zzso C zzso member zzso has been implicated in several signal zzso pathways regulating zzso proliferation or zzso of zzso zzso We report here the identification of a zzso and zzso protein that we name zzso protein zzso and that interacts with the regulatory domain of zzso but not classic zzso The structural motifs in zzso include a recently defined zzso zinc finger as a potential protein binding zzso two zzso sequences and a novel putative protein binding motif with the consensus sequence zzso zzso binds to the zzso region in the regulatory domain of zzso and is zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso via the same region that promotes binding to zzso suggesting a competitive situation between zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso proper zzso zzso of zzso is impaired and we show that zzso targeting of zzso is dependent on a balanced interaction with zzso Taking into account the recent isolation of zzso by others in different contexts we propose that zzso may function as a scaffold protein linking zzso to protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso
