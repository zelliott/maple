The fragile X syndrome is due to the new class of dynamic zzso It is associated with an expansion of a zzso repeat zzso in zzso 1 of the fragile X mental zzso gene 1 gene zzso Here we present a fragile X family with an unique female patient who was rendered zzso for the zzso locus due to a large deletion of one X zzso In addition, the other X had a zzso in zzso zzso and sequence analysis revealed that the zzso included all zzso repeats plus 97 zzso of zzso zzso leaving zzso start site and translation start site zzso Despite this total lack of zzso repeats in the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed expression of zzso and the patient's zzso was essentially zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso locus and zzso determination of zzso markers gave evidence that the deletion probably originated from zzso of a fully zzso zzso zzso Although the minimal number of zzso repeats zzso reported in zzso is six, and at least four other genes associated with zzso repeats are known, suggesting an as yet unknown function of these repeats, our study clearly demonstrates that the absence of zzso repeats does not abolish expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
