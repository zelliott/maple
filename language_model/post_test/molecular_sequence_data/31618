The primary role of zzso zzso previously zzso as a zzso zzso is to catalyze the reduction of a variety of toxic zzso compounds using zzso as a zzso at zzso pH zzso Here, crystal structures of zzso in zzso and zzso forms are presented at zzso and zzso resolution, zzso zzso exists as a zzso each zzso of which adopts an zzso structure and has a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed that induced fit upon zzso binding yielded an intact zzso pocket that recognizes the zzso Moreover, the crystal structures combined with zzso simulation defined an open zzso site to accommodate various zzso that possess a zzso zzso
