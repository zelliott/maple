This study was designed to establish the zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso modified zzso with zzso were used as templates in primer extension reactions zzso by DNA zzso I zzso zzso DNA zzso alpha zzso zzso or DNA zzso beta zzso zzso zzso or zzso is incorporated opposite zzso when either of these zzso is provided as zzso for DNA zzso zzso is incorporated exclusively opposite zzso when all four zzso are present in the reaction mixture at zzso zzso zzso extension is zzso efficiently by zzso zzso and pol beta under conditions where zzso is paired with zzso at the 3' zzso of the primed DNA zzso zzso extension zzso by pol alpha proceeds more zzso As shown by zzso kinetic experiments, incorporation of zzso is higher in reactions zzso by pol beta than by zzso zzso or pol zzso The zzso pair is extended efficiently from the 3' zzso in the absence of zzso We conclude that DNA containing zzso is capable of zzso however, unlike zzso the zzso potential of this zzso is zzso
