The natural evolution of human zzso virus type 1 infection often includes a switch in zzso preference late in infection from zzso to zzso a change associated with expanded target cell range and worsened clinical zzso Why zzso switching takes so long is puzzling, since it requires as few as one to two zzso Here we report three obstacles that impede the zzso zzso zzso switch zzso were selected by target cell replacement in zzso Most switch zzso showed diminished replication compared to their parental zzso zzso Transitional zzso were more sensitive to both zzso and zzso zzso than either the parental zzso virus or the final zzso (or rare zzso zzso The small number of zzso in viruses selected for zzso use were distinctly zzso with a dominance of charged zzso acid zzso zzso by zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso sites, and zzso zzso zzso zzso replication zzso zzso zzso use, and unique zzso pathways may explain the long delay from primary infection until the emergence of zzso zzso
