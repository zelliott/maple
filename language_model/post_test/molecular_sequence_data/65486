Although the range dynamics of North American zzso during the last glacial cycle are increasingly better zzso the zzso history of the most northern regions and the impact of southern zzso on patterns of zzso genetic diversity and zzso variation in these regions are not well zzso Here we present the zzso history of a widespread and primarily northern frog, zzso zzso We surveyed zzso individuals from 116 localities across the zzso range for a zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso Our zzso analyses revealed two distinct zzso corresponding to eastern and western zzso as well as a Maritime zzso within the eastern zzso zzso of genetic diversity support multiple zzso However, zzso zzso in the Appalachian zzso and modern-day Wisconsin appear to have had the biggest impact on northern zzso zzso analyses based on zzso further support a distinction between eastern and western wood frogs and suggest that zzso migration has played an important role in generating zzso patterns of zzso variation in this zzso
