zzso zzso metabolism responds to environmental zzso such as zzso limitation and heat zzso This response is zzso in part, by the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso Environmental zzso induce a number of zzso zzso zzso including zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso extension analysis detected two start sites for zzso one of which zzso zzso upstream of these sites included a possible zzso zzso zzso of this sequence reduced zzso expression by a factor of 10 but did not affect start site zzso This zzso also did not affect the relative induction of zzso upon entry into stationary zzso Three candidates for stress response elements zzso were found upstream of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed that they were required for regulation of zzso expression in early stationary phase, and in response to zzso shock and heat zzso These elements appeared to act zzso since the intact promoter exhibited zzso more expression in stationary phase than the sum of that observed for each element acting zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso has been implicated in control zzso by zzso For zzso induction by zzso shock depended on a functional zzso zzso In contrast, induction upon entry into stationary phase was only partially dependent on zzso Furthermore, the heat shock response, which can also be zzso by zzso was independent of zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso respond to more than one pathway, only one of which requires zzso
