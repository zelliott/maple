The zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso produces a large array of plant cell zzso zzso Using an in zzso detection test, we showed that it produces two zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso cleave the zzso link between zzso and the zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso family zzso and they are the first two zzso zzso to be identified in this zzso zzso of synthetic zzso revealed strong zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso The gene zzso appeared to be zzso zzso and its product, zzso is a zzso zzso In contrast, the gene zzso is strongly induced in the presence of zzso acid, and zzso is an zzso protein zzso by the Out system, responsible for zzso zzso The product of the adjacent gene zzso is involved in the positive control of zzso in response to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso acid acts in zzso with zzso to induce zzso zzso the main zzso zzso of soft rot zzso zzso zzso zzso internal zzso in the zzso network of the plant cell wall, suppress the zzso zzso and liberate zzso acid, which contributes to the induction of zzso zzso Together, these effects of zzso zzso could facilitate soft rot disease caused by zzso zzso
