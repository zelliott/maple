Although it is well established that the coat protein complex II zzso mediates the transport of proteins and lipids from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso apparatus, the regulation of the zzso transport event and the mechanisms that act to counterbalance the zzso flow between the zzso and zzso are poorly zzso In this study, we present data indicating that the zzso zzso protein zzso directly interacts with the zzso coat zzso zzso and regulates zzso assembly in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso has been shown to interact with zzso in a zzso manner and to have a role in stabilizing the association of the zzso complex with the zzso However, zzso displayed reversed zzso dependence for zzso zzso only the zzso form of zzso bound to the zzso zzso In addition, the influence on zzso coat assembly also appeared to be zzso zzso binding acted as a kinetic inhibitor to delay zzso zzso Our results provide further evidence for a linkage between zzso signaling and zzso trafficking, but its mechanism of action in zzso seems to be different from the mechanism reported for its zzso zzso zzso
