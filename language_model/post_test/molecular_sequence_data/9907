We recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from bovine zzso An expression analysis using bovine zzso revealed that zzso plays critical roles in the regulation of the cortical zzso zzso Here, we report the molecular cloning of zzso zzso from human and rat brain zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of human and rat zzso show zzso and zzso identity to bovine zzso respectively, suggesting the functional importance of the zzso zzso raised against zzso rat zzso recognizes a zzso protein that exists zzso in whole brain, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was shown to be concentrated at the nerve terminal zzso The gene locus of human zzso was also determined at zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
