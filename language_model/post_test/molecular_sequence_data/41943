zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by in zzso zzso in rat brains submitted to transient zzso zzso of 30 zzso zzso of this zzso protein has been previously observed following diverse types of brain zzso and an involvement in programmed cell death and synaptic zzso has been zzso zzso was produced by zzso zzso and followed by various zzso times ranging from 15 zzso to 7 zzso Up to 6 h after zzso zzso zzso did not change in any brain zzso After 12 h zzso zzso zzso induction was observed in the stratum zzso zzso of zzso sector of zzso This induction peaked at 3 days zzso and then zzso From 24 h zzso zzso induction also occurred in zzso areas of the cortex, and after 7 days zzso in the zzso zzso and in a zzso around zzso parts of the zzso No induction occurred at any zzso time in zzso zzso of zzso or other zzso populations that are damaged by zzso The combination of in zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was mainly induced in zzso zzso This excludes a direct involvement in zzso zzso death and supports the possible participation in the zzso reorganization of the zzso
