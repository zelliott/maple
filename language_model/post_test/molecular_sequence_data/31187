zzso zzso factor zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in a positive manner by binding to the internal control region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The present study reports the identification of a zzso binding site on the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso gene that codes for the synthesis of this zzso zzso This zzso binding site zzso from zzso zzso in zzso I protection zzso extends on the zzso zzso region from about zzso zzso to zzso on the zzso strand and from zzso to zzso on the coding zzso The affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso region of its own gene is less than that for the zzso zzso gene but within the same order of zzso A sequence similarity between this newly identified binding site and the zzso gene zzso is the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding to this zzso zzso element zzso as with the zzso zzso zzso zinc is required for DNA binding zzso When zzso is bound to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the protein does not bind to this zzso zzso region, an observation similar to that observed with binding to the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate zzso is using similar zzso acid binding zzso for interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso region of its own zzso This upstream DNA region to which zzso binds has been previously shown to contain a negative and a positive regulatory element for zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and Roeder, zzso 1989, Genes & zzso 3, zzso The present results indicate zzso binds to the negative control element located at zzso to zzso and possibly zzso with another zzso factor which binds to the positive control element extending from zzso to zzso
