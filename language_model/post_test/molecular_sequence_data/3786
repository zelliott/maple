The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has proteins zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the presence of a battery of associated zzso We have identified the zzso protein zzso gene fragments zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso chain reaction zzso strategy using zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso was subsequently cloned in its entirety from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with a predicted zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso region divided by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli yielded a protein confined to the membrane zzso which was found to be zzso exclusively on zzso zzso and could transfer zzso to the model zzso zzso basic protein and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso transfer could be inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso resistance gene in the zzso zzso zzso resulted in changes in zzso zzso and an increased sensitivity to the zzso cycling agents zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso in trans could reverse this sensitivity, whereas a zzso inactive zzso of zzso could not, indicating that zzso activity is essential for this zzso This suggests a link between this zzso protein zzso in zzso pathways sensitive to zzso stress and/or zzso zzso These results broaden the roles of zzso protein zzso in bacteria and underscore the diversity of signal zzso mechanisms available to respond to various zzso
