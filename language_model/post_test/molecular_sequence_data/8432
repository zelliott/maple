zzso and zzso are members of the zzso family of small zzso and are required for a diverse set of zzso interactions in different cell zzso Here we show that these two proteins contribute differently to the organization of zzso cells in the zzso wing zzso zzso zzso is required to assemble zzso at zzso zzso Failure of zzso junction zzso assembly in zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased cell zzso zzso on the other hand, is required for processes that involve polarized cell shape changes during both zzso and zzso zzso In the third zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso Whereas normal wing disc zzso cells increase in height more than twofold during the third zzso cells that express a zzso version of zzso remain short and are zzso zzso zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso regions of the cell during these events, and mediates zzso at least in part, by zzso a reorganization of the zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that a common zzso mechanism may govern polarized cell shape changes in a wide variety of cell zzso
