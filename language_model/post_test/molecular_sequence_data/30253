The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso Ds element is zzso A comparison with previously characterized Ds elements reveals several novel zzso This element has less zzso terminal sequence than other zzso Ds zzso The left zzso contains 398 zzso of zzso sequence interrupted by a zzso DNA zzso leaving only 317 zzso of zzso zzso zzso The right zzso has 259 zzso of zzso terminal zzso The interior of the element contains sequences not found in other cloned members of the zzso zzso We suggest that the role of this zzso DNA is to separate the zzso zzso by a minimum distance and may be a zzso requirement for Ds zzso in zzso
