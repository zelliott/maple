The major zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An in zzso approach was used to identify new proteins involved in the zzso zzso zzso One such zzso zzso was identified as a zzso protein of unknown function having extensive zzso interactions with several proteins involved in zzso zzso and zzso degradation including zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso can stimulate zzso zzso of both unstable and stable zzso in zzso when the zzso zzso is compromised by zzso zzso of either the zzso or the zzso zzso In these cases, deletion of zzso caused a synergistic zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso had no effect when combined with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso which appear to affect an early step in the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso specifically affects the function of the zzso zzso per zzso zzso with a functional role in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso referred to as zzso These results identify zzso as a new protein involved in the zzso zzso
