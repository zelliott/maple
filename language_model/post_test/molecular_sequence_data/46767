The human zzso growth factor zzso primary transcript is alternatively processed to produce zzso forms that vary in their affinity for zzso growth zzso The inclusion of a single zzso zzso in normal brain zzso cells produces a low affinity form of the zzso zzso of the zzso is zzso during zzso transformation of zzso cells to produce a high affinity zzso zzso In this study, we have identified a second zzso zzso of zzso zzso located approximately 250 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso or zzso of this sequence resulted in a significant increase in zzso recognition in zzso zzso This zzso zzso was found to share significant sequence zzso with an zzso zzso element located downstream of the zzso The two zzso elements are functionally redundant in that they are capable of zzso zzso recognition when positioned upstream or downstream of the zzso Finally, the elements were found to mediate enhanced exclusion of an unrelated zzso but only the zzso were placed zzso the zzso However, under these conditions, the zzso zzso exclusion was no longer zzso These results suggest that although the zzso inclusion is actively zzso in zzso the absence of zzso appears to be key to the production of the high affinity form of zzso growth factor zzso in zzso
