zzso has been shown to be required for S phase progression and to interact with a nuclear zzso zzso locus zzso a component of zzso bodies in the nucleus and an zzso of zzso zzso We investigated the role of human zzso by using an zzso zzso zzso system in the presence or absence of various zzso forms of mouse zzso While zzso deletion zzso of zzso which do not interact with zzso can support S phase zzso its zzso deletion zzso which are unable to self associate, cannot support S phase zzso zzso zzso transcription, or the formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was shown to be associated with zzso resistance protein 2 zzso through its central region, which is composed of only 13 zzso zzso The expression of zzso and the interaction between zzso and zzso are required for S phase zzso Taking these results together, zzso functions in S phase progression through interaction with zzso
