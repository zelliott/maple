We report here the characterization of a zzso zzso zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso Previously we amplified the zzso site - zzso site zzso of this zzso by zzso zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Benz, zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso Letters 258 zzso and in the present work we used this zzso as probe for isolation of a zzso clone with the zzso coding zzso The isolated zzso zzso clone has been zzso and the primary structure of the zzso protein has been zzso It consists of zzso zzso acids with all the characteristic features of the zzso zzso It shows zzso zzso acid identity and an apparently identical zzso profile with the zzso zzso zzso zzso On basis of sequence similarity we suggest that the first zzso segment of zzso zzso type zzso may be responsible for targeting of these transport proteins into the zzso zzso The gene of this zzso zzso zzso has been mapped on the right arm of zzso 2, in section zzso
