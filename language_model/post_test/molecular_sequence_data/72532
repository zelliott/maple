The target cell zzso on tumor cells and on zzso zzso recognized by zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso has not yet been specifically zzso zzso may be the zzso equivalent of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso A zzso recognized by zzso has been zzso It is expressed on both zzso zzso and zzso tumor target zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso target zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and the entire zzso acid sequence was deduced from zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of human and mouse transformed target zzso zzso comparisons using zzso database revealed that zzso is a novel zzso zzso weight zzso of the deduced sequence demonstrated that zzso is a zzso protein containing 422 zzso acids with relatively high percentages of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso on various zzso tumor target cells, normal zzso and zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso This zzso bound to zzso and tumor cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with low levels of binding to fish, zzso and zzso zzso Studies were also done to determine if zzso and zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso zzso was zzso and zzso These data provide evidence that zzso recognize a target cell zzso which is found on both zzso and tumor zzso This may provide an explanation as to how zzso (including activated zzso zzso recognize a vast array of targets in the absence of zzso recognition and in spite of a diverse species of zzso
