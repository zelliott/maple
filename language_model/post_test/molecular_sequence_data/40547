zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso three sequential zzso in zzso zzso zzso These serve to transform the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso intermediate into the zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso To investigate the unknown zzso mechanism and properties of zzso we have engineered the corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso for functional zzso expression in zzso coli, involving use of a fully zzso zzso along with additional zzso deletion and zzso This zzso zzso zzso was used to carry out zzso zzso studies with zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso to investigate the zzso reaction zzso revealing zzso of three zzso zzso which further requires zzso at some zzso zzso following initial zzso zzso must then be further zzso to a zzso zzso and our data indicate that the subsequent reactions proceed via zzso of the zzso to zzso followed by an additional zzso to directly form zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that these zzso are all retained in the active site during the course of the reaction series, with the first zzso being zzso In addition, investigation of alternative zzso demonstrated that zzso which differs in ring structure zzso to the zzso zzso is only zzso by zzso indicating the importance of the exact zzso ring structure of zzso for zzso zzso zzso Thus the results of the present study clarify the reaction sequence and zzso mechanism of zzso as well as zzso features critical for the zzso multiple reaction zzso
