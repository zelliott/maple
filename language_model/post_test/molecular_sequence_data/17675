The structure of zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli was solved from cubic zzso with a zzso 133 A grown under reducing conditions at pH zzso and refined to R zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The structure is compared with that from zzso zzso solved to R zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The structures are compared using a difference distance zzso which identifies a common core of zzso that retains the same relationship to one another in both zzso After zzso of the effects of a 50 zzso acid insert present in zzso zzso differences in position of atoms correlate with temperature factors and with distance from the nearest zzso zzso The dependence of structural difference on zzso factor is zzso and reflects both errors in coordinates that correlate with zzso factor, and the increased zzso of the energy well in which atoms of high zzso factor zzso The dependence of structural difference on distance from the nearest substitution also depends on zzso factors and shows an exponential dependence with half zzso effect at zzso A from the zzso This represents the plastic accommodation of the protein which is zzso in terms of zzso B factor and distance from a zzso zzso
