zzso of the structurally complex zzso toxin zzso is an eminent character of zzso zzso For that zzso however, they rely on zzso bacteria that are lacking in zzso zzso The bacterial inhabitants of the two zzso in zzso zzso are evaluated in a zzso analysis of zzso zzso A certain fragment, which is not found in zzso zzso is highly dominant in the other, zzso females and thus identifies the zzso Its DNA sequence reveals a member of the gamma subdivision of the zzso that is clustered within the zzso zzso zzso zzso as it is most closely related to zzso zzso These bacteria appear as the hypothesized common producers of zzso and the zzso family of zzso from marine zzso
