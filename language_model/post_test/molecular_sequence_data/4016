Members of the zzso zzso channel zzso mediate fast synaptic transmission in the nervous zzso In this study, we investigate the molecular zzso and mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso charge selectivity in this family of channels by characterizing the single channel zzso and zzso of zzso zzso human zzso zzso channels zzso containing pore zzso that impart zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the selectivity double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had mean inward chord zzso (at zzso zzso of 7 zzso and mean outward zzso of 11 and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso have not simply reduced zzso zzso but have replaced the previous zzso zzso with a zzso zzso An additional zzso to neutralize the ring of positive charge at the zzso mouth of the channel zzso zzso made the zzso relationship linear zzso zzso at both 60 and zzso zzso When this external charged ring was made negative zzso zzso the inward zzso was further increased (to 22 zzso and now became sensitive to external zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso in their zzso The effects of the zzso to the external ring of charge on zzso and zzso could be fit to a model where only the main external energy barrier height for zzso was zzso Mean outward zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso were increased when internal zzso zzso were zzso consistent with the zzso end of the pore being flanked by fixed negative zzso This supports our hypothesis that the zzso charge selectivity zzso have zzso the zzso profile of the pore by introducing a zzso charged ring at the putative selectivity zzso These results also further confirm the role of external pore zzso zzso in determining the zzso and zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso
