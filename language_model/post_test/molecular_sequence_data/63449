The zzso zzso define a zzso of zzso zzso able to reduce hydrogen zzso zzso zzso and zzso Besides their zzso zzso function, zzso have been implicated in zzso signaling and zzso activity, the latter depending on the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been mechanistically divided into three major zzso namely typical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on the number and position of zzso involved in the zzso We report the structure of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso marina zzso in three different crystal forms determined at zzso zzso and zzso A zzso Although zzso marina zzso was cloned during the search of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the crystal structures support its assignment to the mechanistically typical zzso zzso zzso The protein is composed of two distinct zzso a zzso domain and an zzso domain exhibiting a zzso zzso The zzso are associated in zzso compatible with the formation of zzso zzso bonds between the zzso and the resolving zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The packing of two crystal forms is very similar, with pairs of zzso associated as zzso The zzso zzso formed by zzso association and observed in most typical zzso zzso is not zzso Thus, zzso marina zzso presents structural features of typical zzso zzso without any formation of zzso zzso suggesting that it should function more like a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso of zzso cell signaling rather than a molecular zzso
