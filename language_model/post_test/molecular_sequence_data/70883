The structure of the zzso zzso complex has now been refined at zzso A zzso The zzso arrest agent zzso binds zzso protein zzso and the zzso binding zzso domain of zzso associated protein zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso is responsible for zzso biological zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso complex is very similar to that observed in the zzso zzso complex, with an zzso difference of only zzso zzso However, a slight (9 degrees ) rotation zzso the zzso face of zzso in the zzso zzso There are extensive zzso interactions and relatively few interactions between the two protein partners zzso and zzso these interactions mainly involving zzso in the 40s and 80s zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso The high-resolution refinement has revealed the crucial role of several buried waters in the formation of the zzso zzso
