zzso of organic zzso compounds by acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an important method for efficient removal of zzso from high concentration organic zzso Another important method is supplementation of animal feed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which improves the availability of zzso zzso that are zzso by zzso making it possible to add less zzso to animal feed and resulting in the zzso of less zzso by the zzso In the present study, we zzso a novel zzso from the wastewater treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cloned the zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso and characterized zzso The molecular weight of zzso after zzso by zzso was 49 zzso The optimal pH and temperature for zzso activity were zzso and 50 degrees C, zzso zzso exhibits zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso 37% identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transformed and expressed in zzso zzso The yield was 23 zzso by jar zzso zzso The marked zzso activity exhibited by zzso on six zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated that it is a zzso acid zzso
