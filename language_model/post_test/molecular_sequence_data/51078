zzso and all of the zzso visual zzso have a zzso acid zzso zzso in the third zzso segment that serves as a zzso to the zzso Schiff base nitrogen of the zzso We show here that the zzso in bovine zzso can be moved from position 113 to 117 without significantly changing the zzso spectral properties of the zzso A series of double zzso were constructed where the zzso zzso was changed to zzso and an zzso zzso was zzso for zzso acid zzso from position 111 to 121 in the third zzso segment of the zzso Only at position 117 can an zzso fully substitute for the zzso at position zzso The double zzso zzso has an zzso maximum at 493 zzso which is independent of pH in the range zzso and independent of the presence of external zzso zzso An zzso at no other position tested in the third zzso segment can fully substitute for the zzso zzso at position zzso zzso substitution is observed for an zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso and 120 are expected to lie along the same face of an zzso These results suggest that the Schiff base nitrogen in zzso is located between zzso 113 and 117 but there is enough flexibility in the protein to allow partial interaction with an zzso at position zzso zzso 117 is the same location of the zzso in the related zzso zzso zzso
