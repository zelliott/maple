zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the final step of the zzso pathway, the zzso dependent zzso of zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso an zzso precursor zzso that is a critical intermediate in zzso and zzso zzso is essential in zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and thus the zzso of the zzso zzso are ideal zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso that have been extensively studied for the past 50 years, yet the zzso of zzso zzso zzso complexes has proven to be zzso To further our understanding of the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso with the purpose of developing broad spectrum zzso agents that target the zzso and zzso binding sites, we report the crystal structures of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso complex zzso zzso provides structural information about the mode of zzso binding and the zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso complexes of zzso deficient zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso provides insight into zzso zzso The zzso side chain of zzso zzso functions as a zzso base and is essential for the proper orientation of the zzso zzso group within the active site zzso Several zzso zzso acids within the zzso zzso binding loop zzso provide key zzso stabilizing the zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures presented here provide a useful foundation for zzso drug zzso
