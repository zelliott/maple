Human zzso a 24 zzso zzso of the zzso chain of type IV zzso has been proved to be one of the most effective zzso of zzso and tumor zzso To investigate in zzso zzso activity and in zzso effects on zzso cell proliferation of zzso mouse zzso the zzso of mouse zzso was introduced into an expression zzso zzso to construct a zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso mouse zzso efficiently expressed in zzso coli zzso after zzso induction was monitored by zzso and by Western zzso with an zzso tag zzso The expressed mouse zzso mainly as inclusion bodies, accounted for approximately zzso of the total bacterial zzso The inclusion bodies were washed, zzso and zzso by the zzso affinity zzso to a purity of approximately zzso The zzso mouse zzso was tested on the chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso and a large number of newly formed blood vessels were significantly zzso In addition, zzso mouse zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation with no zzso on zzso zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the zzso mouse zzso effectively inhibited zzso of the chicken zzso in a zzso manner and specially suppressed in zzso the proliferation of human zzso vein zzso zzso
