zzso of gene expression in the zzso and the nucleus is important for zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso gene regulation in zzso remains incompletely understood in most zzso including zzso Here we show that zzso zzso which influences the zzso status of zzso zzso in many zzso directly regulates the zzso tract of zzso zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates zzso zzso zzso and shows defects in zzso protein complex zzso zzso of zzso suppress the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are required for their functions in the regulation of the zzso tract of zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso constitute a regulatory system that controls zzso zzso zzso status in zzso
