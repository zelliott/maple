zzso is not thought to be effective for the treatment of zzso influenza virus zzso based on an analysis of genetic sequences of the zzso zzso However, the actual clinical efficacy of zzso has not been well zzso Here, we were able to compare the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso patients, including 144 with seasonal influenza zzso identified between 2008 and 2009, and zzso with zzso identified between July 1 and November 30, zzso Diagnosis of flu was established using a rapid diagnostic kit obtained commercially in zzso Body temperature sheets were obtained from zzso of the zzso zzso Times required to recover normal body temperature were compared among subjects using different zzso zzso zzso abnormalities in the zzso protein were also investigated in 66 randomly selected subjects from within the patient zzso Overall, the average hours required to recover normal body temperature in zzso patients treated with zzso (160 zzso with zzso zzso zzso or with zzso (65 zzso were zzso zzso or zzso zzso These differences were not statistically zzso The zzso zzso was found in all 14 samples taken from the zzso patients and in all of the 23 samples taken from in zzso zzso However, this zzso was not found in any of the 30 samples taken from seasonal zzso zzso zzso was found to be equally effective in treating zzso patients as zzso zzso The genetic zzso resulting in zzso zzso acid conversion identified in some of the zzso and zzso patients is thought to alter the function of zzso protein only zzso
