The assembly and budding of zzso virus, a zzso member of the zzso zzso in the family zzso requires a specific interaction between the zzso core and the zzso zzso E1 and zzso These zzso are modified zzso by the addition of zzso acid, and zzso of zzso interfere with this budding process zzso Schlesinger and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This report describes the use of zzso zzso to identify two of the zzso sites in the zzso zzso as the zzso near the zzso zzso of the protein which is oriented to the zzso domain of this type 1 zzso zzso Additional zzso were made at two zzso within a zzso sequence of zzso that is highly zzso among several zzso and the zzso viruses were zzso in assembly and particle zzso These data support earlier studies indicating that the native structure of the zzso domain of zzso is essential for proper assembly of this enveloped zzso
