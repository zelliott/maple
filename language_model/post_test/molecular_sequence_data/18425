Three abundant storage proteins have been detected in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fat body of the tobacco zzso zzso zzso These zzso have zzso molecular weights of zzso zzso and zzso as determined by zzso and exist as zzso zzso in their native zzso A zzso zzso storage protein fraction has been obtained along with a preparation containing equivalent amounts of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso raised to each of these components have been used to document the zzso profiles of protein zzso and synthesis by fat zzso zzso clones corresponding to each of three abundant classes of fat body zzso have been recovered, and at least one of these has been zzso demonstrated to zzso the zzso storage protein zzso Northern zzso studies with these zzso clones revealed that the zzso zzso of transcripts in fat body for each was consistent with the general pattern of storage protein zzso and more interestingly, that transcripts zzso to two of these zzso sequences are also found in zzso These two zzso have also been zzso revealing that one encodes a zzso similar to zzso a class of storage proteins widely distributed in zzso The derived zzso sequence of the second zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso had no unusual compositional features and determination of its structural relationship to other zzso zzso awaits molecular analysis of related genes from other zzso
