A key goal in molecular biology is to understand the mechanisms by which a cell regulates the zzso of its zzso One important aspect of this zzso regulation is the binding of zzso factors zzso to their specific zzso counterparts on the zzso zzso recognize and bind their DNA counterparts according to the structure of their zzso zzso zzso zinc finger, zzso zzso zzso The structure of these zzso can be used as a basis for grouping zzso into zzso Although the structure of zzso zzso varies widely across zzso generally, the zzso within a particular class bind to DNA in a similar fashion, suggesting the existence of zzso features in the DNA sequences bound by each class of zzso 

In this paper, we apply a sparse zzso learning zzso to identify a small set of zzso features in the DNA sequences bound by different classes of zzso the zzso simultaneously learns a true zzso zzso that uses these features to predict the zzso domain of the zzso that recognizes a particular set of DNA zzso We train our zzso on the six largest classes in zzso zzso a total of 587 zzso We learn a zzso zzso for this training set that achieves zzso zzso zzso zzso We also identify features within zzso sequences that are highly specific to each class of zzso which has significant implications for how zzso binding sites should be modeled for the purpose of motif zzso
