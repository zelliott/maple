zzso islands have been shown to harbor functional traits that differentiate ecologically distinct populations of environmental zzso A comparative analysis of the complete zzso sequences of the marine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals that zzso of the zzso genes are located in 21 zzso zzso These islands are enriched in genes associated with secondary zzso zzso providing evidence that secondary metabolism is linked to functional zzso Secondary metabolism accounts for zzso and zzso of the genes in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and represents the major functional category of zzso genes that zzso the two zzso zzso islands harbor all 25 of the zzso zzso zzso the majority of which occur in zzso zzso and may contribute to the cosmopolitan distribution of this zzso Genome evolution is dominated by gene zzso and zzso which in the case of secondary metabolism provide immediate opportunities for the production of new zzso zzso Evidence that secondary zzso pathways are exchanged zzso coupled with earlier evidence for fixation among globally distributed zzso supports a functional role and suggests that the acquisition of natural product zzso gene clusters represents a previously zzso force driving bacterial zzso zzso differences observed in clustered regularly zzso short zzso repeat sequences suggest that zzso zzso may possess a higher level of zzso zzso whereas a highly duplicated family of zzso membrane proteins provides evidence for a new mechanism of marine adaptation in zzso zzso
