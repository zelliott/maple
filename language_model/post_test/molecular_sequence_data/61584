The human zzso DNA zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso and an accessory zzso zzso Recent studies suggested that zzso might interact via its extreme C zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Murphy, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To address this hypothesis, we zzso measured the binding of peptides corresponding to the extreme C zzso of zzso to zzso by using zzso zzso zzso A zzso corresponding to the last 22 zzso of zzso was sufficient to bind specifically to zzso in a zzso complex with a zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso To define individual zzso in this segment that are crucial for interacting with zzso we engineered a series of zzso in the zzso region of zzso The zzso zzso were tested for their ability to interact with zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso DNA zzso activity, and for zzso DNA synthesis in the presence of zzso We observed that deletion of the zzso segment or substitution of zzso for zzso or zzso in zzso greatly impaired both the zzso interaction in zzso zzso and zzso DNA synthesis without affecting zzso zzso activity, identifying these zzso as important for zzso zzso Thus, like the zzso zzso virus zzso interaction, a few specific side chains in the C zzso of zzso are crucial for zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso important for interaction with zzso are zzso and not zzso This information might aid in the rational design of new drugs for the treatment of human zzso zzso
