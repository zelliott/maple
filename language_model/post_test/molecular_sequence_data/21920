The molecular mechanisms contributing to high-level zzso resistance in zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso were zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso target genes was identified in all high-level zzso zzso A number of zzso acid zzso together with insertions and deletions were identified in the corresponding genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins both of resistant and susceptible zzso zzso acid zzso identified in the resistant strains were located outside regions known to be altered in these zzso The zzso pump inhibitor zzso zzso increased the zzso to zzso in one of four zzso displaying high-level zzso resistance, and reduced the minimal zzso concentration displayed by an zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso appeared to be the main contributor to high-level zzso resistance in zzso Other zzso acid zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso do not appear to be linked to the high-level zzso zzso Active zzso contributes to the intrinsic resistance to zzso in zzso and may contribute to high-level resistance in some zzso
