The zzso zzso zzso community in three groundwater treatment plants and connected distribution systems was analyzed by quantitative real-time zzso and sequence analysis targeting the zzso gene of zzso bacteria zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso numbers increased during biological zzso of zzso zzso groundwater, and zzso were responsible for ammonium removal during zzso In one of the treatment trains at plant C, zzso removal correlated significantly with zzso numbers but not with zzso zzso Thus, zzso were responsible for zzso removal in water treatment at one of the studied zzso Furthermore, an observed negative correlation between the dissolved organic carbon zzso concentration in the water and zzso numbers suggests that high zzso levels might reduce growth of zzso zzso entered the distribution system in numbers ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These numbers did not change during transport in the distribution system despite the absence of a zzso zzso Thus, inactive zzso biomass does not seem to be zzso by zzso zzso in the distribution zzso We conclude from our results that zzso can be commonly present in distribution systems and groundwater treatment, where they can be responsible for the removal of zzso
