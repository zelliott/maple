One of the key properties of biological molecules is that they can bind strongly to certain zzso yet interact only zzso with the very large number of other molecules that they zzso Using a simple lattice model, we test several methods to design zzso binding zzso We characterize the binding free energy and binding energy as a function of the size of the interacting zzso Our simulations indicate that there exists a temperature window where specific binding is zzso zzso sites that have been designed to interact quite strongly with specific zzso are unlikely to bind zzso to other zzso In other words, the conflict between specific interactions between small numbers of zzso and weak, zzso interaction with the rest need not be a very serious design zzso
