By screening zzso animals for zzso in rhythms of zzso activity, we identified a mouse zzso after hours zzso The zzso a zzso substitution in zzso an zzso protein with zzso repeats, results in long zzso rhythms of about 27 hours in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are attenuated in zzso zzso The zzso zzso significantly affected zzso expression and delayed the rate of zzso protein degradation in zzso tissue zzso Our in zzso and in zzso studies reveal a central role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso
