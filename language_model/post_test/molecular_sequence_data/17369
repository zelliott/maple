In a search for novel zzso zzso at sites of allergic zzso we found zzso zzso activity in extracts of human zzso zzso The extracts were zzso by reverse phase zzso and the resulting zzso were tested for zzso activity using sensitive shape change zzso The zzso activity detected was not depleted by a zzso zzso protein affinity zzso This activity was further zzso by zzso and proteins in the zzso zzso were analyzed by tandem zzso mass zzso zzso growth zzso zzso was identified in these zzso zzso and the zzso activity was inhibited by an zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a substantial shape change response in zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso or zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso also caused zzso of zzso zzso expression and inhibited zzso but did not stimulate zzso or zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 exhibited similar zzso effects as zzso and both growth factors were detected in zzso zzso extracts by zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso factors that increase the zzso of zzso but do not act on other zzso or zzso IGF-1 and zzso could play a role in the selective recruitment of zzso in zzso
