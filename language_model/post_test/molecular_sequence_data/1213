The coordinated and zzso action of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso produces transient zzso a fundamental regulatory mechanism for many biological zzso The human zzso encodes a far greater number of zzso protein zzso than of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in particular, is zzso distributed and regulates a broad range of cellular functions, including zzso zzso zzso progression and muscle zzso zzso has evolved effective zzso machinery but lacks zzso zzso zzso specificity is zzso upon zzso through interactions with a large number of regulatory zzso The regulatory zzso are generally zzso but most possess the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Here we reveal the crystal structure at zzso A resolution of the complex between zzso and a zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso is the protein that regulates zzso function in smooth muscle zzso zzso elements zzso and zzso to the zzso motif of zzso are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso contributing to the increased zzso specificity of this zzso The structure has general implications for the control of zzso activity by other regulatory zzso
