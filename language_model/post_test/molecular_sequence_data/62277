One key area of protein zzso research is the identification of zzso zzso The search for zzso is hampered by problems in zzso assigning zzso to a particular zzso in zzso and in zzso One solution to this impasse is to engineer the zzso of interest to accept an zzso analogue which is zzso zzso to fit into the zzso binding zzso for the zzso zzso and the majority of other zzso The acceptance of structurally zzso zzso zzso analogue by active zzso zzso can provide a unique handle by which the direct zzso of any particular zzso can be displayed in crude zzso or cell zzso We have taken this approach with the zzso zzso zzso which plays an essential role in the zzso of stimuli through the zzso zzso zzso This cascade plays essential roles in zzso differentiation and zzso Here we detail the zzso strategy for the zzso binding pocket of zzso such that it can zzso an zzso zzso zzso We show that these zzso do not alter the zzso specificity and signal zzso through zzso We screen a library of zzso to identify which are zzso for zzso and show that zzso zzso can zzso the zzso analogue zzso zzso in zzso to zzso its currently only accepted zzso zzso zzso we show that our approach can be used to tag putative direct zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso in cell zzso
