We provide direct evidence that zzso zzso alters zzso protein zzso Using a novel in zzso zzso approach, we detected several proteins that associate with zzso zzso junctions only as a consequence of zzso zzso experiments suggested that these proteins are part of a tight complex around the zzso Two were identified as zzso a nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso a core component of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that a subset of these proteins remain associated with zzso after its release from the zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso can leave behind signature proteins at zzso zzso Such proteins could influence downstream zzso events in zzso such as zzso zzso translation, and zzso zzso
