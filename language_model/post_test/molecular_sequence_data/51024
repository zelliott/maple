A gene family zzso the fork zzso domain has been identified in the South African clawed frog, zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA and zzso stage derived zzso libraries with a DNA zzso zzso the zzso fork head domain led to the isolation of a number of different clones zzso this zzso While one of the zzso fork head zzso zzso represents the zzso counterpart to rat zzso zzso all other sequences zzso novel types of fork head related zzso Here we report on zzso a DNA binding protein which can bind to the zzso alpha target zzso Analysis of zzso and spatial expression revealed that the gene is activated at zzso stage and that transcripts are localized in a rather thin stripe of cells zzso the zzso zzso lip zzso during zzso zzso zzso is localized within the zzso and, by the end of zzso is no longer zzso In the animal cap zzso the gene is activated by incubation with the zzso factor zzso zzso but not with zzso
