A new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been obtained and named zzso Both zzso DNA and zzso for zzso expression were zzso The zzso sequence was zzso and consisted of the zzso gene as well as zzso zzso The zzso sequence was analyzed for possible regulatory elements that would control gene zzso In zzso several of these elements have been shown to be involved in development and cell zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has low identity compared with the four alternatively spliced zzso zzso to zzso from another zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The percent identities are zzso and zzso comparing zzso to insect zzso from Delta and zzso classes, zzso zzso characterization of zzso shows it to be distinct from the other zzso zzso zzso because of low zzso activity for customary zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso However, this zzso has a greater affinity of interaction with zzso compared to the other zzso zzso zzso
