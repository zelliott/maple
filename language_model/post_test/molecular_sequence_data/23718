Twenty-six Israeli zzso of zzso zzso from both marine and zzso water sources were compared with each other and with 9 foreign zzso All the zzso were tentatively identified according to their zzso zzso zzso sequencing of approximately 600 zzso zzso products of the zzso zzso confirmed their identification as zzso zzso at the molecular level and revealed a new zzso zzso among Israeli zzso in addition to 2 zzso that had been previously zzso zzso variation was further examined by subjecting the zzso to randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso and amplified zzso length zzso zzso zzso The zzso method allowed separation of the zzso into only 2 groups, one including 5 Israeli zzso water zzso and one including all the other zzso The zzso method grouped the Israeli marine zzso into one homogeneous zzso although they had been obtained in different years zzso to 2001) from different species of fish, and from wild (Red zzso as well as cultured (both Mediterranean and Red zzso zzso The Israeli zzso water zzso and foreign zzso separated into distinct entities that clustered at generally high degrees of zzso The distance between the clusters of the Israeli marine and zzso water zzso indicates that the zzso zzso zzso that has been afflicting the aquaculture industries in the 2 environments in recent years was caused by distinct zzso zzso showed superior zzso properties over zzso in detecting zzso variation and proved to be an important tool for the characterization of zzso zzso A correlation between strain variation and geographic zzso was zzso
