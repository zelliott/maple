Many studies have correlated reductions in gap zzso zzso communication zzso with altered cellular growth, tumor promotion, and zzso zzso To test directly whether reduced zzso affects cellular growth, zzso was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso zzso by treatment with a zzso zzso zzso targeted against the zzso translation start zzso and in zzso cell growth was zzso The cells were incubated with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso in zzso culture medium for 16 zzso washed and zzso with zzso zzso and analyzed for zzso zzso protein and zzso levels, and cell growth over the next 5 zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso and reduced zzso protein levels in a zzso manner but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso Cell growth rate was not affected, but zzso density was increased approximately zzso by the zzso These data support a role for zzso in the establishment of contact zzso of in zzso cell zzso
