One of the important sites of zzso action that affects cellular function is known to be zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso could be another target of zzso modification of protein function, as we have shown previously using a model protein zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of several proteins that allowed us to determine the position of zzso in their zzso acid sequences in a more complex zzso We modified zzso from zzso cells with and without nerve growth factor zzso by treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Western zzso analyses using zzso zzso showed several zzso bands and spots, which were subsequently subjected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified several zzso peptides including zzso zzso which were derived from zzso zzso A, zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 90 zzso in zzso zzso from zzso cells, and zzso zzso A, zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso ratio of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso treated with zzso was determined to be zzso to 1 by using an zzso zzso This is the first report to identify several specific sites of zzso zzso on proteins in a complex system treated with zzso and to compare the zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso
