Since zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso no zzso have been constructed to transform this zzso Moreover, it is difficult to design a new transformation system because no selection markers and promoters are zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to inhibit the growth of zzso zzso The dominant zzso marker zzso zzso zzso gene containing five zzso zzso in an zzso frame of 375 zzso was zzso by replacing its zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso This marker zzso resistance to zzso zzso promoter, zzso zzso factor 1 zzso promoter from zzso zzso and zzso promoter from zzso zzso were then used to drive zzso and to examine the function of promoter in zzso zzso The resulting zzso enabled selection of zzso clones after transformation by zzso method and zzso These results demonstrate that transformation into zzso zzso is feasible under the operation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The development of the transformation system for zzso zzso is essential to the genetic analysis of gene regulation and zzso features of this zzso species and the expression of zzso proteins in zzso zzso
