The zzso of chronic liver disease zzso due to persistent zzso B virus zzso infection has not been zzso but the disease activity is believed to correlate with the presence of zzso B zzso zzso zzso and high zzso The molecular characterization of an zzso zzso isolated from an zzso patient with severe zzso required amplification of the circulating zzso DNA (2 zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso from five independent zzso of the zzso zzso region consistently revealed a G to A zzso in each of the two terminal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 28 was zzso from zzso zzso to a zzso stop zzso zzso zzso 29 preceding the core initiation zzso was changed from zzso to zzso For zzso evaluation of these zzso on zzso replication and expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells contained zzso core particles in the zzso and zzso mature zzso without zzso into the zzso The findings present the first evidence that complete zzso zzso can be amplified by zzso and are zzso in zzso The data also indicate that zzso is not necessary for replication of zzso and zzso suggest that zzso is not required for the progression of zzso zzso
