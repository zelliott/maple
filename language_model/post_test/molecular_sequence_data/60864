The importance of zzso in the second hairpin loop and the zzso end of zzso zzso B for binding of zzso was zzso by zzso of the bovine zzso zzso zzso B was modeled onto the crystal structure of the human inhibitor in complex with zzso with minimal structural zzso zzso of the two deduced contact zzso in the second hairpin loop, zzso and zzso with zzso resulted in appreciably reduced affinities for zzso and zzso H and zzso These losses indicated that the two zzso together contribute zzso of the free energy of binding of zzso B to these zzso and that zzso is responsible for most of this zzso In contrast, the small decrease in the affinity for zzso L suggested that the second hairpin loop is less important for zzso of this zzso Replacement of the contact zzso in the zzso end, zzso with Ala resulted in losses in affinity for zzso and zzso L and H that were consistent with zzso contributing zzso of the energy of binding of zzso B to these zzso However, this substitution minimally affected the affinity for zzso B, indicating that the zzso end is of limited importance for binding of this zzso All affinity decreases were due predominantly to increased zzso rate zzso These results show that both the second hairpin loop and the zzso end of zzso B contribute to zzso the inhibitor to target zzso each of the two regions interacting with a different domain of the zzso However, the relative contributions of these two interactions vary with the zzso
