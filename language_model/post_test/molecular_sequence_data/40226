zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is high virulent to zzso The zzso juvenile reaches the insect zzso by passing through zzso barriers and develops zzso During invasion, the zzso was predicted to express a large set of zzso including zzso one of which was zzso and expressed in this zzso A zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso containing a zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso mature zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and a theoretical zzso of zzso was cloned from the zzso stage of the zzso zzso analyses predicted signature sequences of the zzso zzso family, an zzso domain, a zzso motif and a zzso turn zzso therefore, this protein was identified as an zzso and designated as zzso The zzso domain of zzso has an zzso acid sequence zzso of zzso to zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso Like zzso of zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso was produced in an zzso coli system and was zzso by affinity zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso protein matched the zzso sequence with a significance score of zzso zzso was produced in the correct folding zzso showed activities against gelatin and zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso presented an optimum pH of zzso and temperature of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso is zzso in the zzso stage and is strongly induced in zzso by insect zzso thus suggesting that it plays a role in the zzso zzso
