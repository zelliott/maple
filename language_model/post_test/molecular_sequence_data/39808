Human zzso zzso receptors zzso characteristically bind zzso zzso in a zzso way via their zzso recognition domain zzso Their zzso preference is dependent on the zzso acid sequence in the zzso domain and on the ability and flexibility of the zzso domain to accommodate sugar zzso that are located at different distances from each other in the zzso Although microbial and zzso cells are able to produce similar zzso zzso the density of carbohydrates on microbes is much higher compared to zzso zzso Despite this difference, carbohydrates present on both cell types can be recognized by the zzso These receptors are predominantly expressed by zzso presenting cells such as zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso family, zzso function as pattern recognition receptors by recognizing zzso patterns on zzso This usually results in zzso of the zzso zzso degradation and subsequent loading of zzso peptides into major zzso complex molecules for zzso zzso However, several pathogens have developed ways to exploit the zzso to evade immune zzso by for example escaping from the zzso degradation zzso or by inducing zzso zzso When zzso bind zzso zzso zzso they mediate several processes like zzso zzso and clearance of zzso cells like tumor cells or zzso zzso
