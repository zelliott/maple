The zzso zzso gene in zzso acts both zzso and zzso to provide essential functions during zzso zzso zzso expression is required by zzso for the regulation of sex determination and dosage zzso zzso zzso expression is required throughout zzso for the formation of the peripheral nervous system and perhaps for the proper functioning of genes in zzso regions of the zzso during zzso stages for growth and differentiation of the future adult zzso and in the zzso part of the zzso of adult females for proper egg membrane zzso Here we describe the cloning of da by the zzso tagging approach as well as some aspects of the molecular characterization of zzso and zzso zzso Despite the multiple zzso roles of zzso the organization and expression of this gene appear relatively simple at this level of zzso The gene codes for two zzso present in both sexes and at all stages of zzso The zzso sequence of a nearly full-length zzso predicts a protein product of zzso zzso acids that shares sequence similarity with the zzso repeat of the zzso genes zzso and zzso Two zzso da zzso (one of which is temperature zzso appear to be caused by DNA insertions in the zzso region of the zzso
