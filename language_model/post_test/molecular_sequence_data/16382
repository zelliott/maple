The sequence of the human zzso encodes the genetic instructions for human zzso as well as rich information about human zzso In 2001, the International Human Genome zzso zzso reported a draft sequence of the zzso portion of the human zzso Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a zzso sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete zzso Here, we report the result of this finishing zzso The current zzso sequence zzso zzso contains zzso billion zzso interrupted by only zzso zzso It covers approximately zzso of the zzso zzso and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 zzso Many of the remaining zzso gaps are associated with zzso zzso and will require focused work with new zzso The near-complete zzso the first for a zzso greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human zzso including studies of gene number, birth and zzso zzso the human zzso seems to zzso only zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades zzso
