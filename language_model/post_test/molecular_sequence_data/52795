zzso display was used to isolate genes zzso expressed early in fruit development of apple zzso zzso zzso This approach resulted in the isolation of zzso a zzso gene with a zzso similar to that of zzso zzso which is involved in regulation of zzso development in zzso However, outside the zzso zzso is quite different from zzso In apple, zzso zzso was predominantly found in flowers, expanding leaves and expanding zzso In zzso flowers, in zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso accumulated in zzso To further investigate the function of this new zzso zzso zzso was transformed into zzso zzso under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso The transgenic zzso plants showed zzso reduced fertility and changes in zzso and fruit zzso zzso The size and shape of the cells in the transgenic fruit was zzso Both the transgenic zzso in zzso and the expression pattern of this gene in apple are consistent with the idea that zzso is likely to play an important role in control of plant zzso
