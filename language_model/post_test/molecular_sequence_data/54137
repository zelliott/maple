zzso Yellow zzso India zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso causes the yellow mosaic disease in a number of economically important edible grain zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soybean zzso zzso The disease is zzso critical, open spread and zzso heavy yield losses zzso The objective of this study is to develop molecular markers linked to zzso to facilitate zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso molecular markers were successfully developed from consensus motifs of other resistance zzso gene or R gene zzso zzso zzso linked zzso zzso plant breeders can carry out repeated zzso throughout the growing season in absence of any disease zzso Two zzso marker zzso zzso and zzso were identified and of these two zzso is completely linked with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The present study demonstrated that these two markers could be efficiently employed together in a zzso for zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from field grown plants and also directly from the seed zzso This method of zzso would save time and zzso during the zzso of zzso through molecular zzso as methods of zzso against zzso are zzso zzso and time zzso
