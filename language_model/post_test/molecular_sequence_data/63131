The development of expressed sequence tags zzso for zzso zzso libraries and their deposition in publicly accessible databases has generated a rich resource for zzso discovery in this commercially and ecologically important zzso zzso Here, we have conducted in zzso searches of these databases for zzso zzso zzso putative zzso precursors using the zzso program zzso and have predicted the mature forms of the peptides zzso by zzso The primary strategy used was to query the database with known zzso zzso sequences or, in some instances, insect precursor protein zzso For zzso for which no zzso are known, the peptides themselves were used as zzso For those peptides expected to originate from a common zzso the individual sequences were combined, with each zzso flanked by a zzso processing site and, if zzso a zzso zzso Using these approaches, 13 zzso zzso zzso putative zzso precursors were zzso For example, using the first strategy, putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso and zzso were zzso Similarly, several zzso zzso zzso zzso putative zzso precursors were zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a red zzso concentrating zzso zzso were identified from the zzso zzso zzso as was one zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso peptides from the zzso zzso zzso Using the second strategy, we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso recently discovered via mass zzso from Cancer zzso Using mass spectral methods we confirmed that this zzso is also present in zzso zzso zzso over 50 novel zzso peptides were predicted from the identified zzso providing a strong foundation for future investigations of the evolution, regulation and function of these and related molecules in this zzso zzso
