We describe here the molecular cloning and expression analysis of mouse zzso zzso a key zzso in cell signal zzso A mouse brain zzso library was screened in order to isolate the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso The predicted open reading frame encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of 85 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence exhibits zzso and zzso identity with the sequence of rat and human zzso zzso The zzso zzso was highly expressed in brain, heart, zzso and zzso We found that transcripts of zzso are present in almost all regions of mouse brain zzso zzso that the zzso may play a role in some fundamental cellular process in zzso In male zzso zzso zzso zzso was widely expressed in the zzso as well as in the zzso In zzso zzso studies indicate that distribution of zzso zzso in mouse zzso is discrete and zzso The expression of zzso zzso was defined in the periphery of each zzso zzso especially in zzso which might imply that zzso plays a role in proliferation of zzso To the best our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the high expression of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso may carry out fundamental roles in almost all of mouse zzso especially in brain and specific roles in zzso
