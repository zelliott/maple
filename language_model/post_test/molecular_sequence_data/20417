zzso from dietary sources or from de zzso synthesis are transported while bound to proteins to other zzso where they are used for cell membrane synthesis or stored for energy zzso In cell zzso or in zzso lipids can undergo several modifications that are important in cell zzso Several proteins orchestrate the zzso zzso and modification of zzso Thus, the intersection of lipids and proteins is important in human zzso zzso Recent advances in mass zzso and zzso have made it possible to obtain compositional zzso and zzso data of zzso molecular species and proteins in biological zzso This combination of zzso and zzso is advantageous because it allows us to better define zzso zzso discover new drug targets, and better understand the zzso of several zzso
