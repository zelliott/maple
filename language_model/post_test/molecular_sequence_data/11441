zzso occurring sequences containing repetitive zzso motifs have the potential to form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA shows some regions where one strand is composed mainly of G and T zzso zzso These regions contain several stretches of zzso zzso An zzso was constructed with the sequence corresponding to one of these regions zzso It was demonstrated by native gel zzso and zzso protection that zzso forms zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso structures stabilized through zzso zzso DNA formation by this sequence could have biological relevance as it can be formed in zzso conditions and zzso regions comprise approximately one-third of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
