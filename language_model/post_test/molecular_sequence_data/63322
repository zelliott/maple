The zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso is expressed by regulatory zzso cells and has the unique ability to recognize chemically diverse zzso presented by zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso to a natural, zzso zzso zzso zzso illustrates the extent of this diversity when compared to the binding of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso A single mode of recognition for these two classes of zzso would then appear problematic for a single T cell zzso However, the zzso zzso adopts two different zzso in the crystal where, in one zzso the presence of a larger cavity between the two zzso regions could accommodate zzso and, in the other, a smaller cavity fits zzso more zzso zzso the extended zzso zzso could be zzso upon zzso of the zzso and zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the same zzso may adopt alternative modes of recognition for these foreign and zzso for zzso cell zzso
