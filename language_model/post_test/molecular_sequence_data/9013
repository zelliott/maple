Phase variable zzso zzso systems have been identified in a range of zzso zzso In some it has been demonstrated that the random switching of the mod zzso zzso gene mediates the coordinated expression of multiple genes and constitutes a zzso zzso variable zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso contain a highly zzso DNA recognition domain zzso that defines the target sequence that is modified by zzso and is used to define zzso zzso 18 distinct zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso To determine the origin of zzso zzso the 18 zzso zzso were used to search the available databases for similar zzso zzso matches were identified between several zzso zzso and mod gene from distinct bacterial species, indicating one source of the zzso zzso was via horizontal gene zzso zzso of zzso sequences revealed significant zzso indicating exchange between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of high zzso and zzso similarity indicate that some zzso zzso had undergone zzso more frequently than others, generating further zzso Furthermore, the zzso from some zzso zzso such as zzso have been transferred en bloc to replace the zzso from different zzso zzso
