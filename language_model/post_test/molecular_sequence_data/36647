A zzso expression zzso was constructed to direct the synthesis of foreign proteins in zzso coli as zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso location zzso zzso The ability of zzso to bind to zzso immobilized zzso was zzso in zzso fused target zzso A large proportion of the zzso zzso delta zzso formed inclusion bodies which adopted the active zzso at considerably high zzso concentration zzso zzso delta zzso zzso By lowering the zzso temperature the proportion of the soluble delta zzso was slightly zzso zzso expressed delta zzso provides a potential affinity handle which forms easily zzso inclusion bodies increasing the yield and stability, and possibly allows the expression of lethal target zzso Interestingly, the interaction between one model fusion protein delta zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso coli heat shock protein zzso was zzso
