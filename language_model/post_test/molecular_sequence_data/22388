We have explored the evolution of the zzso gene family by comparative sequence and zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso Our analyses reveal the existence of a new zzso gene lineage in zzso that is related to the zzso genes of birds, zzso and zzso The gene is located in the middle of the zzso gene cluster of a zzso zzso zzso and of zzso It exists in a wide variety of additional zzso including zzso cows, zzso and dogs, but is a zzso in American zzso zzso analyses suggest that the gene has generally evolved under zzso selection, indicative of a functional zzso The presence of zzso products in humans, zzso and cows also suggest that the gene is expressed and likely to be zzso The analyses support the hypothesis that the zzso gene lineage has an ancient evolutionary origin that predates the divergence of zzso The structural similarity of zzso gene clusters of zzso and humans suggest that an eight gene cluster zzso including seven zzso genes and one zzso zzso gene zzso existed in the common zzso of all zzso and zzso zzso This basic structure has remained relatively stable in zzso and in the lineage leading to humans, although zzso has been lost from the zzso gene cluster of zzso
