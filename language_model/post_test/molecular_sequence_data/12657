zzso zzso protein zzso was originally discovered as the tumor product that causes zzso zzso of zzso zzso is now known to be widely expressed in many normal fetal zzso where it may participate in the regulation of zzso In this report, we document that zzso of zzso in zzso cells in the zzso zzso of transgenic mice resulted in a form of breast zzso characterized by a profound zzso in branching zzso of the developing zzso duct zzso In addition, transgenic mice zzso a zzso in zzso development during pregnancy that seemed to be, in part, the consequence of an impaired ability to form terminal ducts in response to zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso on branching zzso during breast development appeared to be the result of zzso zzso sequences that signal through the zzso zzso since zzso of zzso hormone itself in the zzso zzso of transgenic mice caused a similar development zzso and delivery of zzso zzso via locally implanted zzso zzso impaired breast development in normal zzso These results suggest that zzso which is a native product of zzso zzso and zzso cells may participate in normal breast development, perhaps as a locally zzso growth zzso
