The Mexican zzso zzso zzso carries the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso that results in a failure of zzso zzso zzso to form hearts that beat because of an absence of organized zzso Our previous studies have shown that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of promoting zzso and heart beating in the zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that the zzso gene is essential for zzso zzso expression in zzso hearts during zzso Gene expression studies show that zzso expression of various zzso zzso in zzso zzso hearts and in normal hearts knocked down with zzso zzso zzso are similar to zzso zzso However, at the protein level, selected zzso zzso are significantly reduced in zzso and zzso treated normal zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in controlling the translation or zzso of various TM zzso and subsequently of regulating cardiac zzso
