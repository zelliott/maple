The free solution zzso of curved and normal zzso DNA fragments have been measured in buffer solutions containing various quantities of the organic zzso zzso ethanol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso The curved fragment, taken from the zzso gene of zzso contains five zzso spaced A- and zzso in a centrally located zzso zzso the A- and zzso have been zzso to other sequences in the normal zzso zzso The free solution mobility of the curved zzso zzso is significantly lower than that of its normal counterpart in zzso solutions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005, 33, zzso The zzso of both the curved and normal fragments decrease with increasing zzso zzso due to the effect of the zzso on the zzso and zzso constant of the zzso The mobility differences between the curved and normal zzso fragments and the mobility ratios decrease approximately zzso with the increasing mole fraction of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and other organic zzso affect DNA zzso mobility by a common zzso most likely the preferential zzso of the DNA surface that occurs in zzso zzso The gradual loss of the zzso slow mobility of the curved zzso zzso with increasing zzso zzso combined with other data in the literature, suggests that preferential zzso gradually widens the narrow zzso minor groove, releasing zzso zzso in the minor groove and shifting the zzso toward that of normal zzso
