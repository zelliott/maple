We cloned a zzso zzso a novel zzso named zzso zzso from the sea zzso a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the newly identified zzso zzso is zzso The architecture of the precursor is similar to that reported for other zzso precursors consisting of a signal zzso zzso a downstream processing site, and a zzso zzso however, the gene for zzso zzso does not have zzso in comparison with the gene organization for all other zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor transcript was widely expressed in a variety of zzso In zzso zzso of the brain showed expression and zzso of the transcript in the zzso zzso and zzso regions, whereas zzso using a specific zzso showed only zzso cell bodies and processes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to stimulate the zzso axis using in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso was also shown to activate the zzso zzso signaling system in zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso These studies provide evidence for a novel zzso zzso that has a role as a third zzso zzso In zzso the newly discovered zzso zzso offers a new paradigm of the origin of the zzso zzso zzso We zzso that due to a zzso zzso event, an ancestral gene gave rise to two lineages of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
