zzso the major zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Its zzso domain is surrounded by an zzso zzso region rich in Ala, zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is of low complexity and unknown function, and a zzso region composed of five zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Here, we investigate the contribution of these two accessory zzso and of zzso to zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is an zzso and identify the pattern of zzso (21 zzso of its zzso zzso The zzso process is zzso as zzso zzso from zzso zzso is not zzso We therefore explored the functional role of zzso by zzso different truncated versions of zzso that were either zzso or zzso We show that zzso zzso are able to bind PG and are responsible for zzso targeting to the zzso of dividing cells, whereas the zzso domain and its zzso are not involved in this zzso zzso our data reveal that the lack of zzso of the zzso domain significantly increases zzso zzso activity, whereas removal of zzso PG binding zzso dramatically reduces this zzso Based on this zzso role, we propose a model in which access of the zzso zzso domain to its zzso may be hindered by the zzso domain where zzso changes its zzso and/or mediates zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that zzso is shown to control the activity of a bacterial zzso
