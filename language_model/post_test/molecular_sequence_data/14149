The zzso of the green zzso zzso zzso contains approximately 15 gene clusters of the zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and at least one zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso gene zzso were isolated from a zzso library, physically zzso and the zzso sequences of three zzso of each core zzso gene species and one linked zzso gene zzso The core zzso genes are organized in clusters of zzso and zzso pairs, in which each gene pair shows zzso divergent zzso from a short zzso 300 zzso zzso zzso These zzso regions contain typically zzso promoter zzso namely a zzso and the three motifs zzso zzso and zzso Different from the genes of higher plants, but like those of animals and the related zzso zzso the 3' untranslated regions contain no zzso A zzso but a zzso sequence zzso zzso essential for zzso processing is zzso One single zzso gene was found in close linkage to a zzso zzso The zzso upstream region contains the zzso promoter element zzso (also found upstream of the core zzso zzso and two specific sequence motifs that are shared only with the zzso zzso zzso This suggests differential zzso of the zzso and the core zzso zzso The zzso gene is interrupted by two zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso the three zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA demonstrated, however, that at least 8 of the about 15 zzso genes do contain one zzso at a zzso zzso In synchronized zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso levels zzso of all core zzso zzso peak during cell division, suggesting strict zzso gene zzso The derived zzso sequences place zzso zzso core zzso closer to plants than to animals, except that the zzso zzso are more zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Organization of the core zzso gene in pairs, and zzso of zzso are features shared with animals, whereas zzso sequences and zzso elements are shared with higher plants, assigning the zzso zzso genes a position intermediate between animals and zzso
