zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso elevated in patients with chronic motor zzso and zzso zzso We have cloned six zzso zzso zzso from zzso of five affected zzso zzso and zzso gene analysis demonstrated substantial zzso zzso predominantly clustered around zzso zzso and zzso in all six zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from three different patients, are zzso by closely related zzso gene segments with restricted zzso zzso The corresponding L chains are zzso by V zzso II and V zzso VIII genes and also share the same zzso structures, containing zzso deletions at the zzso boundary to form a zzso of 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso segments show zzso identities of zzso and zzso respectively, to the zzso member zzso and zzso shows zzso identity to the closely related zzso member, zzso The zzso zzso and zzso derived from a single patient and containing the same zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso with zzso identities of zzso and zzso respectively, and have both common and unique zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso has zzso identity to the zzso member, zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by both diverse and closely related V genes in association with restricted zzso structures, and that their V genes are zzso zzso consistent with an origin through an zzso immune zzso
