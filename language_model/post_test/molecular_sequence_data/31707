A zzso curved to twisted zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from freshwater collected from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were observed to be zzso negative, zzso negative and zzso zzso The major fatty acids zzso % of the total) were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was determined to be zzso zzso The major polar lipids were identified as zzso zzso one unknown zzso and one unknown zzso The major zzso was determined to be zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso forms an evolutionary lineage within the zzso zzso and its nearest zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso of stain zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of only zzso zzso The zzso characteristics indicate the strain zzso can be distinguished from the sole member of the zzso zzso On the basis of the data presented in this study, strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
