We have identified and isolated zzso clones of the 33 zzso protein of the zzso complex zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and determined their zzso zzso The zzso clones and zzso prepared against zzso were used as zzso to examine the expression of the zzso gene with respect to regulation by light, organ zzso and zzso stage of tomato zzso The zzso zzso level is regulated by light, being present in zzso plants and absent in zzso zzso The zzso transcripts that accumulate during growth in the light were reduced to zzso or low levels by a zzso dark zzso The zzso gene also exhibits differential expression in various zzso of the tomato zzso zzso zzso level was highest in immature leaves and absent in roots while the protein was most abundant in mature leaves and absent in zzso During tomato fruit zzso zzso zzso decreases to a low level in the zzso while the protein level decreases below zzso The expression of zzso appears to be under the control of a complex mechanism regulating both the amount of zzso and its zzso
