We have previously shown that the zzso duplicated 27 zzso zzso storage protein locus underwent zzso zzso to yield a zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso line zzso This zzso contains a new zzso zzso designated zzso This middle repetitive element of zzso zzso had two long terminal repeats, a primer binding site, a zzso tract and a zzso open reading frame of 375 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region were detected by the zzso chain reaction zzso in certain zzso zzso and Western blots detected the zzso protein in the same zzso Moreover, the product of this zzso zzso was shown to contain the same zzso site and 3' zzso as zzso suggesting that this zzso occurs with unusual zzso zzso elements were found to be present in zzso and not present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
