Previously, we generated human zzso zzso using peripheral blood zzso cells from an zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso clone 3, zzso recognized 10 zzso acids zzso within the zzso region zzso I) of the zzso envelope zzso zzso and neutralized infection of target cells with different laboratory zzso Because the zzso recognized by zzso has two zzso zzso that could potentially produce a zzso loop in zzso we analyzed binding of our zzso zzso to the zzso and linear motif of the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not bind to the synthetic zzso zzso but did recognize the linear zzso Two zzso rabbit zzso against both the linear and zzso peptides were then zzso Both zzso bound to viral zzso zzso and zzso but neither zzso neutralized zzso laboratory zzso Using a set of zzso zzso zzso we analyzed binding of zzso zzso and zzso The profile of binding of zzso zzso to these peptides was different from that of zzso to the same zzso This suggests that zzso recognized a unique zzso core zzso which was not zzso in either the zzso or the linear zzso peptides used as zzso in the zzso
