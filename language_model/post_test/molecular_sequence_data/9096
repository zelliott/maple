The zzso of zzso zzso zzso determines if toxic zzso are zzso The zzso structure by its turn depends on the environment and zzso zzso We characterized the secondary structure of zzso in zzso solutions and interacting with zzso The zzso adopts zzso structure in solutions of zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso alters the critical zzso concentration value of the zzso zzso underlining zzso zzso At zzso zzso the zzso forms zzso when its concentration at the surface is high zzso These results suggest that only zzso interactions of charged zzso that surround completely the zzso are able to induce zzso zzso zzso
