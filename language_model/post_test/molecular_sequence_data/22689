zzso modification of proteins by the small zzso modifier zzso regulates diverse biological zzso zzso usually requires a consensus zzso through which the binding of the zzso zzso zzso to the target protein is zzso However, additional specificity zzso are in many cases zzso To gain insights into zzso zzso selection, we have zzso the differential zzso of highly similar loop structures within the zzso zzso of heat shock zzso factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso in combination with molecular modeling revealed that the zzso specificity is determined by several zzso acids near the consensus site, which are likely to present the zzso consensus motif to zzso zzso we also demonstrate that zzso of the zzso loop zzso zzso zzso activity, without affecting its zzso zzso zzso modification of the zzso loop contributes to zzso regulation of DNA binding and zzso the concept of zzso in the negative regulation of gene zzso
