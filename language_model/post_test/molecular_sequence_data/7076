zzso zzso zzso channels were first described in sensory zzso where they are important for primary zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA zzso from rat zzso root zzso that had properties dissimilar to those of sensory zzso We also found zzso for zzso zzso zzso 8) and zzso zzso 9) in sensory zzso channels expressed from individual zzso did not reproduce those of sensory zzso zzso of zzso with zzso but not other combinations, yielded zzso currents that closely resembled those in sensory zzso These properties could not be accounted for by addition of the two sets of channels, indicating that a new channel had formed by zzso zzso Although in some zzso responses to zzso can be accounted for by zzso channels, our results indicate that zzso channels of sensory zzso may form by a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso
