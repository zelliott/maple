The purpose of this investigation was to study in zzso rats the blood pressure, zzso and zzso responses to zzso a structural analogue of zzso zzso peptides zzso The zzso was infused zzso for 20 zzso at doses of either 1 or 20 zzso in zzso rats as well as in rats with intact zzso The experiments were started 2 h after preparation of the rats under zzso zzso In zzso rats, the small dose of zzso lowered blood pressure and raised zzso In those rats, the larger dose of the zzso zzso had no blood pressure lowering effect, but still increased zzso zzso had no effect on heart rate, both in rats with and without zzso zzso given at the 1 zzso dose to normal rats caused a significant increase in urinary Na zzso The large dose, however, did not modify this zzso The effect of zzso (1 zzso for 20 zzso on zzso nerve activity was evaluated in other normal rats after a recovery period of 24 h from surgical zzso Integrated nerve activity was found to significantly increase in parallel with heart rate while blood pressure was zzso Taken together, these results show that a low dose of zzso lowers blood pressure and zzso an increase in urinary Na zzso and zzso They also indicate that the blood pressure and zzso effects of the zzso are abolished when a high dose is zzso In addition, it appears that the shift of fluid from the zzso to the zzso zzso reflected in zzso rats by an increase in zzso does not depend on the level of systemic blood zzso Finally, the present observations suggest that the blood pressure lowering effect of zzso is accompanied in the conscious rat by a stimulation of the sympathetic nervous zzso
