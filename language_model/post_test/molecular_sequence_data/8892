The malaria zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso the active form of vitamin zzso In the present study, we have shown that the de zzso zzso zzso is used by the zzso to zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso a highly destructive zzso oxygen species arising from zzso zzso The formation of zzso and the response of the zzso were monitored by zzso zzso zzso by zzso analysis and by determination of zzso levels in the zzso zzso experiments of transgenic zzso zzso the vitamin zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearly demonstrated an interaction of the two proteins in zzso which results in an elevated zzso level from zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso cells and thus to a higher tolerance towards zzso In contrast, by applying the zzso effect on the cellular level using inactive zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso becomes susceptible to zzso Our results demonstrate clearly the crucial role of vitamin B6 zzso in the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Besides the known role of zzso as a zzso of many essential zzso this second important task of the vitamin B6 de zzso synthesis as zzso emphasizes the high potential of this zzso as a target of new zzso zzso
