zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex differ in resistance to zzso killing by human zzso Here, we characterize complement sensitivity of a panel of zzso zzso zzso derived from ticks collected in Germany and zzso as well as one zzso zzso zzso All zzso are highly susceptible to zzso zzso in human serum and activate complement predominantly by the alternative pathway, leading to an increased deposition of complement components zzso zzso and the terminal complement zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to bind immune regulator factor H zzso and some strains also bound zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso bound to the surface of zzso zzso was inefficient in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the identification and characterization of a potential zzso zzso zzso revealed that this zzso possesses a significantly reduced binding capacity for zzso compared to that of zzso zzso zzso expressed by various zzso zzso zzso This finding suggests that a reduced binding capability of zzso is associated with an increased serum sensitivity of zzso zzso to human zzso
