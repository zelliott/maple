zzso differentiation of a bovine zzso zzso in the course of zzso is characterized by significant increase of zzso expression of genes zzso milk proteins zzso zzso zzso The zzso is known as a ubiquitous zzso factor which zzso a zzso zzso of different genes (including zzso cooperating with zzso and other ubiquitous zzso zzso We have observed a dramatic increase of zzso activity in nuclear extracts of bovine zzso zzso during zzso The zzso zzso factor appears to have a zzso precursor zzso This zzso precursor as well as zzso B zzso precursor could be activated in zzso by zzso zzso treatment which caused possibly zzso of a complex of zzso and its zzso zzso There was an inverse proportion between zzso of active nuclear zzso factor and its zzso zzso We have observed an increase of nuclear factor binding and a simultaneous decrease of the zzso precursor pool in the course of zzso We have determined the zzso protein zzso composition using zzso zzso labeled zzso with nuclear and zzso proteins of zzso zzso The main zzso of zzso factor were zzso and zzso The drastic increase of nuclear zzso binding activity was correlated with significant increase of the zzso zzso concentration in nuclear protein during zzso
