The human insulin zzso is a zzso consisting of two zzso linked by zzso zzso Each zzso comprises an zzso that is entirely zzso and a zzso that spans the cell zzso The zzso has a total of 37 zzso zzso most of which form zzso zzso bonds, whereas the zzso contains 10 zzso zzso four of which are in the zzso zzso There are two classes of zzso bonds in the insulin zzso those that can be reduced under mild reducing conditions to give zzso zzso zzso I) and those that require stronger reducing conditions zzso zzso The number of class I zzso is small and includes the zzso zzso bond zzso In this report we describe the use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso 11 plus form of the zzso zzso to identify zzso linkages between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The latter bond is the sole zzso link in the zzso and implies a side-by-side alignment of the two zzso III zzso of the zzso Also presented is evidence for additional zzso zzso zzso involving at least one of the zzso zzso of the zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso Evidence is also presented to show that zzso exists as a buried zzso in the soluble zzso
