We had previously identified an zzso responsive protein zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso rat zzso which is zzso distinct from complement zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso followed by sequence zzso analysis showed that this protein is a new member of a class of zzso responsive proteins in the zzso zzso chain reaction with a zzso specific primer yielded partial sequence information of its zzso The observed pattern of zzso message in the zzso during the various stages of the zzso cycle in the rat suggested a possible regulation of zzso message by zzso zzso sequencing of zzso message and its promoter zzso would provide insight into the mechanism of its regulation by zzso
