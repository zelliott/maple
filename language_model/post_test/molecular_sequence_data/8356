A possible role of zzso virus zzso in the zzso of zzso germ cell zzso has been suggested zzso but direct evidence for an association of zzso cancer with zzso is zzso We examined 26 cases of classical zzso two zzso zzso and 12 cases of zzso or combined germ cell tumors for the presence and cellular location of zzso with a combined approach using the zzso chain reaction and zzso in zzso zzso for zzso small zzso zzso After exclusion of cases without zzso DNA, zzso zzso zzso but none of the other tumors, were positive for zzso by zzso chain zzso In zzso zzso for zzso showed rare positive zzso probably zzso infected zzso in two of these four zzso zzso No zzso tumor cells were found in any of the analyzed zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso cells was not correlated to the frequency of zzso zzso including zzso which were present in zzso in significant zzso Our study demonstrates the absence of zzso from the zzso cells of zzso germ cell tumors and makes a direct role of zzso in the development of these zzso zzso Whether the presence of zzso zzso in some zzso simply reflects the normal occurrence of zzso infected cells in zzso tissue of zzso individuals or is influenced by local factors remains to be zzso
