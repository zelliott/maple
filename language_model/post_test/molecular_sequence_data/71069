Analysis of the zzso coli zzso capsule gene cluster identified two regions, regions 1 and 3, zzso between different group III capsule gene zzso Region 1 encodes zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and region 3 encodes zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso abolished zzso capsule production, suggesting that expression of the zzso capsule was regulated by zzso in a manner analogous to group II capsule gene zzso An zzso element and a zzso zzso both of which may have played a role in the acquisition of group III capsule gene zzso were detected zzso the zzso capsule zzso
