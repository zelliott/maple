DNA sequencing upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes previously identified in the zzso zzso major zzso island zzso Zhang, zzso Morris, and zzso zzso Gene zzso 1997) identified a further 10 zzso genes apparently forming a zzso zzso The product of the zzso zzso zzso protein (a putative type zzso structural zzso was zzso and an zzso zzso was raised in zzso zzso of zzso zzso either lacking the whole zzso zzso or with an zzso zzso in the zzso gene were constructed, as was a strain in which the zzso to zzso genes were driven by the zzso zzso The zzso strains zzso type zzso zzso as judged by zzso zzso in the electron microscope of thin zzso in culture zzso of one such strain and zzso the presence of zzso protein (smaller than the zzso protein by removal of the leader zzso on zzso of material zzso by high-speed zzso of either the culture zzso or zzso of zzso zzso Control zzso zzso did not express the zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso entered human zzso zzso cells in culture to levels only 5 to zzso of those of the zzso strain, and zzso zzso entry was strongly inhibited by soluble zzso protein zzso zzso of entry at zzso zzso zzso
