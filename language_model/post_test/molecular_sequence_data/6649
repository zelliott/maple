A series of zzso are described which contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed from a variety of zzso both regulated and zzso The regulated promoters include the zzso promoter which can be induced by zzso and zzso promoters which are zzso activated in zzso zzso One zzso contains zzso with a strong zzso translation initiation context, but no promoter, and thus acts as a zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso deletion strain of zzso coli, and a zzso designed for use in zzso mapping using zzso are zzso The zzso zzso are constructed in a zzso system which can be transferred to zzso bacteria by zzso and will form stable zzso zzso Due to the absence of zzso activity in plants and many bacteria of economic importance, these zzso constitute powerful new tools for studying the ecology and population biology of bacteria in the environment and in association with plants, as well as for studies of the fundamental molecular basis of such zzso The variety of zzso available for zzso enable both quantitative zzso and spatial zzso of marked bacteria to be carried zzso
