Human programmed cell death 5 zzso is a protein playing a significant role in regulating both the zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso findings show that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso and also has a potential ability to interact with zzso Here we aim to zzso characterize the nature of the interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso and to depict the binding mode between two zzso The zzso binding zzso were determined by zzso experiments performed with zzso and various fragments of zzso zzso The binding affinity was investigated using the zzso zzso zzso Analysis revealed that the zzso binding site on zzso is localized within zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso while zzso binds zzso to the positively charged surface region around the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso The binding is mainly zzso through zzso zzso The present data suggested a model for the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso
