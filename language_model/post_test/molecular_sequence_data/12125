zzso gene transfer into bone zzso cells is extensively used in gene therapy zzso zzso are needed for zzso to achieve a high rate of gene zzso However, the zzso cell compartment of bone zzso is characterized by rapid proliferation even without zzso In this study, human bone zzso zzso cells were isolated and subsequently infected with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso used in this study carries the bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso zzso efficiency was significantly enhanced by repeated cycles of infection, with a maximum of zzso zzso cells by four rounds of zzso zzso of the zzso was detected by zzso from all zzso cells selected by zzso After culture in zzso for 3 months, cells were still positive for zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso cells were also injected into zzso mice to study their zzso and survival ability in zzso
