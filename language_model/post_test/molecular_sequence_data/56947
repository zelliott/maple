The ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso and 29 zzso and the highly zzso zzso zzso N zzso (29 zzso share several zzso recognized by systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso Previous studies on the zzso of nuclear zzso recognized by human zzso have not zzso between ubiquitous and zzso zzso We set out to examine whether a zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso by comparing the zzso of the most unique sequences in this zzso zzso peptides from the two regions of least sequence zzso that occur between zzso N and zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso containing five zzso and an zzso zzso zzso containing four zzso were coupled to a carrier zzso These zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso from patients with zzso Of 43 zzso with zzso zzso six bound to the zzso zzso zzso but not to the N zzso None of 17 zzso zzso zzso bound these zzso The second region of least sequence zzso between N and zzso zzso was not zzso Our data suggest that a subset of zzso patients with zzso zzso have zzso zzso capable of discriminating between zzso N and zzso zzso by binding a previously zzso zzso zzso The data also indicate that brain and zzso zzso zzso do not exist in zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso do not participate in the induction or maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso
