zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are among the most zzso of all zzso zzso due in part to massive amounts of zzso a small heat shock zzso that acts as a molecular zzso These zzso contain equally large amounts of another protein called zzso of previously unknown function, that we report on zzso Its zzso stability allows large-scale zzso in about a day, using ammonium zzso zzso and incubation at 70 degrees C for 7 zzso followed by gel zzso The latter yields an zzso complex from which the pure zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso We evaluated the possibility that zzso acts as a molecular zzso for zzso but obtained no evidence for that in zzso The association of zzso with zzso occurs at high temperatures and, although it is not yet clear whether zzso has a specific role as an zzso zzso it does bind zzso zzso which are then translated in zzso zzso is zzso some molecules resisting destruction after 30 zzso at 90 degrees zzso The first order rate constant for zzso and zzso of zzso at 85 degrees C is zzso zzso zzso which compares well with other zzso proteins of similar size ( approximately 500 zzso such as the zzso with which zzso has zzso acid sequence zzso The amount of zzso extracted from zzso that had been stored dry, under laboratory conditions, since 1951 is comparable to the amount in contemporary zzso indicating its stability in zzso and supporting the in zzso heating zzso
