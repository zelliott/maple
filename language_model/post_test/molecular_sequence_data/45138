The zzso gene zzso zzso channels are known to be crucial for life in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and humans zzso zzso The zzso genes known to date zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in various areas of the rat and mouse central nervous system zzso and zzso channel zzso alter firing zzso To assign zzso roles to each zzso it is necessary to design pharmacological strategies to distinguish individual zzso To this purpose, we have investigated the blocking properties of specific zzso zzso of zzso channels on the human and rat zzso In particular, we have tested zzso (from the scorpion zzso zzso zzso (from the scorpion zzso zzso and zzso (from the sea zzso zzso zzso Because these peptides had different zzso effects on the six different channels, we have also carried out a zzso characterization of zzso and zzso channels that turned out to be different from the rat zzso It emerged that zzso is exquisitely selective for zzso and does not compete with the other two zzso zzso discriminates well among the three rat zzso zzso is unable to block zzso but blocks zzso and has the lowest zzso for zzso zzso and zzso compete for zzso but not for zzso zzso Our findings should be helpful for zzso studies and for novel zzso zzso drug zzso
