Identification of zzso steps or components of zzso second zzso systems holds promise to effectively interfere with these pathways under pathological zzso The emerging literature on a recently identified family of zzso regulator zzso called zzso gives interesting clues for how these proteins seem to link several zzso signal processing systems zzso Via their unique way of action, zzso zzso the zzso and suppression of the various interacting zzso pathways and therefore appear to be key in determining cell fate while responding to environmental zzso This review zzso our current understanding of zzso function and also provides an evolutionary perspective on the various zzso zzso
