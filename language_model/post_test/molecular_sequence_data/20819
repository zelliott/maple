zzso acid binding protein 4 zzso is a candidate gene affecting zzso traits of zzso However, its association with zzso traits in cattle and other livestock species is not consistent from one study to zzso Here, we zzso the coding sequence of zzso looking for zzso zzso We identified a zzso site zzso between the third zzso and the third zzso of bovine zzso We zzso this zzso zzso in zzso cattle with intramuscular fat zzso from seven zzso The average zzso frequency of the C zzso was zzso with a range of zzso to zzso A zzso on the number of G zzso shows a statistically significant effect of alpha zzso zzso P zzso zzso This appears to confirm an association between zzso and variation at zzso with an effect of zzso of the variation in our sample when using this zzso
