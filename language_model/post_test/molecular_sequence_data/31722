It has been reported that an indigenous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was isolated from a real plant of membrane zzso zzso has promising potential to control zzso in zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso mechanisms by the strain zzso In this study, various characteristics of strain zzso were investigated to zzso its behavior in more detail in the mixed liquor of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of strain zzso showed a high degree of identity to zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the degradation product by strain zzso confirmed that it zzso AHL activity by zzso the zzso bond of zzso It zzso a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso but there was a large difference in the degradation rate of each AHL compared to other reported zzso strains belonging to zzso zzso Its zzso zzso activity was confirmed not only in the zzso zzso but also in the synthetic zzso Furthermore, the amount of strain zzso zzso in the vessel as well as the material of the vessel substantially affected the zzso zzso activity of strain zzso which provides useful information, particularly for the zzso control in a real zzso plant from an engineering point of zzso
