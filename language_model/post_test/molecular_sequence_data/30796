The zzso zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso is composed of a tandem collection of zzso a zzso domain, an zzso growth factor zzso domain, and two repeats common in complement regulatory zzso Here we demonstrate zzso of zzso to zzso 1, the portion zzso with zzso 1 in zzso This locus is inseparable in mouse strains from the zzso zzso cell surface marker zzso The data indicate that zzso is an zzso zzso on the zzso resulting from a single zzso acid interchange within the zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso and zzso recognize independent zzso and that zzso is distinct from the zzso binding zzso Application of zzso in the in zzso binding zzso shows zzso of binding of zzso to high zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso in this novel zzso protein suggests direct participation of the zzso domain in the zzso of zzso to zzso
