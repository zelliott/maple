The protein zzso D zzso family comprises zzso zzso protein zzso with three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A prominent zzso function is the regulation of zzso transport carrier zzso from the zzso network zzso To zzso zzso zzso zzso at this zzso we designed a molecular reporter consisting of a zzso zzso sequence fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso specifically targeted to the zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging revealed that zzso zzso of the reporter was strictly dependent on stimulation of zzso zzso or transient expression of active zzso zzso zzso zzso pharmacological zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppressed reporter zzso Using this reporter we investigated a potential role for zzso in the regulation of zzso complex zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso was associated with local zzso zzso as measured by reporter zzso and this was efficiently blocked by expression of a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our data thus identify a novel link between zzso activity and the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex integrity is zzso
