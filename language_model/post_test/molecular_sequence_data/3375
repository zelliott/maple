zzso is an zzso zzso protein believed to play a role in the regulation of cellular zzso Based on sequence analysis, this protein is classified as a member of the zzso zzso zzso All previous studies on zzso have been confined to the zzso level, and the protein has never been zzso and zzso In the present investigation, the zzso protein was zzso for the first zzso An zzso protein was isolated from the liver of black zzso zzso zzso by zzso on zzso zzso and zzso Blue zzso followed by ammonium zzso zzso The zzso protein was identified as zzso by the first 18 zzso zzso acid zzso which showed zzso identity with the deduced sequence of human zzso zzso mobility studies indicated that black zzso zzso is a zzso with a zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein indicated that it zzso the zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The longer zzso zzso and the aromatic zzso are also zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso is highly specific towards zzso as the zzso and is totally inactive towards zzso zzso zzso activity was found at about pH zzso
