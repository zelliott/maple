zzso in zzso cause an zzso zzso early onset familial form of Parkinson disease zzso However, little is presently known about the role of zzso in the more common sporadic form of zzso and in other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as zzso disease zzso Here we report that zzso is zzso damaged in the brains of patients with idiopathic zzso and zzso By using a combination of two-dimensional gel zzso and mass zzso we have identified 10 different zzso zzso of which the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and the basic zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are selectively accumulated in zzso and zzso frontal zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis shows that the total level of zzso protein is significantly increased in zzso and zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses reveal that zzso is not only susceptible to zzso zzso but also to previously zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso protein is zzso oxidized by zzso as well as by zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Our study provides new insights into the zzso modifications of zzso and indicates association of zzso damage to zzso with sporadic zzso and zzso
