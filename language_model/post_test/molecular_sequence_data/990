Recent reports show that numerous zzso proteins of zzso zzso are zzso on zzso zzso molecules containing one or two zzso genes zzso The genes for these zzso are zzso specific because their zzso from other zzso zzso are exclusively zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation, sequencing, and zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are organized in the same manner as in other zzso zzso and zzso the same kinds of zzso zzso as previous studies zzso However, intact zzso isolated from zzso zzso do not contain zzso nor do they contain DNA that zzso to zzso zzso Rather, zzso zzso zzso are localized in the nucleus as shown by cell zzso Southern zzso and in zzso zzso with zzso zzso A zzso DNA was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso but it is apparently not zzso in organization, as zzso with a cloned probe from the zzso DNA zzso The distinction between zzso zzso and other zzso zzso at the level of their zzso zzso is paralleled by zzso zzso zzso organization, which also differs from that of other zzso zzso indicating that a zzso underestimated diversity of zzso DNA zzso and zzso organization exists across various zzso zzso
