Cellular zzso is a form of irreversible growth arrest and a major tumor zzso zzso We show here that the zzso and zzso zzso families are zzso during induced and zzso zzso and that zzso requires zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of a reporter construct containing the zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso during zzso and repression is blocked by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso a reporter construct containing the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso and repression of the zzso zzso is reinstituted by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso that restore binding to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso introduction also zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso cellular DNA zzso Finally, interference with zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso regulate zzso expression by binding to its zzso and suggest that these zzso play an important role in zzso cellular zzso
