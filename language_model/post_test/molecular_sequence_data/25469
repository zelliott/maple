zzso M zzso zzso zzso the zzso step in zzso zzso The zzso has been characterized in detail from zzso zzso strain zzso and delta zzso which grow on zzso and CO2 as energy zzso During zzso of the zzso we have now discovered a second zzso M zzso zzso zzso in the two zzso which zzso at lower salt concentration from zzso columns than the zzso zzso I) previously zzso zzso II is similar to zzso I in that it is also composed of three different zzso zzso zzso and gamma but distinct from zzso I in that the gamma zzso is 5 zzso smaller, as revealed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and gamma zzso of zzso II and zzso I were found to be different in several zzso acid zzso The respective sequences zzso however, strong similarities indicating that zzso II was not derived from zzso I by limited zzso The relative amounts of zzso I and zzso II present in the cells were affected by the growth zzso When the cultures were supplied with sufficient zzso and and CO2 and the cells grew zzso essentially only zzso II was zzso When growth was limited by the gas supply, zzso I zzso
