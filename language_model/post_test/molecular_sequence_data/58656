zzso lox sites having an altered zzso region zzso lox zzso are not zzso for zzso zzso with the zzso 34 zzso zzso site, but can recombine with each zzso By placing different zzso lox sites at different zzso locations, zzso can catalyze independent DNA zzso events at multiple zzso in the same cell without concern that unwanted zzso zzso events will be zzso Such zzso lox sites also allow zzso to specifically target efficient integration of zzso DNA to zzso zzso sequences that naturally occur in the zzso zzso targeting occurs only with a DNA zzso carrying a zzso lox site in which the zzso region has been redesigned to match the zzso region of the targeted zzso zzso Moreover, in cells expressing a zzso active zzso zzso naturally occurring zzso sequences can exhibit almost zzso zzso zzso Thus, in the same cell, zzso lox sites can be used independently at multiple zzso for integration, for deletion and for enhanced zzso zzso thereby increasing the repertoire of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
