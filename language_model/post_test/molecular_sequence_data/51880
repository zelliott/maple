With a view to determine a minimal sequence length of zzso necessary for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, we developed a system, based on interaction between zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso were measured between zzso zzso zzso derivatives carrying zzso zzso gene zzso fragments of various zzso and a bacterial zzso The zzso zzso events resulted in zzso gene zzso zzso 70 zzso of zzso were found to be necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected when zzso was equal 25 zzso These data indicate that zzso requirement for zzso in zzso zzso differs from that in zzso zzso
