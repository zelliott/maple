zzso II zzso zzso is one of the zzso transferring zzso to the terminal zzso of zzso zzso Previously, we have reported that zzso II zzso increased zzso zzso cell zzso However, the mechanisms of its expression regulation have been rarely zzso Here, we cloned the zzso zzso region of the zzso II gene and zzso its promoter zzso The zzso activity and zzso expression level of zzso II were dramatically induced by zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso In response to DNA damage agent zzso the zzso expression and promoter activity of zzso II were significantly zzso and the binding of zzso to zzso II promoter was obviously zzso Furthermore, decreasing the expression of zzso II using zzso interference inhibited zzso zzso cell zzso induced by zzso zzso these results suggested that zzso II might serve as a target gene of zzso zzso factor during zzso zzso cell zzso which zzso a new mechanism of zzso cell zzso
