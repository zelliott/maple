zzso complement receptors play pivotal roles in the zzso mechanisms of the complement zzso Previously, we identified an zzso alpha zzso zzso from the solitary zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso To identify zzso beta zzso that pair with zzso to compose zzso complement zzso genes zzso beta zzso were cloned and characterized for their binding property to zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso two zzso beta transcripts zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso total zzso and the entire coding sequences of both zzso species were zzso The putative primary structure of each zzso gene product retained zzso characteristic for zzso beta zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are located outside of zzso zzso beta groups, zzso an independent cluster specific for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso all showed zzso expression on Northern zzso analysis, and zzso proteins of both beta zzso could bind to zzso on insect zzso The zzso zzso was expressed especially on the surface of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso In the zzso analysis of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso These observations showed that zzso and possibly zzso too, binds to zzso to comprise zzso molecules on zzso zzso which act as ancestral forms of complement receptors in the primitive complement system of zzso
