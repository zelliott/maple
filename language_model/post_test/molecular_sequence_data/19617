A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of genes that are involved in zzso acid and zzso zzso pathways under zzso acid zzso zzso has an zzso zzso domain in the central region and a zzso domain in the zzso that is divided into the zzso motif and zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to identify zzso acids in the zzso motif of zzso which are involved in zzso zzso we constructed zzso libraries in the zzso motif through an innovative application of random zzso zzso library made by zzso which were zzso randomly using the zzso distribution showed that the actual zzso frequency was in good agreement with expected zzso This method could save the time and effort to create a zzso library with a predictable zzso zzso Based on the studies using the zzso libraries constructed by the new method, the specific zzso of the zzso domain in zzso appear to be involved in the zzso activities on a zzso binding zzso
