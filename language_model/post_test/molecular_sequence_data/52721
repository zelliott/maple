zzso organisms produce proteins of exceptional zzso To understand protein zzso at the molecular level we studied a pair of cold shock zzso one of zzso and one of zzso origin, by systematic zzso Although the two proteins differ in sequence at 12 positions, two zzso zzso are responsible for the increase in stability of the zzso protein (by zzso zzso zzso at 70 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso originate from a predominantly zzso contribution of zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso from zzso interactions of zzso 66 at the zzso zzso The zzso protein could be converted to a highly zzso form by changing the zzso zzso at positions 3 and 66 to zzso and zzso zzso The variation of surface zzso may thus provide a simple and powerful approach for increasing the zzso of a zzso
