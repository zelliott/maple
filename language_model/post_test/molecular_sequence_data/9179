The region responsible for replication of zzso zzso zzso II zzso resembles those of plasmids that have repeated zzso binding sites zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso has additional features: Its zzso require full zzso for zzso zzso zzso which makes them inactive for a part of the cell cycle when they are zzso zzso also binds to a second kind of site, called zzso in a zzso independent zzso This binding is zzso to zzso zzso The site that zzso uses for zzso has not been zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso similar to the zzso serves as that site, as we find that it binds zzso in zzso and zzso to repress the zzso promoter in zzso The site is not subject to zzso and is likely to be active throughout the cell zzso The zzso like the zzso could inhibit zzso zzso replication in zzso coli, possibly by zzso with zzso via zzso bridges, as was seen in zzso The zzso thus appears to play a dual role in regulating zzso zzso one independent of the cell cycle, the other dependent upon zzso zzso hence responsive to the cell zzso
