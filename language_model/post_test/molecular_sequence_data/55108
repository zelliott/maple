By screening extracts of zzso from the Asian scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso for their abilities to activate zzso zzso we have identified zzso an zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a precursor that displays a signal sequence and contains four copies of zzso sequences and four of zzso all flanked by single zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and thus fulfill the characteristics expected of zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso zzso receptors with selectivity for the zzso zzso while zzso is inactive at zzso zzso The discovery of zzso suggests that scorpion zzso may represent a novel source of zzso molecules targeting G zzso receptors zzso and reveal additional insights on the evolution of the zzso zzso
