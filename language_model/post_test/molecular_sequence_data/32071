zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Analysis of zzso fragments revealed that three zzso existed, which corresponded to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Six bases changes that resulted in the changes of five zzso acids were found in the zzso structural gene of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso change that resulted in an zzso acid substitution was found in the zzso structural gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed that zzso zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An internal promoter was found in the upstream of the zzso gene from zzso zzso and it functioned in zzso coli, but a zzso exchange (A to zzso existed in zzso box of zzso The zzso genes from the zzso strain and its zzso were expressed both in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the specific zzso activities of transformed zzso zzso were much higher than that of the parental zzso The amplification of the activity of AS yielded zzso increase of zzso production, but the cell growth became slower than zzso
