The zzso zzso screening method was used to identify novel proteins that associate with human DNA zzso delta zzso zzso Two zzso were used in this zzso These were the large zzso and small zzso zzso of the core pol delta zzso zzso was the only positive isolated with zzso as the zzso Two novel protein partners, named zzso and zzso were identified from the zzso zzso In this study, the interaction of zzso with pol delta was further zzso zzso encodes a protein of 368 zzso acids whose C zzso is zzso with the bacterial zzso protein and with the F box A zzso It was found that zzso also interacts with zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso The ability of zzso to interact with both the zzso zzso of pol delta and with zzso was confirmed by pull-down zzso using zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso The zzso interaction was also demonstrated by zzso overlay zzso The association of zzso with pol delta was shown to occur in calf zzso tissue and zzso cell extracts by zzso pull-down and zzso zzso zzso was associated with pol delta isolated by zzso zzso The association of zzso with pol delta could also be demonstrated by native gel zzso
