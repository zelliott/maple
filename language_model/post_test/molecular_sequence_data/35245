Division of labor is a distinguishing characteristic of zzso zzso To understand the zzso factors underlying zzso determination, it is essential to clarify the zzso mechanisms during the differentiation of each zzso zzso soldiers have zzso and diverse zzso that are specialized for colony zzso Soldiers of the zzso zzso zzso one of the most derived zzso groups, possess a long, zzso frontal projection zzso an zzso zzso structure in the head zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso changes occur prior to the zzso into zzso (the preceding stage of zzso In zzso and other insects, zzso genes determine segment zzso thus they might be involved in such zzso modifications during soldier zzso zzso zzso functions not only in the formation of the zzso and zzso but also in other head parts zzso zzso zzso in other zzso In this study, we examined zzso functions in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Relative expression analyses showed that zzso expression levels in the zzso were significantly higher than those in any other body parts of workers before zzso zzso zzso zzso interference resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso but zzso and frontal zzso formation were not zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the determination of zzso zzso information and specific modification during zzso differentiation in zzso zzso This is the first work to show the effects of zzso genes on zzso zzso in social zzso
