As derived from a zzso zzso the structure of the zzso protein of zzso zzso a putative regulatory factor of zzso zzso has a central zzso region separated by two zzso covered by secondary structure zzso In this work, three zzso zzso clones were selected from two zzso libraries obtained from the zzso zzso lines zzso and zzso The zzso sequences of the complete coding region of each zzso zzso as well as long stretches of their zzso and 3' zzso regions, were zzso zzso are not present in the zzso zzso zzso Minor variations among the three genes and an earlier reported zzso zzso indicates that they constitute a gene family showing a characteristic zzso Such a zzso is highly evident in large segments of the upstream regulatory zzso Interestingly, when compared with zzso zzso or with gene zzso zzso the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso show three jumps of the reading frame in the central part of the coding region, resulting in a completely different sequence of the zzso protein central zzso In all cases, variations in the zzso and zzso zzso account only for zzso
