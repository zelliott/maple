zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, and can inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a zzso factor in a number of zzso systems, and this activity has been assumed to be a function of its zzso zzso zzso Here, we report cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was isolated in a functional screen of an egg zzso library for factors that modify early zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso through late zzso zzso and is expressed zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso region of the brain in zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes defective zzso zzso zzso extension movements in zzso induced animal zzso and zzso expression of a distinct subset of zzso induced zzso zzso Interestingly, expression of point or deletion zzso of the zzso Center zzso of zzso is essential for the zzso zzso activity of all zzso had effects on zzso development indistinguishable from those of wild type zzso These observations suggest the possibility that zzso has a novel activity in addition to its established function as an inhibitor of zzso zzso
