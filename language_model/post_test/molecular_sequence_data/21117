Cotton zzso as natural zzso are widely used in the textile industry in the zzso In order to find genes involved in fiber development, a zzso zzso as zzso zzso a novel zzso protein with 151 zzso acid zzso was isolated from cotton fiber zzso zzso The deduced protein shares high similarity with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso However, the zzso protein zzso absent of the partial zzso and normal zzso is shorter than zzso and zzso by the reason of gene zzso zzso during zzso The experimental results revealed that zzso was not a zzso zzso and it did not form zzso zzso transcripts were specifically accumulated in zzso zzso but no or very low signals of its expression were detected in other zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso promotes zzso cell zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis indicated that the transformed cells expressing zzso a zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso displayed the same zzso as that of the transformed cells with zzso The zzso of these data sets suggested that zzso protein may function in fiber cell zzso and its zzso domain and partial zzso are sufficient for this zzso
