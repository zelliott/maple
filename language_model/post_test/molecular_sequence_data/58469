zzso zzso 40 zzso and zzso 43 zzso do not form functional zzso gap junction zzso This property may contribute to the preferential propagation of action zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is surrounded by working zzso expressing zzso When mouse zzso and zzso were individually expressed in zzso human zzso cells, no zzso zzso signals were detected on zzso plasma zzso between different zzso using zzso specific for each zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso zzso do not dock to each zzso We wanted to identify zzso in these zzso proteins which are responsible for the zzso Thus, we expressed in zzso cells several zzso gene zzso in which different zzso and zzso zzso of zzso had been spliced into the corresponding regions of zzso We found that exchange of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso in this system zzso was required for formation of zzso and zzso zzso channels, although the electrical properties differed from those of zzso or zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso can be directed to form functional zzso and zzso zzso Another zzso construct in which both zzso zzso and the central zzso loop zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were spliced into zzso zzso led to zzso zzso only with zzso and not with zzso zzso Thus, the central zzso loop of zzso contributed to zzso A third zzso in which only the zzso domain zzso of zzso was spliced into zzso zzso zzso showed neither zzso nor zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso region of zzso determined zzso
