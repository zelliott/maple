We identified and cloned the rabbit zzso zzso zzso the pulmonary zzso zzso and zzso its upstream region from zzso to zzso including a much larger zzso of the upstream region than has previously been reported for an zzso for any zzso zzso zzso showed substantial zzso to its human counterpart in the coding and zzso regions immediately upstream from the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso reporter gene zzso construct we measured promoter activity with a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso functioned as an active promoter in this zzso Further, we identified, cloned and zzso the zzso zzso a unique zzso zzso zzso that bound zzso at zzso zzso When the N zzso was cloned into the expression zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso reporter zzso N significantly enhanced Luc production, but only in the presence of zzso zzso we identified and zzso a functional promoter region upstream from rabbit zzso and isolated and characterized a zzso protein that zzso enhanced zzso responsiveness on this zzso
