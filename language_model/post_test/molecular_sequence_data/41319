zzso is a novel genetically engineered zzso of the major birch zzso zzso zzso v 1 that lacks the typical zzso v zzso fold and displays negligible zzso but strong T zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso possible differences between zzso and zzso v 1 in zzso zzso processing, and zzso 

zzso responses to zzso and zzso v 1 of peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso v zzso zzso clones were zzso zzso labeled zzso and zzso v 1 were used to study surface zzso zzso and zzso degradation by zzso DC zzso Both proteins were zzso by zzso extracts of zzso zzso and zzso v zzso zzso were employed to assess the zzso of zzso of zzso v zzso zzso clones and the polarization of zzso T zzso 

zzso displayed a significantly stronger T zzso capacity than zzso v zzso Furthermore, zzso showed increased surface binding and zzso as well as faster zzso degradation compared with zzso v zzso zzso zzso induced enhanced zzso responses at earlier zzso in zzso v zzso zzso clones and promoted less zzso production in T cells than zzso v zzso zzso 

The loss of the zzso v zzso changes the zzso interaction with the human immune system at the level of zzso cells resulting in altered zzso zzso By combining low zzso with strong and modulating T zzso capacity, zzso represents a highly interesting candidate for specific zzso of birch zzso zzso
