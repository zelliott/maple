Previous analyses of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have revealed that the zzso in these protein complexes bind and zzso zzso zzso zzso their zzso DNA binding zzso In the zzso zzso one zzso zzso binds zzso with high affinity and zzso it zzso while the other zzso zzso binds zzso with lower affinity and zzso it at an apparently slower zzso zzso of zzso with mismatched DNA results in suppression of zzso zzso at zzso which of these zzso zzso or zzso makes specific contact with the mismatch zzso base stacking by a zzso zzso zzso remains zzso In order to answer this question and to clarify the links between the DNA binding and zzso activities of each zzso in the zzso we made zzso in the zzso sites of zzso and zzso and assessed their impact on the activity of the zzso zzso (in zzso only zzso makes base specific contact with the zzso The key findings are: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus resembles the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a slower rate, and thus resembles the zzso zzso of zzso zzso though itself an apparently weak zzso zzso has a strong influence on the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso binding to mismatched DNA results in suppression of rapid zzso zzso revealing a zzso linkage between its mismatch recognition and zzso activities, zzso the zzso zzso complex, with both zzso in the zzso state, exhibits altered interactions with the zzso
