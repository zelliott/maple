In previous studies, we characterized an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that plays a central role in regulating zzso hormone zzso in zzso by sensing zzso In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the chicken zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The chicken zzso zzso shares a high degree of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with the human zzso and displays a similar zzso Moreover, zzso acid zzso where zzso cause disorders of zzso in the human zzso share the zzso human sequence in the chicken zzso However, a single region in the zzso domain of the chicken zzso differs substantially from its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injected with chicken zzso zzso respond to elevated ambient levels of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with the characteristic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso currents zzso by zzso zzso as well as by G zzso receptors coupled to zzso of zzso zzso By in zzso zzso clusters of cells in chicken zzso zzso were shown to express zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis and zzso demonstrated expression of zzso transcripts and/or protein in kidney zzso and zzso as well as in zzso The close conservation of the zzso acid sequence of the chicken zzso with its zzso zzso as well as its similar tissue distribution suggest that the zzso may also play an important role in avian calcium zzso
