zzso zzso is a human zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso mechanism of SK differs from that of zzso zzso zzso in that SK is not a zzso and cannot zzso activate zzso Instead, it forms a tight complex with zzso that zzso activates other zzso zzso The zzso zzso of human zzso was hypothesized to participate in triggering zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we report a study of the zzso to Met substitution in the zzso domain of zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso background zzso While it remains competent in forming a complex with zzso maintaining a comparable zzso zzso constant zzso the zzso protein shows a nearly zzso reduction in zzso activity relative to its zzso background when mixed with native zzso A zzso A crystal structure of this zzso zzso confirmed the correct folding of this zzso zzso Combined with other zzso data, these results support the premise that zzso of human zzso plays a functional role in the so-called zzso zzso zzso mechanism by zzso
