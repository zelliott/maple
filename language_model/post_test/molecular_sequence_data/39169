Natural killer zzso zzso receptors zzso are a family of zzso receptors which interact with specific motifs on zzso class I molecules and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed a recently zzso zzso region on zzso zzso containing eight members of the zzso zzso zzso Six members are clustered within a zzso continuous zzso These genes include a previously unpublished member of the zzso gene family zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso Two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso which may be located zzso of this cluster were also zzso We show that the zzso genes have undergone repeated gene zzso zzso between the genes has occurred zzso primarily as a result of zzso zzso and gene zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso sequences identified within these genes as evolutionary molecular zzso the evolution and zzso of this gene cluster is estimated to have occurred zzso million years ago, during zzso zzso A proposed model of the zzso history of the zzso gene family leading to their present organization is zzso
