U2 and zzso zzso pair to form a zzso zzso complex at the zzso core of the zzso zzso with zzso metal zzso particularly zzso at specific sites are essential for its folding and zzso zzso We used a novel zzso resonance energy transfer zzso method between zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso attached fluorescent zzso combined with supporting zzso and zzso studies, to determine locations of zzso zzso within the human zzso zzso At pH zzso we detected three zzso sites in: zzso the consensus zzso zzso which forms the internal loop between zzso I and zzso zzso the zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the internal loop of the zzso zzso stem loop zzso zzso at each of these sites is supported by previous zzso substitution studies and, in the case of the zzso site, by zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso junction and the zzso sites was found to be zzso with no zzso binding observed below pH 6 and 7, zzso This pH dependence of metal zzso binding suggests that the local environment may play a role in the binding of metal zzso which may impact on zzso zzso
