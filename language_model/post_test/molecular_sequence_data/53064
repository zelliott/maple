zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso generated from zzso zzso the same precursor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a potent zzso when administered both zzso and zzso In order to clarify the structural relationship with all peptides generated from zzso we have undertaken the zzso study of zzso in water and in zzso zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance data and theoretical calculations are consistent with a well defined zzso structure from zzso to zzso The uniform distribution of zzso zzso along the zzso suggests that zzso may interact with the zzso zzso of a zzso akin to those of zzso and zzso
