A zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso with an zzso probe based on the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene contains zzso base pairs and encodes a protein with a predicted mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar zzso match in zzso acid zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso has four zzso and one of them, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso was expressed to a level of about zzso of total cellular protein in an zzso coli cell as a soluble and functional zzso
