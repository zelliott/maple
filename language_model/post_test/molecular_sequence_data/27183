Review is devoted to zzso prediction of functionally related proteins by comparative zzso Growing possibilities of biotechnology for zzso sequencing lead to generation of sequences for millions of zzso However, function of majority of these genes is unknown, and can be determined zzso only for a few of zzso zzso accurate and robust methods for in zzso prediction zzso of gene functions are highly zzso We describe here the main techniques of comparative zzso including the standard method based on transferring functions between zzso sequences and also zzso methods, including zzso profiles and zzso zzso Modern methods of comparative zzso allow obtaining correct functional zzso for more than a half of all zzso zzso
