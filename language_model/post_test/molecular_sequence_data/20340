zzso sensors, based on zzso genetic control systems, are promising for on-site chemical detection because sensing targets and generating signals do not require costly zzso Here, we have constructed zzso synthetic zzso without relying on zzso screening and demonstrated that the zzso can be harnessed to develop bacterial sensors displaying readily visible reporter signals in response to zzso In zzso imaging using the zzso showed zzso changes in the expression of a green zzso protein reporter, which was visible even to the naked zzso
