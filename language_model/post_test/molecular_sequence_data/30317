We have shown previously that the zzso of the gene designated zzso is induced by nerve growth factor zzso in rat adrenal zzso zzso cells and that this zzso induction is zzso by zzso In this paper we demonstrate that zzso is a member of a gene family that contains several hundred members, which is closely related to zzso and zzso as demonstrated by the following zzso zzso the original zzso zzso zzso to numerous restriction fragments in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso clones with various zzso and zzso clones can be isolated with a frequency suggesting that this family includes several hundred members; and zzso there were minor sequence variations in four independently isolated zzso clones that were zzso to zzso zzso zzso extension studies show that initiation of the zzso zzso zzso occurs at a unique site relative to a synthetic zzso The zzso end of the zzso sequence was zzso to Rasheed rat zzso zzso and a zzso clone contained several elements that are typical of a long terminal repeat zzso including a zzso box, a zzso box, a primer binding site, a zzso addition zzso and a zzso addition zzso Furthermore, there is a zzso at the 3' end of at least one of the genes in this family, and there appeared to be a zzso zzso at the probable site of integration into host zzso Since several members of this family retain responses to zzso and zzso we conclude that the regulatory elements present in the zzso have been zzso in many members of this zzso We have named this family of genes the zzso elements because they are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso
