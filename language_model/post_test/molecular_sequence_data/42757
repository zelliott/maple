The structure gene of the colonization factor zzso 1 zzso has been zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso precursor deduced from the zzso sequence is composed of 170 zzso zzso The first 23 zzso acids are considered to be the signal zzso of the zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso three zzso acids are different from the protein zzso zzso acid zzso at positions 37, 76 and 97 are found to be Ala, zzso and zzso instead of zzso zzso and Ala as determined by zzso acid zzso The zzso is very zzso zzso zzso Among the total 170 zzso zzso zzso of them are zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has a typical zzso sequence zzso zzso but no 35 promoter sequence could be zzso The G + C ratio of zzso gene is zzso Observation of zzso stained preparations of the culture with electron zzso showed that no zzso were found on zzso coli zzso strain itself, but the cell carrying the zzso showed thick zzso on its zzso
