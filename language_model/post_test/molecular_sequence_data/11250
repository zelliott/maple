Wheat zzso is a protein expressed during zzso which possesses an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been extensively studied in zzso zzso and zzso where they are thought to have important functions for development, stress response and zzso against zzso In contrast, almost nothing is known about the zzso proteins found in zzso zzso and zzso In this work, zzso clones for three genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso initially characterized as expressed sequence tags zzso from zzso zzso zzso libraries were further zzso In addition, we isolated and zzso a zzso zzso zzso which was strongly zzso to the zzso for zzso zzso analysis and secondary structure predictions of the proteins zzso by these zzso showed that they possess all the characteristic features of members of the zzso family and of the zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso comparisons and mapping demonstrated the existence of at least two different gene families in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a minimum of three genes for zzso These three genes have been mapped in three different location on the zzso zzso By northern zzso zzso we found that these genes are zzso zzso zzso was expressed during zzso like wheat zzso but also in leaves whereas zzso transcripts were exclusively found in developing zzso like wheat zzso zzso zzso were found in leaves and flowers and their abundance was shown to vary during the zzso zzso
