zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the first dedicated zzso of the plant zzso zzso zzso We report here the zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso in tomato zzso Light increases the zzso content of zzso but has little effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso of both genes is induced in zzso of the zzso zzso ghost and in zzso zzso treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso which contain the lowest levels of zzso in the plant, have also the lowest levels of zzso and zzso zzso In flowers, expression of both genes and zzso content are higher in petals and zzso than in zzso and zzso During flower development, expression of both zzso and zzso increases more than zzso immediately before zzso During fruit development, zzso expression increases more than zzso but zzso expression increases less than zzso We concluded that zzso and zzso are zzso regulated by stress and zzso mechanisms that control zzso zzso in leaves, flowers, and zzso We also report that zzso maps to zzso 3, and thus it does not zzso to the zzso zzso which maps to zzso zzso
