Development of the eye is zzso similar among zzso indicating that the underlying mechanism regulating the process may have been highly zzso during zzso zzso we analyzed the promoter of the human zzso gene in zzso by transgenic zzso To delineate the zzso zzso regulatory zzso we performed serial deletion zzso in the promoter zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso upstream zzso promoter region is sufficient to zzso zzso specificity to the human zzso gene in transgenic zzso Through zzso sequence comparisons and an zzso mobility shift zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso of a zzso pair sequence zzso the consensus sequence for the zzso protein binding site, within the zzso promoter region was zzso Further, a zzso zzso showed that this element is crucial for promoter zzso These data suggest that the fundamental zzso regulatory mechanism of the zzso gene has been well zzso between humans and zzso and zzso among all zzso during zzso
