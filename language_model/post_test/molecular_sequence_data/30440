Pulmonary zzso contains at least three unique zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso from bovine zzso are markedly zzso and have molecular masses between 3 and 26 zzso We identify zzso proteins under zzso conditions on zzso gels with approximate molecular mass of 5, 14, 26 zzso zzso 14, 26) when organic zzso material is zzso from a zzso zzso size exclusion column followed by separation on a zzso zzso zzso zzso These bands zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Computer analysis zzso zzso of sequences for these proteins suggests that zzso contains zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso resembles a more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso and zzso duplicate the surface activity of natural zzso when zzso in a pulsating bubble zzso We speculate that zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso may act zzso in affecting zzso zzso An important function of zzso and zzso may be to affect the ordering of zzso lipids so that rates of transport of zzso lipids to the zzso surface in the zzso are zzso
