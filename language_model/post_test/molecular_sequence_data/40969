zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its zzso by zzso zzso and invasion of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso of strain zzso as zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso properties, zzso The zzso 62 zzso acids zzso in zzso and 76 zzso in zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso Comparative protein modeling using the zzso three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these zzso would contain four zzso beta sheets and that they formed zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen as zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso coli, and each also formed zzso zzso thus supporting this zzso zzso coli zzso zzso or zzso bound to zzso zzso proteins with a zzso to zzso level of affinity than the control zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso strains significantly zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso ability to adhere to or invade zzso cell zzso and the functions were restored upon zzso A zzso zzso region in the zzso passenger domain was required for this zzso zzso coli expressing zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed significantly zzso zzso zzso more reduced zzso than zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso were indispensable for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso individually offered advantages to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso This is the first report characterizing zzso zzso in zzso zzso as zzso surface zzso and zzso
