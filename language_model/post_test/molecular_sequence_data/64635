Cell fate determination in zzso and zzso systems is regulated by the zzso signaling zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso involves zzso liberation of the zzso zzso domain zzso which activates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We showed previously that zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso associated zzso domain of zzso was required for both zzso and zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso repression, we tested whether distinct sequences within the zzso domain mediate zzso versus zzso We analyzed the capacity of zzso domain zzso to bind zzso zzso to activate zzso zzso and to repress zzso A zzso lacking 20 zzso acids of the zzso domain zzso resembled the zzso domain deletion zzso in being defective in all zzso Analysis of 14 deletion and zzso substitution zzso revealed a correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could only tolerate very low level expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso retaining zzso zzso By contrast, zzso compromised zzso zzso accumulated at high zzso These results support a model in which the binding of zzso to zzso is required for zzso repression and reveal a powerful zzso mechanism that suppresses the levels of zzso competent zzso
