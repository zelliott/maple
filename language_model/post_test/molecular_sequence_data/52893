zzso encodes a zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso zzso syndrome is a genetic condition of young adults characterized by premature aging, limited zzso capacity of cells in zzso and increased cancer zzso zzso is a reverse zzso that extends the zzso strand of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso typically lack zzso activity and undergo zzso whereas zzso is zzso in many, but not all, zzso The roles of the two genes are not known to be zzso Here we report the development of an effective zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso zzso cell line is zzso more sensitive to zzso zzso than zzso normal cell zzso The sensitivity can be partially reversed by zzso a normal zzso gene but not a zzso zzso gene into the zzso zzso the sensitivity can be reversed equally well by zzso a zzso gene zzso into the zzso These data indicate the possibility of an zzso function of these two zzso
