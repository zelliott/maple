Root hairs play important roles in the interaction of plants with their zzso Root hairs anchor the plant in the soil, facilitate zzso zzso from the zzso and participate in symbiotic zzso zzso These specialized cells grow in a polar fashion which gives rise to their zzso shape, a process zzso in part by a family of small zzso known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso activate zzso to effect tip growth in zzso zzso and root zzso but the genes zzso tip growth in zzso have not yet been zzso In this report we describe the zzso and zzso gene families from the model zzso zzso zzso and from the crop zzso zzso We find that one member of the zzso zzso gene family, zzso is required for root hair development because zzso this gene by zzso interference affects the zzso zzso zzso and zzso structure of root zzso and reduces root hair zzso zzso with its role in polar growth, we find that a zzso fusion protein zzso in the zzso of emerging and actively growing root zzso The zzso zzso of zzso regulates its ability to interact with zzso in zzso and regulates its biological activity in zzso
