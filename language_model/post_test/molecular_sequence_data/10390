Human zzso and its zzso counterpart, zzso are zzso zzso proteins in the family of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals complex alternative zzso including forms too small to zzso the full zzso zzso acid zzso We have characterized a zzso alternatively spliced zzso zzso of zzso zzso Human zzso a predicted zzso zzso acid zzso shares 400 zzso acids with zzso but has an alternate N terminal zzso of 20 zzso and the zzso 258 zzso acids diverge from zzso zzso As the unique zzso of zzso lacks the three zzso and zzso of zzso we predict it does not bind zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to human, shares these zzso Database searches identify zzso in chicken zzso identical to human zzso and zzso zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso is ubiquitous in mouse zzso and in zzso cell zzso We generated a specific zzso against the unique zzso of zzso and used this zzso to demonstrate that zzso protein is expressed as an zzso 80 zzso protein in human and zzso zzso zzso of in zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso with specific zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso can from a complex with zzso Studies of the zzso structure of the zzso zzso locus zzso 100 zzso reveal that the unique 3' zzso of zzso are zzso between zzso 2 and 3 of the zzso zzso We speculate that a primordial zzso gene captured a zzso gene to give rise to the zzso zzso family of zzso
