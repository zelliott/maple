The European rabbit zzso zzso is used as a model for many human diseases, yet comparatively little is known of its zzso particularly at important zzso such as the major zzso complex zzso This study investigated genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the zzso gene in a range of zzso species by zzso coding sequence diversity of zzso 2 and zzso 2 in 53 individuals of 16 different zzso Fifty zzso zzso zzso were zzso including 13 novel European rabbit zzso In the zzso the highest levels of diversity were observed in wild rabbits from zzso with wild rabbits from England and domestic rabbits showing less zzso Within the sample, several zzso events were detected and zzso evolution of zzso was zzso both being general characteristics of zzso zzso zzso Positive selection is implicated as operating on six zzso within zzso 2, which are also subject to positive selection in other zzso Some of these positions are putative zzso recognition sites and underline the importance of zzso selection on these zzso zzso
