We describe a new approach for the identification and characterization by mass zzso of proteins that have been zzso onto zzso Using this method zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins can be analyzed either as intact proteins for molecular weight determination or as peptides generated by zzso zzso zzso is used to zzso the zzso and to zzso the zzso zzso thus removing the zzso which can interfere with zzso zzso This method offers improved protein coverage, especially for membrane zzso such as zzso because the extraction step after zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, removal of zzso from the sample solution allows sample analysis by both zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso Finally, we demonstrate the utility of zzso for the direct identification of soluble and membrane proteins after Western zzso obtaining comparable or better results than with zzso zzso
