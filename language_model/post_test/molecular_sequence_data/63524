The zzso family zzso is the largest family of zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and early evidence suggests that each member may have a unique zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso an zzso that has the potential to generate the sequence zzso which is the zzso 3 blood group zzso The zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein that shows approximately zzso zzso acid identity to a previously cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but has a very low identity ( approximately zzso to zzso sequences in humans, zzso and zzso A zzso form of zzso expressed in human zzso cells has a high zzso activity toward zzso but unexpectedly, the zzso is inactive toward the zzso zzso Thus, zzso differs from all other zzso previously described from animals that all zzso zzso zzso is expressed at all stages of zzso development, but zzso promoter analysis of the zzso gene using green fluorescent protein reporter zzso indicates that the zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso cells of the zzso from zzso to an adult zzso Because zzso cells are known to zzso their zzso to the zzso surface, these results may indicate that products of zzso contribute to interactions of the zzso with its environment or are used as zzso for bacterial zzso These findings, along with those on other zzso in zzso zzso suggest that each zzso in this zzso may have a unique zzso zzso expression pattern, and biological zzso
