There is clear evidence that the zzso zzso of smooth muscle cells zzso contributes to the zzso of vascular zzso zzso zzso refers to the unique ability of zzso to alter their zzso in response to zzso stimuli and is zzso by the loss of zzso marker gene zzso The zzso factor zzso factor 4 zzso is a known powerful negative regulator of zzso marker gene expression that works, in part, by decreasing the expression of the serum response factor zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in healthy adult zzso but is increased in zzso in response to vascular injury in zzso or zzso treatment in zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of zzso in zzso modulated zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso factor stimulating zzso zzso regulated the expression of zzso in zzso The zzso promoter contains three consensus zzso binding zzso Using a series of truncated zzso zzso we showed that only fragments containing these zzso sites could be activated by zzso In addition, zzso of zzso alone was sufficient to increase the activity of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression with zzso zzso attenuated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso sites within the zzso promoter abolished both baseline and zzso zzso Finally, the results demonstrated enhanced zzso binding to the zzso promoter in zzso treated with zzso in zzso and following vascular injury in zzso Taken together, the results suggest a novel role for zzso in increasing the expression of zzso in zzso modulated zzso
