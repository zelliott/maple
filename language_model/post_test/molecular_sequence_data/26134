Twelve zzso have previously been identified in tomato zzso zzso that control the intensity and distribution of zzso zzso these are useful genetic markers because they zzso zzso that are readily zzso in the zzso of emerging zzso In order to obtain molecular zzso for tomato zzso zzso zzso we isolated two zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the key zzso in zzso zzso from a tomato zzso zzso zzso By comparing their zzso acid zzso we determined that the two zzso zzso have an overall similarity of zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso We identified zzso conditions that would distinguish the two clones and by Northern analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso species corresponding to each zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and leaves of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso at low stringency to zzso blots indicated that in tomato, zzso genes comprise a family of at least three individual zzso The two genes that zzso the zzso zzso were then placed onto the tomato genetic map at unique zzso by restriction zzso length zzso zzso We also zzso the activity of zzso and another zzso in the zzso pathway, zzso zzso in zzso extracts of zzso tomato and a number of zzso zzso Five zzso had reduced zzso activity when compared to the zzso zzso Of these, three were also reduce in zzso zzso activity, suggesting a regulatory role for these zzso The other two zzso were zzso reduced in zzso activity, suggesting a more specific role for these zzso in zzso zzso
