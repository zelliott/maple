The zzso zzso proteins zzso are motor proteins that transport zzso and protein complexes in a zzso and zzso zzso We identified zzso as a new member of the zzso zzso zzso is a rather zzso member as it lacks zzso zzso Mice with a zzso deletion of zzso developed a zzso with enteric nerve zzso zzso enteric zzso showed hypersensitivity for zzso zzso and we find that zzso suppressed zzso signaling by direct binding and zzso of zzso an essential component of zzso zzso We therefore propose that the unconventional zzso zzso plays a key role in enteric nervous system development by zzso a cell growth signaling zzso
