zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis is tightly regulated to the S phase of the cell division cycle as a result of both zzso and zzso zzso We focused on the role of zzso control in zzso zzso gene zzso regulation and studied a portion of the zzso message required for zzso zzso The 3' end of the zzso gene containing a zzso coding sequence and entire zzso sequence was fused to the bacterial zzso zzso II gene zzso under control of the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso and zzso zzso genes was analyzed during the zzso cell zzso As zzso cells entered a zzso cell cycle following release from zzso arrest, the level of zzso zzso message increased approximately zzso during S phase and dropped to zzso level when the cells left S zzso This indicates that the 3' end of the zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso regulation on a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the 3' end showed that the signal for cell cycle control of zzso zzso includes zzso coding and zzso sequences surrounding the stop zzso This differs from the situation in zzso cells, whose zzso regulation of zzso genes is zzso through a short sequence containing a zzso structure near the very zzso of the untranslated 3' zzso
