zzso growth factors mediate cellular responses by interacting with a family of related zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso but not of zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells allows for proliferation in response to zzso and that the zzso signaling halves of these two receptors distinguish their zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In order to map the zzso which functionally distinguish these zzso a panel of zzso receptors whose zzso bear different contributions from zzso and zzso were constructed and zzso The behavior of these zzso zzso zzso acids from both the zzso insert and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Specifically, two zzso zzso present in the short zzso insert domain of zzso and absent from zzso are a necessary, but not zzso component of a fully zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso in the zzso insert promotes a zzso signaling zzso A strongly zzso zzso also requires one or two zzso zzso from either of two regions within the zzso zzso One of these regions is within the zzso zzso zzso loop, where zzso but not zzso bears a key zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso receptors strongly zzso with the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We discuss mechanisms by which these few key zzso acid differences may determine the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
