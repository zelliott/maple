zzso zzso is an opportunistic human pathogen producing a variety of zzso zzso One of them is zzso consisting of zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso which are connected together through a short zzso region, called core zzso Chemical structures of the core zzso are well zzso with one exception, in that certain strains of zzso add a terminal zzso zzso zzso ) to core by a zzso reaction, due to the activity of a zzso zzso Here, we investigated the regulation of zzso zzso Our results showed that while the majority of zzso zzso of zzso contain zzso many of these have a zzso identical zzso deletion in the upstream region that zzso the zzso This deletion is within the zzso zzso that is recognized by a principle zzso factor zzso or zzso as proven by data from an zzso shift zzso These results provide the molecular basis of why zzso core of many zzso strains is lacking zzso zzso In addition, we show that absence of zzso due to an inactive zzso promoter zzso resistance to killing by zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso
