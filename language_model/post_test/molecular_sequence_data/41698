zzso zzso in the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso gene are rarely detected due to the absence of a clearly defined zzso particularly in zzso We here report the zzso features of a novel zzso in the first zzso loop of the zzso The zzso zzso was detected in an zzso man exhibiting normal zzso suppressed serum zzso and normal or elevated levels of zzso markers of zzso zzso zzso different experimental strategies on zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso led to decreased cell surface plasma membrane expression of the zzso zzso but zzso a low level of zzso activity associated with markedly altered zzso zzso and zzso These latter features may contribute and/or amplify the persistent zzso of the zzso in both absence and presence of zzso and provide new insights into opportunities for zzso therapies based on disruption of these zzso
