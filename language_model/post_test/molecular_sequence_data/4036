A panel of 22 zzso zzso libraries was constructed in a zzso zzso display format and sorted against zzso growth zzso zzso The libraries were pooled to achieve a total diversity of zzso zzso zzso After three rounds of selection, the majority of the zzso clones bound specifically to IGF-1, with a zzso zzso scaffold dominating the zzso Four zzso displayed zzso were designed on the basis of these zzso zzso zzso maturation in a zzso format yielded an zzso zzso that inhibited the interactions between IGF-1 and two zzso receptors and those between IGF-1 and two soluble zzso binding proteins with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso is highly structured in the absence of IGF-1, and peptides that zzso the binding elements were selected during the zzso
