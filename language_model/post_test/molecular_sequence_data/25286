An unusual left end zzso has been identified on zzso zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso This end has a zzso structure and is formed at a short zzso repeat sequence centered around zzso zzso of zzso 190 zzso to the left of the site where a mature left end is formed on the zzso zzso We do not detect the companion right end that would be formed if the zzso is produced by a zzso cut on the zzso zzso This suggests that the hairpin left end may be generated from a zzso cut in the DNA that is used to prime rightward DNA zzso The formation of zzso does not require the products of zzso genes 10, 18 or 19, proteins that are essential for the formation of mature zzso zzso During infection with a zzso gene 3 zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis is reduced and the zzso are not processed into unit length DNA zzso but both zzso and the mature right end are formed on the zzso zzso These two ends are also found associated with the large, rapidly zzso zzso formed during a normal zzso infection while the mature left end is present only on unit length zzso DNA zzso We propose that DNA replication primed from the hairpin end produced by a zzso in the zzso repeat sequence provides a mechanism to duplicate the terminal repeat before DNA zzso Packaging is initiated with the formation of a mature right end on the zzso zzso and, as the zzso head is zzso the zzso gene 3 zzso may be required to trim the replication zzso from the zzso zzso processing is completed by the removal of the 190 zzso hairpin end to produce the mature left zzso
