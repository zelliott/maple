The nuclear zzso zzso currently consists of seven gene zzso that zzso over 80 distinct zzso zzso These zzso factors typically share a common zzso structure with a highly zzso zzso zzso Some nuclear receptors are ubiquitous among the zzso while others are unique to specific zzso zzso zzso represent the second largest group of zzso with insects being the zzso However, relative to insects, little is known about the nuclear receptors of zzso The aim of this study was to identify putative nuclear receptors from the first assembled zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso expression was evaluated and receptors were subjected to zzso analyses to gain insight into evolution and zzso 

Twenty-five putative nuclear receptors were identified in zzso zzso based on the presence of a zzso zzso zzso All of the nuclear zzso protein sequences contain a highly zzso zzso domain and a less zzso zzso domain with the exception of the zzso zzso These receptors lack a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of all seven zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains several nuclear receptors that have zzso zzso However, several nuclear zzso members that are represented in zzso are absent from zzso zzso zzso absences include receptors of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso the 3A group zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso also contains nuclear zzso zzso that are present in insects and zzso but not zzso including putative nuclear receptors within the zzso zzso A novel group of zzso designated zzso was identified in zzso zzso that groups with the zzso zzso but forms its own zzso Gene products were detected in adult female zzso zzso for 21 of the 25 zzso 

Nuclear receptors are ancient proteins with highly zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the nuclear receptors of zzso zzso contain the same degree of conservation that is typically found within nuclear receptors of other zzso Most of the receptors identified in zzso zzso have zzso within the zzso and zzso lineages examined with the exception of the novel zzso group and the zzso and potentially the zzso receptors found in zzso zzso These groups of receptors may zzso functions that are intrinsic to zzso zzso
