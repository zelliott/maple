As the most zzso atom in DNA, the zzso zzso atom is a major site of attack for a large number of chemical zzso as well as zzso zzso Paradoxically, while zzso of zzso zzso is believed to be largely zzso zzso zzso among the most potent zzso appears to exert its zzso activity through zzso at this zzso On the basis of an analysis of the specificity of zzso induced by various zzso forms of zzso zzso we have previously proposed mechanisms that can both resolve the paradox and account for the specificity of zzso by zzso zzso The hypothesized mechanisms specify how a bulky zzso zzso zzso can promote zzso to zzso transitions as well as zzso zzso Since the proposed mechanisms are in principle zzso a simple test of the proposed mechanisms would be to examine the specificity of zzso induced by a structurally different bulky zzso zzso zzso Toward this goal, zzso zzso form DNA was subjected to in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene segments were scored and defined at the sequence zzso The results show that zzso zzso zzso both base zzso and frame shifts with zzso zzso A clear majority of base zzso were zzso to zzso zzso On the other hand, unlike zzso B1 which could induce both zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to predominantly induce zzso frame zzso This preference appears to arise by zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
