The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to specifically cleave the zzso zzso factor zzso leaving the binding and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is capable of efficient DNA binding but is no longer able to activate zzso A surprisingly high proportion of other zzso factors tested, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were similarly zzso by zzso to produce specific partial zzso zzso These properties make zzso a particularly useful zzso for zzso studies of zzso factors and also raise the possibility that zzso may be involved in zzso in regulation of turnover or zzso activity of a number of zzso zzso
