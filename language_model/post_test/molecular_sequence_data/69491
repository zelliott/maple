zzso are zzso highly zzso proteins released by zzso zzso at the time of zzso zzso Previously determined zzso sequences allowed the proposal of a general gene structure consisting of 5 sequence zzso The sequence of the central block of tandem repeats provides a useful means of distinguishing the zzso zzso and also its zzso whereas the zzso and zzso terminal sequences defined the zzso family, 4 of which have been zzso We present the sequence of 3 new zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso repeat sequence is zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The sequences of these newly described zzso are consistent with the proposed general gene structure and all belong to defined families, although zzso sequences appear to be much more variable within a family than previously zzso
