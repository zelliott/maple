zzso a 3' zzso zzso DNA zzso directs assembly of a zzso on some zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso replication machines that contribute both the zzso and Okazaki zzso functions at the replication zzso The role of zzso in zzso replication is zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggest that the protein zzso in replication zzso at zzso zzso We show here that zzso promotes replication fork assembly at a D loop, an intermediate formed during initiation of zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso by a naturally arising zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the need for zzso during replication fork assembly at D zzso in zzso These findings underscore the zzso of replication fork zzso at zzso zzso under normal growth conditions in zzso
