DNA zzso are the zzso responsible for controlling and maintaining the zzso states of zzso Type zzso zzso work by zzso breaking the zzso backbone of one strand to allow passage of another strand through the zzso The protein has to perform complex zzso of the DNA, and hence it is likely that different regions of the zzso bind DNA with different zzso In order to identify some of the DNA binding sites in the zzso we have solved the structures of several complexes of the 67 zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso I with zzso and zzso There are five different binding sites in the complexes, one of which is adjacent to the active zzso Two other sites are in the central hole of the protein and may represent general DNA binding zzso The positions of these sites allow us to identify different DNA binding regions and to understand their possible roles in the zzso zzso
