In all zzso proteins related to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso that occur in a mature factor are each zzso by two zzso and those that do not, by one zzso During zzso additional zzso zzso can be inserted between zzso 3 and 4, which code for the zzso domain of the mature zzso zzso growth factor zzso The resulting zzso codes for the short form of zzso zzso zzso which retains the signal zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso However, its zzso domain lacks the zzso zzso essential for the interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has high affinity for zzso but zzso if at all, interacts with zzso Data obtained in three different systems indicated that zzso zzso possesses a zzso activity but zzso a signal zzso zzso other than that of zzso
