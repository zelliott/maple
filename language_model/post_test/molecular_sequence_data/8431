We have previously shown that the zzso resistance protein zzso mediates the zzso membrane transport of zzso zzso and additional zzso organic zzso In the present study we demonstrate the expression of zzso in zzso where it functions in zzso zzso Analysis by reverse zzso of human and normal rat liver zzso resulted in two expected zzso fragments of zzso Four different zzso against zzso reacted on zzso with the zzso of about 190 zzso from human zzso as well as zzso zzso membrane zzso A zzso zzso directed against the zzso sequence of zzso detected the rat zzso of zzso in zzso Double zzso zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso showed the presence of human zzso and rat zzso in the zzso as well as in the lateral membrane zzso of zzso The transport function of the zzso zzso zzso export pump was zzso in plasma membrane zzso with zzso C4 as a zzso zzso zzso zzso The deficient zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso from zzso zzso rat zzso was associated with a lack of amplification of one of the zzso zzso fragments and with a selective loss of zzso on zzso of zzso zzso Double zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso rats localized zzso only to the lateral but not to the zzso zzso Our results indicate that the absence of zzso or an zzso of zzso from the zzso membrane is the basis for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
