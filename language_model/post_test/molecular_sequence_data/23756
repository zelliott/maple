zzso are essential organic zzso with multiple cellular zzso Their synthesis is controlled by a feedback regulation whose main target is zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso has been shown to be inhibited and targeted for zzso degradation by zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso AZ was reported to involve a zzso zzso zzso zzso High levels of zzso therefore inhibit new synthesis of zzso by inducing zzso zzso We identified a previously zzso sequence in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso We show that synthesis of zzso AZ zzso involves zzso zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso depends on zzso Using this novel model system for zzso regulation, we discovered another level of its zzso zzso itself is subject to zzso zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso however, is inhibited by zzso We propose a model, in which zzso inhibit their zzso zzso by two mechanisms, the control of zzso synthesis and zzso of its zzso
