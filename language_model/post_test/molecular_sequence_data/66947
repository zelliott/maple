Human zzso zzso infection is the main zzso agent of cervical cancer and zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso many cellular zzso An association between zzso gene expression and cervical cancer development has been zzso however, the mechanisms by which zzso influences zzso expression remain zzso In the present study we analyzed the mechanism through which zzso E6 and zzso zzso regulate the zzso promoter in cervical tumor zzso Our results showed that E6 and zzso increased zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, we identified a specific DNA sequence motif in the zzso core promoter that is responsible for zzso and that zzso to the zzso site associated with zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso recognition site abolished the zzso caused by E6 and zzso These results suggest a physical interaction and functional cooperation between viral zzso and cellular regulatory elements of the zzso promoter, and may explain the contribution of zzso to zzso gene expression in cervical zzso
