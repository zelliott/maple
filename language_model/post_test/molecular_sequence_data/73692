zzso analysis of 198 zzso zzso zzso revealed a variable region of DNA sequence differing in length among the zzso Five zzso differed by the presence of two to six copies of the zzso tandem repeat zzso This zzso tandem repeat zzso region is located within a larger sequence containing one complete open reading frame that encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso variation did not change the reading frame of the zzso protein and only changed the copy number of a zzso sequence zzso from 2 to zzso The structure of the zzso region suggests that these multiple repeats are generated by zzso or zzso zzso zzso structures predicted from the zzso DNA sequence suggest that any structural changes in the zzso protein are confined to the region zzso by the zzso zzso Copy number differences in the zzso region were used to define five different zzso zzso zzso zzso of 198 zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from shorter to longer zzso The high degree of zzso in the zzso region provides a criterion for assigning zzso to five zzso zzso There is a correlation between categories and geographic zzso Such molecular markers can be used to monitor the epidemiology of anthrax outbreaks in domestic and native zzso zzso
