Many zzso have multiple zzso zzso zzso Generally, sequence differences between small zzso zzso zzso genes are minor zzso and cause little concern for zzso zzso or environmental diversity zzso For zzso an order of extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence divergence can exceed zzso rendering zzso assignment zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is a zzso zzso gene that may be an appropriate alternative zzso marker for zzso We zzso a zzso of the zzso gene from 21 species, encompassing 15 zzso of zzso To examine the utility of zzso as a zzso marker in zzso we investigated three properties of zzso zzso the variation in resolution between trees zzso from the zzso DNA and zzso protein zzso the degree of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA and protein trees were for the most part zzso and consistently recovered two zzso zzso groups, the zzso I and zzso II zzso within a collection of less well resolved zzso zzso A comparison of observed versus zzso numbers of substitution revealed zzso zzso in the zzso DNA data set, particularly between more distant zzso Thus, the zzso protein sequence may be more reliable than the zzso DNA sequence for zzso zzso zzso zzso tests of tree selection indicated the trees zzso from zzso DNA and protein alignments were significantly zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We discuss possible explanations for this zzso including tree reconstruction artifact, differential zzso zzso and lateral gene zzso This is the first study of zzso evolution based on a marker other than the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we present a valuable zzso framework encompassing a broad diversity of zzso in which novel sequences can be inserted for zzso zzso or zzso zzso
