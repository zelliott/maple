The zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes coding for the general zzso proteins zzso and zzso I of the zzso zzso system were zzso These genes form an zzso with the gene order zzso Three distinct zzso species were zzso a zzso zzso transcript specific for zzso and two long transcripts zzso and zzso zzso covering the whole zzso zzso zzso of all these zzso initiated at the same zzso located 9 zzso downstream from a promoter located immediately upstream from the zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso structure zzso located at the beginning of zzso was responsible for the premature zzso termination generating the zzso zzso zzso zzso The long transcripts ended in the zzso region of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the 3' end of zzso Studies with a zzso spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso that produces an zzso fusion protein suggest that the regulation of zzso and zzso expression involves zzso as well as zzso zzso
