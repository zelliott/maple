zzso zzso exchange factors zzso activate zzso zzso and thereby regulate zzso structure, gene transcription, and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a small zzso of zzso that are zzso and directly activated by the zzso family of zzso G zzso zzso we describe the atomic structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone and in complex with zzso These structures demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso can undergo a dramatic zzso change upon binding zzso wherein both the zzso and zzso zzso directly engage zzso Through zzso analysis we show that full zzso exchange activity requires a novel zzso extension on the zzso domain that is predicted to exist in a broader family of zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and identify regions within the zzso zzso domain that contribute to its ability to facilitate zzso exchange in zzso In zzso of the zzso complex, the active site of zzso adopts two distinct zzso zzso among the four unique complexes in the zzso zzso Similar changes were previously observed in structures of zzso Ras and zzso A potential zzso site on the zzso zzso domain is also evident and appears to be zzso throughout the zzso zzso of zzso
