zzso zzso was zzso and used as a probe to study the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modified both free zzso and zzso complex, resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso Nearly complete protection of the zzso complex against zzso modification was obtained by addition of excess zzso whereas zzso activity alone was lost in a zzso manner even in the presence of excess zzso These results suggest that zzso modified zzso sites and zzso sites, and the latter sites are protected by zzso zzso The results also suggest that the zzso site is accessible to the zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was completely zzso by zzso and the zzso peptides were isolated and zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso where X is the zzso zzso The sequence was compared with the known zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was identified as zzso which is located downstream of the zzso motif zzso among zzso zzso
