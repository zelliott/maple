A zzso zzso zzso zzso approach was used to study the bacterial and zzso communities in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment was applied to limit the analysis to the fraction of viable cells in zzso A total of 104 and 68 clones respective from bacterial clone library and zzso library were picked and analyzed by restriction zzso length zzso zzso 35 zzso patterns from bacterial clone library and 10 zzso patterns from zzso clone library were unique and the respective clones were selected for zzso zzso analysis and zzso analysis showed that the bacterial clone library mainly consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the only two lineages of the zzso zzso This study gave a first insight into the overall microbial structure in a cloth printing and zzso wastewater treatment plant with high concentration of zzso and increased knowledge on the zzso of the zzso treatment in combination with zzso molecular techniques to analyze only viable cells in microbial zzso
