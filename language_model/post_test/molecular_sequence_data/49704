zzso are members of the zzso zzso of cell zzso molecules proposed to play important roles in early development, but whose mechanisms of action are largely zzso We examined the function of zzso zzso a novel cell zzso zzso essential for the zzso of the embryonic zzso in zzso and demonstrate that the cellular protein zzso previously identified as a zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso extracts when zzso zzso and zzso can rescue the zzso disruptions caused by a zzso zzso construct lacking the zzso zzso Furthermore, disruptions in either zzso or zzso zzso using zzso or zzso zzso zzso result in essentially identical zzso zzso These results indicate a role for zzso in the differentiation of the embryonic zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso
