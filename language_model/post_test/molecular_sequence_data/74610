zzso zzso of proteins onto carbon zzso is important to understand the environmental and biological activity of carbon zzso as well as their potential applications in zzso zzso In this study, the zzso dynamics and features of a model protein (the A zzso of human serum zzso onto the surfaces of carbon zzso with different diameters were investigated out by molecular dynamics zzso The zzso behaviors were observed by both trajectory and quantitative zzso During the zzso process, the secondary structures of zzso in the model protein were slightly zzso However, the random coils connecting these zzso were strongly affected and this made the zzso structure of protein zzso The zzso and orientation selection of the protein were induced by the properties and the texture of surfaces indicated by the interaction zzso In addition, the zzso zzso dynamics of these processes are zzso The mechanism of induced zzso zzso change of protein on carbon zzso surfaces would be helpful to better understand the zzso interaction at the molecular zzso
