The zzso zzso promoter system has proven useful for production of zzso proteins in several zzso species and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this study we subjected a zzso region of zzso (including the zzso zzso to random zzso leading to large zzso libraries in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying strongly increased promoter activity zzso could be efficiently identified by using zzso as a zzso The zzso typically carried multiple point zzso positioned throughout the zzso region, combined with deletions around the zzso start zzso zzso displaying up to about a zzso increase in zzso expression zzso to zzso zzso were identified without loss of the zzso zzso The zzso also strongly zzso the expression of two other reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and were found to significantly improve zzso a previously zzso process for high-level zzso production of the medically important zzso zzso factor in zzso coli under zzso zzso These results demonstrate the potential of using random zzso of promoters to improve protein expression at industrial levels and indicate that targeted modifications of individual functional elements are not sufficient to obtain zzso promoter zzso
