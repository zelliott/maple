We isolated two zzso clones of rat zzso a zzso zzso studied its expression in rat liver and various cells, and characterized the zzso The levels of zzso zzso were only slightly increased in liver of rats zzso with a zzso diet or after partial zzso Whereas the expression of zzso zzso was detected in zzso isolated from adult rat liver and also in highly differentiated zzso cells, no zzso zzso was detected in poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected in liver from zzso aged 15 zzso zzso of zzso was increased in zzso cells during differentiation into visceral zzso cells by treatment with zzso zzso This stimulation occurred prior to an increase in the level of zzso zzso When zzso expression zzso of zzso zzso domain and zzso were zzso with zzso reporter zzso with or without five copies of the zzso site, into zzso cells, the zzso activities were decreased in zzso and zzso zzso zzso This repression did not require the presence of the zzso which is located between the zzso acid zzso 137 and zzso Its repression domain was mapped between the zzso 45 and 136 in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso was responsible for zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso and may be involved in the differentiation and/or maintenance of the differentiated state in zzso
