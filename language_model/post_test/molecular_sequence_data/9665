The three-dimensional structure of zzso a potent inhibitor of blood zzso factor zzso from the Mexican zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso A resolution by X-ray zzso The structure reveals a novel protein fold composed of two zzso zzso each resembling the structure of zzso a related zzso zzso zzso However, zzso has a different overall shape than the individual zzso zzso it contains four rather than two zzso and does not inhibit factor zzso The two zzso zzso can be subdivided into two similarly sized zzso with different relative zzso zzso the domain shapes are different, the zzso domain being zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso studies suggest that differences in domain shape enable the zzso but not zzso domain of zzso to bind and inhibit factor zzso even though both have a very similar zzso zzso Furthermore, a putative zzso binding region could be defined in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is likely to interact with a cluster of positively charged zzso on the factor zzso surface zzso This zzso binding region explains the specificity and zzso potency of zzso towards factor zzso In the zzso domain of zzso these zzso interactions are prevented due to the different overall shape of this zzso
