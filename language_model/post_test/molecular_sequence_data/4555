zzso zzso transport processes in zzso cells are either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Previously, we isolated a zzso from human zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport activity and was inhibited by coronary zzso drugs zzso and zzso that may compete with zzso and zzso for binding to the zzso binding zzso We now report the molecular cloning and functional expression of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso identical to zzso in zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso identical to zzso and corresponded to a full-length form of the zzso zzso response gene product zzso a protein of unknown function previously cloned in truncated zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso whereas zzso was zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso Both proteins zzso zzso zzso influx zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), were broadly selective for zzso and zzso zzso including zzso and were relatively insensitive to zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso transport activities are zzso by separate, but zzso proteins and establish a function for the zzso gene zzso
