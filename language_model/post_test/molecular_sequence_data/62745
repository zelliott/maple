zzso zzso is well known for its durable zzso zzso which allow the zzso to grow at low temperature and pH and high zzso Growth under high zzso depends on the zzso of compatible zzso among which zzso zzso and zzso are the preferred zzso for this zzso Three different transport systems, zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso zzso which serve to zzso the preferred compatible zzso The general stress response regulator zzso has been shown to play an important role in zzso adaptation in zzso zzso presumably by directing zzso from one or more of the zzso transport zzso In the studies presented here, we have used primer extension analyses to identify the promoter elements responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso All three genes are zzso zzso to some zzso zzso is transcribed from a zzso promoter, while zzso is transcribed from dual zzso one of which is zzso zzso zzso is transcribed exclusively from a zzso zzso The zzso promoter is similar in sequence to the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of transcript zzso after zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso transcripts from zzso and zzso accumulate for an extended period after zzso suggesting that zzso activity may provide a mechanism for sustained high-level expression during zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso expression from the zzso zzso and zzso promoters after temperature zzso and ethanol stress was zzso suggesting that additional mechanisms may also participate in regulating zzso from these zzso zzso
