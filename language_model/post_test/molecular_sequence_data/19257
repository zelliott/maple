The zzso zzso zzso zzso has an unusual floral structure that includes two zzso distinct whorls of zzso zzso and a clearly differentiated fifth organ type, the zzso In this study, we have sought to determine how zzso zzso of the B class genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso contribute to these novel forms of organ zzso zzso expression analyses of the three zzso zzso and one zzso zzso in zzso and floral zzso zzso lines reveal complex patterns that suggest that zzso B class function has been elaborated in zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the protein products of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can form zzso much like what has been observed for their core zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso gene zzso indicates that in addition to zzso and zzso identity, this locus is essential to zzso identity but may not control the identity of the zzso zzso Our findings show that zzso floral organ identity programs can be zzso and modified to produce additional organ zzso In addition, they indicate that some types of zzso zzso are not entirely dependent on zzso zzso for their zzso
