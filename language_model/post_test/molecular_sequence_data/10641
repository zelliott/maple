The genetic structure of zzso zzso recovered from three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso grown in Mexico was zzso Among 41 zzso zzso 18 zzso types zzso were distinguished by zzso zzso zzso of five zzso zzso The mean genetic diversity, zzso indicated that there was great genetic diversity in the population zzso Most zzso zzso fell into two closely related clusters zzso I and zzso and were the types most frequently isolated from the root zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cluster III zzso were frequent zzso occupants of zzso zzso The zzso also were assigned to three main groups by using zzso point zzso mass zzso In general, the zzso zzso zzso data and zzso mass zzso data zzso We determined the zzso zzso sequences of representative zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso and found that the zzso zzso were highly related to the zzso zzso type strain, although not all zzso zzso type strains zzso maintained in different bacterial zzso had identical zzso zzso
