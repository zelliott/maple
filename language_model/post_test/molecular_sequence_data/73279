Five hybrid constructions of zzso protein zzso each containing an inserted zzso from the zzso region of the envelope proteins of zzso B virus zzso have been zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso with the zzso hybrid zzso demonstrating that the zzso presented by these zzso proteins mimic the zzso zzso of the native viral zzso In addition, all five hybrid proteins have been zzso zzso structural solutions obtained by molecular replacement indicate that the native zzso of zzso is preserved in the hybrid constructions despite the significant length of the zzso zzso
