zzso in whole blood incubated on zzso zzso zzso produced by bovine zzso zzso cells under zzso flow conditions demonstrate extensive zzso zzso Since both zzso and zzso interactions are zzso by von zzso factor zzso we used this system to examine the effect of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the native zzso zzso on zzso zzso with zzso The seven zzso present in the zzso zzso were reduced and zzso in order to achieve a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso When added to zzso zzso it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso whole blood to zzso was inhibited by zzso in a dose dependent and zzso manner, with zzso of 4 zzso and zzso zzso (about zzso at 6 zzso zzso electron microscope zzso analysis showed that addition of zzso to whole blood significantly inhibited zzso zzso on zzso The extent of zzso observed with zzso at a final concentration of 4 zzso was similar to that obtained with the cell zzso zzso zzso at the concentration of zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso on zzso is in agreement with the concept that blockade of zzso interaction may inhibit further events leading to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex and subsequent zzso zzso
