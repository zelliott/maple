We first identified and characterized a novel zzso zzso designated as zzso from the zzso library of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso consisted of zzso zzso with an open reading frame zzso a mature protein of 247 zzso zzso It showed a significant zzso to zzso 4 zzso with the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso and zzso indicating that it should be a new member of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein had a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an estimated zzso point of zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso could be detected in all the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was cloned into the expression zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso by zzso High Performance zzso column zzso and analyzed for its biological zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the ability to reduce hydrogen zzso and protect zzso DNA from zzso damage, suggesting that zzso protein may play an important role in protecting zzso from zzso zzso
