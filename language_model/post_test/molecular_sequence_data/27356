The zzso zzso zzso can alternate its zzso zzso a process called zzso chromatic adaptation zzso allowing it to zzso in green light zzso and in fluctuating light zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso requires zzso for photosynthesis under all light zzso Two alternative zzso catalyze the penultimate step of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is light independent, while zzso requires zzso zzso we zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso so that zzso is more abundant when zzso is less zzso We cloned the genes zzso the three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to determine the abundance of the transcripts under red light zzso zzso and dark zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are transcribed as parts of a single zzso a gene structure that is zzso within zzso zzso levels of all zzso genes are zzso approximately zzso in zzso relative to levels in zzso whereas zzso transcript levels are reduced in zzso Moreover, zzso in zzso regulators, zzso and zzso modify zzso and zzso transcript levels under specific light zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso transcripts are zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso These results provide the first evidence that light quality and zzso affect the genetic regulation of zzso zzso in freshwater zzso ecologically important zzso zzso
