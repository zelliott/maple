zzso administration of zzso can dampen or prevent zzso processes by induction of bystander zzso Based on encouraging results from experiments in zzso diabetic zzso mice, clinical trials have been initiated in type 1 diabetes using human insulin as an oral zzso However, neither the precise zzso requirements nor the mechanism of bystander suppression are currently understood in zzso Here we report that 1) a zzso difference in position 30 of the insulin B chain zzso the ability of insulin to zzso protection in both zzso as well as a zzso transgenic mouse model for type 1 zzso In the latter model transgenic mice express the zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso under the control of the rat insulin zzso zzso in the pancreatic beta cells and develop diabetes only following zzso zzso and 2) protection could be transferred with insulin B zzso but not zzso zzso from zzso transgenic mice, demonstrating that the mechanism of diabetes prevention in the zzso model is zzso by insulin B zzso zzso regulatory cells acting as bystander zzso
