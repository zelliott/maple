zzso a zzso of zzso and zzso serves as a storage compound for zzso carbon and energy in many zzso Analysis of available zzso sequences from zzso identified zzso zzso zzso proteins of high similarity to known zzso zzso and zzso from zzso in various strains of bacteria belonging to different zzso zzso and not closely related to zzso Genes of zzso metabolism occur in a wide range of bacteria exhibiting diverse zzso capabilities, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This study identified different groups of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and proposes a collective zzso for the putative genes and zzso of zzso zzso Among zzso different microbial zzso whose zzso have been partially or completely zzso and are publicly accessible, we identified 44 zzso which possess a zzso zzso and are zzso able to zzso zzso From these, 31 zzso harbor also a zzso enabling them to degrade zzso to zzso From the latter, 24 strains possess in addition a zzso necessary to zzso zzso zzso thereby enabling them to completely zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to have a much wider distribution among zzso than previously zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not identified in the zzso of zzso and zzso and are therefore obviously only occurring in zzso In addition, the outcome of this detailed in zzso analysis proposes to distinguish 10 different groups of zzso zzso
