zzso a zzso to 3' zzso specific for zzso DNA, functions in DNA repair and zzso zzso We determined the crystal structure of zzso bound to zzso zzso essential for its zzso zzso has a novel fold in which two zzso are interconnected by a long zzso forming a central zzso zzso is located on the wall of the groove and is coordinated by zzso zzso characteristic of a family of zzso that includes zzso zzso The groove is composed of zzso zzso among zzso proteins and is positively zzso These findings and the narrow zzso of the groove indicate that the groove binds zzso instead of zzso zzso
