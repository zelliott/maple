The zzso zzso and zzso are representatives of the zzso zzso The zzso molecules of zzso immune system in zzso are different from the zzso receptors in zzso zzso The unique zzso molecules of zzso are known as variable zzso receptors zzso There are three types of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso and constitute the major components of the zzso arm of the zzso zzso immune zzso zzso zzso zzso are composed of four or five zzso zzso zzso which are similar to zzso zzso in structure and zzso In this study, the conservative zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso After zzso mice zzso cell fusion, the positive clones were screened by indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso cells that produced specific zzso zzso zzso were zzso In order to get a large number of zzso against zzso the zzso cells were injected into the abdominal cavity of zzso mice and the zzso were zzso by protein G zzso The results of zzso indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso Western zzso zzso showed that the zzso were able to detect both zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed the existence of zzso on the surface of zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso provided a major tool for studying zzso zzso immune zzso
