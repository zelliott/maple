To characterize novel multiple zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 15 isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso produced novel zzso By using three zzso steps, four zzso peptides termed zzso A zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso Q and zzso N were zzso from the culture zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso A zzso and zzso zzso 15 were identical to that of zzso zzso zzso belonging to class zzso zzso but zzso A zzso was deficient in seven zzso zzso zzso Q and zzso N are novel class zzso zzso Moreover, the DNA sequences zzso three zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso Q and zzso N were zzso 

These zzso including two novel zzso were identified from zzso zzso zzso zzso They showed similar zzso zzso but their zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso 15 was important for its zzso zzso zzso Q and N were zzso by adjacent open reading frames zzso in the same zzso but zzso zzso 15 was zzso 

These zzso were produced zzso by the same zzso Although the two novel zzso were zzso by adjacent zzso a characteristic of class zzso zzso they did not show synergistic zzso
