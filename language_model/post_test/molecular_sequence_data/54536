The fruit flesh color of zzso is an important nutritional quality trait and is due to the zzso of zzso To zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso genes were isolated from zzso (named zzso and zzso using the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso approach, and their expression levels were investigated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame coding for zzso zzso zzso while zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame coding for zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso and zzso proteins contain a zzso zzso site at the zzso and a zzso domain at the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are single zzso the zzso was mapped to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso were expressed in all zzso examined with the highest expression in maturing zzso and that the expression of zzso and zzso were higher in zzso fruits than in zzso zzso These results indicated that the differential zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso varieties might be partly explained by the zzso level of zzso and zzso
