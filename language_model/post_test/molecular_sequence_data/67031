The ability of zzso zzso zzso to recognize most of its target peptides is caused by its binding to two zzso zzso zzso In most of the zzso complexes, the anchors pack against the zzso pockets of the zzso zzso and are surrounded by fully zzso Met side zzso Here, by using zzso simulations, we investigate zzso the zzso of the final step of this process using the zzso zzso which has a high affinity and spans the sequence of the skeletal zzso light chain zzso an important natural zzso zzso We established the accuracy of our calculations by a comparison between calculated and zzso structural and zzso zzso Our calculations provide novel insights into the mechanism of zzso zzso we show that the process is associated with a free energy gain similar to that zzso measured for the zzso complex with the zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1995, zzso 34, zzso We suggest that binding is dominated by the zzso effect, in agreement with previous zzso Furthermore, we explain the role of zzso zzso by showing that the large flexibility of these side chains is a key feature of the binding zzso Finally, we provide a rationale for the experimental observation that in all zzso complexes the zzso domain seems to be zzso more important in establishing the zzso
