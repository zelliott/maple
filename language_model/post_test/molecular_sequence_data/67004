To mutate human zzso V gene and transform it to zzso zzso for zzso human zzso V zzso so as to be zzso as active zzso V with zzso metal zzso zzso 

The zzso and 3' end of native zzso V gene were zzso by specific zzso The zzso zzso V gene was inserted into zzso and zzso The correct zzso was zzso and transformed into zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso The zzso were selected from MD plates and cultured in zzso medium and induced with zzso The culture was zzso and the zzso was analyzed by zzso and silver zzso The binding activity of zzso human zzso V from culture zzso was determined with zzso exposed zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso end of native human zzso V gene was fused with zzso coding sequence and 3' end zzso site zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins of relative molecular mass 36 zzso 48 h after methanol zzso The concentration of this protein that inhibited 50% of the binding of zzso V was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso human zzso V with zzso zzso sites can be expressed in zzso zzso zzso
