zzso of zzso pepper by the tobacco etch virus zzso typically causes zzso associated with root zzso However, a strain of zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso pepper plants but does not cause zzso In order to locate the genetic zzso responsible for the zzso response, a full-length zzso clone of zzso zzso from which infectious transcripts can be derived was zzso A number of zzso zzso were prepared by substituting zzso fragments between zzso zzso (which causes zzso and zzso zzso zzso This approach was used to identify two zzso zzso in zzso zzso one encompasses the 3' one-third of the zzso zzso zzso the other spans the 3' end of the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso end of the zzso coding zzso zzso of both these zzso zzso fragments into zzso zzso resulted in infection but not zzso of zzso pepper, while the replacement of either of the fragments alone did not alter the zzso zzso This indicates that both zzso zzso regions contain zzso necessary but not sufficient to alter the zzso response and that both must be present in order to avoid the zzso zzso There was no difference between the in zzso zzso products derived from zzso containing these regions from zzso zzso and zzso zzso
