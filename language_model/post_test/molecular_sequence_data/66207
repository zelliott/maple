An expression system for high-level expression of the native zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has been developed in zzso zzso using the methanol zzso alcohol zzso 1 zzso zzso To zzso zzso two zzso coding regions have been designed and expressed alongside the zzso coding zzso To ensure zzso of the native mature zzso a truncated version of the alpha mating factor zzso signal from zzso zzso was zzso In order to be able to compare expression levels from different zzso single zzso zzso generated by gene replacement of the zzso gene was selected by zzso zzso Following methanol zzso expression levels reached 125 zzso from the zzso coding region while expression from the two zzso zzso reached 65 and 125 zzso zzso The protein was zzso and characterized by zzso degradation, liquid zzso mass zzso and zzso blue starch zzso and was shown to possess the same characteristics as zzso protein zzso from barley zzso
