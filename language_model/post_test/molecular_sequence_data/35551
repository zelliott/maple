zzso virus zzso is a novel zzso recently identified from a patient with acute zzso fever in the zzso province of the Democratic Republic of zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso can be successfully used to zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso allowing studies of zzso membrane fusion and viral entry into target cells without zzso zzso zzso displayed broad tissue and species zzso in zzso and zzso membrane fusion was pH zzso The zzso changes induced in zzso by zzso were fully zzso and did not lead to zzso of the viral fusion zzso Our data combined with comparative sequence similarity analyses suggest that zzso shares structural and functional features with other zzso zzso and falls into the group of class III viral fusion zzso However, zzso of zzso fusion required a lower pH and higher temperatures than did zzso zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso mature zzso in zzso zzso consists of a mixture of zzso and complex zzso that enables it to bind to certain zzso zzso thereby enhancing its attachment to target zzso Taken together, the results presented in this study will facilitate future investigations of zzso cell entry and its zzso in the absence of an infectious cell culture zzso for zzso and at lower zzso zzso Moreover, zzso testing based on zzso zzso zzso can be used to uncover the prevalence and importance of zzso as a potential novel human pathogen in the zzso and throughout Central zzso
