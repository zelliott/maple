In examining the protein zzso components of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulate the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, we previously found that distinct upstream zzso were involved in responses to zzso and zzso Here we have extended that analysis to the possible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso provided a major contribution to zzso zzso by zzso To explore the possible link to zzso in zzso cells, we isolated and characterized zzso zzso zzso 1), one of two human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein of zzso zzso acids that is widely expressed in zzso zzso and cell zzso Of potential regulators surveyed, zzso zzso is activated only by zzso zzso notably zzso and to a lesser extent zzso However, zzso did not increase the activity of zzso zzso nor did it activate three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso screen implicated another zzso family member, the zzso protein zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84 in the zzso regulatory domain of zzso Replacement of zzso 84 with zzso reduced the zzso of zzso by an active form of the small G protein zzso suggesting that zzso by zzso zzso the G protein sensitivity of zzso zzso
