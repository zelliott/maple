The zzso zzso nitrogen zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that belongs to a family of zzso protein zzso dedicated to the regulation of plasma membrane zzso Its activity is regulated by the zzso (target of zzso signaling zzso zzso of the zzso proteins by treating zzso cells with the zzso drug zzso promotes rapid zzso of zzso As an alternative to zzso zzso the zzso requirement of zzso was zzso with a zzso library that was generated by zzso zzso cell extracts with zzso and after zzso zzso the individual zzso were zzso in zzso with zzso zzso In this way, the zzso protein zzso was found to be an excellent in zzso zzso for zzso zzso peptides tailored around the zzso site of zzso show that zzso is a zzso protein zzso with an absolute requirement for a basic zzso at the zzso position and a strong preference for basic P + 1 zzso whereas zzso at P + 1 is strongly zzso The results obtained with synthetic peptides suggest a zzso consensus sequence for zzso The availability of a consensus sequence allows a targeted search for zzso relevant zzso zzso involved in the regulation of zzso zzso acid zzso
