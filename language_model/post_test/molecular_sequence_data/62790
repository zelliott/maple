We previously reported that the zzso domain of the zzso zzso chain is responsible for zzso zzso zzso To specify the zzso acid zzso involved in this activity, we produced a series of zzso zzso proteins in which each of the 27 basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were replaced one by one with zzso zzso When the effective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are mapped on a structural model, they form a track on the zzso surface of the zzso suggesting that they interact with adjacent zzso groups along the zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso sites of other LG zzso have been located at the top of the zzso sandwich opposite the N and C zzso the zzso for zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso reveal a new zzso area of the LG zzso
