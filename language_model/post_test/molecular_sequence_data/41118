When genetic structure is identified using zzso DNA zzso but no structure is identified using zzso nuclear DNA, the zzso is often attributed to differences in zzso potential between the zzso 

We sampled the zzso rocky shore zzso Perna zzso in a South African bay and along the nearby open coast, and zzso zzso zzso (there is no evidence for zzso zzso in this zzso and a zzso zzso By treating males and females as different zzso we identified significant genetic structure on the basis of zzso data in the females zzso 

This is the first study to report zzso differences in genetic structure based on zzso zzso in a passively zzso species that lacks social structure or sexual zzso The observed pattern most likely stems from females being more vulnerable to selection in zzso from which they did not zzso which also zzso itself in a zzso sex zzso Our results have three important implications for the interpretation of population genetic zzso First, even when zzso is inherited exclusively in the female line, it also contains information about zzso For that reason, using it to identify zzso differences in genetic structure by contrasting it with zzso markers is zzso Second, the fact that zzso differences were found in a passively zzso species in which zzso zzso is unlikely highlights the fact that significant genetic structure is not necessarily a function of low zzso potential or physical zzso Third, even though zzso is typically used to study historical demographic zzso it also contains information about contemporary zzso Higher survival rates of males in non-native zzso can erase the genetic structure present in their mothers within a single zzso
