Plasma zzso of zzso zzso are markedly increased during zzso but the role of AM has not been zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso protein zzso 2 or 3 have been reported to form the zzso zzso specific zzso We examined the expression of zzso and zzso 2, and 3 in several zzso from mice in a zzso model induced by zzso zzso High expression of zzso and zzso zzso was observed in lungs of normal mice, but it was markedly decreased in zzso zzso It is suggested that the abundant binding sites of AM in lungs are formed by zzso and zzso in healthy subjects and that their reduction should contribute to the increase of plasma AM zzso during zzso In contrast, zzso treatment markedly increased zzso gene expression in zzso zzso and zzso It is revealed that the zzso of zzso or binding sites of AM are changed in zzso and it is suggested that AM plays distinct roles in the clinical course of this zzso
