zzso of the genes required for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso is controlled primarily by the zzso zzso protein zzso The upstream zzso sequences for zzso zzso of most zzso genes have multiple sites to which zzso can zzso In this report we compare the binding properties of wild type zzso and derivatives of zzso bearing the zzso zzso domain to multiple zzso sites in zzso To produce wild type zzso we constructed a zzso zzso for expression in insect zzso zzso wild type zzso was found to bind efficiently to an zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso site in zzso mobility shift zzso zzso experiments revealed that wild type zzso binds zzso to the four zzso zzso sites of the zzso zzso however, in contrast an zzso zzso of zzso containing only the zzso zzso binds to each of these sites with slightly different zzso With increasing zzso of zzso the four sites become filled in the following order: site II, site IV, site I, and site zzso In experiments with wild type zzso these four sites become fully occupied at approximately the same concentration of zzso In zzso of wild type zzso on the zzso enhancements and protections of zzso zzso zzso are zzso between sites III and IV, indicative of formation of a loop between these zzso spaced zzso zzso of wild type zzso to a strong zzso binding site assists binding to an adjacent zzso site in both zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso and zzso fused to portions of zzso zzso region II were incapable of cooperative DNA binding in our zzso We conclude from these observations that wild type zzso has a cooperative zzso function that is distinct from the DNA binding and zzso or zzso zzso functions, and likely plays and important role in precise regulation of zzso gene zzso
