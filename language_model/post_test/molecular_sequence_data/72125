We have found a novel zzso zzso a 265 zzso acid protein possessing a WW domain in our full-length zzso zzso The WW domain was sandwiched between an zzso region and an zzso zzso acid repetitive zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso produced a 38 zzso product that was also found in the cell zzso by western zzso zzso Thus this protein is named the nuclear protein containing a WW domain with a molecular mass of 38 zzso zzso zzso studies and expression of a fusion protein to a green fluorescent protein revealed that this protein is localized in the zzso zzso was shown to be capable of binding to a zzso zzso Interestingly, the WW domain of zzso was found to function as a zzso zzso in zzso cells using the zzso zzso fusion zzso Furthermore, the WW zzso of human zzso and zzso were demonstrated to have a similar zzso zzso Combined zzso of the zzso first and second zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso in the WW domain of zzso abolished the zzso activity, but single zzso of these sites did zzso These results suggest that some WW zzso potentially possess zzso activity in zzso zzso
