A zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a sludge sample from the zzso sewage disposal plant in South zzso A zzso approach was applied to study the zzso position of strain zzso zzso zzso showed highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to the type strains of other zzso species were less than zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso formed by members of the zzso zzso in the family zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of strain zzso showed features typical of the zzso zzso with zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso zzso acid as the zzso acid in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso On the basis of zzso zzso fatty acid profile and other zzso properties, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
