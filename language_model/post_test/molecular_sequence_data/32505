Human zzso virus zzso infection begins with fusion between viral and host cell zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso fusion zzso The approximately 20 zzso zzso zzso of zzso are called the zzso fusion zzso zzso interact with the host cell zzso and play a key role in zzso In this study, the membrane location of peptides which contained the zzso sequence zzso was zzso in samples containing either only zzso or zzso and zzso Four zzso were examined which each contained zzso labeling at three sequential zzso between zzso and zzso The zzso chemical shifts indicated that zzso had zzso beta strand zzso over the labeled zzso in the zzso The zzso distances between the zzso zzso groups and the zzso zzso atoms were measured using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso The shortest zzso distances of 5-6 A were observed for zzso labeled between A14 and zzso and correlated with intimate association of beta strand zzso and zzso These results were confirmed with zzso using zzso zzso labeled with zzso at A6 or zzso To our knowledge, these data are the first zzso of distances between zzso fusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso and qualitative models of the membrane location of zzso beta strand zzso which are consistent with the experimental data are zzso Observation of intimate contact between beta strand zzso and zzso provides a rationale for further investigation of the relationship between structure and fusion activity for this zzso
