Twelve zzso clinical zzso of zzso coli zzso acid zzso 64 to 512 zzso zzso zzso zzso to 8 zzso were transformed with zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene and with zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene to examine the proportion of zzso and zzso zzso Transformation with zzso resulted in zzso zzso acid zzso 4 to 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, no change in zzso were observed after transformation with zzso A zzso zzso of zzso from the 12 strains was amplified by zzso zzso DNA sequencing of that zzso identified the causes of zzso resistance in eight strains as a single point zzso leading to a substitution of the zzso at position 83 zzso to zzso and in four strains as a single point zzso leading to a substitution of zzso to zzso Exchange of the zzso from one of these strains with that of zzso and transformation of resistance with the hybrid zzso zzso indicated the contribution of zzso to resistance and the zzso of zzso containing zzso zzso Thus, zzso gene zzso are probably encountered more often than zzso gene zzso in clinical zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the substitution of zzso to zzso can be encountered in such zzso On the basis of the level of resistance found in the zzso exchange experiment, the zzso resistance attributable to zzso appears to be comparable to that attributable to zzso The levels of resistance found in the clinical zzso shown to have a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 64 to 512 zzso zzso zzso zzso to 4 zzso suggest that the zzso zzso causes resistance at the level of the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso or less) and that the additional increments in resistance seen in the other strains with higher levels of resistance may be attributable to additional zzso The zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso products readily detected zzso zzso and zzso zzso
