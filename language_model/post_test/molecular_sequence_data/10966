Random zzso with zzso selection has been used to zzso scan the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the sheep zzso for zzso acid zzso that alter zzso zzso The four random zzso libraries used in this study include all of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso as well as zzso of the zzso zzso Through an extensive number of zzso cell zzso of these libraries and subsequent zzso selection, 24 zzso clones have been zzso All previously described zzso acids that zzso zzso resistance were identified, confirming the zzso of this random zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso that zzso the greatest zzso resistance, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified more than once in this zzso This extensive survey of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso has identified two new regions of the zzso that affect zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The new zzso identified in this study are zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso domain and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso modest increases in the concentration of cardiac zzso needed to produce 50% zzso of activity zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this extensive screening of the zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso acids zzso that are important in zzso sensitivity further supports our hypothesis that the zzso and zzso regions represent the major binding sites for the cardiac zzso class of zzso
