zzso zzso zzso zzso is the infectious cause of zzso zzso zzso and certain zzso particularly in the context of human zzso virus zzso type zzso zzso The introduction of effective therapies to treat zzso has led to a decline in the zzso of zzso suggesting that immune responses may play a role in controlling zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso activity against zzso proteins has been zzso however, the identification of zzso zzso zzso remains elusive and zzso Although the zzso zzso layout is generally zzso zzso encodes a unique zzso zzso zzso with intense biological selection pressure at specific zzso acid zzso To investigate whether this zzso is partly driven by cellular zzso we designed zzso peptides that match only the unique viral sequence for every individual studied here zzso zzso We identified functional zzso zzso within zzso most variable areas, and we show that a given individual responds only to zzso peptides and not to peptides from other zzso Furthermore, these zzso are highly zzso sequences within zzso zzso from a specific strain but are not zzso between different zzso We conclude that zzso recognition contributes to zzso and therefore to zzso zzso
