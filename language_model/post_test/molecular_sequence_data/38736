An analysis of the complete zzso sequence of the composite zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso A comparison of the protein sequences from zzso and zzso zzso has identified four zzso acid zzso These zzso appear to play an important role in normal zzso function and may account for the differences in exhibited zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by this version of zzso share zzso identity with those of zzso demonstrating the conservation that exists between these zzso A previously zzso approximately zzso region of zzso contains four putative open reading zzso One of these open reading frames shares zzso identity with the zzso zzso protein sequence from zzso zzso although it was unable to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso with which it shares 51% zzso The three remaining putative open reading frames are arranged as a discrete genetic unit adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso and are transcribed in the opposite zzso Two of these open reading frames are zzso with zzso zzso proteins of unknown functions while the other has no zzso in the zzso The presence of an zzso zzso class II motif in one of these open reading frames in combination with the zzso zzso zzso allows us to zzso that this region of zzso could once have played a role in zzso acid zzso
