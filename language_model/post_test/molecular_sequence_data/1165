We have cloned genes involved in the initial stage of fruit development in the melon by suppression zzso zzso A zzso library of zzso zzso was zzso from that of fruit 9 days after zzso zzso 10 of the 40 selected zzso clones were identified by reverse Northern analysis as genes zzso expressed in fruit at 9 zzso Seven of the ten genes were zzso to genes of known zzso two were related to genes with unknown functions, and one was zzso With the exception of zzso none of the zzso had been previously identified in zzso According to Northern zzso six of the genes were expressed at high levels early in fruit zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was highest at 9 zzso zzso that these genes are involved in the initial stage of fruit zzso zzso a seed zzso zzso was also expressed early in seed zzso The other genes were expressed at a moderate level throughout fruit development, with the highest expression occurring in fruit at 9 and 18 zzso In conclusion, nine new genes involved in early fruit development in melon were zzso and their zzso and spatial expression patterns indicate that they are zzso expressed during the active growing stage of zzso
