The zzso protein is a zzso zzso found in many zzso zzso It is a member of the zzso family of zzso and has 12 predicted zzso zzso spanning segments zzso While the zzso binding site has previously been mapped to a region near the surface of the zzso zzso layer, no structural feature within the zzso zzso of zzso have been shown to be important for zzso We examined the role of the only large outer loop, situated between zzso spanning segment 7 and 8, in zzso zzso zzso of the highly zzso zzso acids in the region closest to zzso spanning segment 7 produced a protein with little zzso zzso zzso of this region showed that zzso and zzso were required for optimal zzso zzso The zzso zzso transported zzso at a lower zzso rate compared to zzso zzso but with the same zzso binding zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso had a higher zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso of this zzso which is located at or near the membrane surface, is important for zzso zzso Secondary structure predictions of the large outer loop indicated the presence of a zzso zzso in the zzso with a zzso region at each end suggesting that the loop was not entirely exposed to the zzso zzso zzso The study shows that loop zzso is important for zzso function, possibly by forming a zzso loop in the channel of the zzso
