A shift in the spectrum of zzso a induced by calcium or zzso zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso has been attributed to interaction of zzso or zzso with the vicinity of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso c zzso and proposed to be associated with the exit path of zzso zzso However, this shift is absent in zzso c zzso from zzso and bacteria zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso or zzso in a newly described zzso binding site in zzso I of zzso c zzso from zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 94, zzso establish the zzso spectral shift in zzso zzso This shift is zzso by low pH and by sodium zzso as was described for zzso zzso c zzso but in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also able to shift the zzso a spectrum, albeit to a smaller zzso We conclude that the zzso shift in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is due to binding of the zzso to the new metal binding zzso zzso of the structures of this site in the two types of zzso allows rationalization of their different zzso with zzso zzso analysis and data from zzso zzso experiments suggest mechanisms by which the zzso binding may influence the zzso zzso
