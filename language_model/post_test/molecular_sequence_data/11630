The zzso proteins are involved in regulation of many muscle specific zzso Although zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso the presence of zzso proteins in zzso cell types has been zzso Here we use a zzso zzso in conjunction with DNA binding studies to provide evidence that members of the zzso family are widely expressed in the zzso of cultured cells and are competent to bind zzso The data show that zzso zzso complexes contain zzso and that another zzso zzso probably zzso is also zzso These results suggest that zzso proteins zzso functions in addition to zzso gene zzso
