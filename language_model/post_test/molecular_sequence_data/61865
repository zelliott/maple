The type II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IV zzso also known as zzso or zzso zzso binding zzso is a major regulator of various zzso zzso including zzso zzso nervous, and zzso zzso It has been generally accepted that zzso of zzso and of other zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for zzso activity and correct protein zzso zzso studies on zzso reveal clear zzso zzso of nine zzso zzso in zzso However, the importance of each zzso site on zzso relevant reactions such as zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso zzso binding remains zzso Individual zzso point zzso were introduced at the nine zzso sites in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso does not contribute significantly to its zzso zzso The kinetic parameters of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso site zzso were determined by using zzso and zzso as zzso and varied by zzso zzso is active as a zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso site zzso do not affect zzso zzso binds to the highly zzso zzso domain of zzso but the impact of zzso on binding had not previously been zzso Our studies indicate that zzso of zzso is not required for zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that in contrast to the generally accepted view, zzso of zzso is not a prerequisite for zzso zzso or zzso zzso
