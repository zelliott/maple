The gene spa P (formerly designated as spa zzso zzso the Mr zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso has been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso includes a putative signal zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso region zzso zzso The zzso part of the protein zzso zzso is particularly rich in zzso and includes three tandem repeats of a sequence of 82 zzso This region is predicted to be zzso adopting a zzso formation, and may account for the cell surface zzso associated with expression of zzso zzso In contrast the zzso region zzso zzso is zzso zzso an extended zzso zzso with the sequence determined from zzso zzso strain zzso showed that zzso zzso is highly zzso with the exception of a short central region zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso I and II components indicated that zzso I extends from the zzso of the intact Mr zzso surface zzso while zzso II extends from zzso zzso
