zzso zzso accessory protein zzso is the second zzso required to form a functional zzso complex for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso While it does not directly interact with the zzso zzso is necessary to mediate signal zzso We previously reported a zzso zzso with an unknown zzso termed zzso that was capable to induce a significant increase in the size of zzso colonies when added to cultures of human zzso blood zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso recognizes zzso We show that this zzso zzso is significantly present on peripheral blood zzso and zzso including zzso and zzso T zzso B and zzso zzso Interestingly, its expression is found increased on zzso T cells when compared to zzso T cell zzso suggesting that the level of zzso membrane expression could allow to distinguish within zzso T zzso the zzso T regulatory subset from conventional zzso T zzso zzso studies reveal that addition of zzso zzso enhances the proliferation of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso obtained with zzso zzso of zzso Interestingly, we found that although zzso zzso does not increase the optimal zzso proliferation induced by a zzso pair of zzso zzso it zzso their time of zzso Thus, these results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso exhibits unique functional properties by triggering zzso signals in zzso
