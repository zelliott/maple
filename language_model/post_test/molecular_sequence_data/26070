Goose zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from zzso zzso zzso through molecular zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso on zzso zzso zzso Despite apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso measured by zzso gel zzso with sodium zzso appeared near 17 zzso this value fell to 11 zzso after reduction with zzso suggesting the existence of a zzso Complete zzso acid sequence zzso zzso of goose zzso has been zzso zzso and zzso sequences of the protein have been established by zzso degradation zzso and use of zzso Y, zzso zzso derived from oxidized or zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been isolated by zzso liquid zzso and zzso allowing determination of the complete zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso namely goose zzso to zzso zzso and to deduced zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso between positions 66 and 67 in the zzso zzso When goose zzso zzso zzso and goose zzso are compared to their bovine counterparts, identical zzso are found in positions 17 zzso in both goose zzso instead of zzso in both zzso zzso 18 zzso instead of zzso 35 zzso instead of zzso and 41 zzso instead of zzso zzso of the sequences zzso in both zzso zzso has been explained by partial gene conversion between zzso and zzso zzso and identical zzso in both goose zzso might reveal a similar gene conversion between zzso and zzso genes in zzso
