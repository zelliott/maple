The goal of this study was to explore the occurrence of zzso proteins in zzso given that these zzso are endowed with a zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and considering the important role that zzso have in energy zzso Our hypothesis is that zzso of proteins constitutes a zzso modification by which zzso exhibits long-term effects above and beyond those zzso ones zzso through the interaction with zzso c zzso Our studies are aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying the zzso of proteins in zzso and the biological significance of such a process in the cellular zzso On promoting a sustained zzso production by zzso we investigated various aspects of protein zzso Among them, the zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso the identification of zzso proteins through zzso approaches, the characterization of affected zzso and depiction of a target zzso The biological relevance was analyzed by considering the turnover of native and zzso zzso In this regard, zzso dysfunction, ensuing zzso stress, may be envisioned as the result of zzso of zzso zzso resulting from an overproduction of zzso zzso (this zzso a failure in the zzso system to zzso modified zzso or a combination of zzso Finally, this study allows one to gain understanding on the mechanism and zzso species underlying zzso protein zzso
