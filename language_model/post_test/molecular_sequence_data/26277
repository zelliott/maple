zzso zzso protein zzso clones were isolated from a rat zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed three different zzso sequences zzso two somewhat different open reading frames of 176 zzso zzso The zzso 24 zzso acids of these sequences show the typical characteristics of signal peptides of zzso zzso The zzso end of the derived protein sequences displays sequence similarity to a number of zzso zzso zzso called zzso suggesting a common zzso zzso Upon Northern zzso with a labeled zzso fragment, three different zzso protein zzso zzso 950 zzso zzso 920 zzso and 860 zzso could be detected in the rat zzso prostate and the zzso zzso In both zzso these zzso were regulated by zzso showing the most rapid zzso response for the 950 zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso nearly completely abolished the observed zzso effect suggesting that a zzso protein is required for the full induction of the zzso protein zzso zzso experiments with specific zzso which distinguish between the zzso zzso both zzso protein zzso indicate that one protein form is less zzso dependent in the zzso prostate and not expressed in the zzso zzso
