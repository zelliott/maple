A zzso analysis of zzso ability was undertaken in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agent of bacterial brown spot disease of zzso Following a screen of zzso zzso derivatives of zzso on bean zzso 26 strains that did not form disease zzso were zzso Nine of the zzso strains were defective in the ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction zzso and were shown to contain zzso insertions within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten zzso zzso were defective in the production of the toxin zzso and a region of the zzso implicated in the zzso of zzso was deleted in a subset of these zzso The remaining seven zzso zzso retained the ability to produce zzso and zzso zzso exchange zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso in several zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso was characterized at the molecular zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region zzso the zzso within zzso revealed strong similarities to a number of known zzso coli gene products and DNA zzso the zzso zzso including the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of sequences containing the two potential zzso genes prevented restoration of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso insertions within the zzso strains zzso including zzso were not closely linked to each other or to the zzso or zzso genes previously identified as involved in zzso formation by zzso zzso zzso zzso
