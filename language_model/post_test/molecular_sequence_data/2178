zzso zzso clones have been isolated for an zzso which codes for four different but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and two other proteins of similar zzso The primary structure as deduced from the zzso sequence is highly zzso to the precursor of the rat zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The full-length clone was zzso long, starting from 8 bases above the zzso zzso and terminating with a zzso A zzso The zzso sequence confirmed an earlier prediction based on the zzso acid sequence that a previously published sequence contained zzso On the other hand, the zzso acid sequence now closely agrees with the recent revised sequence published by the same group except for several zzso acids near the zzso Two alternate forms of the zzso zzso were zzso differing from each other by the presence or absence of zzso acid zzso
