A group of 41 zzso each 24 zzso acids long and overlapping with each other by 12 zzso spanning the total gag open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso 10 zzso were zzso using zzso zzso The zzso compounds were used in zzso zzso and tested for zzso zzso in zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso humans showed zzso against four defined regions, two in zzso one in zzso and one in zzso The values of these zzso were elevated especially in serum samples of zzso individuals showing zzso with gag proteins on Western zzso zzso acid sequence comparison of zzso gag proteins with those of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) revealed significant similarities predominantly in the zzso showing elevated zzso zzso The majority of zzso from zzso individuals showed strong zzso to the zzso regions and to various other zzso zzso a sequential zzso recognized by all zzso zzso could, however, not be zzso The results suggest that human individuals may have immune reactions to zzso zzso protein zzso which are enhanced by infections with zzso zzso zzso to zzso gag proteins are probably mainly directed to zzso structure defined zzso formed by particle formation of the zzso zzso to the zzso
