When zzso factor G zzso binds to the zzso it first makes contact with the zzso domain zzso of zzso before interacting with the zzso domain zzso of zzso Here we have identified a universally zzso zzso zzso of zzso that functions as a zzso switch zzso as well as the corresponding center of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity on zzso that drives the zzso zzso of zzso Only the zzso zzso of zzso allows direct contact between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso analyses of both zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso center reveal their function in zzso zzso zzso activity, protein synthesis and cell survival in zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that all known universal zzso contain an active zzso zzso Our observations suggest that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is a universal event required for an efficient turnover of zzso throughout the translation zzso
