zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso regulate multiple aspects of zzso zzso T regulatory zzso cells are a critical subset that limits immune responses, but the relative importance of zzso versus zzso for zzso cell development has been zzso We observed that peripheral zzso T cells were reduced in zzso zzso however, the levels of zzso a zzso factor that is critical for zzso cells, were normal in zzso zzso T cells even though they were reduced in the zzso In contrast, complete deletion of zzso zzso resulted in dramatic reduction in zzso or zzso zzso T zzso An intrinsic requirement was demonstrated by reduction of zzso in zzso cells and by stem cell transplantation using zzso fetal liver zzso zzso were also required for optimal induction of zzso in zzso and bound directly to the zzso zzso Reduction of zzso in T cells did not reduce the numbers of zzso cells in the zzso or zzso however, zzso was required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso we conclude that zzso have an essential, zzso role in regulating zzso cells, and that zzso and zzso appear to have opposing roles in the regulation of zzso
