zzso zzso is an zzso disease caused by zzso zzso against zzso 3 zzso Previously, we isolated a zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso In the present study, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing zzso zzso to examine zzso tolerance and the zzso role of zzso zzso transgenic B cells were found in the zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was detected in the cardiovascular zzso The transgenic mice did not develop an obvious zzso zzso zzso however, even though an excess of zzso zzso was passively transferred to zzso zzso Similarly, when zzso cells producing zzso zzso were zzso into adult mice, no blistering was zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso binding at the edges of zzso or zzso cell zzso but not in the zzso core, where zzso zzso binding has been frequently zzso Furthermore, in an in zzso zzso zzso using cultured zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments, but not zzso zzso induced fragmentation of zzso zzso Together, these observations indicate that zzso must gain access to zzso integrated within zzso to induce the loss of zzso zzso zzso These findings provide an important framework for improved understanding of zzso tolerance and the zzso of zzso formation in zzso
