The crystal structure of the zzso binding domain zzso of the zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso with a steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a zzso active zzso in absence of any zzso The structure explains why zzso does not bind zzso with significant zzso zzso of the previously reported zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso requires structural zzso enlarging the zzso binding pocket that can only be zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors in which the zzso binding cavity is filled up by zzso side chains still interact with zzso in zzso and are zzso active in zzso but are no longer efficiently zzso by zzso or zzso These results provide structural and functional evidence for zzso zzso zzso by zzso
