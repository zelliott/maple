The zzso regulator zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso plays a key role in controlling gene expression in some zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso global regulatory zzso and zzso are found within the zzso of most zzso zzso zzso including the epidemic lineage zzso Comparative zzso sequencing of the wild type and otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso revealed a network of approximately 75 zzso regulated transcripts at late exponential growth phase, including many genes associated with zzso assembly and function, such as the major structural zzso zzso Other zzso regulated genes include several involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and toxin A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives were poorly zzso and exhibited reduced levels of colonization and relapses in the zzso infection zzso Thus, the zzso locus likely plays a zzso role in the fitness and zzso potential of zzso zzso strains in the zzso zzso
