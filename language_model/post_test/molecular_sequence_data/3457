zzso zzso zzso zzso is a solitary zzso zzso of zzso zzso Along with the egg the female zzso zzso zzso which are zzso for successful zzso zzso The zzso zzso is segmented and consists of zzso circular zzso zzso DNA is integrated in the zzso zzso virus replication is restricted to the zzso zzso and does not occur in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso protects the zzso zzso from zzso by the zzso immune system and causes a zzso arrest of the host in the zzso zzso Here we report on the first two cloned zzso zzso which are named zzso and zzso because of their zzso on segment zzso The zzso of zzso has a size of zzso zzso the gene contains seven zzso interrupted by six zzso of similar size and encodes a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso has a size of zzso zzso the gene consists of three zzso and encodes a putative zzso of 77 zzso zzso zzso quantities of both genes are very low up to the penultimate zzso zzso of the zzso In the last zzso at the stage of zzso cell formation, zzso expression increases about zzso and zzso expression about a zzso These are the first data to show strong zzso of zzso genes towards the end of zzso These two genes might be involved in the reduction of host zzso observed at this zzso
