The zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso initiation module of zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso presented as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 22 zzso of this E domain that are zzso across the approximately 450 zzso E zzso of zzso zzso zzso were constructed, and the zzso derivatives expressed in zzso coli as zzso His tag zzso and then zzso and zzso for three activities: zzso the zzso zzso exchange to zzso zzso the rate of approach to zzso zzso zzso equilibrium from either zzso or zzso and zzso the rate of zzso zzso zzso formation with the downstream zzso zzso We found that for zzso zzso zzso is much faster than subsequent zzso leading to a zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso Only zzso is then transferred to yield zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso generated, three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso were among a larger set partially zzso All these zzso were dramatically impaired in approach to zzso equilibrium from either zzso or zzso while another zzso zzso was zzso impaired only for zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso forms of zzso were only slightly active from zzso but zzso from zzso zzso zzso faster than zzso from zzso When the zzso of the zzso released product was analyzed the zzso ratio from zzso zzso and zzso was zzso From zzso and zzso it was comparably zzso and zzso but zzso and zzso yielded zzso of the zzso reflecting a gain of function to transfer zzso The zzso preference of zzso zzso for zzso transfer reflects the zzso controlled zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso for the zzso donor zzso It may be that other zzso C zzso immediately downstream of E zzso will likewise be zzso
