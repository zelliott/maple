The zzso zzso zzso play an essential role in regulating zzso pH and zzso zzso zzso Of the known members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins have been shown to be zzso The zzso nature of these zzso results from the unequal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso during each transport zzso This unique property zzso zzso and zzso proteins from other sodium zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso that are known to be zzso zzso studies have played an essential role in revealing the basis for the zzso of the zzso ratio of zzso zzso In addition, the recent zzso zzso analysis of zzso has shed light on the potential structural zzso that are responsible for zzso zzso through the zzso The zzso difficult problem of determining the nature of zzso species being transported by these proteins zzso versus zzso is analyzed using a theoretical equilibrium thermodynamics zzso Finally, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of zzso zzso and flux through zzso sodium zzso zzso is reviewed in zzso
