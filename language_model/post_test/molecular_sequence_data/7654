zzso is an zzso zzso disorder caused by a genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso So far 20 zzso in zzso zzso have been identified in human classical zzso including 14 single base changes causing zzso zzso in the coding sequence of the zzso 4 zzso associated with an absence of zzso 5, 6, 7, or 13 in zzso 1 zzso with a deletion of the first 7 bases in zzso 16 (which is caused by abnormal zzso and 1 zzso with an zzso of 37 bases between the zzso 15 and 16 regions in zzso In order to identify the zzso in the zzso gene causing the zzso 7 and 13 deletion zzso and the zzso zzso zzso between zzso 15 and 16 in zzso and to establish a DNA diagnostic test, we isolated and zzso the zzso DNA surrounding each zzso The absence of zzso 7 or 13 in zzso zzso resulted from abnormal zzso caused by a single base change in the zzso zzso zzso (a transition of A to G at the second zzso position within the 3' zzso zzso site of zzso 6) and zzso (a transition of G to A at the fifth zzso position within the zzso zzso zzso site of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted in the creation of an zzso restriction zzso DNA diagnostic analysis of 33 Japanese zzso with classical zzso showed that 19 zzso had the zzso zzso (over 50% of the zzso zzso in Japanese zzso It was thus confirmed that one zzso is zzso in zzso This differs from the situation in the USA where there is far greater zzso The zzso zzso in zzso on the other hand resulted from abnormal zzso caused by a zzso deletion at the zzso between zzso 15 and zzso zzso The deletion had a short direct repeat zzso at the zzso junction and presumably resulted from slipped zzso
