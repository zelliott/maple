When an acid zzso zzso which had been zzso from the eggs of zzso zzso zzso was incubated at pH zzso zzso activity appeared after a few minutes, lag period, indicating that the zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that after the incubation the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso disappeared and the active zzso zzso form of the zzso appeared, suggesting that the zzso form was processed to the active form under zzso conditions zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the active form was zzso The conversion of the zzso form to the active form was completely blocked by zzso which is a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso The results strongly suggest that the processing might be zzso The zzso form zzso zzso disappeared in the zzso eggs during embryonic development and zzso with its zzso the zzso form appeared, indicating that in zzso the zzso is activated in a similar manner to that observed in in zzso zzso
