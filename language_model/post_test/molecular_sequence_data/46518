The sequence of the zzso b zzso gene of zzso zzso has been zzso The structural gene is interrupted by two intervening sequences of approximately zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso shows extensive zzso with the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso are, however, located at sites different from those of zzso in the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso (which contain highly zzso zzso at the same site within the zzso The zzso share several short regions of sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso with each other and with other zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the second zzso contains a 50 zzso long sequence that is highly zzso with sequences within every zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso sequences may allow the formation of a core secondary structure, which is nearly identical in many zzso zzso The zzso secondary structure may be required for zzso zzso The second zzso contains an open reading frame, continuous with the preceding zzso of approximately 290 zzso Two stretches of 10 zzso acid zzso zzso in many zzso are present in the open reading zzso
