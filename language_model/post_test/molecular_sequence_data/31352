zzso V zzso is a zzso 82 zzso zzso zzso that is zzso during zzso zzso to yield 69 zzso zzso We have developed a rapid and simple method for isolation of the protein from zzso extracts using a combination of gel zzso zzso and zzso affinity zzso The partial zzso acid sequence was determined by analysis of peptides generated by zzso of the zzso protein with zzso zzso I or zzso zzso The sequence shows a remarkable zzso of zzso zzso which is zzso to the consensus sequence of a highly diversified protein zzso with a common repetitive zzso zzso zzso site was determined to be located at the zzso region of zzso by analysis of the products separated by zzso and zzso high performance liquid zzso By zzso zzso analysis, the existence of zzso zzso chains was zzso as well as the existence of zzso zzso chains shown by the zzso acid sequence zzso From these data, we report a structural model of zzso that is analogous to zzso zzso
