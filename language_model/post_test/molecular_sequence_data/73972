Members of the marigold zzso of flowering plants (the zzso zzso which zzso and accumulate zzso compounds in their roots, were investigated as potential sources of bacteria able to degrade zzso zzso zzso and continuous enrichment cultures zzso with zzso from root balls of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced the same zzso type of zzso when they were supplied with zzso zzso or zzso zzso as a carbon and energy zzso This zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which we zzso as a new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso grew on simple zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso on zzso of these compounds zzso and zzso and on the condensed zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso fixing carbon dioxide by means of zzso zzso zzso and was able to grow on hydrogen, zzso or zzso as an energy zzso It also grew on a wide range of other zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its growth on zzso was optimal at 28 to 31 degrees C and pH zzso to zzso and the maximum growth rate in batch culture was zzso zzso The DNA base composition of zzso is 68 zzso G + zzso A zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of strain zzso showed that this zzso represents a distinct lineage within the zzso cluster of the zzso zzso of the zzso Discrimination of zzso zzso from the other zzso in this group and from other zzso species is zzso
