Recently we tentatively identified, by sequence comparison, central zzso of the zzso proteins of zzso and the respective portion of the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the same proteins revealed conservation of short sequence stretches resembling those around the zzso zzso His and zzso zzso of zzso zzso A statistically significant similarity has been detected between the sequences of these zzso and those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso and the respective zzso protein contain at least two functional zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain is probably involved in the processing of viral zzso zzso
