zzso is a large zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that associates with the zzso family of cell zzso molecules in zzso zzso junctions zzso zzso zzso where it both activates zzso and couples them to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso between the head and rod zzso has previously been shown to be important in zzso zzso Here we identify an additional zzso site that removes the zzso domain from the zzso of the zzso rod, and show that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at this site in zzso and increases the steady state levels of zzso in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso turnover and the persistence of cell zzso just as effectively as a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso between the zzso head and rod zzso Moreover, incorporation of both zzso into a single zzso zzso had an additive effect clearly demonstrating that zzso zzso at both the zzso and zzso regions of zzso contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso However, the zzso site was more sensitive to zzso zzso suggesting that lower levels of zzso are required to liberate the zzso head and rod fragments than are needed to clip off the zzso zzso zzso The zzso head and rod liberated by zzso zzso have recently been shown to play roles in an zzso zzso cycle important in zzso turnover and in zzso cell cycle progression zzso The zzso of the zzso head is tightly regulated by zzso and we suggest that removal of the zzso zzso domain from the zzso rod may provide a mechanism both for terminating the zzso function of the zzso rod and indeed for zzso full-length zzso thereby promoting zzso turnover at the rear of the zzso
