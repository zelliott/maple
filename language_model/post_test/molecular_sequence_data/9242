zzso for durable disease resistance is challenging, yet essential to improve crops for sustainable zzso The wheat zzso gene is one of the few zzso durable resistance genes in zzso It encodes an zzso binding cassette zzso and has been a source of resistance against zzso zzso such as leaf rust zzso zzso for over zzso As zzso zzso zzso quantitative resistance, we wanted to determine the effects of transgenic zzso with specific reference to how expression levels affect zzso zzso zzso wheat lines were made in two different, susceptible genetic zzso We found that the introduction of the zzso resistance zzso was sufficient to provide comparable levels of leaf rust resistance as the zzso zzso zzso As with the zzso zzso we observed resistance in zzso after cold treatment and in flag leaves of adult plants, as well as zzso leaf tip zzso The zzso zzso resistance did not involve a hypersensitive response, altered zzso deposition or zzso of zzso zzso Higher expression levels compared to zzso zzso were observed in the transgenic lines both at zzso as well as adult stage and some improvement of resistance was seen in the flag zzso Interestingly, in one genetic background the transgenic zzso resistance resulted in improved zzso resistance without cold zzso These data indicate that functional zzso in zzso resistance can be created using a transgenic zzso
