A global zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso the most likely zzso agent of zzso zzso in sea zzso was zzso using dated zzso through zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo analysis and used to estimate the virus evolutionary rate independent of the evolution of the host, and to resolve the zzso positions of new zzso from Puerto Rico and the Gulf of zzso Four zzso groups were zzso eastern Pacific, western zzso Caribbean, zzso Pacific and zzso The latter comprises the Gulf of zzso and Puerto Rico, suggesting recent virus gene flow between these two zzso One virus zzso from Florida remained zzso representing either an independent lineage sharing a common zzso with all other identified virus zzso or an Atlantic representative of the lineage giving rise to the eastern Pacific zzso The virus evolutionary rate ranged from zzso to zzso zzso per site per year, which is much faster than what is expected for a zzso The mean time for the most recent common zzso of the modern virus zzso was estimated at zzso years ago, which, although more recent than previous estimates, still supports an interpretation that the global zzso pandemic is not the result of a recent acquisition of a zzso zzso The zzso pattern obtained seems partially to reflect sea turtle movements, whereas altered environments appear to be implicated in current zzso outbreaks and in the modern evolutionary history of zzso
