zzso and zzso zzso components were isolated by zzso and zzso zzso from developing dental zzso zzso developing zzso contains zzso and zzso components analogous to those of zzso zzso acid composition and mass zzso analyses established that, in both species, the zzso sequences of the zzso components are two zzso longer than previously reported for bovine zzso and that both the zzso and zzso contained a single zzso zzso These zzso zzso were the principal components of the zzso protein lower molecular weight zzso The zzso sequence data for both species suggests that the mechanism of zzso zzso processing may differ significantly from that previously zzso
