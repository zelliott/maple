zzso regulatory light chain zzso is zzso at various sites at its zzso region, and zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso has been assigned as a zzso zzso that zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso toward the various zzso sites of zzso was zzso as well as the role of the zzso region of zzso in the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso 18, and zzso 9 efficiently with almost identical rates, whereas it failed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso seven zzso acid zzso of zzso markedly decreased the zzso rate of zzso 19 of zzso incorporated in the zzso zzso whereas this deletion did not significantly affect the zzso rate of isolated zzso On the other hand, deletion of only four zzso zzso acid zzso showed no effect on zzso of zzso 19 of incorporated zzso The zzso of zzso by deletion of the seven zzso zzso was also found with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso 2 and zzso 9 did not influence the zzso rate of zzso 19 and zzso 18 by zzso These results suggest that the zzso region of zzso plays an important role in zzso recognition of zzso
