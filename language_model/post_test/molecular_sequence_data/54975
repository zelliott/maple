zzso zzso is closely associated with a unique cell envelope rich in complex carbohydrates and unique zzso among which are the zzso zzso zzso also zzso unique zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso which are zzso with zzso fatty zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso fatty acids in zzso the possibility of a similar role in zzso and the regulation of zzso acids assembly have been zzso Unlike zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and other fast-growing zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso an essential role for zzso in this pathogen and turning the zzso zzso into attractive drug zzso The zzso of zzso tuberculosis was zzso 14 years ago but only recently has the identity of the genes involved in zzso zzso been zzso Two gene clusters zzso and zzso containing a few genes considered to be essential for zzso tuberculosis growth, have initially been proposed to coordinate zzso zzso Among these zzso only the product of zzso for the first step in the zzso zzso has, so far, been zzso and its three-dimensional structure been zzso However, recent results indicate that at least three additional clusters may be involved in this zzso The functional assignment of authentic roles to some of these zzso tuberculosis zzso genes sheds new light on the zzso of zzso zzso and renewed interest on their biological zzso
