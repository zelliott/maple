A zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a sea zzso collected from a tidal flat in the South China zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the new isolate was a member of the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso zzso characteristics and zzso data also indicated that strain zzso zzso was a member of the zzso zzso The strain grew well on most of the media tested, producing white to zzso zzso zzso and white aerial zzso and straight to zzso zzso The zzso zzso was well developed and fragmented with zzso the aerial zzso produced long, straight to zzso spore chains with zzso zzso zzso zzso The strain grew in the presence of zzso % zzso total zzso and at pH zzso and zzso degrees zzso optimum growth occurred in the presence of zzso % zzso total zzso and at pH zzso and 25 degrees zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso contained zzso acid and no diagnostic zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso zzso : zzso Polar lipids comprised zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso The combination of zzso analysis, zzso zzso data, zzso characteristics and zzso data supported the suggestion that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
