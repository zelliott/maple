Introduction of the zzso genes of zzso zzso 1 and zzso coli K-12 into zzso zzso carrier strains expressing the zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso resulted in the formation of longer chains of zzso zzso 1 O zzso In bacteria producing both zzso and zzso O zzso this resulted in a reduction of the masking of zzso O zzso by zzso zzso and an increased immune response induced by zzso zzso of mice by zzso zzso The zzso genes of zzso zzso 1 and zzso coli K-12 were zzso and their gene products were compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary sequence of zzso zzso zzso differs from both zzso coli K-12 and zzso zzso 1 zzso proteins only at positions 267 and zzso which suggests that this region may be responsible for the difference in biological zzso
