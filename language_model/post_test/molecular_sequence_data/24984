In this work, we characterized chemically the zzso specific zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso composed by three zzso with zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the secondary structure of ALL contains zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso and its zzso was determined from peptides obtained after zzso zzso by zzso zzso assisted laser zzso zzso of zzso The zzso peptides prepared from the zzso zzso and the three zzso showed different degrees zzso to zzso of identity with the zzso acid sequence belonging to a previously described high nutritional value protein from zzso zzso not shown at the time to be a zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso peptides obtained from ALL previously treated with zzso zzso revealed a zzso identity with the aforementioned zzso zzso of zzso linked zzso of the zzso type and, in minor proportion, of the zzso type zzso was determined by affinity zzso on immobilized Con zzso
