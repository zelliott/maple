zzso transport in the kidney plays an important role in urinary concentration and nitrogen zzso Recently, three types of zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso from rat and rabbit kidney and zzso from human bone zzso To zzso the zzso role of the latter zzso zzso we have isolated the rat zzso zzso of zzso and studied its distribution of expression and functional zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which has zzso identity to the human zzso and zzso identity to rat zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso induced a large zzso zzso increase in the zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso The zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (55 and zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis gave a single band of zzso zzso in kidney inner and outer zzso zzso brain, bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso of rat kidney revealed that zzso zzso is expressed in the inner stripe of the outer zzso inner zzso the zzso surface zzso and the transitional urinary zzso of urinary zzso zzso experiments using zzso against von zzso factor showed that zzso zzso in the inner stripe of the outer zzso is expressed in descending zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso in kidney is involved in counter current exchange between ascending and descending zzso zzso to enhance the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso revealed that zzso is located in zzso cells of zzso zzso The signal was only detected in zzso cells associated with the early stages of zzso development, suggesting that zzso may play a role in zzso
