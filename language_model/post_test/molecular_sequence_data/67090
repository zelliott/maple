zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that possesses a protein zzso system similar to those found in zzso and zzso Recent work has indicated that the protein zzso by the zzso gene of zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar in sequence to zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso and is therefore likely to be a zzso protein in the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso has been solved at a resolution of zzso A revealing the detailed zzso fold of the zzso The overall structure is appreciably extended and consists of a bundle of zzso zzso segments with two small zzso zzso The longest zzso of the zzso form a zzso bundle and most of the remaining secondary structure elements (three zzso and two zzso zzso are formed by the region linking the last two zzso of the zzso zzso The structure suggests that the biologically active form of the zzso may be a zzso formed by contacts involving the zzso zzso which is the most strongly zzso part of the zzso zzso of the structure of zzso with zzso and other data for zzso indicates that the zzso zzso is also involved in contacts with other proteins that form the zzso
