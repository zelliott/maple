zzso zzso communities in water supplies may include hosts for zzso zzso and other zzso bacteria, as well as zzso This study aimed at identifying zzso zzso in two zzso groundwater supplies, using zzso molecular zzso For this purpose, samples zzso degrees zzso of treated water, distributed water, and distribution system zzso were collected from supply A, with a low concentration of natural organic matter zzso zzso zzso of zzso and from supply B, with a high zzso concentration zzso zzso of zzso zzso communities were studied using terminal restriction zzso length zzso and clone library analyses of partial zzso zzso gene fragments and a zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso In both supplies, highly diverse zzso communities were observed, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso clustered with zzso (10 operational zzso units zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (29 zzso zzso (13 zzso zzso (5 zzso and zzso (5 zzso A large variety of zzso were present in both supplies, but the estimated values for zzso richness did not differ zzso zzso zzso was observed in both supplies but was not a zzso zzso One zzso with the highest similarity to zzso zzso an opportunistic human pathogen and a host for zzso bacteria, was observed in supply zzso The high level of zzso in supply B corresponded with an elevated level of active biomass and with elevated zzso of zzso zzso in distributed zzso zzso the application of zzso may be promising in zzso the relationship between drinking water quality and the presence of specific zzso
