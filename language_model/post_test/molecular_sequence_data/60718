The egg zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso was zzso from blood plasma of zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso on zzso A rabbit zzso was raised against their blood plasma and then zzso with plasma from zzso zzso males to render the zzso specific to zzso The zzso zzso was used to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso in Western and dot zzso experiments and in an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso as a approximately 156 zzso protein in plasma from zzso females and zzso males but not zzso zzso Its identity was confirmed by analysis of: zzso zzso acid zzso zzso an internal zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso recognition by zzso zzso prepared against the zzso from common carp zzso zzso and brown zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso was confirmed by Western zzso of serially diluted plasma from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso for detecting exposure of male zzso zzso to zzso compounds was verified using a dot zzso zzso of zzso and detected by zzso Adult male fish were exposed to various zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in their rearing water and plasma zzso for the presence of zzso at different time points zzso 7, 14 and 21 zzso A competitive, zzso quantitative zzso was then developed based on the zzso zzso and its respective zzso The zzso was validated by demonstrating parallel binding slopes of dilution zzso prepared with plasma from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso egg extracts as compared with zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso as low as 3 zzso zzso were detected in the zzso for which zzso and zzso zzso of variation were both less than zzso Furthermore, plasma from control males was zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be useful for the detection of zzso properties associated with certain compounds and could be easily incorporated into standard laboratory toxicity zzso using this zzso
