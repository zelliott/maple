An zzso determined zzso change of zzso units has been reported for the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso relative to the native zzso zzso zzso zzso calculations were performed to probe the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and B10 His zzso zzso zzso on zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The method produced shifts of zzso and zzso units for the zzso shift of the two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso which is in good agreement with the experimental value zzso zzso The calculations also suggest that the reason neither zzso insulin can zzso into zzso is the zzso crowding of zzso charged groups in the central zzso channel on zzso zzso In the zzso insulin, binding of zinc zzso by B10 His overcomes this problem, whereas in the B10 zzso this possibility is ruled out by the absence of the zinc binding zzso A series of zzso are predicted to stabilize the medically relevant, zzso form of zzso
