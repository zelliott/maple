zzso studies of zzso zzso are complicated by the zzso zzso inherent to individual zzso zzso zzso we report the cloning of a novel zzso of avian zzso and the subsequent zzso zzso and characterization of a soluble form of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso insect zzso The novel zzso of zzso differs from the previously reported chicken zzso by eight zzso acid zzso but these changes do not alter the secondary structure content, the zzso bond pattern, or the sites of zzso The zzso linkage pattern and zzso distribution on each zzso site of zzso chicken zzso from both cell lines were determined by a combination of zzso sequencing and mass zzso The mass spectral data showed that the zzso zzso was modified to zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells contained zzso on zzso 60, whereas the zzso on zzso 23 and 100 contained approximately zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso The zzso on zzso expressed in zzso cells were more heterogeneous, with the zzso ranging over zzso on each zzso The ability to generate zzso zzso with restricted zzso zzso is the first step toward the systematic study of zzso relationships in intact zzso
