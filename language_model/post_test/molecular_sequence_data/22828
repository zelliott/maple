zzso zzso bacteria have been isolated from zzso plants such as zzso rice, and zzso They are thought to promote plant growth, not only by fixing zzso but also by the production of plant zzso The molecular mechanisms involved in this interaction are not yet zzso In this work, the identification of a zzso zzso zzso named zzso which may participate in signal zzso involved in the establishment of zzso bacteria interaction is described for the first zzso zzso seems to be part of a novel zzso of zzso present in a wide range of plant zzso The expression of this gene is zzso in zzso plants associated exclusively with beneficial zzso bacteria and is not a general response caused by zzso or zzso zzso In addition, more successful zzso bacteria associations have a more pronounced decrease in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso levels in plant cells are zzso related to the efficiency of the zzso
