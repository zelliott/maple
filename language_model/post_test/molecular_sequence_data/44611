To evaluate whether only 20 zzso zzso at zzso positions are needed to bind and coordinate the metals in zzso zzso and whether changing the positions of zzso zzso in the sequence affects the zzso capacity and the coordination of zzso we examined the zzso affinities of seven zzso zzso alpha s using an zzso coli expression zzso Five zzso zzso alpha s in which the zzso zzso acid zzso other than zzso of the zzso were replaced with zzso zzso and the remaining two zzso zzso alpha s in which the zzso positions of the zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso were zzso for their ability to be expressed as zzso forms and for their zzso zzso The results showed that extreme zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso other than zzso in the zzso zzso leads to disruption of their zzso abilities and of their zzso However, zzso zzso alpha s containing changes of the zzso positions of the zzso zzso were expressed in a zzso form in zzso coli, although the zzso positions of 20 zzso zzso in the zzso are thought to be important for their zzso zzso These results suggest that the position of zzso zzso and the chemical nature of the other zzso acids in the zzso acid sequence of zzso are less critical than zzso
