zzso zzso zzso is a component of four zzso zzso zzso zzso interference or the deletion of both zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in an absolute requirement for zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso showed a severely altered zzso and cell cycle zzso Most probably, in zzso cells with their only zzso zzso zzso is required as component of the zzso zzso complex which generates zzso for zzso and thus DNA zzso The essential role of zzso in zzso zzso was confirmed by an in zzso zzso zzso cells were unable to zzso zzso Our data further revealed that degradation of zzso zzso acids takes place but is zzso In cultured zzso not zzso zzso the total cellular concentration of zzso increases with increasing cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion caused an even stronger proliferation zzso that was not reversed by zzso suggesting that in the fully elaborated zzso of these cells the primary effect is not on the zzso zzso zzso Since the medium used for the zzso of zzso cells was not supplemented with zzso impairment of the zzso zzso complex is probably the main effect of zzso zzso
