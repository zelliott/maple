zzso zzso zzso isolated from slag of a zzso zzso zzso site, showed the highest zzso zzso zzso identity of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identities with other identified zzso zzso A zzso gene zzso was cloned and encodes a zzso zzso zzso showing the highest zzso acid sequence identities of zzso with the putative zzso zzso zzso family 26 zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the identified zzso 26 zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed the typical characteristics of zzso zzso showing apparent optimal at zzso zzso of the maximum activity at zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso The potential mechanism for zzso of zzso 26 zzso might be ascribed to the more zzso zzso zzso and less polar zzso zzso compared with typical zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity at the concentration of zzso zzso No loss of zzso activity was observed after zzso the zzso with zzso or zzso zzso or zzso or zzso K at zzso and pH zzso for zzso The zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, using locust bean gum as the zzso
