The expression of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso is insensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso By selecting zzso cells zzso for zzso in the presence of zzso serum, zzso which had escaped from zzso by the serum because of repression of their zzso expression by zzso were zzso Their zzso sequences were examined in the region containing the promoter, the position of which was confirmed by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso initiation zzso The two independently isolated zzso had the same zzso zzso zzso at a site overlapping with the promoter zzso creating a putative operator sequence zzso to zzso zzso but not to zzso Other candidates for operator zzso had reduced zzso synthesis because of zzso between the zzso and zzso initiation sites or in the structural zzso The sequence analysis also revealed a repetitive zzso zzso zzso consensus sequence and a zzso zzso of zzso in a small, functionally unknown open reading frame zzso
