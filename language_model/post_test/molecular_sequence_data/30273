The mechanisms of zzso responsible for random integration of zzso DNA into the zzso of normal human cells have been investigated by analysis of zzso DNA zzso Cell clones containing integrated zzso sequences were selected by zzso transformation of primary human zzso after zzso with a zzso containing zzso virus 40 zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso DNA junctions was performed on cloned DNA fragments containing the integration sites from two of these cell zzso zzso chain reaction was then performed with human cell DNA from primary zzso to isolate the cell DNA from the same sites before zzso zzso zzso of the sequences at the zzso DNA junctions with those of both the original zzso and the cell DNA demonstrated short sequence similarities and additional zzso typical of zzso zzso Evidence of short deletions in the cell DNA at the zzso integration sites suggests that integration occurred by a mechanism similar to that used for repair of spontaneous or gamma zzso strand zzso zzso integration occurred within zzso cell DNA with no major zzso although zzso of the cell DNA at the integration site occurred in one of the clones after zzso
