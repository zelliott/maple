zzso zzso C virus zzso infection has been clearly established as a major risk factor in the development of zzso zzso In the present study we have attempted to identify the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso in patients from the USA and zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso from 11 zzso zzso Japanese patients, and plasma from 4 American patients were zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso methods employing zzso specific for the zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso products were cloned and compared by zzso sequencing and zzso zzso The zzso region could be successfully amplified and zzso from all samples, and zzso analysis of the zzso sequences demonstrated with the exception of two of Japanese viruses were closely related to zzso type zzso Type 2 was detected in these two zzso In addition, two of the Japanese patients who were found to have zzso were also found to be infected with type zzso zzso amplification of the zzso was successful in 7 of the Japanese and 1 USA sample and clearly demonstrated that zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso regions proved to be extremely difficult and was unsuccessful in all zzso patients despite the fact that these regions could be consistently amplified in samples from patients with both acute and chronic zzso zzso These findings might suggest that with long term persistent zzso infection, there may be marked zzso in both the structural and zzso regions of the virus, and/or possibly that the viral zzso may be zzso
