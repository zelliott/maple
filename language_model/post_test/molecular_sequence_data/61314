The structure of zzso A zzso which functions as a zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso control of the zzso zzso in zzso coli, has been determined at zzso A zzso In zzso zzso at zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso serve as accessory zzso ensuring that zzso is exclusively zzso In contrast, zzso zzso from other species have no known zzso activity and are not implicated in zzso regulation or control of zzso zzso zzso comprises two zzso which have similar folds to the two zzso of bovine lens zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso domain of zzso which probably plays a significant role in DNA zzso is rotated by 19 degrees compared with its position in zzso zzso is a zzso of 32 zzso A groove that runs from one zzso face across the zzso molecular axis to the other zzso face is proposed to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso supports a structure of the zzso complex in which zzso zzso and a second zzso zzso are sandwiched along their zzso molecular zzso and the accessory sequences of the two zzso sites wrap around the accessory proteins as a right-handed zzso such that three negative zzso are zzso
