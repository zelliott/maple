Previously, we demonstrated that a representative M zzso type strain of infectious zzso necrosis virus zzso from rainbow trout grows well in rainbow zzso zzso cells, but a U zzso type strain from zzso salmon has restricted growth, associated with reduced zzso replication and zzso zzso Here, we zzso further the mechanisms for this growth restriction of zzso zzso in zzso cells, using strategies that assessed differences in viral zzso host immune regulation and zzso To determine whether the viral zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein was responsible for the growth zzso four zzso zzso viruses were generated in which the G gene of an infectious zzso clone was replaced by the G gene of zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso gene was replaced by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the growth of these zzso in zzso cells, indicating that G and zzso proteins are not major factors responsible for the differential growth of the zzso and zzso zzso Poly zzso zzso of zzso cells suppressed the growth of both zzso and zzso zzso although the M virus continued to replicate at a reduced zzso Both viruses induced type 1 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso but the expression levels in zzso cells were significantly higher than in zzso cells and an inhibitor of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the growth of zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data did not indicate a role for the zzso system in the restricted growth of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites in the viral zzso zzso using the zzso program revealed differences between zzso and zzso P genes at five zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso inhibitor or a zzso inhibitor did not affect the growth of the zzso and zzso zzso However, 100 zzso of the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso of the U type zzso at 24 h zzso In contrast, 100 zzso of the zzso inhibitor reduced the zzso of the M type only zzso at 48 h zzso Our data suggest that the different growth of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells may be linked to a differential requirement for cellular protein zzso such as zzso for their zzso
