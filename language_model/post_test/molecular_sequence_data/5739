The dynamics of changes in the zzso and zzso zzso composition of dental pulp varies considerably during tooth development and zzso In this paper, we studied zzso zzso where we hypothesized that they played important roles in zzso zzso and transport aspects of zzso development and zzso The zzso tissue was collected from partially erupted bovine zzso zzso and then extracted with 6 M zzso The extract was subjected to zzso column zzso zzso and the zzso collected were screened by zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso generated against zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was the major zzso species and occurred as a zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso After further zzso it was subjected to zzso composite gel zzso and it migrated as a single band stained with zzso The band was zzso against zzso zzso by Western zzso zzso The partial zzso acid sequence analyses of the core protein clearly indicated this zzso to be zzso The presence of link protein was also confirmed by Western zzso analysis with an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso study indicated that the zzso of zzso and link protein coincide in the dental pulp and are enriched in the peripheral area of the tissue just beneath the zzso zzso Since the dental pulp contains zzso zzso may bind to zzso via its zzso domain, where this association is stabilized by link zzso This complex, then, could form large hydrated zzso zzso that fill the zzso space, support zzso and/or facilitate the transport function of zzso and nutrients within the zzso
