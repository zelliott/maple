Group A zzso zzso are the leading cause of severe zzso in infants and young children zzso Due to their zzso complexity, it is important to compare the genetic characteristics of vaccine strains with the zzso strains circulating before the introduction of the vaccine in the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso the main targets for zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso of 11 zzso 12 zzso 4 zzso 2 zzso 1 zzso and 1 zzso zzso strains circulating in zzso from 2006 to 2011 with the zzso strains present in licensed vaccines showed that multiple zzso acid differences existed in or near putative zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso strains were found to possess a potential extra zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were closely related to the zzso vaccine strain in zzso belonging to the same zzso but the alignment of their zzso zzso acids revealed an zzso of an zzso zzso at position 76 which is close to a zzso site zzso zzso Despite several differences detected between zzso and vaccine zzso which may affect binding of zzso zzso both vaccines are known to protect against the vast majority of the circulating zzso providing an indication of the high vaccine efficiency that can be expected in a future zzso zzso zzso
