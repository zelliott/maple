zzso zzso is a candidate precursor of the plant growth hormone zzso acid zzso We demonstrated that zzso has zzso effects on zzso zzso and that zzso zzso is converted to zzso in zzso We isolated zzso with reduced sensitivity to zzso that remained sensitive to zzso These zzso were zzso and fell into a single zzso group that mapped to zzso 3, within zzso zzso of a cluster of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each of the three zzso contained a single base change in the coding region of the zzso zzso and the expression pattern of zzso is consistent with the zzso zzso observed in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and levels of zzso and zzso were unchanged in the zzso zzso confirming that zzso has other functional zzso zzso zzso in transgenic zzso caused increased sensitivity to zzso and faster turnover of zzso zzso in zzso
