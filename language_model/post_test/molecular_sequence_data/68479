zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein containing the zzso domain of zzso zzso and an internal zzso zzso located immediately after the zzso zzso domain of zzso were investigated for their zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso for native zzso zzso zzso 5-8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are virtually zzso In addition, zzso and zzso do not show high affinity toward zzso zzso and the zzso fragment, whereas zzso zzso and zzso show comparably high affinity toward these zzso These observations indicate that the zzso binding domain of zzso is confined in the internal zzso zzso
