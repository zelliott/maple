A number of studies have shown that a short zzso the protein zzso domain zzso derived from the zzso zzso protein zzso improved cellular zzso in zzso and distribution in zzso of zzso proteins bearing such zzso when administered zzso To investigate the effects of zzso addition on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with a view towards designing improved therapeutic strategies for zzso disease zzso cell zzso mouse zzso was zzso zzso with the zzso Compared with unmodified zzso zzso bearing a zzso a zzso zzso and 6 consecutive His zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and 6 consecutive His zzso was found to be zzso more zzso Also, zzso was found to be taken up by cells both via zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso displayed increased zzso zzso in zzso derived from zzso mice (a zzso model of zzso cell zzso and in zzso derived from the mouse brain zzso compared with zzso lacking a zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso protein zzso in part with the zzso membrane zzso Complete correction of zzso zzso was achieved in zzso mouse zzso lacking zzso activity following addition of zzso zzso zzso not only maintained the features of the native zzso protein including zzso function, zzso transport and location, but also displayed more efficient cellular zzso
