zzso zzso harbors a zzso locus for psoriasis ( zzso This locus may overlap with zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso To further refine the location of zzso we zzso 242 primarily nuclear families for 15 zzso zzso mapping to zzso zzso zzso linkage analysis revealed a linkage peak lying close to a novel cluster of genes from the zzso zzso zzso This cluster spans zzso zzso and harbors five zzso genes and a sixth zzso zzso ( zzso with three zzso motifs that is transcribed in the opposite direction from the zzso The zzso zzso zzso by these genes are most similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso expressed selectively in zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are only expressed in zzso of cells of the zzso zzso In order to investigate the association of this region with zzso we zzso the families for 13 novel zzso and 19 zzso from the region of zzso A maximum zzso of zzso ( zzso was obtained within the zzso Two zzso zzso revealed some evidence for association with zzso One spanned zzso and includes a zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso The second was a zzso zzso lying within the first zzso of zzso ( zzso zzso zzso The novel markers described here will facilitate additional linkage and association studies between the zzso family and zzso
