The zzso genes are required for protein zzso by zzso zzso They are involved in the second step of the process, zzso the zzso across the outer zzso after the zzso have reached the zzso in a signal zzso dependent zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing zzso genes showed at least two complete open reading zzso potentially zzso proteins with molecular weights of 41 and 19 zzso Products with these apparent molecular weights were identified after expression of the DNA zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that both proteins are required for zzso The two products are located in the inner membrane and share highly significant zzso with the zzso and zzso proteins which are required for the specific zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These zzso reveal the existence of a common mechanism for protein zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
