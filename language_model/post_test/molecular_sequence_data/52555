The zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are closely related to each other but exhibit functional zzso To test the hypothesis that specific functions of zzso and zzso are zzso by specific interaction partners, we used the zzso zzso system to identify zzso or zzso zzso We report the identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso designated zzso that interacts with zzso but not zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso also interacts with zzso in zzso and is zzso from cell extracts with zzso zzso and an enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein zzso zzso zzso zzso when they are zzso zzso activity is detected in zzso zzso performed with extracts from zzso cells indicating that zzso and zzso interact under zzso zzso The zzso zzso is broadly expressed and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso is localized within the nucleus and at the plasma zzso The plasma membrane zzso is dependent on the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso is a zzso regulator of one zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a potential role in targeting zzso to a particular cellular zzso
