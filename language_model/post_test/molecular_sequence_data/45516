zzso studies of a protein from domain fragments can furnish important insights into the distinctive role of particular domain interactions and how they affect zzso properties important for zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and a number of zzso and zzso tools, including CD, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso we have investigated the zzso of the ubiquitous zzso protein zzso zzso and its zzso zzso from fragments zzso one or two zzso The studies were carried out with and without the target zzso from smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso The zzso complex can be zzso from the three components consisting of the target zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the absence of zzso there is no evidence for association of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso can further be zzso from their corresponding native zzso The zzso constant, zzso in 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso complexes, zzso and zzso was determined with zzso to zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso Thus, the affinity between the two zzso zzso located within zzso is stronger by a factor of 16 than that between the corresponding zzso within zzso These observations are zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso
