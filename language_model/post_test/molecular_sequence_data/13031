The interactions between the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso B and zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso have been investigated for the zzso protein and the zzso zzso and zzso so that the roles of these zzso in the zzso relationship could be zzso Neither zzso prevented zzso by either zzso B or by zzso zzso However, zzso of protein zzso show that both zzso are in structural zzso the zzso of which are zzso by the binding of zzso B or zzso Moreover, both zzso cause a substantial decrease in the affinity of the zzso site of the zzso protein for zzso B, zzso and zzso respectively, but have little effect upon the affinity of this site for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both these zzso change the equilibrium between the putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso so that the zzso form is more zzso They also stabilize a different zzso state, zzso in which the initial interactions between the protein and antibiotics are zzso Overall, this has the effect of zzso for the reduction in affinity for zzso B, so that the respective overall zzso values are zzso and zzso that of the wild type, while causing a slight increase, zzso and zzso respectively, in affinity of the zzso for zzso The zzso zzso causes a zzso reduction in the affinity of the zzso site for zzso suggesting that this zzso forms part of the sugar binding zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso has no effect upon the affinity of the zzso site for zzso These effects may be related to the reduction in zzso zzso activity only in the zzso zzso although it still effects active transport to the same extent as the zzso zzso However, there is a zzso increase in the zzso values for energized transport of zzso for both zzso
