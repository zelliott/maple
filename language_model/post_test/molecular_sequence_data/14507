zzso display is a powerful technique for the discovery of zzso zzso that bind to various zzso however, ambiguous results often zzso zzso zzso has been isolated repeatedly in our laboratory and by other research groups dealing with different protein and zzso targets, which led to a hypothesis that it may be a zzso zzso interacting with polystyrene plastic zzso We compared binding properties and amplification rate of zzso clone displaying the zzso zzso a previously confirmed plastic binding clone zzso and a control zzso clone zzso An zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso clone zzso binds to zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso on the other hand excluded the possibility of binding to bovine serum zzso a common blocking agent in zzso display zzso zzso rates of the zzso zzso clones were not statistically zzso We therefore conclude that zzso clone zzso was isolated in different selection procedures as a result of its affinity to zzso
