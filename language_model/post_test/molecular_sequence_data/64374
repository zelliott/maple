A survey of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of randomly selected rice DNA sequences from public databases was carried out to clarify the role of zzso elements zzso in the zzso of zzso in the rice zzso The estimated frequency of zzso in this sample was one per zzso zzso and this frequency is approximately equivalent to that of Class I zzso in the rice zzso Of the zzso in the zzso sequence sample, zzso were found to be present in multiple copies in the rice zzso and all of these were a part of TE zzso In this study at least 61 TE groups were identified as zzso zzso It was also shown that the zzso zzso zzso which was previously reported to be one of the zzso zzso in the rice zzso is a component of an zzso zzso These results indicate that the majority of zzso in the rice zzso are maintained in zzso and amplified and dispersed as components of the zzso The zzso content of the zzso zzso sequences reflected that of the TE sequences containing those zzso but no obvious bias towards the high zzso content of DNA was zzso Single locus zzso also did not show any obvious bias towards the high zzso content of DNA in the rice zzso In this respect, the zzso in the rice zzso are quite different from those in the human zzso in the latter, the majority of zzso show an obvious bias towards the high zzso content of zzso
