zzso zzso and zzso constitute an important part of gene regulatory networks, influencing diverse biological zzso zzso closely related zzso and zzso can be an essential first step towards the discovery of their zzso effects on different cellular zzso Here, we propose a zzso learning method to identify synergistic zzso involving regulation of their zzso target genes zzso from multiple information sources, zzso zzso predicted target genes of zzso and their respective expression zzso 

We used data sets consisting of zzso gene binding information and expression profiles of zzso and zzso on human cancer zzso Our method allowed us to detect functionally correlated zzso zzso involved in specific biological processes from multiple data sources by using a balanced fitness function and efficient searching over multiple zzso The proposed zzso found two zzso zzso highly correlated with respect to their expression and biological zzso Moreover, the zzso included in the same module showed much higher correlations when the related zzso were highly zzso demonstrating our zzso ability for finding coherent zzso zzso Most members of these zzso have been reported to be closely related with zzso zzso our method can provide a primary source of zzso and target sets presumed to constitute closely related parts of gene regulatory zzso
