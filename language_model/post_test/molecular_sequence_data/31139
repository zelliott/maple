A zzso zzso zzso was generated against a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids 148 to zzso of the zzso protein with zinc finger zzso The zzso designated zzso zzso which was positive with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso with an in zzso translated zzso product as well as with native proteins in cell extracts made from mouse zzso and zzso human leukemia cell line, both of which were previously shown to express high levels of zzso zzso When zzso cells were zzso into nuclear and zzso zzso the protein zzso with zzso zzso was zzso only in the nuclear zzso By the zzso complex zzso method, this zzso strongly stained over zzso of the zzso of human and mouse zzso cells, except mature zzso and of human zzso tumor zzso In other human adult zzso up to zzso of positive cells were zzso These zzso activities were clearly absorbed by zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso These results thus indicated that zzso zzso recognizes a nuclear protein which is expressed at high levels in male germ zzso
