Based on the inherent zzso activity, zzso liver contains two different zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso which typically exhibits the zzso activity and zzso II zzso zzso which is devoid of such zzso The molecular properties of the zzso that may account for their zzso differences are as yet zzso In this study, we have characterized and compared the chemical and zzso properties of zzso I and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the first zzso zzso acids revealed the striking zzso between zzso I and zzso zzso zzso of zzso I and zzso II generated the zzso maps that display similarities in zzso pattern, indicating their close relationship in zzso zzso zzso were generated in rabbits against the zzso zzso I and zzso II for comparison of the zzso zzso Both Western zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso studies showed that the zzso II zzso reacted with both zzso I and zzso II, whereas the zzso I zzso reacted only with zzso I, indicating the presence of common as well as unique zzso zzso on zzso I and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso I and zzso II are closely related with regard to structure and that their zzso zzso are possibly responsible for the differences in zzso zzso
