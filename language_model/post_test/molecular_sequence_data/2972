zzso proteins with altered properties can be useful zzso for investigating structure, zzso binding sites, mechanisms of action, and zzso attributes of the corresponding zzso proteins of zzso In this report, we illuminate properties of zzso of the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso selected by construction of a zzso library by zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso screening using zzso zzso display zzso After three rounds of zzso two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso After the zzso of biological activities of the zzso displayed on zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we subsequently subjected the zzso to analyses by native PAGE and zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso not only was active against zzso but also existed exclusively as a zzso in zzso This was in marked contrast to the zzso zzso which exists in solution predominantly as the zzso The zzso zzso provides a novel model for further investigations of the folding mechanism as well as zzso requirements for zzso zzso zzso
