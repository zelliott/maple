zzso zzso channels are critical elements in providing functional diversity in nervous zzso The diversity of zzso zzso channels in modern zzso zzso (such as zzso zzso and zzso is provided primarily by four gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but there has been no data from the ancient zzso zzso until zzso zzso represented by zzso and other zzso arose during the first major zzso radiation and are the most structurally primitive animals to have true nervous zzso By comparing the zzso channels of zzso and zzso we may determine the fundamental set of zzso channels present in the first nervous zzso We now report the isolation of two Shaker zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso express transient outward currents in zzso zzso most similar to Shaker currents from zzso in their rates of zzso and recovery from zzso The finding of multiple Shaker zzso genes is significant in that multiple Shaker genes also exist in zzso In zzso multiple Shaker channels are also produced, but by a mechanism of alternative zzso Thus, the Shaker zzso channel zzso had an established functional identity prior to the first major radiation of zzso and multiple forms of Shaker channels have been independently selected for in a wide range of zzso
