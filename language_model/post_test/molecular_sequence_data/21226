To characterize proteins that interact with base zzso interruption repair DNA zzso in cell free extracts of zzso zzso we used a combination of zzso labeling with the protein identification by zzso zzso zzso zzso analogue of zzso namely zzso and zzso DNA duplex containing one zzso gap were used to generate zzso DNA with a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso This zzso DNA zzso was incubated with the zzso cell extract and after zzso zzso a number of proteins were zzso Two of the zzso proteins were identified as the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso and zzso checkpoint zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso DNA repair intermediate indicates that the DNA zzso is involved in the DNA repair synthesis in zzso at least at DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso to DNA nicks took place independently of the other components of checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the protein alone is able to recognize DNA zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso protein was efficiently zzso to zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with DNA nicks may provide a link between the DNA damage checkpoint and DNA base zzso breaks repair pathways in zzso In addition, we found that absence of zzso protein greatly influences the overall pattern of other proteins zzso to DNA zzso We suggested that this last effect of zzso is at least partially due to its capacity to prevent zzso degradation of the zzso zzso
