zzso induced against intact zzso disease zzso zzso particles bind to the zzso analogue of zzso zzso of the viral coat protein zzso of zzso zzso A, equally well as to the parent zzso A zzso investigation of this zzso zzso was carried out by zzso zzso and restrained molecular modeling in order to identify the structural basis for the zzso mimicry between these zzso and parent zzso In zzso zzso a zzso left-handed zzso region exists from zzso 150 to zzso zzso which is consistently present in all zzso families obtained from restrained zzso A zzso left-handed zzso region is present in the tract zzso which is also consistent for all zzso zzso flexibility exists about zzso which leads to two types of structures, either bent or zzso In the bent structures, a zzso inverse tight turn is found, which can be classified as an inverse zzso centered at zzso The overall structural features of the zzso zzso are shown to be similar to those of the parent zzso The two zzso however, are roughly mirror images because they share inherently zzso secondary structure zzso By comparing these zzso conclusions with the zzso structure of the zzso complex of a corresponding zzso zzso fragment, a rationale is proposed to account for the zzso requirements of specific recognition that are implied by the equivalent zzso activity of the natural and zzso zzso
