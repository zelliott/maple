zzso of zzso human zzso type 5 zzso specifically associated with zzso zzso were recognized on the basis of the genetic zzso of the E6 open reading frame zzso To further evaluate the genetic zzso of zzso we zzso the long control region zzso the zzso ORF, and the terminal parts of the zzso zzso of five previously characterized zzso zzso and compared the data with the published zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed 140 zzso variable zzso of zzso zzso zzso substitution rates varied from zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso in the E6 zzso By sequencing the variable region encompassing the zzso 3' part and the E6 zzso of zzso from six additional zzso zzso patients, we identified three new zzso and three already known zzso indicating the stability of zzso zzso This stability was further demonstrated by the identity of zzso obtained years later from benign and zzso zzso of three zzso zzso analysis of the 10 zzso zzso distributed them into three groups, tentatively defining zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso grouping shows no geographical zzso a fact that may be related to the host restriction that characterizes zzso zzso No differences in the zzso potential of the zzso or in the zzso properties of the zzso protein zzso in zzso were observed among zzso zzso Whether zzso zzso possess distinct biological properties in zzso remains to be zzso
