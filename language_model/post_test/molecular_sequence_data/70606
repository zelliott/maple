zzso zzso zzso were transformed with the coding sequence of the zzso zzso protein of the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso A single zzso of live transformed zzso zzso an zzso response directed against the zzso repeat zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso these animals failed to show a positive serum conversion against zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso were detected only after a second zzso with a higher number of transformed zzso This boost induced an increased zzso response against the zzso zzso zzso protein associated with zzso class zzso thus demonstrating the establishment of zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso protein is efficiently recognized by the monkey immune system and represents an zzso zzso in transformed zzso
