In zzso selection experiments have produced zzso acid zzso zzso that bind tightly and specifically to a great variety of target zzso The utility of zzso is often limited by their vulnerability to zzso present in biological zzso One way to circumvent this problem is to select an zzso that binds the zzso of the target, then zzso the zzso of the zzso as a zzso zzso of the normal zzso We have so identified a zzso zzso DNA that binds the zzso hormone zzso and have demonstrated its stability to zzso and its zzso as a zzso zzso in cell zzso
