The form of the zzso zzso of the biologically and medically important zzso zzso zzso zzso and the closely related zzso remain obscure despite significant progress zzso the zzso zzso Considering possible zzso schemes using a graph approach and applying known constraints of zzso order and zzso a previously zzso system with a highly efficient tree structure emerged with two features: zzso All commonly occurring HS zzso could be zzso through a common route, the major zzso zzso The least common zzso also occurred on a separate common branch, termed here the minor zzso This suggested that the relative abundance of these two sets of structures were the result of the specificity of a single zzso zzso zzso acting at an early point in the zzso to convert zzso to zzso in preference to converting zzso to zzso A third key finding was that the common zzso for zzso all lie on the same zzso zzso The proposed scheme is consistent with a wide body of experiments zzso both zzso data and results from HS zzso zzso knockout experiments in the zzso The major branch also contains a zzso providing a choice of two distinct backbone zzso with the same zzso Further development of this novel zzso zzso in which frame shifts in the site of action of the zzso were permitted to occur, while maintaining their order of action, suggested a mechanism by which zzso could be generated, or further modification zzso The relationship between the proposed zzso and the geometric and charge possibilities it allows were also zzso
