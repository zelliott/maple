zzso are essential for cell growth and zzso compounds interfering with their metabolism are potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso The zzso zzso an zzso zzso to zzso the zzso of the secondary zzso groups of zzso and zzso 

The first crystal structure of a zzso zzso has been determined to a resolution of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso contains two zzso which define a remarkable 30 zzso long zzso zzso tunnel at their zzso The structure of zzso in complex with the inhibitor zzso reveals the zzso forming the zzso machinery and unusual zzso zzso H zzso A ring of zzso and zzso zzso surrounding one of the two tunnel openings contributes to the steering of the zzso towards the inside of the zzso 

zzso specifically zzso zzso that have both primary and secondary zzso zzso The complex with zzso shows that the primary zzso groups are essential for the proper alignment of the zzso with respect to the zzso Conservation of an zzso sequence motif indicates that zzso is member of a novel family of zzso Among these, zzso zzso displays significant sequence zzso with zzso suggesting a similar overall folding zzso
