zzso zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso is the most severe form of zzso in which the synthesis of all zzso and adrenal cortical steroids is markedly zzso We report here the clinical, zzso and molecular analyses of two unrelated Japanese zzso of zzso subjects affected with zzso zzso who zzso spontaneous zzso zzso female infants with zzso zzso were diagnosed with zzso zzso as newborns based on a clinical history of failure to zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso values of serum cortisol and urinary zzso and zzso These patients responded to treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso occurred in association with increased serum zzso levels at the age of 10 and 11 zzso zzso zzso hair developed at the age of 12 zzso 11 zzso in one subject and zzso was at the age of 12 zzso in both zzso Both subjects reported periodic zzso bleeding and subsequently developed zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis of the zzso zzso in these patients, the zzso gene was characterized by zzso and direct DNA sequence zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that one patient is zzso for the zzso 258 Stop zzso in zzso 7 and that the other patient is a compound zzso with the zzso 258 Stop zzso and a single A deletion at zzso zzso in the other zzso causing a zzso which renders the zzso protein zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso can be spared to some extent through zzso when the zzso gene product is zzso This is in marked contrast to the early onset of severe defects in zzso and zzso zzso which are characteristics of this zzso
