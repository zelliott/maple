The zzso zzso zzso complex of zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso (1 or zzso All zzso stations involved in electron transport from zzso to oxygen are located in zzso zzso zzso zzso is the consequence of assembly of zzso zzso with zzso zzso a process zzso in a zzso system, consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activated by an zzso zzso zzso is believed to act as a zzso between the zzso components and zzso We applied zzso zzso to mapping of zzso in zzso participating in zzso zzso zzso zzso one synthetic overlapping zzso spanning the zzso zzso were tested for the ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in the zzso system and to bind individual zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude the zzso 1) The zzso zzso of zzso zzso serves as an anchor for both zzso and zzso 2) zzso binds not only to the zzso region, located at zzso zzso in the zzso C zzso of zzso but also to a domain zzso zzso located on a loop exposed to the zzso 3) zzso shares with zzso the ability to bind to the zzso region zzso zzso and also binds to two additional zzso in the zzso loop zzso zzso and at the start of the zzso tail zzso zzso 4) The binding affinity of zzso for zzso peptides is lower than that of zzso 5) zzso of both zzso and zzso to zzso zzso peptides occurs in the absence of an zzso zzso A revised membrane zzso model of zzso is proposed, the core of which is the presence of a functionally important zzso loop zzso zzso
