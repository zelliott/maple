zzso of the zzso tract are important for microbial zzso The expression of zzso group zzso zzso both the expression of blood group zzso and in part the structure and size of the zzso Using neutral zzso isolated from the small zzso of a rare blood group O zzso zzso zzso zzso individual we were able to map the zzso zzso of the individual lacking zzso Lewis, and zzso zzso zzso were deduced with combined analysis of mass zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 600 zzso All structures present at a level zzso were structurally resolved and included two extended zzso zzso and zzso The first, a novel zzso is based on a type 2 chain and bears the Lex zzso on both its zzso The second, a major zzso is based on a type 1 chain, which bears a zzso type 1 precursor zzso zzso and a zzso Lex zzso on its zzso This latter structure is identical to that previously isolated from plasma and characterized by zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso resolution of these structures was supported by zzso of the blood group zzso zzso previously isolated from rat small zzso Other minor linear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso some bearing blood group zzso were also zzso The cumulative data were used to define a default zzso zzso where it can be seen that zzso chain extension, in the absence of blood group zzso is controlled and regulated by zzso group zzso and branching with type 2 zzso zzso
