zzso zzso zzso serve a zzso function in the reduction of zzso to less toxic zzso Both cellular and zzso forms of the protein have been reported, as well a number of distinct zzso zzso Previous efforts have described three distinct zzso on human zzso 3, 21 and X which zzso to a zzso zzso and these authors have speculated that only the zzso 3 locus encodes a functional zzso zzso This conclusion was based on mapping studies showing a precise deletion of zzso sequences in the zzso zzso on zzso 21 and X despite strong conservation among these sequences in both the coding and zzso zzso To pursue this issue, we have isolated the zzso 21 zzso locus by molecular cloning and determined its zzso zzso zzso with the expectations of McBride et zzso zzso 4 (1988) zzso the sequence does reveal a highly zzso processed zzso It is suggested that a zzso copy of the zzso gene integrated into zzso 21 and may have maintained activity prior to the zzso of zzso zzso
