zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been known for years, but the importance of these structures for the zzso of allergic reactions is still a matter of zzso Because of their zzso zzso structures, especially zzso have always been prime candidates for zzso zzso between zzso from unrelated zzso The aim of our study was to determine whether zzso structures on zzso can by themselves zzso allergic zzso We characterized in detail the zzso zzso of the major zzso zzso p 1 and zzso p 13 of zzso grass zzso zzso zzso zzso by performing zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso sequencing, sugar analysis, zzso and zzso zzso p 1 contains one zzso with one of the two zzso zzso and zzso and a single zzso zzso which is bound to a zzso zzso in direct vicinity to the zzso This zzso is probably due to an zzso consensus sequence found in the zzso part of zzso p 1 and other group 1 zzso but displayed no zzso Thus, zzso p 1 is zzso with respect to its zzso zzso zzso and showed no zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso p 13, which carries four of the same zzso (like zzso p 1), can zzso zzso via zzso chains and elicits zzso release from zzso
