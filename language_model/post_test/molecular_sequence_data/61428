The Florida scrub zzso zzso zzso is endemic to scrub habitat patches along the central portion of the Florida peninsula and zzso coastal zzso Scrub zzso are the zzso distributed remnants of previously widespread zzso formed during the zzso and early zzso Scrub zzso appear to have limited zzso capabilities due to high habitat specificity and low zzso To assess the population structure and zzso of zzso zzso 135 samples were collected from 16 patches on five major zzso in Florida, zzso Analysis of 273 zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso b reveals a very strong geographic distribution of genetic zzso zzso zzso are significantly different in 63 of 66 comparisons between zzso With one exception, samples from the five major zzso are characterized by fixed differences in zzso distribution and deep evolutionary zzso zzso zzso genetic differences were also observed between northern and southern segments of several zzso Analysis of molecular zzso zzso shows an estimated zzso total genetic variation within patches, zzso among patches zzso zzso and zzso among zzso This strong population structure among patches within zzso indicates that the distribution of zzso zzso is tightly linked to sandy scrub habitat and that the zzso distribution of scrub zzso significantly zzso zzso and gene zzso zzso analyses indicate a pattern of zzso down the Florida peninsula during the late zzso zzso followed by habitat fragmentation and zzso isolation zzso zzso the deep genetic structuring among scrub zzso populations on separate zzso is attributed to ancient isolation events induced by a shift from dry zzso to wet zzso conditions on the Florida zzso These findings indicate that some scrub zzso populations have persisted in isolation for time frames in excess of 1 zzso providing a case history on the genetic consequences of habitat zzso
