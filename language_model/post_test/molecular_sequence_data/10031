zzso zzso is a specific zzso I zzso poison which traps zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso breaks with zzso and zzso linked zzso zzso is also a potent zzso agent and several of its derivatives have recently shown activity in the chemotherapy of solid zzso Our aim was to apply the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method to DNA extracted from zzso cells in order to: zzso evaluate zzso as a sensitive technique to detect in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso investigate the frequency and distribution of zzso DNA damage in zzso ; and zzso compare the distribution and intensity of zzso sites in zzso and in zzso This report describes a protocol allowing the sequencing of zzso DNA strand breaks induced by zzso in the coding strand of the zzso zzso gene of human colon zzso zzso zzso or its clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differed in their potency and exhibited differences in their DNA zzso pattern, which is consistent with our previous in zzso studies zzso et al zzso zzso zzso , 43, zzso zzso DNA zzso induced in the presence of zzso zzso were induced at the same sites in the human zzso zzso However, the relative intensity of the zzso were different in zzso and in zzso Because zzso cells contain approximately 300 copies of the zzso gene per zzso zzso could be used to monitor zzso DNA zzso in different cell lines and possibly in tumor zzso
