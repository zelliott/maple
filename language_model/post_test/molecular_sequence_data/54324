It is becoming clear that the zzso brain has the capability of forming steroids de zzso the so-called zzso To understand zzso in the brain, it is essential to demonstrate the formation of zzso a main precursor of zzso In zzso the zzso formation from cholesterol is still zzso although the brain accumulates zzso zzso zzso and zzso This study was addressed to obtain basic information about zzso formation in the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso brain produces zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso zzso catalyzing zzso formation, was isolated from the zzso The sequence analysis showed that the isolated zzso zzso contained a putative coding region consisting of zzso zzso which zzso 523 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were highly shared in zzso acids among zzso zzso analysis amplified the authentic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso showed its zzso in the zzso However, the zzso level in the brain was lower than those of the zzso and the kidney including zzso The restricted cells in the four major regions of the zzso brain, such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were demonstrated to express zzso transcripts by zzso and in zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso brain expresses zzso zzso and produces zzso from zzso
