zzso zzso is listed as a Prior zzso zzso chemical, and it is still used extensively in developing zzso It has been seen that zzso shows high toxicity in fish and aquatic zzso To confirm whether zzso shows zzso effects on fish, the induction of zzso zzso in male goldfish zzso zzso following a 21 day exposure to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso exposure system was evaluated by zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso showed that zzso significantly increased zzso zzso expression of zzso in male goldfish in a zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed the presence of two zzso zzso with molecular masses of zzso zzso and 110 zzso in the plasma of the exposure groups, which were not observed in that of the control zzso indicating the induction of zzso protein synthesis and zzso by zzso in male zzso Furthermore, the levels of plasma zzso protein in the control group and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure groups were zzso by zzso zzso and revealed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overlapping results of zzso zzso and protein indicated that zzso had significant zzso properties and was thus a potential zzso zzso
