zzso zzso have been proposed to interact with one another through mutual zzso exclusion of their zzso zzso zzso zzso producing order in zzso zzso zzso and zzso mechanical strength to the zzso Here we apply theory developed for zzso brushes to examine the relationship between the brush properties of the zzso and zzso organization in zzso We first measure zzso zzso distribution functions and occupancy probability zzso for adult zzso Interpreting the probability zzso using information theory, we show that the zzso zzso may be represented by a single pair potential of mean zzso Then, to explore the relationship between model parameters and zzso architecture, we conduct two-dimensional zzso Carlo simulations of zzso zzso zzso We impose purely repulsive interaction zzso in which the zzso are represented as neutral and zzso zzso By treating the zzso as zzso zzso zzso we also incorporate zzso zzso Both repulsive zzso are capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their pair zzso We find that zzso structure is sensitive to changes in brush thickness zzso by chain charge, consistent with the experimental observation that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso The presence of attractive zzso interactions contributes only modestly to structure for moderate degrees of zzso and leads to zzso zzso for extensive zzso
