zzso 6 is a zzso zzso zzso to belong to the class of zzso zzso We built a three-dimensional model of human zzso 6 based on the similarity of its zzso pattern with that of other zzso and on the zzso structure of growth hormone, zzso 2, zzso 4, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The resulting model is a bundle of four zzso and suggests possible alternative zzso for the 9 zzso zzso zzso in this region, the importance of zzso and zzso for biological activity has been demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we generated a large collection of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of their biological activity in two systems and the zzso binding properties of a subset of the zzso indicates that the entire region is involved in forming the zzso binding surface and supports the hypothesis that this region does not assume an zzso zzso zzso we also found a zzso with zzso affinity and biological activity much higher than wild type; the potential zzso value of this finding is zzso
