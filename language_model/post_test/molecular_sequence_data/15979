zzso I zzso studies employing several DNA fragments have confirmed that zzso binds zzso to regions of DNA containing alternating zzso and zzso zzso and zzso A, related compounds which contain additional sugar zzso at both ends of the zzso produce similar patterns of zzso protection though at higher drug zzso The pattern induced by zzso which has charged groups at both ends of the zzso differs in many details and this analogue appears to display a modified DNA sequence zzso The results have been confirmed by similar studies using zzso zzso All four compounds increase the zzso of certain zzso zzso to modification by zzso The results suggest an zzso mode of binding for these zzso zzso and reveals an increased complexity in compounds which can bind to DNA by this zzso
