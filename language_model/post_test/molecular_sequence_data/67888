zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger, has emerged as a key controller of several biological zzso Numbers of reports that deal with the zzso aspects of this second zzso have appeared in the zzso However, the lack of a reporter tag attached to the zzso at times limits the understanding of further zzso In this study, we have chemically coupled zzso zzso zzso with zzso giving rise to zzso or zzso We have characterized the chemical and physical properties and spectral behavior of zzso The zzso of zzso is sensitive to changes in the zzso which helped us study its interaction with three different zzso binding proteins (a zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have shown here that zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso however, it is zzso by zzso specific zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso behaves like native zzso and this study raises the possibility that zzso will be a valuable research tool for the in zzso characterization of zzso signaling zzso
