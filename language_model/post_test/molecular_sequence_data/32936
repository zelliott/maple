Recent studies have indicated that the zzso common zzso gene clusters are loaded on structurally diverse zzso zzso plasmids and their residing zzso To zzso the mechanisms supporting the diversification of zzso plasmids and zzso we determined here the complete zzso zzso sequence of zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to belong to the zzso zzso group that play important roles in the zzso of several zzso zzso carried two distinct zzso gene clusters zzso zzso five short terminal zzso repeats zzso and three zzso resolution zzso sites that are all typical of class II zzso This organization of zzso suggested the four possible zzso regions, zzso to zzso The largest 86 zzso region zzso spanned the three other regions, and zzso and zzso (62 zzso covered all of the 36 zzso genes for zzso zzso Our subsequent zzso experiments clarified that the three zzso zzso to zzso indeed exhibit their zzso and that zzso also generated another 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso which carried the two separated and zzso oriented segments of zzso the zzso module of zzso and a part of zzso gene clusters on zzso The zzso zzso was able to mediate the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso zzso zzso only the zzso of zzso zzso was formed by the zzso zzso zzso inversion between the two zzso oriented zzso sites on zzso These findings and comparison with other zzso plasmids clearly indicate multiple copies of zzso genes and sites on one zzso and their zzso activities contribute greatly to the diversification of zzso structures as well as wide dissemination of the evolutionary common gene clusters in various zzso
