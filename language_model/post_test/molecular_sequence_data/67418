The process of zzso often brings about profound changes in levels of genetic variation in animals and zzso The honey zzso zzso zzso has been managed by humans for centuries for both honey and wax production and crop zzso Human management and selective breeding are believed to have caused reductions in genetic diversity in honey bee zzso thereby contributing to the global declines threatening this ecologically and economically important zzso However, previous studies supporting this claim mostly relied on population genetic comparisons of European and African (or zzso honey bee zzso such conclusions require reassessment given recent evidence demonstrating that the honey bee originated in Africa and zzso Europe via two independent zzso We sampled honey bee workers from two managed populations in North America and Europe as well as several zzso zzso populations in Africa, East and West zzso zzso bees had highly zzso zzso representing zzso between East and West European zzso zzso We found that managed honey bees actually have higher levels of genetic diversity compared with their zzso in East and West Europe, providing an unusual example zzso human management increases genetic diversity by promoting zzso The relationship between genetic diversity and honey bee declines is tenuous given that managed bees have more genetic diversity than their zzso and many viable zzso zzso
