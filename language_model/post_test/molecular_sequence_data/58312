zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso disease that affects mainly zzso and other zzso zzso zzso is zzso characterized by a separation of the zzso from underlying zzso within the basement membrane zzso zzso studies demonstrate the deposition of zzso membrane zone zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso of patients with active zzso identified a zzso clone from a human zzso zzso library that had complete zzso with the zzso domain of beta zzso The zzso recognized a zzso protein in human zzso human zzso and tumor cell zzso that was identified as beta zzso by its reaction with zzso and zzso zzso to human beta zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso diseases did not recognize the zzso zzso indicating the specificity of the zzso These data strongly zzso a role for human beta zzso in the zzso of zzso It should be emphasized that multiple zzso in the basement membrane zone of zzso zzso may serve as targets for a wide spectrum of zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso definition of these zzso will facilitate the zzso and characterization of zzso of zzso zzso and help distinguishing them from zzso zzso This study highlights the function and importance of beta zzso in maintaining the attachment of zzso cells to the basement zzso
