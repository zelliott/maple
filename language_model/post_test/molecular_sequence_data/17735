The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso protein from the seeds of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso This has been done by the sequence analysis of peptides derived by zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso as well as by chemical zzso with zzso zzso The protein consists of 261 zzso acid zzso containing two zzso bonds and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The two zzso bonds connect zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso of this sequence with the sequence of the zzso zzso shows that there are identical zzso at 76 positions in the two molecules zzso zzso having an extended region of highly zzso sequence at positions zzso zzso In contrast, the internal regions at positions zzso and zzso and the zzso 15 zzso acid zzso are less zzso in the two zzso
