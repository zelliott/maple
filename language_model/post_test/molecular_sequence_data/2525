We have isolated and zzso a DNA zzso from zzso zzso that specifies zzso 3' end formation for the zzso transcribed zzso and zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso zzso previously showed that this zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso shown here are consistent with this zzso The zzso sites in the zzso formed by the zzso are the same whether the zzso resides at the native location or at a zzso zzso No single zzso substitution zzso the zzso activity, whereas certain large, zzso deletions have strong, deleterious zzso zzso the zzso zzso behaves more like zzso bacterial zzso than zzso of higher zzso That a number of deletions or zzso have different effects in the two zzso suggests that the zzso contains the sequences of two, zzso zzso zzso
