The Clock gene is an essential regulator of zzso zzso It encodes a member of the basic zzso family of zzso factors known to play a central role in the control of diverse cellular zzso Previously we described the functional identification and molecular isolation of the Clock gene in the zzso its interaction with the zzso zzso and the role of this complex as a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso organization, zzso location, and zzso expression of the human zzso zzso The coding sequence of human zzso extends for zzso zzso and is zzso identical to its mouse zzso its deduced zzso acid sequence is zzso zzso long and is zzso identical to mouse zzso zzso hybrid mapping localized human zzso to the long arm of human zzso 4 zzso zzso sequencing of a zzso zzso clone indicated that the coding sequence of human zzso extends over 20 zzso and that its zzso organization is identical to that of the mouse zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated widespread expression of two major transcripts of 8 and 10 zzso and in zzso zzso of human brain tissue revealed elevated expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the locus of zzso control in zzso and in the zzso zzso of zzso clones revealed two single zzso zzso in zzso sequence zzso the zzso open reading zzso The central role of Clock in the organization of zzso rhythms suggests that it will be a useful candidate gene for genetic analyses of disorders associated with dysfunction of the zzso zzso
