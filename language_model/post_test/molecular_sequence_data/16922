zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso harbor an approximately zzso repeated element, zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we show by Southern zzso zzso that zzso is present in all 54 zzso zzso group strains tested but absent in 11 zzso strains outside the group, suggesting that zzso may be specific and ubiquitous to the zzso zzso zzso By comparative analysis of the complete zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is exclusively present in the zzso but absent from large plasmids carried by these strains and that the numbers of full-length zzso repeats for these strains are 79, 54, and 12, zzso Numerous copies of partial zzso elements are also present in the three zzso zzso zzso and 53, zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso is not zzso between strains with respect to zzso position or organization of gene neighbors, as only six full-length zzso zzso are common to at least two of the three zzso However, the zzso sequence surrounding a specific zzso repeat in one of the three strains is generally strongly zzso in the other two, even in zzso where zzso is found exclusively in one zzso This finding indicates that zzso either has evolved by differential deletion from a very high number of repeats in a common zzso to the zzso zzso group or is moving around the zzso The identification of zzso repeats interrupting genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the presence of a zzso zzso motif in each end show that zzso exhibits features characteristic of a mobile zzso
