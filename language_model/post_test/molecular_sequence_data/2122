The zzso zzso nucleus zzso is a storehouse for a large number of proteins that are used during early zzso We have cloned and characterized a zzso coding for a maternal gene product that is localized in the zzso and then becomes highly enriched in the zzso of the central nervous system zzso of zzso and adult zzso This zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso species on Northern zzso Southern blots of zzso DNA suggest that this gene is a member of a zzso zzso The zzso sequence reveals a long open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso with a putative nuclear targeting signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the extreme zzso zzso and an internal zzso zzso region with a repeated zzso zzso acid sequence between His zzso The significance of this region is zzso but the protein is a zzso zzso and it is possible that this region is involved in this zzso The zzso protein also possesses a putative zzso consensus sequence that is similar to the bacterial zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exists as several zzso that exhibit zzso and zzso changes during zzso Northern zzso analysis of the abundance of the zzso zzso shows an zzso following neural induction at stages zzso There is a transient expression of the zzso in the gut of zzso In the adult, the zzso is highly enriched in the brain and is absent or in very low abundance in other zzso zzso analysis of the protein shows that the protein is localized in the zzso of the brain zzso We conclude that the zzso gene product is a maternal protein that may serve several important functions, one of which may be in the development and zzso of the zzso
