Two gene clusters each zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In cluster zzso the genes zzso and zzso were expressed in media containing zzso zzso or zzso as nitrogen sources, but expression was higher in the absence of combined nitrogen taking place both in zzso cells and zzso Both genes were zzso from three putative promoters located upstream of zzso and, zzso the zzso gene was expressed zzso from at least two promoters located in the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso promoters and promoters dependent on the global nitrogen control zzso regulator zzso were zzso In cluster zzso the zzso and zzso zzso which are found in opposite zzso were expressed as zzso messages in media containing zzso zzso or zzso but expression was higher in the absence of zzso zzso of the zzso genes was lower than that of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso gene zzso zzso indicated that cluster zzso genes contributed more than cluster zzso genes to zzso zzso in the whole filament as well as in zzso zzso growth was more severely impaired in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso although normally zzso in the zzso is not required for zzso function and that the inability to degrade this zzso is zzso for the zzso growth of the zzso
