Sound zzso in the zzso depends on the unique high zzso of zzso in the zzso The production and maintenance of high zzso zzso are accompanied by zzso zzso In this study, we report on an investigation of the expression and zzso of zzso 1 zzso a recently cloned zzso zzso channel, in the mouse zzso by Western zzso and zzso The zzso protein was identified in the zzso by Western zzso The zzso was found in zzso zzso as a line and in the organ of zzso as three zzso The cellular zzso of zzso was examined by means of zzso experiments with zzso 11, a marker for zzso cells of the zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso zzso with zzso 11, indicating its expression in zzso zzso We also examined zzso zzso in the organ of zzso by double- and zzso techniques with zzso zzso a marker for hair cells, and zzso a marker for zzso zzso nerve endings under hair zzso The results clearly showed that zzso is zzso with zzso but not with zzso zzso indicating that zzso is localized at zzso zzso zzso nerve endings under outer hair zzso These results suggest that zzso may be specifically involved in synaptic transmission from zzso zzso zzso nerve endings to outer hair cells in the organ of zzso as well as zzso cycling in zzso cells of the zzso zzso
