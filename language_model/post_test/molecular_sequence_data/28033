zzso is a smooth muscle and zzso regulatory protein that interacts with zzso myosin, zzso and zzso Two overlapping zzso isolated from a chicken zzso zzso zzso library and a chicken gizzard zzso zzso zzso library, were used to generate a zzso pair sequence coding for one zzso zzso of the coding sequence confirms this is one of the large smooth muscle zzso The deduced protein molecular weight is zzso significantly less than the molecular weights estimated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The protein has a high content of zzso zzso zzso and zzso there are two zzso zzso one at either end of the zzso zzso with the zzso Identification Resource database demonstrates a similarity with a zzso binding domain of zzso zzso but none with any zzso or zzso binding zzso The center of the protein has an zzso repeat of a 13 zzso acid sequence whose general motif is zzso where X is zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso sequences from a zzso zzso that binds zzso and zzso places this domain on the C zzso of zzso adjacent to the zzso T zzso A tentative map of the major binding zzso is proposed on the basis of available zzso
