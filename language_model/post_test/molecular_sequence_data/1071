zzso belongs to the zzso family and is one of the zzso class E zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Previously we have reported that the zzso of an zzso zzso form of zzso zzso of zzso transport growth zzso zzso leads the zzso of membrane transport through zzso and zzso however, the molecular mechanism behind the action of zzso is poorly zzso We have identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso screening and we assign them as zzso class E zzso zzso The primary sequence of zzso indicates zzso identity with that of zzso from zzso zzso which was recently identified as a novel class E zzso protein binding to zzso In fact, zzso binds directly to zzso through its zzso region zzso zzso zzso is exclusively localized to zzso however it is redirected to an zzso zzso structure, the zzso zzso in the cells expressing zzso The zzso activity of zzso regulates both the membrane association of, and assembly of, a large zzso protein complex, containing zzso which is potentially involved in membrane transport through zzso and zzso The zzso half zzso of human zzso is identical to zzso protein 5 and zzso zzso zzso activity significantly influences the membrane association of zzso zzso The zzso complex, together with zzso zzso may function in zzso membrane zzso A primary sequence of zzso a mouse zzso of human zzso indicates zzso identity with zzso from zzso zzso zzso also interacts with zzso and is localized to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso region of zzso is required for the formation of the zzso compartment but not for binding to zzso We propose that both zzso and zzso regulate zzso function in zzso zzso
