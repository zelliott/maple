zzso dormancy is a zzso zzso state during which zzso is zzso In this study, zzso lines of zzso zzso were used to zzso the influence of zzso and environment on the dormant zzso and on expression of the zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso 1 zzso zzso The zzso for zzso 1 was cloned from mature zzso Analysis of the predicted protein sequence revealed a high degree of similarity to other VP zzso zzso zzso factors, in particular in four regions previously shown to be highly zzso including the zzso region that has been shown to interact with several classes of zzso DNA binding zzso The potential of zzso mature zzso for dormancy was zzso and shown to be determined primarily by zzso and zzso by previous environmental experience of the mature seed acting on zzso zzso Under all conditions zzso expression of zzso 1 and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso to be regulated by VP 1 during zzso zzso were positively correlated with the dormant zzso whereas expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with dormancy (in barley zzso 6-4 has been shown to be zzso by VP zzso zzso of zzso 1 zzso was also shown in the dry seed to be positively correlated with the length of time required for seeds of the zzso lines to zzso These results suggest new functions for the VP 1 zzso factor family in the control of zzso processes in zzso cells of mature seeds, and the zzso of zzso 1 and zzso zzso in the dormant state suggests that they are regulated by a switching mechanism in the mature seed that shows some aspects of zzso
