zzso factor 5 zzso is a member of the zzso gene zzso The zzso proteins stimulate the in zzso zzso activity of zzso toxin and appear to play a role in zzso trafficking in zzso We have mapped zzso one of the six known zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso on human zzso zzso In addition, we have isolated and zzso an approximately zzso zzso segment that contains the entire zzso coding region, revealing the complete zzso structure of the zzso With six coding zzso and five zzso the zzso structure of zzso is unique among the zzso zzso genes and provides insight about the evolutionary history of this ancient gene zzso
