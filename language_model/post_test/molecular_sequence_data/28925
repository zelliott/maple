A zzso designated zzso that is zzso responsive to temperature was found in zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso fusion and primer extension analysis revealed that zzso was expressed at a low temperature with a peak around 25 degrees C but was hardly expressed at 42 degrees zzso After a temperature downshift, the zzso level increased until 6 to 12 h and then zzso zzso an A + zzso sequence similar to UP elements seen in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso genes was found zzso of the zzso promoter, and its zzso region was found to share similarity with those of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, a putative zzso box, which also exists in zzso zzso was zzso The zzso product was identified by overproduction and determination of its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso portion of zzso to the zzso family suggests that zzso belongs to this zzso The results of zzso experiments suggest that zzso is not essential for zzso zzso
