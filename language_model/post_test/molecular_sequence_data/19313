Four bacterial strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the residual zzso produced during the processing of Spanish-style green table zzso The zzso were subjected to a zzso zzso study using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The bacteria were zzso zzso zzso Moreover, they were zzso that were able to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as carbon zzso The zzso content of their zzso DNA ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids found in strain zzso were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso shows zzso % zzso among the four zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of isolate zzso shows that it belongs to the zzso zzso with the highest sequence similarity (99 zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso differences and zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of less than 47 % suggest the placement of these strains within a novel species of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
