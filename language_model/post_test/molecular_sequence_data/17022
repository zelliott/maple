The zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso predicts that the protein contains five zzso zzso Human zzso contains an additional zzso zzso and folds into two forms with distinct zzso bridge zzso One form is zzso active zzso while the other is inactive zzso Due to the lack of the additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso are unable to generate an inactive fold identical to human zzso The zzso acid sequences predict the formation of zzso only, but other folding zzso cannot be ruled out based on the zzso observed for human zzso To test this, we zzso zzso from rabbit plasma and determined the zzso bridge zzso The results revealed that the zzso bridges are homogeneous and identical to human zzso Four zzso zzso are involved in two zzso bonds while the zzso zzso zzso forms an zzso zzso zzso No evidence for other folding zzso was zzso These findings show that rabbit zzso exists as an zzso active form zzso The absence of zzso in rabbits suggests that the structure and aspects of the zzso function of zzso differs significantly between rabbit and zzso This is an important notion to take when using these animals as model systems for zzso zzso
