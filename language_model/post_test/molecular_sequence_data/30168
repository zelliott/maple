zzso zzso is characterized by complete lack of zzso zzso in skin and zzso In order to study the molecular basis of zzso we have cloned and characterized the zzso gene of zzso mice zzso zzso analysis of this gene reveals a point zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causing a zzso substitution at position 85 in one of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Since this zzso zzso creates an additional zzso site, we were able to confirm that this zzso is actually present in zzso zzso DNA using DNA amplification zzso In contrast, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso mouse strains carry the G zzso at the same position, suggesting that this point zzso is specific for the zzso zzso at the c zzso Moreover, we were able to show that the zzso containing zzso is not functional in transient expression of its zzso We therefore suggest that a zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene could lead to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
