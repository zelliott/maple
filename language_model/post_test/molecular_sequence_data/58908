A zzso region of a zzso product containing the putative zzso control region and zzso sequences was analyzed for sequence variation among 19 sea stars representing 10 previously described zzso zzso within a cryptic species complex zzso zzso Most zzso of the sequence variation was zzso rather than zzso which greatly reduced the utility of sequence zzso in this zzso region as markers of zzso population structure and gene zzso The estimated number of transition and zzso zzso per zzso site, corrected for multiple hits, was zzso and zzso zzso Most of the sequence variation occurred in the first half of the putative control zzso zzso analysis (both maximum zzso and maximum zzso revealed three zzso zzso but the position of two zzso zzso was not completely zzso Low zzso zzso sequence divergence over large geographic distances may be a general pattern for zzso zzso
