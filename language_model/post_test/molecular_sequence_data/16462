zzso cells are crucial components of the innate immune system, capable of directly eliminating infected or zzso cells and regulating zzso zzso immune zzso Unlike T cells, where the key recognition event driving zzso is zzso by the unique T cell zzso zzso expressed on a given cell, zzso cells express multiple zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso often with overlapping zzso zzso zzso display two zzso structural zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is found on zzso cells but is also widely expressed on T cells and other immune system cells, providing zzso or zzso zzso zzso drives target cell killing following engagement of diverse, zzso expressed zzso class zzso protein zzso whose expression can signal cellular distress due to infection or zzso The zzso zzso zzso interacts with its zzso zzso zzso in similar zzso complexes, with an equivalent surface on each zzso zzso binding extensively and intimately to zzso structurally divergent surfaces on the zzso Thus, zzso zzso site recognition is highly zzso further demonstrated by zzso ability to simultaneously accommodate multiple zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso In zzso zzso recognition explains zzso but zzso zzso zzso and kinetic analyses of multiple zzso pairs show that rather than classical zzso zzso zzso zzso is achieved using distinct interaction mechanisms at each rigid zzso recognition zzso by zzso zzso While likely forming similar complexes with their zzso zzso other zzso zzso family members do not require such recognition zzso
