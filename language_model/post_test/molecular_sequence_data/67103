Using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso we establish that the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso adopts a zzso fold similar to those of zzso and zzso zzso is sorted to the limiting membrane of the zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso pathway, and we show that its zzso domain is sufficient to direct transport to this zzso In contrast, we found that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were not sufficient to direct their zzso A zzso zzso zzso sorting signal zzso unique to the zzso domain of zzso mediates interactions with the zzso complex in zzso and in zzso We show that zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso as well as reduced binding of the zzso protein to the zzso zzso Although the sorting of zzso to the limiting membrane of the zzso is dependent upon the zzso zzso and zzso in particular, our findings with zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso chain zzso of zzso zzso suggest a mechanistically distinct role for this zzso in the recognition of zzso zzso sorting zzso
