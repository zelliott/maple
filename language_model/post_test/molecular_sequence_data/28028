In zzso coli, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso zzso and zzso zzso require zzso the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso contains a single sequence that matches the consensus for zzso binding zzso A zzso that converted the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this consensus sequence to a zzso reduced the activities of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso by factors of greater than 500, to levels below the detection limits of the zzso The apparent elimination of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso by this zzso is consistent with the proposal that these activities share a common zzso binding site and that these reactions may occur at the same active zzso Although conversion of zzso to a zzso eliminated zzso zzso zzso activity as measured in zzso the zzso zzso retained the ability to complement an zzso deletion zzso restoring the ability of these cells to grow on minimal zzso zzso zzso apparently resulted because the zzso protein retained sufficient activity to zzso zzso in zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso performed in zzso had correctly reflected the activity of the zzso protein in zzso we measured the rates at which zzso and zzso cultures could incorporate zzso zzso into zzso The zzso culture achieved zzso incorporation in less than 3 zzso In contrast, zzso incorporation was only barely zzso after 30 zzso in the zzso culture, indicating that the activity of the zzso protein is, indeed, greatly reduced in zzso The ability of the zzso zzso to complement an zzso zzso zzso thus suggests that zzso zzso levels in zzso cells are in great excess over what is required for zzso growth on zzso zzso
