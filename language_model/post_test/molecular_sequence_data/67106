The budding and zzso of zzso during membrane trafficking requires many zzso including those that coat the zzso zzso proteins that recruit components of the coat, and small zzso that initiate zzso zzso In addition, zzso formation in zzso is promoted by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms by which these zzso zzso are directed to the appropriate zzso in zzso and their precise roles in zzso zzso are not yet zzso Here, we present the first report on membrane associated zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso member of the zzso protein zzso We show that in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso membrane zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso in zzso reduce the rate of zzso zzso A lack of zzso activity causes a change in zzso zzso Although in wild type, many zzso zzso have long zzso zzso loss of zzso activity results in loss of the zzso zzso suggesting the zzso is required for the generation or maintenance of these zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso binds fatty zzso in zzso and that this zzso ability is important for its function in zzso Our results are consistent with a role for zzso in an zzso process during zzso zzso
