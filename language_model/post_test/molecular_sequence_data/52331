We cloned three overlapping zzso covering zzso base pairs zzso a new basement membrane collagen chain, alpha zzso from rabbit zzso zzso cell zzso zzso sequence analysis demonstrated that the clones zzso a zzso domain of zzso 1/3 zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso zzso domain of 231 zzso We also isolated a zzso DNA zzso for the human alpha zzso chain, which contained two zzso zzso from the zzso end of the zzso domain to the zzso end of the zzso zzso Identification of the clones was based on the zzso acid sequence identity between the zzso zzso acid sequence and the reported zzso acid sequence obtained from a zzso of the alpha zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Michael, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When compared with four other type IV collagen zzso the zzso domain contained 12 zzso zzso in positions identical to those of the zzso in those zzso The domain demonstrated 61, 70, 55, and zzso zzso acid similarity with human alpha 1, human alpha 2, bovine alpha 3, and human alpha 5 zzso zzso The human zzso DNA zzso allowed us to map the alpha zzso gene zzso to the zzso region of the human zzso
