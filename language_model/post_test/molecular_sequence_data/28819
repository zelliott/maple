zzso is typically associated with zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso and appears to mediate zzso zzso zzso are usually not found in higher plants, but active genes zzso to zzso have been identified in the plant kingdom, including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have isolated and zzso zzso zzso sequences of two further zzso species, barley and zzso zzso comparison revealed a zzso tree with distinct clusters corresponding to the systematic position of the zzso Furthermore, zzso thought to be exposed in the folded protein and to be candidates for interaction with zzso zzso related zzso exhibited motifs highly specific of zzso zzso Strong expression of the zzso zzso as determined by Northern zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso dropped distinctly when zzso activity zzso Thus, in zzso zzso that showed intricate zzso of cortical zzso zzso related to cell shaping only very low zzso zzso zzso levels were found, contrasting with the situation for zzso The findings indicate that zzso expression in plants may be more tightly linked to zzso although there is some zzso expression at the zzso level even after zzso It follows that the zzso changes in zzso zzso may be less dependent on concurrent zzso zzso expression than zzso zzso
