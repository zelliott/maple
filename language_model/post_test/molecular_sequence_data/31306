We have recently shown that human zzso zzso zzso and saliva contain a number of zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The members of the zzso family can be divided into the zzso zzso and the pregnancy specific beta 1 zzso zzso zzso The latter zzso are abundant in zzso and fetal zzso Here we report that zzso are expressed in normal adult zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso cloning and sequencing gave two clones zzso and zzso which coded for zzso with a domain arrangement of zzso and a third clone zzso which coded for a zzso with a domain arrangement of zzso zzso is identical to zzso and zzso to zzso while zzso most probably zzso to zzso The 3' untranslated regions of the different members of the zzso zzso contain highly zzso zzso suggesting a common evolutionary zzso
