The zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 6 zzso of bovine muzzle zzso zzso has originally been described as a single molecular species, localized to zzso plaques of certain cell types, mostly zzso zzso zzso and complex zzso We now report that this protein exists in at least two different zzso 726 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This reflects the zzso of the 21 zzso zzso 7 of the human zzso gene and that each zzso zzso form can occur in two zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso recognizing either zzso and/or others that are specific for the zzso sequence of form zzso have allowed, in combination with zzso protocols minimizing losses of zzso zzso the detection of both zzso in the zzso of diverse kinds of cultured cells and zzso including zzso cells as well as cells that never form zzso The protein has also been identified in manually isolated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates in zzso as shown by suitable zzso protocols and upon zzso following zzso with zzso but is also located in zzso of zzso and complex zzso By contrast, zzso zzso has been found exclusively in zzso even in cells connected by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso nuclear proteins zzso by the same zzso which is not expressed in relation to zzso differentiation zzso whereas the additional appearance of zzso zzso in zzso plaques of zzso and complex zzso is regulated by an as yet unknown mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso functions of zzso are discussed in relation to recent reports of the involvement of other members of the zzso zzso family of proteins in cell zzso regulation zzso zzso
