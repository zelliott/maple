During zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso and rolling of zzso on high zzso zzso zzso in secondary zzso zzso The zzso zzso on zzso are a set of zzso zzso for which zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso binding in equilibrium zzso requires zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Analysis of zzso has revealed two zzso modifications zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Lewis zzso Recently, three related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso cell zzso zzso and human zzso were zzso which can generate zzso and zzso in zzso zzso these modifications to zzso together with appropriate zzso yields enhanced rolling zzso for both peripheral blood zzso and zzso cells in flow chamber zzso as compared with those generated with zzso zzso Either zzso modification results in an increased number of zzso and rolling zzso a reduction in overall rolling zzso associated with more frequent pausing of the cells, and an enhanced resistance of rolling cells to detachment by zzso All of these effects are predicted to promote the overall efficiency of zzso zzso In contrast, the rolling interactions of zzso zzso with the same zzso are not affected by zzso
