zzso zzso are among few zzso groups that possess a comprehensive fossil record available for study by zzso The zzso and the zzso whose skeletons do not become zzso were once members of the class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso originally proposed by zzso but are now included in the zzso zzso zzso relationships within this zzso remain largely zzso We investigated the evolutionary relationship of the zzso and the zzso to other zzso using zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso coding zzso We zzso the need to culture these organisms by collecting and maintaining zzso stages that contain many copies of their zzso zzso This strategy facilitated extraction of zzso DNA and its zzso from zzso and prey zzso zzso trees zzso from comparisons of zzso coding regions do not support a shared history between the zzso and the zzso However, the zzso of the zzso and the separate zzso of the zzso zzso are well supported by our zzso zzso The zzso lineage branches among crown organisms whereas the zzso lineage zzso before the radiation of the crown zzso We conclude that the zzso does not represent a zzso evolutionary zzso and recommend that this zzso designation be zzso
