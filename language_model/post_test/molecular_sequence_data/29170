The fact that natural zzso proteins are usually soluble but that fragments or designs of beta structure usually zzso suggests that natural beta proteins must somehow be designed to avoid this zzso Regular zzso edges are dangerous, because they are already in the right zzso to interact with any other beta strand they zzso We surveyed edge strands in a large sample of zzso proteins to zzso features that could protect against further zzso zzso zzso of course, avoid edges altogether by continuous zzso around the barrel zzso Parallel zzso proteins protect their zzso ends by covering them with zzso of other zzso zzso and zzso proteins use a combination of zzso zzso zzso placed charges, very short edge zzso and loop zzso zzso proteins favor placing an zzso charged side chain on one of the edge strands where it would be buried by zzso they also use zzso zzso and other zzso One recent zzso design has a constrained twist too great for accommodation into a larger zzso whereas some zzso edges are protected by the bend and reverse twist produced by an zzso zzso All free edge strands were seen to be protected, usually by several redundant zzso In contrast, edge strands that zzso form beta zzso zzso or rings have long, regular stretches without such zzso These results are relevant to understanding how proteins may assemble into zzso zzso zzso and they are especially zzso to the de zzso design of beta zzso Many zzso strategies used by natural proteins are beyond our current abilities to zzso by design, but one possibility stands out as especially zzso a single charged side chain near the middle of what would zzso be the zzso side of the edge beta zzso This minimal zzso strategy changes only one zzso requires no backbone zzso and is easy to zzso The accompanying paper zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 99, zzso makes use of the zzso charge strategy with great success, turning highly zzso zzso designs into soluble zzso
