The zzso zzso zzso zzso across zzso using the energy provided by zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for the cellular export of zzso and is a member of the heavy metal zzso zzso zzso which includes the related Wilson and zzso diseases zzso The zzso are distinct from their zzso zzso in zzso binding zzso membrane zzso and the presence of zzso metal binding zzso suggesting that they employ alternate forms of regulation and novel mechanisms of zzso zzso To gain insight into zzso function, the structure of the zzso zzso binding domain zzso was determined to zzso A zzso Similar to other zzso zzso the zzso includes zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso adopts a closed zzso similar to the zzso forms of the zzso The zzso zzso is much smaller and more zzso however, revealing the minimal elements required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparisons to the zzso form of the zzso coli zzso zzso and to the Wilson disease protein zzso indicate that the five zzso zzso zzso found in zzso zzso but not in the other families, most likely participate in zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso includes several zzso zzso among all zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso structure provides a basis for understanding the likely structural and functional effects of various zzso that lead to Wilson and zzso zzso
