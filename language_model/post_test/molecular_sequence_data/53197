Individual bacteria of numerous species can communicate and coordinate their actions via the production, release, and detection of zzso signaling zzso In this study, we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine whether zzso zzso produces such a zzso zzso zzso media from zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso each induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso than did sterile culture zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso had a molecular mass of zzso zzso and its activity was unaffected by heating to 80 degrees C for 5 zzso or zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso does not contain any gene predicted to zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso but does contain an zzso of zzso which is required for production of zzso zzso in zzso zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso media from the zzso zzso zzso strains induced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso than did zzso medium from either zzso zzso zzso of the signaling zzso was restored in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain by zzso with a single intact copy of zzso placed in a zzso site on the zzso In addition, zzso coli zzso produced zzso activity following the introduction of an intact copy of zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the signaling zzso by zzso zzso was growth phase dependent, with zzso production occurring in the zzso phase of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso also was growth phase dependent, but this phenomenon was not dependent on zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso produces an zzso signaling zzso related to zzso from zzso zzso We speculate that this signaling zzso may play a role in regulating zzso zzso gene zzso
