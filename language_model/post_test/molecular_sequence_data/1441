Much of our knowledge on zzso was zzso using specific zzso zzso isolated from a number of zzso zzso Recently, this field received a strong support and increased interest due to the solution of the three-dimensional structure of a couple of zzso At the same time, several new zzso of specific toxins for zzso were isolated from scorpion zzso enhancing the availability and diversity of such useful molecular zzso It opened new lines of research for the better understanding of zzso zzso and zzso In this review, we listed 120 zzso acid sequences of peptides isolated from scorpion zzso They were demonstrated or assumed to be specific for zzso These sequences were aligned and used to generate a rooted zzso zzso The evolutionary tree indicates that several clusters of divergent peptides show preference for specific zzso of zzso The three-dimensional structures of representative examples of these peptides were drawn and zzso concerning the molecular fitness of their interactions with the channel zzso Four different interacting modes were identified to exist between scorpion toxins and the various zzso of zzso
