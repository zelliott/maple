The zzso zzso zzso is one of the most abundant proteins expressed in zzso and has been shown to be an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been found on the surface of some zzso cells where it functions as a zzso motif and zzso of zzso zzso to zzso To investigate the zzso of zzso in the opportunistic zzso zzso zzso the zzso and complementary DNA zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The predicted protein comprises 433 zzso zzso and shows extensive zzso to other zzso zzso including those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and may be an important zzso and indicator of zzso zzso zzso The active site and zzso metal zzso site zzso necessary for zzso and zzso function are zzso in the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is unique among the zzso zzso in that it possesses a zzso zzso zzso zzso that was necessary and sufficient for the zzso activity of the zzso of zzso zzso The activity of the zzso binding suggests its involvement in the local regulation of zzso within the zzso zzso
