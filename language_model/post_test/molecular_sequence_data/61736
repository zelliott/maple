zzso zzso zzso is a collection of protein families, clustered on the basis of sequence and structural zzso The database is unique in that the protein family sequence alignments have been specially zzso using the program, zzso to highlight a wide range of structural zzso Such data are useful for identifying key structurally zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of the structures within each family are also available and a sensitive zzso search engine, zzso can be used to search the database for matches to a query protein zzso Historically, zzso families were generated using several key pieces of software, including zzso and zzso and held in a number of flat files and zzso A new zzso database version of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is being developed using zzso This zzso data structure provides more flexibility for future developments, reduces update times and makes data more easily zzso zzso it has been possible to add a number of new web features including a custom alignment zzso Altogether, this makes zzso and its new zzso version, an excellent resource both for comparative zzso and for identifying distant zzso similarities between zzso
