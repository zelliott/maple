The zzso zzso gene from the zzso fungus zzso zzso has been isolated and shown to be only zzso identical at the zzso sequence level to the similar zzso from zzso zzso A transformation system has been developed for both zzso zzso and the related zzso zzso and has been used to create zzso zzso which either zzso or are deficient in zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments on zzso zzso using culture zzso from these zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso is responsible for a large part of the growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso although other zzso compounds may also play a zzso In pot trials with cotton plants, both zzso species had some zzso activity, but there was no significant difference in the zzso of zzso zzso with either the presence or absence of zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso Under the experimental conditions used, insufficient zzso is presumably present in the soil around cotton roots to generate sufficient hydrogen zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and the observed zzso activity must be attributed to other zzso
