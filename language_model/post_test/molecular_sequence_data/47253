A novel zzso zzso zzso has been identified in pancreatic beta cells by comparing genes expressed in pancreatic alpha and beta cell lines using zzso differential zzso The domain structure of the protein products of the zzso gene contains an zzso zzso motif and zzso zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso There are two zzso the larger zzso zzso has two zzso whereas the smaller one, zzso contains only the first zzso zzso is specifically expressed in pancreatic beta cells and the zzso zzso but not in pancreatic alpha cells, the adrenal zzso or other major zzso such as the zzso A portion of zzso associates with zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso in beta zzso Thus, its distribution pattern presents a striking contrast with that of zzso which associates with small synaptic zzso in zzso The first zzso of zzso binds zzso in a zzso manner, whereas the second one does zzso These distinctive characteristics of zzso suggest that it is not a simple counterpart of zzso in zzso cells and that it has a unique role in the regulated zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
