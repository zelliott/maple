zzso analysis was used to establish the first two-dimensional protein map of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was grown in defined medium in the presence and absence of the zzso zzso Over 1,700 zzso proteins were zzso representing about zzso of the estimated zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells was done to reveal zzso displayed zzso The results showed that while the global expression pattern of proteins was largely zzso by the treatment, four zzso proteins were zzso The four zzso proteins and 20 zzso expressed proteins were subjected to sequence analysis to provide internal standards for the construction of a two-dimensional zzso protein data zzso The identity of 12 zzso including zzso and zzso was zzso zzso was present throughout the growth of the cells but was diminished in amount in stationary phase cells whereas zzso was not detected in the later stages of zzso Two of the induced proteins zzso did not match any known zzso gene product, with one of these being present in zzso log and stationary phase cells and possessing four consecutive His zzso at the zzso sequencing was successful with 100 to 200 zzso of zzso zzso analysis provides a sensitive new tool to examine zzso zzso
