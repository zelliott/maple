zzso functional, and clinical analyses strongly suggest that zzso segment zzso contains a gene involved in lung cancer zzso The critical region of zzso loss is 310 zzso in zzso We used our zzso of zzso artificial zzso zzso clones together with newly identified bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones and the draft human zzso sequence to complete a zzso string of 380 407 zzso Three zzso clones that span the region were used to identify transcripts by zzso zzso zzso gene prediction zzso were used to query the sequence for potential genes and zzso zzso for expression was performed with zzso and cell line derived zzso zzso The region contains the complete zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A cluster of six nearly identical genes with an intact open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso that share zzso identity with the zzso gene was zzso In addition, five putative novel genes were zzso zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso markers were used to screen 117 lung cancer cell lines for zzso deletions and none were zzso These data provide the basis for the identification of a lung cancer zzso gene on zzso
