The zzso zzso of zzso gas zzso cells of the European zzso zzso zzso was isolated and used for zzso zzso Using a pair of zzso zzso zzso directed towards the evolutionary highly zzso central part of the B zzso of zzso type zzso zzso a zzso of 388 zzso was zzso By sequencing the cloned zzso products two different zzso with a sequence identity of about zzso were zzso zzso searches revealed a high degree of similarity of both to zzso B zzso of other zzso The sequences were completed by performing rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso subsequent zzso and sequencing of the obtained zzso The expression of two different zzso of the zzso B zzso is already demonstrated for Homo sapiens and zzso zzso This is the first report that attributes the same phenomenon to a zzso species, zzso zzso The first zzso found in zzso zzso shows the highest degree of zzso acid sequence zzso with the human brain zzso zzso the second one zzso with the B zzso sequence of rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso and kidney zzso zzso The alignment of the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso shows that the highest sequence variation between these two zzso is found at the zzso where zzso is nine zzso acids shorter than zzso while at the zzso it is two zzso acids longer than zzso This has also been reported for the human and bovine kidney zzso when compared with the brain zzso Northern zzso analysis using specific zzso zzso revealed the expression of two zzso with lengths of about zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso For zzso it is well known that zzso containing the kidney zzso of the B zzso are responsible for the zzso of zzso across the plasma zzso of several cell zzso The fact that zzso zzso seems to share structural features with the kidney zzso in zzso supports the hypothesis that in gas zzso cells a zzso contributes to the zzso of the blood in the zzso
