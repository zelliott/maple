zzso and zzso are essential for cell division in zzso coli and zzso to the zzso zzso One approach to determine what regions of zzso and zzso are important for their interaction is to identify in zzso interactions between zzso and zzso from different zzso As a first step, the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and zzso In addition, an zzso zzso that shared the unusual zzso extension of zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso In order to zzso their zzso in cells, we zzso these proteins with green fluorescent protein zzso When zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was expressed at low levels in zzso coli, they specifically localized only to the zzso coli zzso ring, possibly by zzso When zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, they failed to zzso zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso However, when zzso zzso zzso was zzso with them, zzso localized to a band at the zzso division site, strongly suggesting that zzso from either zzso zzso or zzso zzso can bind directly to its zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso and zzso from either zzso zzso or zzso zzso localized to the division site in zzso zzso zzso zzso the 61 zzso acid changes between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not prevent their direct interaction with zzso from either species, suggesting that those zzso are not essential for zzso zzso Moreover, the failure of the two zzso coli zzso derivatives to interact strongly with zzso coli zzso in this in zzso system unless their zzso zzso was also present suggests that zzso interactions have zzso and that the zzso which differ between the zzso coli proteins and those of the two other species may be important for specific zzso
