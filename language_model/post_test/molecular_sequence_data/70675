The cell of origin of zzso zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso marginal zone zzso zzso and zzso cell leukemia zzso is zzso To better understand the relationship between these zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso sequences of the rearranged zzso heavy zzso chain variable zzso region of the zzso population of cells in five cases of zzso four cases of zzso and seven cases of zzso to determine whether these zzso could be differentiated by the degree of zzso zzso in the zzso V gene or by the zzso V gene family zzso DNA was extracted from diagnostic material and zzso confirmed by zzso The DNA was zzso using V heavy chain family specific zzso and the zzso were zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso V gene zzso and base changes were determined to be silent or to represent zzso acid replacements by using three different zzso Four of five zzso cases of zzso three of four zzso cases of zzso and three of seven zzso cases of zzso showed evidence of zzso selection, suggesting that these zzso involved zzso expansions of zzso center memory zzso Only zzso showed a preferential usage of zzso family zzso
