All kinetic indicators suggest that the zzso site of the zzso factor zzso is located in the flexible zzso region of the B chain and is centered about the zzso in position zzso zzso restraints of varying lengths were used to zzso zzso zzso to a narrow range of positions relative to the C zzso of the A zzso Total synthesis of zzso involving zzso zzso to zzso zzso assured us that none had a role in zzso zzso Even zzso zzso next to the important zzso can be replaced without deleterious zzso To fix the distance between the zzso end of the A chain and zzso zzso at predetermined zzso we zzso zzso with zzso zzso between a zzso which was placed in position zzso and the zzso group at the C zzso of the A chain zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso varied as a zzso function of length zzso the range of zzso A provided the closest approach to the binding zzso zzso zzso signaling activity, as determined by zzso zzso was reached only with a zzso zzso
