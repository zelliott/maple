A zzso of human protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso which had previously escaped identification in normal zzso zzso was isolated from rat liver as the zzso zzso zzso originally named zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and shown by zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso rat zzso sequence analyses to be structurally related to the zzso rat zzso zzso zzso N zzso and, even more closely zzso sequence zzso to the zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso myeloma zzso was used as the zzso template because of its relative abundance in zzso zzso compared with liver and other rat zzso The zzso properties of zzso in many respects resembled those of zzso zzso but were distinguished by more favorable zzso with several zzso zzso and greater sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was also activated by zzso particularly zzso and to a lesser extent by other zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso was most evident with zzso and zzso zzso zzso but only marginally evident with the favored zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso is the rat zzso of human zzso with zzso properties distinct from although overlapping those of the zzso zzso
