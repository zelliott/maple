zzso interactions are often zzso by small zzso that recognize zzso zzso zzso Deciphering the recognition code for these adapter zzso is an important step in the understanding of zzso zzso Here, we investigate the sequence requirements for the zzso domain, a zzso sequence binding module previously shown to be involved in T cell zzso We show that the signature zzso defines a preferred zzso motif that is present in several proteins of the zzso zzso Specifically, the core small nuclear zzso zzso contains several zzso motifs that interact with the zzso domain in zzso and in zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in the nucleus of zzso T cells and zzso cells suggests a function of the zzso domain of zzso in zzso zzso interactions within the zzso
