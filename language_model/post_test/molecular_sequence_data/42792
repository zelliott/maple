A solid phase zzso method has been zzso to investigate the effect of template DNA and other zzso present in zzso DNA sequencing reactions upon data quality in automated DNA sequence zzso The primer zzso is prepared with an internal zzso group and one of four fluorescent tags at the zzso zzso The zzso labeled DNA fragments produced in the sequencing reactions are separated from other reaction zzso including template DNA, using zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and other reaction components may then be added back to the zzso material to assess their effect upon sequence zzso It is found that band intensity and base calling accuracy are decreased by the presence of the template DNA and other reaction zzso
