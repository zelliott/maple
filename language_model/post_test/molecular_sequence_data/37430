zzso from zzso zzso type E is an zzso toxin zzso that zzso zzso which is lethal and zzso in zzso It is a zzso toxin composed of an zzso component zzso and a binding component zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we report on studies of the zzso relationship by the crystal structures of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso (at zzso A and zzso A resolution, zzso and zzso that map the active zzso The zzso zzso structure was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which is an zzso zzso except for the zzso loop zzso However, a significant structural difference could be seen in the zzso which interacts with zzso suggesting an evolutionary difference between zzso and zzso zzso The high resolution structure analysis revealed specific zzso zzso (a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, the zzso study showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso including a newly identified one, are essential for zzso zzso zzso At least one zzso zzso is an essential zzso for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso the structural feature and these zzso findings suggest that the zzso mechanism of zzso proceeds via an zzso zzso
