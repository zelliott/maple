zzso a complex of six zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso that is assembled at zzso zzso replication origins during zzso zzso It is also believed to be the zzso zzso at growing zzso To zzso the action of zzso during the transition from initiation to zzso zzso we have focused our studies on zzso a replication initiation protein that physically interacts with members of the zzso zzso We show that zzso is a zzso protein that mediates the association of the zzso complex with replication zzso Furthermore, diminished interaction between zzso and zzso a zzso of the zzso complex, by a zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso replication zzso Surprisingly, a double zzso containing both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso restores interaction between zzso and zzso and zzso all of the defects exhibited by each of the single zzso including the zzso of replication zzso at replication origins typically seen in zzso zzso This mutual compensation of defects between two independently isolated zzso is zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso like zzso is a critical component of the zzso zzso and that interaction between zzso and zzso is required for proper replication initiation and prompt release of zzso zzso
