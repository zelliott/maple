zzso zzso zzso possesses a prominent ability to repair the DNA injury induced by various zzso agents including zzso C zzso ultraviolet light zzso and zzso zzso DNA damage resistance was restored in zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso by transforming with zzso of four zzso clones derived from the gene library of strain zzso which showed wild type zzso zzso to zzso zzso Gene affected by zzso zzso or zzso in both zzso was cloned and its zzso zzso sequence was zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequence of the gene product consists of zzso zzso and shares zzso with many bacterial zzso zzso The zzso sites of both zzso were identified by analyzing the zzso chain reaction zzso fragments derived from the zzso DNA of the zzso A zzso pair zzso deletion including the start zzso for the zzso gene was observed in DNA of the zzso zzso causing a zzso in the zzso On the other hand, an zzso sequence zzso element intervened in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso suggesting the zzso zzso of the zzso The IS element comprises zzso long, flanked by zzso zzso terminal repeats zzso and generated a zzso target zzso zzso Two open reading frames zzso were found in the IS zzso The deduced zzso sequences of large and small zzso show zzso to a putative zzso found in zzso of zzso coli zzso and to a zzso found in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first discovery of IS element in zzso and the IS element was designated zzso
