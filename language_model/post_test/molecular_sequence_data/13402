zzso is a T cell protein zzso zzso zzso that, along with zzso and zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in B zzso zzso To determine whether zzso has an analogous role in T zzso we used gene targeting to prepare mice lacking expression of zzso Such animals had decreased numbers of mature zzso an effect most clearly observed in mice expressing T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice had reduced zzso responses to zzso zzso stimulation and to zzso zzso but responded normally to stimulation with zzso zzso plus zzso or with zzso These results provide genetic evidence that zzso is involved in T cell development and also suggest that zzso has an important role in zzso events in zzso signaling zzso
