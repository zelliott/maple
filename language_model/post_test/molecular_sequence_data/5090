Genes for the zzso zzso dense zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso were expressed at high levels in the closely related zzso zzso zzso The protein products were processed appropriately and were targeted to their correct zzso zzso zzso 3 was zzso into the zzso zzso The utility of this system was demonstrated in the analysis of a new open reading frame identified upstream of two identical copies of the zzso zzso The unknown open reading frame was introduced into zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso with zzso to known zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso expressed a novel 52 zzso zzso designated zzso which localized in the zzso These results illustrate that zzso of known zzso genes into zzso zzso can be used to study their zzso processing and targeting in an zzso distinct zzso They also illustrate the usefulness of zzso zzso zzso in the identification and zzso distribution of proteins zzso by previously zzso zzso zzso
