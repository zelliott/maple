zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso have shown that zzso acid zzso A zzso gene on zzso 17 is juxtaposed to the zzso gene on zzso zzso This results in a zzso zzso zzso Our work has demonstrated that the zzso zzso in zzso patients are clustered in two limited regions, zzso and zzso separated from each other by about 10 zzso DNA sequence of zzso and primary structure of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso in a patient have been determined in this zzso Compared to those of two previously reported cases abroad, we found that the zzso may be situated in the zzso II zzso zzso A working model has been proposed for the mechanism of DNA illegitimate zzso in zzso zzso
