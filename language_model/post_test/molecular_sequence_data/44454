zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses the gene for zzso however, the zzso zzso are sparse and have not been previously isolated and zzso We zzso zzso from strain zzso to zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso viewed by electron zzso revealed that the zzso were identical in diameter to zzso of other zzso zzso zzso such as zzso but were shorter in zzso On sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis, the apparent molecular weight of isolated zzso from strain zzso was found to be identical to that of the zzso zzso of strain zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso under reducing condition, exhibited a zzso structure on zzso at room zzso However, under zzso conditions, even at 100 degrees C, no zzso was zzso In zzso analysis as well as zzso labeling of isolated zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso as well as zzso against zzso I zzso and zzso J zzso zzso However, zzso zzso against strain zzso reacted very zzso compared to zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso of whole zzso cells, as well as zzso electron zzso with zzso I and zzso J, showed zzso shorter in length and very few in number compared to those of strain zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso acid composition was very similar to that of previously reported zzso of the zzso zzso
