The ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso is acutely and independently regulated by zzso zzso and zzso pH zzso whereas the closely related zzso of the red cell and zzso zzso cell is relatively zzso We have investigated the contribution of zzso charged zzso within the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso to regulation by pH through zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange was measured as zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso by varying zzso at constant zzso and by varying zzso at zzso zzso All zzso of zzso charged zzso of the zzso zzso yielded functional zzso but zzso of some zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced or abolished zzso Individual zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited reduced zzso sensitivity compared to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso In addition, zzso sensitivity was significantly zzso shifted when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were individually converted to the corresponding zzso zzso These results demonstrate that multiple zzso charged zzso are important for zzso transport function of zzso and that certain zzso charged zzso of the zzso zzso are essential for zzso regulation of zzso exchange by zzso and zzso
