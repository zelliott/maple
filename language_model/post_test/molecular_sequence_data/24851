zzso editing of zzso zzso zzso zzso is directed by small guide zzso zzso Using zzso techniques, we have previously shown that the zzso base pairs to the zzso via a zzso anchor, whereas its 3' zzso interacts with upstream zzso zzso zzso The incorporation of zzso data into zzso folding programs produced similar structure predictions for all zzso pairs zzso This suggests that zzso pairs can form common secondary structure motifs that may be important for recognition by the editing zzso In this study, the structure of zzso zzso zzso to zzso was examined using zzso zzso The zzso zzso molecules are efficient zzso for zzso zzso In addition, when the zzso zzso is performed in the presence or absence of additional zzso the activities of both the zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso can be zzso These results indicate that a partial editing complex can assemble and function on these zzso suggesting that the zzso captured the molecules in a biologically relevant zzso The structure probing data directly show that the zzso protects several zzso bases predicted to be involved in the zzso zzso In combination with our previous studies, these new data provide additional support for the predicted secondary structure of interacting zzso zzso
