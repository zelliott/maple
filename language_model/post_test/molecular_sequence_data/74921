zzso clones were prepared from zzso zzso isolated from a population enriched in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A series of clones was zzso at random and two partial sequences corresponding to the zzso coding and 3' untranslated region of the chicken zzso zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso coding region zzso to the sequence previously described at the protein level for the chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso To study the expression of this zzso zzso zzso was prepared from chicken zzso at different stages of development, zzso in zzso gels, transferred to a nylon zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Two populations of zzso of sizes ranging between zzso and 465 bases are expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine if there was a differential expression of the two populations of zzso in the final zzso zzso stages of zzso zzso was zzso from adult zzso cells separated at unit gravity according to their differences in size by the zzso zzso The zzso was similarly analyzed by Northern zzso The results indicate that round zzso are enriched in the zzso zzso species, whereas in the final stage of zzso zzso the zzso species is the only one present, suggesting either zzso processing, the presence of two different sets of genes that are zzso zzso or a single set of genes with differential promoter zzso
