To investigate the expression of zzso an zzso zzso zzso identified in the retinal zzso zzso zzso in retinal zzso zzso 

The zzso protein levels in mouse zzso and bovine zzso were examined by Western zzso analysis using a zzso zzso against zzso The cellular zzso in the zzso was determined by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso a cell line derived from rat zzso cells, was determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso were performed using zzso from zzso zzso The generation of zzso retinal from zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso 

zzso retinal G zzso zzso zzso and zzso all had higher expression levels in the zzso of zzso than in zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso was also detected at lower levels in the zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso was localized in zzso cells in retinal zzso zzso was detected in zzso cells, at both the zzso and protein zzso The rat zzso zzso containing the full-length coding region was cloned from zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids and shares zzso sequence identity with human, zzso and mouse zzso at the zzso acid zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in the zzso zzso zzso was shown to be the preferred zzso which is identical with the zzso preference of the zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed in retinal zzso cells, in addition to the zzso zzso generates zzso zzso which is the zzso for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
