zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso Previously we have isolated an attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso gene was zzso In the present study, we investigated the expression and the role of zzso locus genes in zzso zzso zzso using a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the fully virulent zzso zzso We show that in zzso zzso zzso expression is controlled from elements residing within the upstream genes zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is the only factor zzso from the zzso locus that is essential for zzso zzso zzso A zzso deletion of the zzso gene sequence resulted in a drastic reduction in zzso to an zzso of at least zzso zzso for subcutaneous and airway routes of zzso The zzso was unable to colonize mouse zzso following zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso indicates that zzso is involved in cell zzso however, deletion of zzso did not affect in zzso growth zzso zzso experiments with the zzso zzso zzso gene restored zzso and all other zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of the zzso zzso could protect animals against zzso and primary zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso factor essential for the development of zzso and zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso is superior to the zzso zzso live vaccine strain in zzso and in zzso effective protective zzso Thus it could serve as a basis for a very potent live vaccine against zzso and zzso zzso
