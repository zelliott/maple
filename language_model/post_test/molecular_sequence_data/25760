The coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a moderately zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso was assembled in a zzso expression zzso The coding sequence possesses unique zzso and zzso sites which flank 243 zzso of the zzso gene that include all point zzso thus far linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso were made from this zzso by cassette zzso using zzso fragments from the corresponding cloned zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli, albeit at low zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso upon gel zzso and zzso upon affinity and zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicated that the zzso was a zzso with identical zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso sequencing gave 10 zzso acids which perfectly matched the sequence predicted from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso affinity zzso followed by zzso Q zzso The zzso properties of zzso toward the zzso zzso zzso show that the point zzso are the molecular basis of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
