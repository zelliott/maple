zzso is a zzso factor required for the expression of competence genes in zzso zzso zzso to zzso targets zzso for degradation by the zzso zzso zzso therefore acts as an adapter protein recruiting a regulatory protein for zzso However, when zzso is zzso zzso is released from binding by zzso and thereby protected from zzso zzso binds to three protein partners during these zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using limited zzso we have defined zzso and zzso structural zzso of zzso and evaluated the interactions of these zzso with the protein partners of zzso Using surface zzso zzso we have determined that the zzso domain of zzso interacts with zzso and zzso and the zzso domain with zzso zzso is shown to exist as a zzso with zzso sites on both the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain stimulates the zzso activity of zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso while the zzso domain is inactive in both of these zzso In zzso data were consistent with these findings, as zzso expression was decreased in a strain zzso the zzso domain, indicating reduced zzso zzso We propose a model in which binding of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso a zzso change enabling the zzso domain to bind zzso with enhanced zzso zzso is widespread among zzso organisms and may act generally as an adapter zzso targeting proteins for regulated zzso
