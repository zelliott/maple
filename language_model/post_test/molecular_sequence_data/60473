zzso technology is currently applied to several animal species of agricultural or medical importance, such as fish, zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the repertoire of genetic tools used for molecular analyses of mice and zzso is not always zzso to other zzso For example, while zzso zzso experiments in mice can be based on embryonic stem zzso cell technology, this is not currently an option with other zzso Similarly, the zzso transformation of zzso depends on the use of the zzso zzso which does not jump in other zzso This article analyses the main characteristics of zzso zzso zzso examines some of the factors that have contributed to their evolutionary success, and describes their potential, as well as their limitations, for zzso and zzso zzso in diverse zzso
