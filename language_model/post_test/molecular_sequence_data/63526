zzso decorations dictate protein functions and thus have crucial importance in life zzso Previously zzso analysis was mainly focused on the analysis of the liberated zzso allowing detailed zzso but lacking zzso zzso Analysis of intact zzso required zzso zzso and manual interpretation of zzso We developed an approach where zzso of native zzso were analyzed with tandem mass zzso and the zzso were analyzed with automated in zzso zzso The latter included combination of the original zzso generation of a human zzso library, matching the zzso zzso to the theoretical zzso fragments, scoring the zzso predicting the zzso zzso which were then matched against the observed zzso statistical validation of the results with zzso zzso and finally the calculation of zzso zzso We verified this approach with the 150 zzso zzso zzso where we automatically generated zzso putative interpretations from zzso theoretical zzso After scoring 62 zzso zzso obtained validated interpretation with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso compositions, and zzso When applying this method to an unknown mixture of human plasma zzso we identified 80 zzso with their zzso compositions or zzso Instead of weeks and months of interpretation work of mass zzso files our automated zzso can be executed in few hours and provide information zzso from both the zzso acid and zzso zzso of intact zzso in zzso No advanced zzso skills were needed to use these zzso and tested zzso In case users want to add complexity to the analysis they are allowed to alter all parameters and rebuild the zzso
