The influence of the two zzso and two zzso zzso of mast cell zzso zzso zzso in activity and binding was studied by replacing these zzso acids in the zzso sequence with zzso Their zzso releasing activity was determined on rat zzso mast zzso Their binding affinity to the zzso binding zzso of the human mast cell zzso zzso was carried out using zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed that replacement of zzso by Ala o zzso without loss of activity compared with the activity of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso resulted in an approximately 40 fold increase, and for zzso in a zzso increase in zzso activity of zzso The binding affinities of the zzso were tested by competitive displacement of bound fluorescent zzso zzso from the zzso binding protein of the mast cell zzso by the Ala zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso (for zzso and zzso (for zzso showed the same binding affinities as zzso whereas analog zzso (for zzso and analog zzso (for zzso showed slightly better binding affinity than the parent zzso This study showed that the introduction of zzso zzso in these positions resulted in zzso zzso of diverse zzso These findings will be useful in further zzso zzso zzso
