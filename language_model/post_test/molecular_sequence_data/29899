The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that is directed into the zzso zzso pathway, where it is highly zzso probably through addition of zzso zzso zzso Gene disruption of the zzso locus leads to a zzso reduced level of cell wall zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso isolated from a strain with a zzso disruption zzso showed that it had an altered structure with a smaller average zzso zzso zzso in two other zzso zzso and zzso also lead to a zzso in cell wall zzso production and appear to be zzso to zzso These findings outline a possible zzso of assembly of zzso cell wall zzso
