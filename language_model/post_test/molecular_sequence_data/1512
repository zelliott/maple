zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso designated zzso is zzso and then zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso % by zzso The prepared zzso samples zzso are diluted to various zzso and zzso for 10 days before zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso When concentration zzso is above zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso systems have weak zzso zzso zzso However, for zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso systems behave as power law zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which are attributed to the moderate zzso degree of zzso zzso Furthermore, a critical overlap zzso of zzso zzso zzso is determined for zzso in zzso solutions, which is close to that of 1 for intact zzso in water while far smaller than that of zzso for zzso in zzso This is considered to be due to the strong interactions of zzso chains in water, further confirmed by the intrinsic zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso solution shows an zzso large value of zzso zzso Regarding the structure of zzso weak gels, zzso of dynamic strain sweep zzso suggest that the dominant structures are zzso formed by zzso associations of zzso chains rather than the permanent three-dimensional zzso In addition, the zzso rate tests are performed to study the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso
