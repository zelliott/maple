The widespread zzso of zzso by microbes is reflected in the diversity and zzso of cellular zzso used to acquire these compounds from the zzso The model zzso zzso coli has numerous zzso that allow it to take up zzso and zzso which recognize the more abundant zzso forms of these zzso Here we report the zzso and structural characterization of a zzso protein zzso from zzso coli that forms part of an zzso ABC zzso zzso Remarkably the crystal structure of this zzso solved to zzso A using zzso zzso revealed that zzso binds a single zzso of zzso in its zzso binding zzso Selective binding of zzso over zzso was also observed using zzso methods that determined the form of the sugar released from the zzso The pattern of expression of the zzso zzso zzso this zzso mirrors that of the high affinity zzso zzso of zzso coli, suggesting that this zzso has evolved complementary zzso that enable it to use all the available zzso present during carbon limiting zzso
