The expression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is positively regulated by the zzso locus which encodes a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso sensor zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso alone, is not expressed in zzso coli, but the introduction of the zzso locus in trans can restore zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have isolated, in zzso coli, partially zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso have been localized to the upstream region of the zzso promoter at position zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso initiation zzso In the absence of the zzso zzso the strength of the zzso promoters was 15 and 200 times higher than the zzso promoter in the absence of the zzso zzso The expression of these zzso promoters was still enhanced by the presence of the zzso zzso
