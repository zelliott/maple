zzso plays an essential role in the zzso zzso repair zzso of zzso We compare 37 zzso of sequence from the zzso region on human zzso zzso to the zzso region on mouse zzso zzso In addition to showing the zzso gene structure between zzso zzso and their zzso counterparts, this zzso comparison reveals a highly zzso 497 zzso segment found 5 zzso upstream of zzso zzso 1 that contains a zzso island and previously unidentified zzso promoter zzso Additional putative regulatory elements are also found within a zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso sequence 800 zzso upstream of zzso 1 in both human and zzso zzso sequence tag zzso zzso for human zzso identified numerous zzso zzso involving zzso 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 that could affect DNA repair efficiencies of zzso A previously zzso transcript that reads through zzso 9 and zzso the zzso signal of a neighboring zzso element accounts for nearly half of the total zzso zzso identified in the human zzso zzso This transcript would theoretically translate to a larger zzso protein product containing a novel zzso zzso Overall, approximately zzso of publicly available zzso zzso sequences were determined to be zzso zzso while no zzso were found in the zzso The ability to assess novel transcripts and identify candidate regulatory regions demonstrates the potential utility for a zzso zzso comparative analyses for all genes involved in DNA zzso Our comparative zzso analysis of zzso can be viewed at zzso
