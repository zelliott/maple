zzso zzso are zzso complexes that zzso zzso peptides molecules by the zzso zzso zzso of the known sequences of zzso zzso led us to the identification of a 350 zzso acids domain zzso zzso and containing the motif zzso This motif is present as many times as zzso or zzso reactions occur during zzso of the zzso The distance between this motif and the zzso attachment site is nearly zzso An identical motif is found in other zzso zzso zzso transfer such as zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso Altogether, the zzso motif may constitute the signature of a zzso sharing a common zzso mechanism based on the zzso properties of the second zzso for zzso zzso transfer or zzso zzso
