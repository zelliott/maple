The extent of internal hydrogen exchange zzso within multiply charged zzso protein zzso was investigated using a small model zzso The zzso backbone zzso protection data were obtained using protein zzso fragmentation in the gas phase and compared with the available zzso zzso Only minimal scrambling was detected when relatively zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso intact protein zzso while low-energy fragmentation resulted in more significant but not random internal zzso Increased zzso flexibility of protein zzso in the gas phase did not have any effect on the extent of hydrogen scrambling under the conditions of zzso zzso zzso but resulted in totally random zzso of zzso hydrogen atoms when the protein zzso fragmentation was induced by multiple low-energy zzso
