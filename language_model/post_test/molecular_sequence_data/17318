The zzso gene encodes an evolutionary zzso zzso factor that is involved in the determination of the zzso cell lineage during the development of zzso In the zzso period, the function of zzso is ultimately required for the zzso of muscle satellite zzso The fact that zzso is expressed in fast zzso zzso zzso and in zzso satellite cells of adults raised the question whether different zzso protein zzso may have distinct roles in these zzso zzso Previously, we identified a human zzso zzso zzso a zzso which did not show any sequence similarity to the zzso proteins of other zzso So far, there was no further information available concerning the biological nature and significance of this form of zzso Here, we show that expression of zzso can be regulated by differential zzso termination either in zzso 9 or in zzso zzso zzso differential zzso zzso and zzso of zzso may result in production of two alternative protein forms that contain or exclude the evolutionary zzso zzso domain, zzso The existence of both protein zzso in zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso These data imply that the alternative zzso of zzso may convey different functions to the corresponding protein zzso
