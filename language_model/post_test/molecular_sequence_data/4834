zzso is the most zzso of the major zzso complex classical class I zzso This zzso is mainly in zzso 2 and 3, which code for the zzso alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso and include the zzso zzso binding zzso Recent studies have indicated that not only zzso but also the zzso 2 region may be involved in the generation of certain zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso To study the degree of zzso 2 participation and the mechanisms that generate zzso at the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 sequences from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups of zzso were zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso shows zzso 1 and 2 sequences identical to those found in all zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso show the same zzso 1 and 2 sequences and their zzso 1 is the same as that found in the zzso zzso This suggests that B5 and zzso groups of zzso may have arisen from a common zzso All known zzso zzso show the same zzso 1 and 2, with the exception of zzso and zzso and all zzso zzso also bear the same zzso 1 and 2, with the exception of zzso zzso at zzso 1 is more restricted than at zzso 2, and the use of zzso 1 for zzso zzso zzso analysis is better for grouping zzso of a zzso common zzso In conclusion, there is a remarkable conservation of zzso sequences within related zzso zzso which probably reflects a common origin and perhaps a selective force avoiding DNA zzso zzso sequences are also potentially useful to design DNA typing zzso
