Although zzso zzso have been described in the United States since the early part of this century, North American strains of sheep zzso remain relatively zzso at the molecular zzso The zzso of a North American zzso zzso zzso was found to be closely related at the molecular and functional levels to zzso virus, the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed high identity to other zzso and zzso zzso in key regulatory elements of the upstream promoter region zzso to zzso However, the R region of the zzso was much less zzso zzso control of zzso in transient zzso zzso required a zzso putative zzso region and possibly an zzso like element in the upstream promoter region for moderate to high levels of transcription, much like zzso zzso In contrast to zzso virus, the downstream region beyond the zzso start site was required for zzso zzso
