We have developed zzso against the zzso zzso and have investigated its cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated against zzso zzso of the rat brain zzso zzso They were very specific to the zzso site as shown by zzso against various zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors and by zzso of proteins from bacteria zzso with rat brain zzso zzso zzso and from rat zzso zzso how zzso zzso receptors are distributed in the rat spinal zzso made it possible to identify the cellular structures on which zzso receptors are located and where they form zzso with SP zzso In the superficial layers of the zzso horn, the zzso receptors appeared mainly of zzso nature and were, like SP, zzso In the deep layers of the zzso horn and in the zzso horn, they were associated mostly with cell zzso
