We have isolated novel zzso steroid zzso transcripts zzso to zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso from the freshwater snail Marisa zzso zzso zzso binding analyses showed that neither zzso zzso protein specifically bound zzso over the range applied zzso zzso These novel zzso transcripts have thus been designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso to be expressed zzso throughout a range of male and female structures zzso including neural and zzso zzso zzso absolute levels were seen in the male zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also expressed zzso throughout all male and female zzso analyzed here, with very low absolute transcript numbers in female accessory sex structures compared to other zzso
