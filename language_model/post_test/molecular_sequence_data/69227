Different zzso features of the upstream regulatory regions of the two pea genes zzso and zzso have been derived using a theoretical method, developed in our laboratory a few years ago, which evaluates the DNA distortion energy from a zzso of the zzso of the 16 possible zzso from the standard B zzso The theoretical analysis, which predicts different zzso of the regulatory regions of the two zzso is in zzso good agreement with experimental evaluations from gel zzso mobility and zzso zzso suggesting a possible model to explain the largely different zzso efficiencies of the two zzso
