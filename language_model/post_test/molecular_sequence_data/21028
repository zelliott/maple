The zzso zzso in the zzso database were collected into a single zzso set and examined for actual versus theoretical zzso zzso We found a highly diversified degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed only once in the protein world, whereas 103 zzso occur more than 50,000 zzso Moreover, it seems that zzso potentially possible zzso are not present in the protein zzso On the whole, tracing the zzso profile of the protein world as a function of zzso zzso reveals a zzso curve, with tails representing scarcely and repeatedly occurring zzso Analysis of zzso parameters shows that zzso number is the main factor influencing and favoring specific zzso zzso in the universal zzso zzso That is, when compared to the set of zzso zzso the zzso frequently represented in the universal zzso are endowed with a higher number of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso degree and the zzso level play a smaller zzso zzso the heat of formation of zzso appears to have the least zzso
