Previously, the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene was reported to begin at a zzso site, 141 zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso and zzso Gene 31 (1984) zzso We have extended the sequence of the zzso untranslated region of the gene to a zzso site at zzso zzso We demonstrate by primer extension analysis that zzso of the gene zzso at one major point 180 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso Since the zzso zzso extending from the zzso site to the start zzso has been used in many studies as the promoter for zzso zzso and Beach, zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso Carr et zzso zzso zzso zzso 218 (1989) zzso Gould and zzso Nature zzso (1989) zzso we investigated the strength of this promoter element relative to the zzso early promoter, a promoter known to work very well in zzso zzso zzso et zzso Cell 53 (1988) zzso We confirm that the zzso gene zzso has significant promoting activity, albeit zzso to zzso less than the zzso early promoter, when zzso in zzso zzso
