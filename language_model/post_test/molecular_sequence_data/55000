zzso zzso zzso elements from zzso are widely used as zzso zzso and gene isolation tools in plants and more recently also in zzso and zzso They are particularly valuable for plant species that are zzso and have long generation cycles or large zzso with low gene zzso zzso zzso zzso vary widely, however, and in some species they are too low for large-scale zzso We discovered a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso more frequent Ds zzso than the zzso zzso whereas the zzso frequency of excised Ds elements is unchanged zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in plants, zzso zzso Ds zzso zzso into coding regions and to genetically linked sites, but the zzso protein apparently has lost the weak bias of the zzso protein for zzso sites with elevated zzso content and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso also in zzso zzso where it effects a more than zzso increase in Ds zzso relative to zzso zzso and thus may be useful to facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso
