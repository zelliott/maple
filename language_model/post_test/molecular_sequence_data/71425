The first study by zzso of the integral membrane zzso the bacterial zzso zzso antenna protein zzso zzso is zzso The zzso apparatus of purple bacteria contains two different kinds of antenna complexes zzso and zzso which consist of two small integral membrane proteins alpha and zzso each of approximately 6 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso We have zzso the antenna zzso zzso beta from zzso zzso and have recorded CD zzso and a series of two-dimensional zzso zzso A comparison of CD zzso of zzso beta observed in organic zzso and zzso zzso shows that the zzso character of the zzso does not change appreciably between the two zzso A significantly zzso shifted zzso signal was observed both in organic zzso and in zzso zzso zzso that a similar three-dimensional structure is present in each zzso However, the zzso signals observed in organic zzso had a zzso line zzso and better resolution, and it is shown that in this case organic zzso provide a better medium for zzso studies than zzso zzso A sequential assignment has been carried out on the zzso zzso region, which is the region in which the zzso is zzso The region is shown to have a zzso structure by the chemical shift values of the zzso zzso and the presence of nuclear zzso effects characteristic of zzso An analysis of the zzso zzso chemical shifts of the zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso suggests that the local structure is well ordered even in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso Its structure was determined from 348 zzso constraints by using distance geometry zzso The zzso contains an zzso extending from zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso is bent, as expected from the zzso zzso chemical shifts, and it is similar to the zzso fold of the previously determined crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso Prince et zzso Journal of zzso Biology, 1997, zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso of this region may facilitate assembly of the zzso zzso
