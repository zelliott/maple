zzso disease zzso comprises a clinically and genetically zzso group of zzso Two major types can be distinguished based on zzso zzso CMT type 1 zzso displays zzso decreased nerve zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso zzso and CMT type 2 zzso displays normal or zzso nerve zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso zzso disease type zzso zzso is the most common form, exhibiting zzso dominant inheritance and linkage to zzso zzso This review will focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to zzso DNA zzso of a zzso region is associated with zzso in the majority of zzso A defined zzso DNA zzso that zzso with a disease in a dominant zzso pattern had been zzso A candidate gene for zzso zzso which maps within the zzso and encodes a zzso zzso was identified from studies on the zzso and zzso mouse models for zzso Point zzso in zzso have since been identified in cases of zzso zzso zzso The genetic data presents two alternative molecular mechanisms involving the zzso gene that result in the same clinical and zzso zzso of zzso The impact of the underlying molecular mechanisms on the prospects for therapeutic development are zzso
