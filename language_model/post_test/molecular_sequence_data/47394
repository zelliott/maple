We showed previously that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso of the gastrointestinal zzso tract and sporadically in breast zzso To investigate whether zzso gene expression is zzso specific, we used in zzso zzso to show that zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso zzso of human zzso We also used Northern analysis to study human breast cells and found zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cell lines as well as freshly isolated normal breast zzso zzso Because we identified three putative zzso acid response elements zzso in the zzso zzso we examined the regulation of the zzso gene expression by zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Without zzso zzso cells had very low levels of zzso zzso and a low level of zzso zzso zzso activity (17 zzso zzso whereas zzso cells had a high level of zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso zzso level 3- to zzso and resulted in a fourfold increase of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso level nor zzso activity was increased in zzso zzso These results show that the zzso gene is expressed in both breast and zzso zzso cells, and suggest that its expression can be highly regulated by zzso acid, a known differentiation zzso
