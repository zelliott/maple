zzso a member of the scavenger zzso family, is centrally involved in the zzso of oxidized low density zzso zzso from the zzso During the zzso process, the zzso cargo of zzso accumulates in zzso and smooth muscle cells zzso inducing their pathological conversion to foam zzso Increased expression of zzso occurs in human zzso zzso and zzso knockout mice show reduced zzso of modified zzso and reduced zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso zzso and extended zzso promoter in human zzso zzso zzso is specifically transcribed in activated zzso zzso and mainly expressed in zzso zzso Thus, switching to zzso zzso zzso may be an important step for the zzso of zzso and their conversion to foam zzso Using an zzso zzso to zzso zzso we inhibit zzso translation and highly reduce zzso zzso The zzso to zzso zzso does not affect zzso in cell lines not expressing the new zzso The possibility of a novel zzso therapy and the use of zzso zzso as a marker of zzso are zzso
