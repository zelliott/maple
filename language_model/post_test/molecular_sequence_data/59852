zzso of zzso zzso to genetic zzso of zzso or its zzso and to normal zzso isolated from the same zzso carriers was studied by a kinetic dialysis technique at zzso zzso The first zzso association constant for binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Roma zzso was increased to zzso and zzso respectively compared with that for binding to normal zzso whereas the constant for zzso zzso zzso was decreased to zzso In contrast, normal zzso properties were found for as many as nine other zzso zzso with single zzso acid zzso Because the net charges of all these zzso were different from that of normal zzso the results suggest that the examples of modified zzso binding are not caused by long-range zzso zzso Rather, the three positions mentioned are located close to different binding sites for the fatty acid zzso The most pronounced effect was observed for the zzso zzso zzso the binding constant of which was decreased to zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was also zzso but to a smaller extent zzso These decreases in binding are caused by partial or total blocking of the zzso site by the zzso by the negative charges of the zzso and/or by zzso changes induced by these bulky zzso zzso binding to two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was normal, indicating that the zzso of zzso is not important for zzso By using different preparations of normal zzso as controls in the binding experiments, it was also possible to compare the effect of various methods for isolation and zzso on zzso zzso
