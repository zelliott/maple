Using the unique sequence organization of zzso defective interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso zzso were zzso amplified and zzso without having to separate them from their helper zzso zzso The cloning was designed so that zzso zzso zzso of the plasmids would generate zzso zzso with the exact zzso and 3' zzso The zzso zzso zzso transcribed from the zzso in zzso cells using zzso zzso produced by a zzso virus zzso was zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso proteins expressed from cloned zzso Such experiments open the possibility of examining the zzso sequences involved in viral zzso directly, without using indirect markers such as zzso zzso
