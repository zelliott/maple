zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso are regulators of alternative zzso Human zzso is a key factor in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a muscle wasting disease caused by the occurrence of toxic zzso molecules containing zzso zzso zzso binds to these zzso and is zzso in nuclear zzso preventing it from exerting its normal function, which ultimately leads to zzso zzso a major cause of the zzso zzso bind to zzso via zzso zinc fingers of the zzso zzso These zinc fingers are arranged in one zzso or two zzso tandem zinc finger zzso motifs with both fingers targeting zzso steps in the zzso zzso Here I show that zzso genes in zzso and in other insects also zzso proteins with two zzso zzso highly similar to zzso zzso zzso In zzso the different protein zzso have overlapping but possibly divergent functions in zzso evident by their unequal capacities to rescue the zzso defects observed in zzso zzso zzso In addition, using whole zzso analysis, I identified several new zzso targets for zzso in zzso zzso Two of these novel targets, zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are not zzso but expressed mainly in zzso cells, indicating a function for zzso not only in muscles and the nervous zzso
