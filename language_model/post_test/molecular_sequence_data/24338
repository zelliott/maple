zzso of the general zzso acid zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulting in the inability to grow on zzso as sole nitrogen zzso zzso for zzso zzso that restored growth on zzso led to isolation of 21 zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso One similar zzso was found in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso acid, while none of the zzso zzso had lost the ability to transport zzso zzso specificity seemed to remain narrow in most cases, and broad zzso specificity was only observed in the cases where zzso affect two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are both zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found zzso affecting six predicted zzso zzso III and X, and zzso 1, 2, 6 and 7) of the zzso zzso III and loop 7 are candidates for zzso in direct contact with zzso zzso zzso zzso III was affected in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and has previously been found to be important for zzso preference in other members of the zzso Furthermore, the zzso affecting loop 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso are close to a zzso side chain zzso potentially interacting with the positively charged zzso a notion supported by conservation of the side chain in zzso for zzso zzso
