zzso zzso is one of the four zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso which form the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, a new gene zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso protein from rice zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso was cloned through zzso from zzso rice zzso This gene zzso a protein of 136 zzso acid zzso that were similar to some plant zzso zzso proteins reported zzso However, the zzso sequence of zzso and other rice zzso genes were zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein with other plant zzso zzso proteins revealed that three zzso acid zzso zzso 88, and zzso were markedly different between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression analysis of zzso revealed that zzso gene was zzso by salt stress in rice roots and zzso treatment in zzso The potential role of zzso during salt stress was zzso
