The zzso group I zzso was broken into four fragments, zzso zzso long, that can zzso into zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso The fragments have no activity individually yet can cooperate through base pairing and zzso interactions to produce stable trans complexes at 48 degrees zzso These complexes can then catalyze a sequence of zzso zzso reactions utilizing other zzso as zzso assembling zzso versions of the zzso Up to zzso of the original fragments are converted into approximately 200 zzso products in 8 zzso Assembly occurs primarily by only one of many possible zzso and the reaction is driven in the correct and forward direction by the burial of key zzso regions in stems after zzso zzso and hence zzso is zzso by a reaction rate increase upon doping the reaction with full-length zzso
