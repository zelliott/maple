A novel zzso strain zzso was isolated from a marine zzso sample collected from zzso Bay, zzso zzso Growth occurred on zzso medium 2 containing zzso % zzso and at pH zzso and zzso degrees zzso The cell wall of strain zzso contained the zzso zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one unknown zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of the isolate had similarities of zzso and zzso % with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, showing that the novel strain should be assigned to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the two zzso zzso species showed zzso and zzso % zzso zzso Moreover, the three strains differed in some zzso and zzso zzso Thus, on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso
