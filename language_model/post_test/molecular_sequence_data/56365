All of the coronavirus defective interfering zzso zzso analyzed thus far contain an open reading frame zzso from which zzso zzso zzso are zzso although the function of the zzso protein and the significance of the zzso are not zzso A complete zzso clone of a mouse zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a single zzso deletion in the zzso region of the zzso was obtained and zzso Due to this single zzso zzso a zzso protein of zzso was made from zzso in contrast to the zzso protein made from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was efficiently zzso after zzso into zzso zzso However, after one passage of zzso zzso virus, the zzso zzso protein was zzso indicating that the large zzso was restored during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso from infected cells demonstrated that in approximately half of the zzso zzso population, the zzso was restored by zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and helper virus zzso zzso The sequences of other zzso zzso contained an additional zzso A at the zzso sequence nine zzso upstream of the deletion site, resulting in a stretch of six consecutive zzso In these zzso zzso zzso the original zzso deletion was maintained and no zzso zzso was zzso This zzso produced an zzso of the same size as the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso with a large zzso has a selective zzso There was no significant difference in replication efficiency among these zzso when they zzso zzso However, zzso of two zzso zzso species and time course experiments suggested that zzso interference and other zzso during the early stage of virus zzso are responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso containing the large zzso
