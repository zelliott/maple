zzso acid sequences of zzso involved in interaction with zzso were determined by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overlapping zzso representing the entire sequence of zzso were zzso on a zzso zzso The membrane was blocked with zzso and incubated with zzso zzso zzso the membrane with zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso to interact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso more strongly with zzso than the zzso sequence of zzso zzso of one of the zzso peptides zzso to zzso was also confirmed by gel zzso studies and zzso zzso The zzso sequences involved in interaction with zzso were distinct from the zzso sites reported earlier as binding of the zzso sequence from zzso zzso does not alter the zzso function of zzso To identify the critical zzso involved in interaction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were made and tested for their ability to interact with zzso The zzso size and zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso increased the zzso content of the zzso While the zzso zzso showed zzso activity similar to zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies showed that the zzso zzso decreased the rate of zzso exchange with zzso by zzso whereas the zzso zzso reduced the exchange rate by zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso with zzso and zzso for interaction with zzso Thus, our studies showed that the zzso sequence zzso is one of the interacting regions in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
