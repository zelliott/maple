Through previous large-scale gene expression profiling we identified a transcript that was abundant in normal stomach and zzso in gastric zzso Genes expressed at similar levels included zzso zzso and zzso which are important in gastric zzso We aimed to zzso this candidate, zzso 1 zzso at zzso DNA, protein and tissue zzso The gene was studied in human, zzso rat and zzso and was highly zzso across these zzso The zzso transcripts averaged 750 zzso in zzso The human, mouse and rat genes all contained six zzso spanning 6 zzso and were located on zzso 2, 6 and 4 zzso The full-length translation products were zzso zzso acids long, reducing to the mature protein of 18 zzso following signal zzso zzso these predictions were confirmed by Western zzso zzso zzso 1 yielded zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso representing the zzso apparatus, in keeping with zzso or expression on the zzso zzso Gene expression in zzso was zzso extensively by Northern zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 was highly expressed in normal stomach, where it was located in the zzso gastric zzso but was absent from gastric zzso zzso the stomach, zzso 1 was found only in zzso showing gastric zzso zzso Barrett's zzso the zzso cell lineage and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have zzso zzso 1, previously known as zzso zzso or zzso Its abundance in, and specificity for, native or zzso gastric zzso zzso in gastric zzso and evolutionary conservation suggest that this gene is zzso important in the zzso The function of zzso 1 is unknown but a role in zzso protection is zzso
