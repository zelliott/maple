The dogma of strict maternal inheritance of zzso is now being tested with population zzso methods on sequence data from many zzso In this study we investigated whether zzso occurs in the zzso of the blue zzso ( zzso zzso by studying zzso in the zzso control region and in a recently identified zzso zzso on the W zzso The female zzso of avian sex zzso allows a test of whether zzso zzso affects zzso zzso by comparison of zzso and zzso sequence zzso There is no zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in blue zzso consistent with no zzso We also analyzed zzso sequence variation in both blue zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso zzso using a zzso approach which accounts for zzso zzso in neither bird species did we find evidence of zzso We conclude that it is unlikely that zzso zzso has large effects on zzso genetic zzso in zzso
