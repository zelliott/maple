During spore zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show limited zzso development in the absence of a host plant zzso In the presence of root zzso they switch to a new zzso stage zzso characterized by extensive zzso zzso zzso branching of the AM fungus zzso zzso was induced in liquid medium by a zzso zzso fraction from carrot zzso zzso root organ zzso Changes in zzso zzso patterns were monitored by differential display zzso zzso appearing zzso fragments were cloned and further zzso Five zzso fragments could be identified that show induced zzso zzso 1 h after the addition of root zzso zzso similarities of two fragments to zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes suggested that root zzso could influence zzso respiratory zzso To support this hypothesis, additional putative zzso zzso were shown to be induced by root zzso These genes were identified after zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso for the zzso zzso was studied in more detail by cloning a zzso and by zzso its zzso zzso The hypothesis that respiratory activity of AM zzso is zzso by root zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso analyses in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consumption and reducing activity of both zzso was induced after 3 and 2 h of zzso with the root factor, respectively, and the first zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso after approximately 90 zzso In addition, changes in zzso zzso orientation, and overall biomass were detected in zzso zzso after 4 zzso In zzso the zzso factor rapidly zzso the expression of certain zzso genes and, in turn, zzso respiratory activity before intense zzso This defines the zzso switch from zzso to zzso first by gene zzso zzso zzso subsequently on the zzso level zzso zzso and finally as a zzso response (after 5 zzso
