zzso are a family of zzso proteins that function as zzso cues directing zzso growth and cell migration during neural zzso zzso or zzso zzso the fourth member of this family, was previously reported by Koch zzso Koch, zzso zzso zzso Hunter, zzso Olson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A novel member of the zzso family, zzso shares zzso with the beta chain of zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso Cell zzso 151 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Miner, Identification and expression of mouse zzso zzso zzso 96 zzso zzso zzso However, whether there is another zzso of zzso and the expression patterns have not been fully zzso Here we report the cloning of a novel zzso of human zzso using rapid amplification of complementary DNA zzso ends zzso technique and analysis on the zzso zzso expression in adult rat brain using in zzso zzso The new zzso lacks the signal zzso region and might represent a truncated form at the zzso terminal domain of human zzso zzso of the expression pattern of zzso zzso in adult rat brain revealed that the zzso zzso was widely expressed in many regions of the zzso High levels of zzso zzso was found in the zzso cell layer of the cerebral cortex, zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso layer of zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso nucleus and zzso zzso nucleus, zzso nucleus of the trapezoid body and zzso cell layer of the zzso zzso zzso signals were present in frontal cortex, several zzso and zzso zzso The widespread expression of zzso in adult rat brain indicates that zzso is not only important for zzso guidance during embryonic development, but also critical to zzso plasticity in adult zzso
