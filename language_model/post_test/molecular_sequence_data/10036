Here we report the use of zzso to expose complementary DNA between an insert and zzso such that zzso becomes independent of restriction site zzso We demonstrate that unusual and, in some cases, previously impossible cloning strategies can be readily and efficiently achieved as long as the zzso sequences of the linear zzso are highly zzso Furthermore, we show that the bacterial repair system resolves the residual zzso zzso or gaps in a predictable fashion to generate zzso zzso This approach zzso cloning regardless of restriction site zzso and overcomes an important limitation in current cloning zzso
