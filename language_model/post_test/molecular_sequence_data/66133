The plant cell wall is a complex network of zzso The diversity in the linkage types connecting all zzso within these zzso would need a large set of zzso to catalyze their zzso Development of a methodology that would allow monitoring of zzso activities in an easy and zzso manner would help assign zzso functions, and understand their roles in building this complex zzso A zzso method was zzso for testing zzso involved in plant wall zzso using an zzso involved in zzso zzso The method is simple, sensitive, and easy to implement in any zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a series of zzso were immobilized on a zzso zzso glass zzso The slide with the attached zzso was then used to estimate the incorporation of zzso onto zzso zzso and zzso zzso incorporation is revealed with a standard zzso zzso after exposure of the zzso to a zzso screen and zzso The method proved to be sensitive enough to detect as low as 45 zzso zzso zzso of small zzso zzso was required for optimal zzso zzso The zzso was also used to monitor and estimate zzso zzso activity in zzso crude extracts from pea zzso that are known to contain this zzso zzso Our data indicate that the methodology can be used for efficient and rapid monitoring of zzso activities involved in plant wall zzso zzso
