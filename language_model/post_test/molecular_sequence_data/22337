The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is isolated from zzso zzso Using gel zzso zzso we defined the zzso 97 zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso zzso as the minimal structured zzso zzso zzso This region contains a typical zzso zzso motif and a zzso extension of 40 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso binds to a zzso DNA duplex containing a single repeat of an zzso zzso DNA sequence zzso in a zzso complex, with a zzso approximately zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso examination revealed that the solution structure of zzso is a novel zzso zzso rather than the zzso bundle structure found in typical zzso motifs and other zzso zzso of the zzso DNA duplex to zzso induced significant chemical shift zzso of protein zzso zzso which suggests that zzso 3 zzso and the flexible loop connecting zzso and zzso are essential for zzso DNA sequence zzso Furthermore, similar to that in zzso the zzso arm likely contributes to or zzso DNA zzso zzso comparisons suggested that the zzso structure and the involvement of the loop zzso in DNA binding may be features unique to plant zzso
