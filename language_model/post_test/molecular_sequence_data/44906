An approach towards the identification at the protein level of the zzso proteins zzso by the zzso zzso of broad bean zzso zzso has been zzso After zzso zzso treatment of isolated zzso a fraction enriched in zzso zzso was obtained by successive zzso first onto a zzso zzso and then in a zzso zzso zzso translation products were zzso in isolated zzso with zzso and added to the enriched zzso zzso proteins before separation by two-dimensional gel zzso Six spots, identified both by zzso blue zzso and zzso were zzso by protein zzso Two of these were shown to zzso to zzso proteins zzso and zzso We conclude that these two proteins are zzso by the zzso zzso of broad bean and that the method described here can be used to identify other proteins zzso by the zzso zzso
