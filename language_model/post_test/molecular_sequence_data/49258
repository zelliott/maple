In an effort to understand the molecular basis of chronic zzso disease zzso a study of the chemical relationship between zzso zzso and the major zzso complex II, zzso was zzso A zzso model of the zzso protein was zzso An analysis of the sequences of zzso and zzso zzso most common among zzso patients revealed several zzso rich regions in the zzso zzso These regions contain many hard Lewis base sites that may provide bonding opportunities for zzso a hard Lewis zzso zzso chemistry calculations and structural database results support the presence of zzso zzso bridged by zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso in the zzso binding zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso clusters are an integral part of the zzso and may even act solely as zzso This work provides an initial model for thinking about zzso interactions with proteins relevant to zzso and other zzso zzso
