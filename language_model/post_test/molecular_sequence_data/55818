The process for optimal zzso zzso requires not only engagement of the zzso zzso complex, but also the delivery of additional zzso signals that zzso with the primary response zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, the regulated expression of zzso for such zzso molecules can be critical in determining whether a cell can effectively activate T cells following the presentation of a foreign zzso The zzso zzso has recently been shown to mediate such zzso signals by interacting with the zzso zzso expressed on activated B cells and zzso We show in this study that activated zzso both in zzso and in zzso display a zzso in expression between B7 and zzso based on differential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso cells in the zzso are zzso with the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso These zzso positive cells fail to express zzso B7 zzso zzso by Northern zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso bind specifically to zzso zzso cells, and this binding is inhibited by zzso and zzso but not B7 zzso These studies zzso 1) that the zzso against zzso binds a functional zzso on a zzso distinct from B7 as detected on activated zzso in zzso and in zzso and 2) that zzso in skin and zzso cells in zzso can express zzso molecules that might mediate zzso zzso via zzso
