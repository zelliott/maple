The gene zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso zzso gene occurs as a single copy within the zzso and encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is flanked at both the zzso and 3' ends by regions of A + zzso zzso and the zzso region contains a promoter zzso zzso zzso has a unique and remarkable organization of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibits a strong similarity to typical zzso zzso zzso in terms of overall secondary structure, while the primary sequence is zzso to a lesser zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene indicated that the DNA sequence including the zzso zzso gene is highly zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
