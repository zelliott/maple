Fifteen zzso of zzso acid bacteria originating from South African grape and wine samples were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso analysis of their zzso zzso gene zzso These zzso were further tested for the presence of genes coding for zzso of zzso relevance using zzso detection zzso A type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also incorporated for comparative zzso From the zzso detection results, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were present in all the strains zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were not detected in some zzso On the other hand, none of the tested strains possessed the genes zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso fragments was performed by zzso zzso database was used to search for zzso DNA zzso zzso trees based on zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were also constructed in order to study the zzso relationship between zzso zzso strains and closely related zzso The zzso analyses revealed that there are genetic zzso between strains of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this study has improved our knowledge on the zzso of zzso strains of zzso zzso and their genetic potential to contribute to certain wine aroma zzso
