The objective of this study was to identify and characterize other proteins than zzso proteins potentially involved in zzso zzso 20 zzso to cellulose using an zzso zzso preparation zzso zzso zzso From protein zzso of zzso zzso 20 grown on zzso the serum recognized at least 10 zzso proteins zzso among which zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5, 9 and zzso of zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by a zzso zzso In strain 20, zzso and zzso were identified as two major zzso and as bacterial zzso zzso The zzso serum was also shown to target the zzso family 37 zzso module zzso of zzso and zzso indicating that this zzso unique to zzso zzso may play a significant role in bacterial zzso to cellulose as suggested previously for zzso zzso zzso Overall, our results support the hypothesis of an zzso mechanism involving the zzso of zzso and zzso This zzso mechanism may not be restricted to these two zzso but may also involve other zzso proteins such as zzso and the other zzso proteins recognized by the zzso zzso
