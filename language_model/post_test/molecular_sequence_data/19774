In the zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso properties are sensed and regulated by two interface zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are of similar structure, as many soluble zzso but are sensitive to zzso charge and zzso stress zzso zzso and zzso sequence analyses show that such interface zzso in relation to soluble ones of similar fold, are characterized by high zzso charge, certain distances between small and zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso surface contents of zzso pairs and zzso indicate different zzso zzso A predicted potential zzso binding zzso from zzso was structurally verified by solution zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was induced by a zzso as well as zzso zzso environment, and the zzso was confined to the zzso zzso zzso affinity of the zzso analyzed by surface zzso zzso was higher than that for soluble zzso zzso and rose with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was supported by phase zzso in membrane zzso zzso analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso An zzso potentially binding zzso has a similar location in the structurally determined zzso coli cell wall precursor zzso zzso These two zzso have little sequence conservation in zzso and zzso zzso but maintain their zzso zzso The evolutionary modification of the zzso binding zzso and its location close to the zzso zzso site imply a functional importance in zzso zzso potentially providing a mechanism by which zzso synthesis will be sensitive to membrane surface charge and intrinsic zzso zzso
