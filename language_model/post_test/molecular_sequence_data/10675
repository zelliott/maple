The preparation of synthetic molecules showing the remarkable efficiencies characteristic of natural zzso zzso remains a formidable challenge for chemical zzso Although significant advances have been made in the understanding of protein structure and function, the de zzso construction of such systems remains zzso zzso natural zzso and zzso zzso possessing tailored binding pockets with appropriately positioned functional groups, have been successful in zzso a number of chemical zzso sometimes with impressive zzso But efforts to produce wholly synthetic zzso peptides have typically resulted in compounds with questionable structural stability, let alone zzso Here we describe a zzso synthetic zzso based on the zzso structural zzso which efficiently zzso the zzso of two shorter zzso fragments with high zzso and zzso Depending on the zzso used, we observe rate enhancements of tenfold to zzso over the background, with zzso efficiencies in excess of zzso These results augur well for the rational design of functional zzso
