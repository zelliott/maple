Water zzso a group of zzso bugs adapted to life on the water surface, have evolved zzso zzso that are long relative to their zzso zzso This novel zzso ground plan is a derived feature among insects, where zzso function as zzso and zzso as zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso is known to increase zzso size in a variety of zzso Using gene expression and zzso analysis, we discovered that zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso but zzso functions to zzso zzso and to shorten zzso in the water zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso insects, zzso has evolved a new expression domain but maintained its ancestral zzso function in zzso whereas zzso has maintained its ancestral expression domain but evolved a new zzso function in zzso These changes in zzso expression and function may have been a key event in the evolution of the distinct zzso ground plan in water zzso
