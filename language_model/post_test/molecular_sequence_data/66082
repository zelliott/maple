zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso is the zzso responsible for the formation of zzso III, the precursor of all cellular zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso genes have been cloned from many organisms, the level of sequence conservation between them is low, making sequence similarity searches zzso As an alternative approach to identify the zzso gene from plants, we used functional zzso since this does not require conservation of primary zzso A zzso of zzso zzso was constructed in which the zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso This zzso was transformed with an zzso zzso zzso library in a zzso expression zzso and two colonies were obtained that could grow in the absence of zzso The rescuing plasmids zzso an zzso zzso reading zzso of 321 zzso acids which, when zzso into an zzso coli expression zzso was able to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso defective in zzso Final proof that the zzso zzso zzso came from the fact that the zzso protein expressed with an zzso zzso was found to have zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the human zzso found that the seven zzso zzso previously identified were zzso including three shown to be important for zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso search of the protein database with zzso identified the human crystal zzso zzso has an zzso extension compared with zzso from other organisms, suggesting that this might act as a targeting zzso The precursor protein of 34 zzso translated in zzso was imported into isolated zzso and processed to the mature size of 29 zzso zzso zzso of plant cells zzso expressing a fusion protein of zzso with zzso zzso fluorescent zzso confirmed that zzso was targeted exclusively to zzso in zzso
