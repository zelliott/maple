zzso crest zzso cells are the main contributors to zzso cartilage and zzso tissue of the zzso zzso These zzso cells also give rise to the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso To study the molecular basis of neural crest zzso we have cloned the gene disrupted in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which affects all neural crest zzso Using a zzso candidate cloning approach we identified an A to G transition within the 3' zzso site of the sixth zzso of the zzso gene that zzso the last zzso zzso the crucial protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso crest induction and zzso are not hindered in zzso zzso zzso as revealed by normal expression of early neural crest specific genes such as zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the initial stages of zzso neural crest migration appear zzso while at a later phase the zzso zzso in zzso arches two to seven fail to express their typical set of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the cell number of zzso and zzso derivatives of neural crest is greatly reduced, suggesting that zzso is required for their normal zzso By tracing the fate of neural crest zzso in live zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that at 24 zzso neural crest cells migrate normally in the first zzso arch while the zzso and zzso neural crest cells begin migration but fail to descend to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Orange zzso revealed that in the absence of zzso a subset of neural crest cells are unable to undergo terminal differentiation and die by zzso Furthermore, surviving neural crest cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso normally and later differentiate to individual zzso Our results indicate that zzso is essential to turn on the normal zzso program in arches zzso and in trunk neural zzso Thus, zzso does not appear to be involved in early zzso and cell proliferation of neural zzso but it is a key regulator of an early differentiation phase and is required for cell survival in neural crest derived cell zzso
