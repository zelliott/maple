A zzso zzso zzso that reacted specifically with a 16 zzso big liver and zzso disease virus zzso protein was used to identify the protein in western zzso of infected liver extracts and enable partial zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso Based on this zzso a zzso primer was designed that was used in conjunction with random zzso in a reverse zzso zzso zzso to amplify a 523 zzso product from zzso extracted from zzso of zzso zzso There was zzso zzso sequence identity between this sequence and the sequence of the zzso gene of human zzso E virus zzso zzso zzso designed from this 523 zzso zzso were able to amplify a zzso zzso product from zzso of zzso chickens but not chickens from zzso zzso
