zzso is an earthworm zzso zzso that we previously isolated from the whole body of a zzso earthworm zzso zzso We have reported that zzso zzso zzso behaviors in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso when it is injected into the respective zzso The present study was undertaken to probe zzso functions of zzso zzso peptides with special reference to zzso and zzso events in which zzso peptides of this zzso are zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso and two analog zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared for their activities to induce zzso behavior and to change body weight as a measure of water balance in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso caused both zzso behavior and reduction of body weight in the animals, but zzso induced zzso Furthermore, leeches in the zzso season responded to peptides less conspicuously than those in the breeding zzso Such a zzso induction of zzso behavior and zzso reduction suggests that these two phenomena are zzso and might be accounted for by the fact that zzso in leeches and zzso is accompanied by zzso of a large quantity of zzso which should significantly contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
