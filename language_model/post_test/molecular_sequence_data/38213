The zzso system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of zzso in the immune zzso To characterize the zzso system in zzso monkeys that are commonly used as experimental zzso we cloned and zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence consists of 331 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The zzso zzso motif of zzso zzso is highly zzso to that of humans zzso whereas the zzso death domain has a relatively low similarity to that of humans zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso induced zzso in human zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to trigger zzso in the zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso consisting mostly of zzso zzso region and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso region underwent zzso upon exposure to zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso monkey cell line was highly sensitive to zzso These findings suggest that the lack of zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso in the human cell line might be related to the zzso structure of zzso especially of the death zzso
