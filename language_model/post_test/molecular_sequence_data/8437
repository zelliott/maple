zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso It has recently been shown that zzso zzso mediates zzso interactions when expressed in insect zzso In this study, we have examined how zzso zzso may function as a cell contact zzso in mink lung zzso cells, which express zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso has a relatively short zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso into two zzso associated zzso with both zzso and zzso molecules being present on the cell surface zzso at a zzso zzso shedding of the zzso zzso is observed in zzso growing zzso zzso analysis reveals that surface expression of zzso is restricted to regions of tight zzso zzso zzso surface expression increases significantly with increasing cell zzso This zzso zzso of zzso zzso is independent of its zzso activity and is also observed when zzso is driven by a zzso promoter, indicating that zzso of zzso surface expression occurs zzso Based on our results, we propose the following model of zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso newly zzso zzso zzso molecules are rapidly cleared from the cell zzso zzso contact causes zzso to be trapped at the surface through zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso at zzso contact zzso This zzso zzso of zzso may then lead to zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso
