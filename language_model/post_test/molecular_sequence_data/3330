A full-length zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso library using a zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis showed that the deduced protein contained a zzso zzso and a possible nuclear zzso signal zzso There was no identical proteins in the database we zzso but it shared high sequence zzso with zzso from zzso zzso and two other open reading frames zzso of unknown function from zzso zzso and zzso zzso These together defined a new family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which might play a role as a zzso factor in the regulation of gene zzso Southern and Northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso was a single copy gene and the zzso of zzso was obviously different in leaves, stems and roots in zzso
