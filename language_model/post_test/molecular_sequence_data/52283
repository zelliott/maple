Based on the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso primer zzso were zzso and used in zzso chain reaction with the bacterial zzso DNA as a zzso A zzso DNA zzso of the appropriate size was zzso and used as a probe for screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One positive clone carrying an insert of about 630 base pairs encompassing the entire zzso zzso gene was isolated and found to contain a zzso pair open reading frame between an initiation zzso (19 base pairs downstream from the zzso site, subsequent to a zzso zzso and two consecutive stop zzso followed by an zzso zzso A zzso in a partial zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows excellent agreement with the quantitative zzso acid analysis and a perfect match with the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso It reveals that the zzso zzso zzso contains 121 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso central zzso core between two zzso zzso Secondary structure zzso predict that it is rich in beta sheets and contains several highly zzso zzso but no signal zzso In the zzso region a potential zzso site zzso was zzso Comparative analyses of this zzso sequence with those of zzso from other sources, reported in the protein and gene data banks, did not reveal any extensive zzso
