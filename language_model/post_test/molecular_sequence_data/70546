The zzso analog zzso zzso is a zzso agent that is also known to induce zzso in zzso zzso In this study, the zzso potential of this drug was tested in the zzso and zzso transgenic Chinese zzso cell lines, which have a single bacterial zzso gene integrated into the zzso at different sites, with its expression driven by a zzso virus 40 zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso following a zzso exposure to different zzso of zzso were 10 to 20 times higher than those of any of the other numerous zzso that have been tested in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso were much higher in the zzso cell line than in the zzso zzso zzso molecular analysis of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso by de zzso DNA zzso and increased zzso zzso in the zzso promoter was the major factor responsible for this high level of zzso zzso As would be expected, exposure to zzso lowered the overall zzso DNA zzso levels, but it unexpectedly caused zzso and increased zzso zzso of the zzso in both the zzso and zzso cell zzso These results provide the first evidence that zzso may also induce zzso DNA zzso a phenomenon that can further be used for the zzso of the mechanism that controls zzso of foreign zzso
