Progressive zzso and fragmentation of elastic fibers are characteristic hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso which is caused by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 6 zzso Because of the great clinical zzso of zzso secondary genetic risk factors are suspected to zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso 1; previously zzso zzso promoter zzso are associated with zzso 

We screened an approximately zzso region spanning the theoretical promoter of the zzso gene for sequence variations by zzso zzso and direct sequencing in 93 zzso zzso zzso variations with a prevalence zzso were zzso in 93 zzso and zzso healthy zzso zzso and zzso association analyses were performed using Fisher exact test, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso screening revealed 9 different sequence zzso Three zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly more frequent in zzso patients than in 93 zzso and zzso healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso The odds ratios zzso zzso for zzso among carriers of the 3 zzso were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of 6 zzso promoter zzso revealed 1 zzso to be significantly reduced among zzso patients zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in the zzso promoter are secondary genetic risk factors contributing to zzso zzso
