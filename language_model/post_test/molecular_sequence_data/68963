The skin zzso of zzso provide a window into the zzso events involved in the human immune response to zzso T cells are thought to play a vital role in the zzso of different forms of the zzso To identify zzso specific T cell zzso in zzso zzso the zzso chain repertoire was simultaneously studied in skin biopsy specimens and zzso from both zzso resistant zzso zzso and susceptible zzso zzso zzso This was accomplished by obtaining zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso and performing the zzso chain zzso We found that zzso gene zzso V beta zzso through V beta zzso zzso beta zzso were zzso overrepresented in zzso vs zzso of seven of nine zzso patients but only one of nine zzso zzso Similarly, V beta zzso zzso were zzso in four of nine zzso patients, but none of the nine zzso zzso To explore the influence of the zzso region 3 zzso in selection of T cells expressing V beta 6 zzso we zzso the V beta zzso beta zzso chain reaction products derived from the zzso and zzso of two zzso zzso From the analysis of deduced zzso acid zzso we found zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid motifs in the zzso region of the zzso sequences from each zzso Our data suggest that the nominal zzso select T cells bearing V beta 6 zzso in the zzso immune response to zzso zzso
