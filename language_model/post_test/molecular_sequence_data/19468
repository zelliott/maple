Various zzso are available for predicting zzso expression and modeling gene regulatory zzso They differ in whether they rely on the existence of zzso of zzso genes or build a model that applies to all zzso whether they represent regulatory activities as hidden variables or as zzso levels, and whether they implicitly or explicitly model the complex zzso logic of multiple interacting zzso factors binding the same zzso The fact that functional zzso data of different types reflect the same molecular processes provides a natural strategy for zzso zzso zzso One promising avenue toward an accurate and comprehensive model of gene regulation combines zzso modeling of the interactions among zzso DNA, and zzso with the use of large-scale functional zzso data to estimate regulatory network connectivity and activity zzso As the ability of these models to represent complex zzso logic increases, the need for approaches based on zzso conservation may zzso
