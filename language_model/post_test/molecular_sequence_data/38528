The zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces toxins that are essential for zzso of the fungus on tomato zzso zzso zzso toxins and zzso of the unrelated fungus zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso which cause zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and are toxic for some plant species and zzso cell zzso zzso can be zzso in the proliferation or death of zzso We investigated the tomato zzso stem zzso zzso zzso which mediates resistance to zzso zzso Until now, zzso resistance of plants has been associated with zzso and altered affinity or absence of the toxin zzso Here we show that SAM resistance of tomato is determined by zzso a gene zzso to the zzso longevity assurance gene zzso and that zzso is associated with a zzso zzso Because both zzso synthesis and zzso facilitate zzso of zzso proteins in zzso we propose a role for zzso in a salvage mechanism of zzso plant zzso
