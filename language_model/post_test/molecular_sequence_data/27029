The zzso status of a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of a zzso was investigated using a zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that the novel isolate formed a distinct zzso line within the zzso zzso displaying zzso sequence divergence with other known zzso zzso The generic assignment was confirmed by zzso data, which revealed a fatty acid profile that included zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso with zzso as the major fatty zzso A zzso with eight zzso units zzso was the zzso respiratory zzso and zzso was the zzso zzso The novel isolate was distinguished from other members of the zzso zzso by using a set of zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso considerations, it is proposed that the new isolate represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type zzso
