During induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a signal from the anchor cell activates the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in the zzso precursor zzso We have characterized two mechanisms that limit the extent of zzso zzso First, we found that zzso may directly inhibit the zzso Ras signaling zzso We identified the zzso gene in a genetic screen for zzso of zzso zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a protein similar to zzso proteins that likely functions to inhibit the signaling activity of zzso zzso A zzso zzso in zzso suppresses the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso signaling pathway, but a zzso single zzso does not exhibit excess zzso zzso Second, we found that zzso zzso prevents zzso induction in a zzso manner, in addition to its zzso role in zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso Using genetic mosaic analysis, we show that zzso activity in the zzso precursor cell closest to the anchor cell zzso prevents induction of zzso precursor cells further away from the anchor cell zzso zzso and zzso This result suggests that zzso in zzso zzso precursor cells might bind and zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso thereby preventing diffusion of the zzso signal to zzso zzso precursor zzso
