The cloned zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso coli to a level of zzso of the soluble zzso This has allowed facile zzso and initial characterization of the zzso and it appears by all criteria to be a representative member of the zzso zzso zzso Most importantly, it shows the same exclusive zzso specificity for zzso over zzso characteristic of other zzso zzso examined to zzso The availability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso makes this zzso a good target for zzso studies and zzso inhibitor zzso
