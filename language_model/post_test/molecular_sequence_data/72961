zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated from a zzso DNA library constructed in the zzso fusion zzso zzso The zzso DNA fragments were identified in the surrogate host zzso zzso by expression of the zzso zzso reporter gene of zzso The expression signals exhibited a wide range of strengths, as indicated by their corresponding zzso zzso Eight clones were zzso and characterized zzso zzso open reading frames and zzso usage were identified by computer zzso Database searching for related sequences using the zzso method revealed no zzso zzso activity was measured by zzso zzso with zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analysis identified the zzso start sites within the cloned zzso The promoter regions characterized in this study were used to establish a consensus promoter sequence for zzso zzso zzso zzso consensus zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso approximately 35 and 10 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso do not zzso to the consensus zzso of zzso coli zzso
