The growth and function the normal prostate is dependent on the presence of zzso As prostate tumors progress there is a loss of zzso cell zzso The identification of the genes that are regulated by zzso may be of pathological and clinical zzso 

In this study the differential display method was used to identify genes regulated by zzso in an zzso prostate cancer cell line, zzso 

A gene whose expression is zzso in zzso cells after 30 zzso of zzso deprivation has been zzso This gene is a previously identified member of the zzso gene family of zzso zzso namely zzso Here we show that zzso expression is regulated by the synthetic zzso zzso but not by serum growth zzso It is zzso in the zzso prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso 

The data indicate that zzso may play a role in the zzso of prostate zzso
