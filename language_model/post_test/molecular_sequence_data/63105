The use of a zzso liver with pig liver cells in the treatment of zzso zzso failure has already begun as a clinical trial in several zzso zzso studies on plasma complement regulatory proteins of the pig are necessary, because the liver produces zzso zzso factor I is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso The DNA sequences of factor I have been reported in many species, with the noted exception of zzso In this study, zzso factor I was cloned and an open reading frame of zzso base pairs were zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence maintained a relatively high zzso compared to those of other zzso especially in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The cell zzso forms of the zzso and the human SP domain of factor I were zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso by these molecules was then tested, using several kinds of zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Both molecules had a suppressing effect on zzso human and dog zzso indicating little zzso Further studies of other plasma complement regulatory proteins produced from pig liver cells will need to be considered as the primary feature of the pig zzso zzso
