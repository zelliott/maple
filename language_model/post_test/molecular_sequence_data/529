zzso zzso zzso hundreds of zzso proteins zzso but zzso preferences for relatively few zzso have been well zzso Current techniques for determining zzso targets, including in zzso selection and zzso zzso require significant time and labor zzso Here we introduce zzso a method for the systematic analysis of zzso binding zzso that uses a single binding reaction to determine the relative preferences of zzso for short zzso that contain a complete range of zzso in structured and zzso zzso zzso We tested zzso by analyzing nine diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified expected and previously unknown zzso binding zzso Using in zzso and in zzso binding data, we demonstrate that preferences for individual zzso identified by zzso are a more accurate representation of binding activity than are conventional motif zzso We anticipate that zzso will be a valuable tool for the study of zzso zzso
