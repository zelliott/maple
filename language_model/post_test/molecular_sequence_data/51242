We have recently cloned a novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso from human leukemia cells showing zzso zzso We report here that the zzso tie zzso zzso zzso is present in all human fetal and mouse embryonic zzso By in zzso zzso the tie zzso was localized to the zzso of blood vessels and zzso of zzso to zzso mouse zzso However, tie was not expressed by zzso cells of developing zzso zzso Increased tie zzso signal was seen in zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso Only a weak tie signal was obtained from adult skin, except during wound healing, when the zzso zzso in the zzso tissue contained abundant tie zzso These results suggest that tie may have a role in zzso
