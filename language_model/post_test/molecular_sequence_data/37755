A putative promoter from the zzso vein zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by its ability to drive infection with full-length zzso of the zzso yellow mosaic zzso zzso zzso A high rate of infection was obtained with the zzso under control of the zzso promoter using particle zzso zzso The zzso promoter shows zzso zzso to the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter in the domain spanning the zzso motifs of zzso (at zzso and the zzso box (at zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso one-third of the putative promoter zzso zzso was sufficient to invoke full zzso with the zzso zzso and drove transient reporter gene expression in zzso and zzso transformed with a zzso plant transformation zzso zzso expression of a reporter gene zzso under control of the truncated zzso promoter was shown in transformed tobacco shoots in roots, leaves and zzso
