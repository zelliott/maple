The synaptic zzso complex is a highly stable zzso bundle that links the zzso and plasma zzso and plays an essential role in the zzso release of zzso and zzso An understanding has yet to be achieved of how this complex assembles and zzso structural transitions during zzso To investigate this question, we have zzso zzso within the zzso core of the zzso complex along the entire length of all four chains and examined the consequences using zzso to measure fusion pore opening and zzso zzso throughout the zzso complex reduced two distinct rate processes before fusion pore opening to different zzso These results suggest that two zzso fully assembled zzso of the zzso complex drive transitions leading to open fusion zzso In contrast, a smaller number of zzso that were scattered through the zzso complex but were somewhat concentrated in the zzso half stabilized open fusion zzso These results suggest that a structural transition within a partially zzso complex drives the zzso of open fusion zzso The dependence of these three rate processes on position within the zzso complex does not support zzso zzso complex zipping during zzso
