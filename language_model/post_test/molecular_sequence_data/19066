In this study, we present the discovery and characterization of a highly zzso zzso from zzso zzso infecting zzso strain zzso isolated from geothermal areas in zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene affiliated the strain with the species zzso zzso zzso analysis has allowed identification in the zzso of zzso zzso of an open reading frame zzso zzso in zzso coding for a zzso basic protein with an Mr of zzso zzso zzso does not resemble any known zzso zzso zzso zzso Instead, it has zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that form a zzso binding site characteristic of zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso recognition zzso which directly bind to, but also may zzso bacterial zzso The zzso zzso shows high zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and also, to a lesser extent, toward zzso zzso bacteria, zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Panama zzso The zzso has shown no activity against a number of zzso bacteria zzso with the exception of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be highly zzso it retains approximately zzso of its zzso activity after 6 h of incubation at zzso The optimum temperature range for the zzso activity is zzso to zzso The zzso exhibits zzso activity in the pH range of 6 to 10 zzso at pH zzso to zzso and is also active in the presence of up to 500 zzso zzso
