We have developed a combined real-time zzso and zzso zzso that successfully differentiated the vast majority of zzso and zzso bacteria when bacterial zzso were zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate this zzso on clinical specimens obtained from orthopedic zzso and to zzso compare the results of zzso Gram zzso with culture and conventional direct Gram zzso zzso surgical specimens were obtained from patients who underwent orthopedic surgery zzso The DNA was extracted and a set of zzso zzso zzso that targeted a part of the zzso zzso gene was used for zzso zzso The zzso were submitted for zzso and the resulting molecular Gram stain characteristics were zzso Culture and direct Gram zzso were performed using standard methods for all zzso zzso specimens were reviewed zzso for all cases that had a zzso between culture and molecular zzso There was an zzso zzso agreement between the traditional and molecular zzso In zzso zzso zzso cases of bacterial infection, molecular Gram stain characteristics were in agreement with the culture results, while the conventional Gram stain result was in agreement only for five cases zzso In the 31 culture negative cases, 27 cases were also zzso negative, whereas 4 were zzso zzso Three of these were characterized as gram negative and one as gram positive by this molecular zzso zzso determination of the Gram stain characteristics of bacteria that cause orthopedic infections may be zzso in most instances, by this zzso Further studies are necessary to understand the clinical importance of zzso zzso
