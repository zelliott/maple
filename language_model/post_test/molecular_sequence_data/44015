As part of an ongoing search for zzso zzso for zzso we tested 19 genes whose products are implicated in insulin zzso or action for linkage with zzso zzso included the zzso inwardly zzso zzso channels expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver and muscle forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1 beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we tested the zzso calcium locus zzso on zzso zzso All regions were tested for linkage with zzso markers in zzso individuals from zzso families with at least two patients with overt zzso zzso to World Health Organization zzso in the zzso using zzso zzso These zzso families comprise 352 possible affected zzso pairs with overt zzso or zzso possible affected zzso pairs defined as having a zzso plasma zzso value of zzso zzso or a zzso value of zzso zzso 2 h after oral zzso zzso No evidence for linkage was found with any of the 19 candidate genes and zzso in our population by zzso methods, suggesting that those genes are not major contributors to the zzso of zzso However, some evidence for suggestive linkage was found between a more severe form of zzso defined as overt zzso diagnosed before 45 years of age, and the zzso locus zzso P zzso zzso zzso of six additional markers spanning 27 zzso on zzso zzso confirmed the suggestive linkage in this zzso Whether an zzso zzso gene lies on zzso zzso in our population must be determined by further zzso
