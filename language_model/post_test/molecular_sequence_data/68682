The duration of long-term zzso in the zzso zzso of awake rats was examined following systematic manipulation of the number of stimulus trains zzso This was correlated with the induction of immediate early genes in separate groups of animals given identical stimulus zzso Following 10 trains of zzso long-term zzso decayed with a time constant of up to several days zzso zzso zzso and this correlated with the appearance of an increase in the zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso the number of stimulus trains resulted in a greater probability of zzso long-term zzso with a time constant of several weeks zzso zzso zzso as well as increasing the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When 10 trains were delivered repeatedly on up to five consecutive days, only the zzso protein levels showed associated zzso These data provide support for the hypothesis that long-term zzso 3 involves mechanisms additional to those for long-term zzso zzso One possible mechanism is altered gene zzso initiated by immediate early gene zzso factors such as zzso and possibly zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso family members, that then contributes to the stabilization or maintenance of long-term zzso zzso
