zzso zzso has a complex pattern of alternative zzso at the zzso zzso One of the alternatively spliced zzso zzso is prominently expressed during biological processes involving substantial cell migration and zzso such as embryonic development, zzso zzso and wound zzso To examine the function of the zzso segment, we zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso in zzso cells and compared their zzso activities using zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly more potent than zzso zzso in promoting cell spreading and cell migration, irrespective of the presence or absence of a second alternatively spliced segment, zzso The cell spreading activity of zzso zzso was not affected by zzso recognizing the zzso segment but was abolished by zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso and by zzso zzso indicating that the zzso segment enhanced the zzso activity of zzso by zzso the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso In support of this conclusion, zzso zzso zzso bound more avidly to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding by the zzso segment was, however, observed only in the context of the intact zzso zzso since the difference in zzso activity between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was abolished after limited zzso with zzso zzso with this zzso binding of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso fragment, consisting of the central zzso domain and the adjacent zzso domain zzso was not affected by zzso of the zzso zzso Since the zzso of an extra type III module such as zzso into an array of repeated type III zzso is expected to rotate the zzso up to 180 degrees at the position of the zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso may be globally altered upon zzso of the zzso segment, resulting in an increased exposure of the zzso motif in zzso module and/or local unfolding of the zzso Our results suggest that alternative zzso at the zzso zzso is a novel mechanism for zzso zzso affinity of zzso operating when enhanced migration and proliferation of cells are zzso
