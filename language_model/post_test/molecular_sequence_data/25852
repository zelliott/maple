The sequence of the zzso zzso of strain zzso of zzso zzso B of human respiratory zzso virus zzso was determined by sequencing cloned zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the corresponding sequence of the zzso strain of zzso A showed that there is zzso zzso sequence identity overall, that the zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein is zzso identical between zzso and that the zzso zzso of both zzso contains a second, zzso overlapping open reading frame zzso whose zzso zzso sequence and potential zzso start and stop sites were highly zzso and whose predicted product has zzso zzso acid identity between zzso zzso analysis of 36 zzso of zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso did not detect zzso insertions or deletions in the region of overlap between the two zzso indicating that the majority of zzso zzso zzso is a faithful copy containing the two distinct zzso zzso in zzso of zzso transcribed from engineered zzso showed that an zzso which contained only the second, internal zzso directed the synthesis of a previously unidentified zzso of the predicted size, whereas zzso representing the complete gene directed the synthesis of both the zzso protein and the product of the internal zzso This latter species was zzso in zzso as a zzso separate protein rather than as a fusion zzso It is not yet known whether this protein is zzso in zzso zzso
