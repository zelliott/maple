A wide variety of medically important zzso forming bacteria produce similar zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structures consist of partially zzso zzso zzso These zzso are key components of the bacterial zzso zzso Here, we describe the efficient synthesis of zzso zzso using an acid zzso reaction of zzso in zzso The zzso zzso produced by this reaction can be zzso to zzso by size exclusion zzso zzso was developed to zzso the zzso zzso to bovine serum zzso using a new zzso zzso containing a zzso and an zzso functional zzso These zzso may serve as useful precursors for the development of defined zzso vaccines against zzso producing bacterial zzso
