zzso zzso toxins zzso are potent zzso of several zzso zzso bacteria, including zzso coli, in which five types zzso to zzso have been identified so zzso zzso is frequently associated with zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and strains not fitting any established zzso In this study, we were the first to sequence and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso from an zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso strain of bovine zzso The zzso zzso is integrated in the place of the tin and old zzso immunity genes zzso the TO zzso of the zzso and the zzso itself is integrated into the bacterial zzso between the zzso genes zzso and zzso The presence of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso was investigated in a further five zzso bovine zzso coli zzso strains of various zzso three zzso zzso zzso four strains expressing other zzso of zzso and eight zzso zzso All but one zzso zzso zzso strain zzso carried all the investigated zzso regions of zzso zzso while the zzso zzso strains missed three regions and the zzso strains carried only a few zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso play a role in the dissemination of zzso between zzso coli zzso strains and that after integration into the bacterial zzso they adapted to the respective hosts and became zzso
