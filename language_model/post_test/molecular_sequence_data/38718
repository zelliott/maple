zzso reverse zzso is initiated by the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso from a cellular zzso partially zzso to the primer binding site in the zzso of viral zzso The zzso zzso has two zzso regions upstream of the primer binding zzso In contrast to zzso zzso no direct evidence of interactions with the zzso zzso loop of zzso has been described to zzso Here we address the question of the potential role of the interactions between these highly structured regions in the initiation of viral DNA zzso To evaluate this we used an zzso approach, first validated in our in zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso binding site (the upstream region zzso to the zzso primer binding zzso was determined in the presence of native zzso or synthetic zzso Using natural and chemically modified zzso zzso we found that interactions between the zzso of zzso and an zzso loop of viral zzso led to an important zzso of the zzso binding zzso this region became accessible to zzso binding site zzso in a cooperative zzso These studies allowed to identify an zzso region in zzso zzso capable of interacting with zzso Better knowledge of these interactions is very important for understanding the zzso positioning in the early steps of zzso reverse zzso
