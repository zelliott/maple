Alternative zzso generates various zzso zzso zzso of the cell surface that zzso different cell lineages and stages of zzso differentiation in the zzso zzso 4-6 are incorporated to generate a zzso zzso zzso and excluded from a zzso zzso zzso the other coding zzso (3 and zzso being zzso As a first step to understanding the mechanisms regulating zzso alternative zzso and thus determining zzso zzso a zzso representing zzso zzso was zzso into zzso T cells and B cells and into zzso L cells for comparison of zzso zzso We conclude that all the information required for faithful zzso selection according to cell type is contained within the resulting zzso The zzso pattern zzso by zzso L cells may represent a default and zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso to account for the selection of appropriate zzso and we provide support for this interpretation from analysis of fused hybrid zzso cells, which exhibited zzso specific zzso zzso zzso patterns were well zzso despite substantial disruption of zzso However, extensive deletion analyses suggested that zzso sequences zzso and within zzso 6 affect the exclusion of that zzso in T zzso
