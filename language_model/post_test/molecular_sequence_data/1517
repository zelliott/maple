Here, we describe a new muscle zzso domain zzso zzso and identify it as a novel target for the zzso finger protein zzso in the zzso zzso body wall zzso zzso animals have zzso muscle zzso and zzso filaments as a result of a failure to assemble normal muscle zzso zzso zzso is active downstream of zzso in the assembly pathways of the muscle dense body and zzso attachments, and upstream of zzso in the dense body assembly zzso The zzso zzso fusion construct is expressed in dense bodies, zzso and zzso cell boundaries as well as in muscle cell zzso zzso is partially zzso with zzso in muscle dense bodies and its expression and zzso are regulated by zzso zzso or a zzso domain deleted zzso zzso exhibit structural defects of the muscle attachment zzso Together, our data demonstrate that zzso constitutes an essential component of muscle zzso sites that is regulated by zzso
