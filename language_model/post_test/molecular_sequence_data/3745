In mouse zzso cells, zzso of the zzso gene zzso the alpha zzso of zzso which acts locally as a tumor zzso is zzso in tumors and in normal cells during zzso Previous studies suggested that regulation of zzso zzso involves the binding of a zzso to a repeat of the zzso motif in the zzso zzso screening identified a zzso zzso a protein that binds this zzso Of the zzso family, it is the mouse zzso of a human protein of unknown function, zzso The mouse zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in two interacting cell types of the zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso In zzso cells, it zzso with the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso nuclear zzso In transient and stable zzso zzso expression from a zzso promoter increased the expression of reporter genes driven by the zzso zzso In a zzso tumor cell line in which expression of both zzso and zzso was reduced, zzso of the latter restored the level of zzso while, zzso the cells reverted to normal growth control in zzso
