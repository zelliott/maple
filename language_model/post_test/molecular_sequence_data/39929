We previously demonstrated that oral application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso directed against zzso coli zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso but only at high zzso zzso We have now shown that a large portion of the orally applied zzso zzso is zzso zzso in the zzso zzso selection for zzso stability identified seven zzso with 7- to zzso increased stability after in zzso incubation in gastric zzso By DNA zzso we obtained four clones with a further zzso to zzso increased in zzso zzso These zzso differed by at most ten zzso acid zzso from each other and zzso that were scattered over the zzso sequence and did not overlap with predicted zzso zzso zzso The most stable zzso zzso retained zzso activity after incubation in gastric fluid and zzso in zzso zzso zzso application of zzso to zzso confirmed its improved zzso zzso In addition, zzso bound to zzso zzso with higher affinity and inhibited zzso zzso at lower zzso zzso zzso is thus a promising candidate for prevention of zzso zzso Furthermore, our findings could guide selection and improvement by genetic engineering of other zzso zzso fragments for oral zzso
