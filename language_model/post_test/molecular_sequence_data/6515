zzso studies have shown that zzso zzso are spliced out in most zzso zzso transcripts in the zzso We have prepared new zzso zzso against the zzso region of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and examined three protein products of the zzso gene in zzso the widely distributed zzso the recently discovered, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to all three proteins in brain and the extent of binding suggests that alternatively spliced zzso are less prominent at the protein level than predicted by zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso was found to be present at much higher levels in zzso brain than in adult zzso If lack of functional zzso is the cause of the cognitive impairment in some zzso muscular zzso patients, this result suggests that the effects may occur early in development, which would reduce the options for therapeutic zzso
