zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso and zzso zzso F zzso zzso activities were monitored during zzso of zzso zzso using a new zzso procedure based on a commercially available zzso The zzso F activity reached a maximum level at the end of the log phase and remained constant during the stationary phase, while zzso F continuously increased until late stationary zzso zzso F obtained at the end of the log phase was less contaminated by other proteins compared with late stationary zzso
