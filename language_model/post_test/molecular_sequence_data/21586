zzso bats zzso zzso are zzso blood feeders that have evolved specialized systems to suit their zzso zzso Chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hotspots on zzso zzso Among zzso only vampire zzso zzso zzso and pit zzso are capable of detecting infrared zzso In each case, infrared signals are detected by zzso nerve zzso that zzso specialized pit zzso on the zzso zzso Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken zzso to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared zzso As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of zzso in a zzso or zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso zzso potential zzso channel zzso to produce an infrared zzso Here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is already zzso zzso by lowering its zzso zzso threshold to about zzso This is achieved through alternative zzso of zzso transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated zzso zzso zzso These zzso events occur exclusively in zzso zzso and not in zzso root zzso thereby maintaining a role for zzso as a detector of noxious heat in zzso zzso This reflects a unique organization of the bat zzso gene that we show to be characteristic of zzso zzso zzso dogs and zzso supporting a close zzso relationship with zzso These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for zzso tuning of zzso nerve zzso
