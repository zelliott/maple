zzso are essential for maintaining bone mass, avoiding zzso and repairing injured zzso zzso of zzso G zzso receptors zzso such as the zzso hormone zzso can increase bone zzso however, the anabolic mechanisms are poorly zzso Here we use zzso an engineered zzso with zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso and skeletal effects of zzso signaling in zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression zzso a dramatic anabolic skeletal response, with zzso zzso increasing zzso and zzso mass increasing zzso in zzso zzso Bone volume, zzso zzso bone mineral density, zzso gene zzso and serum bone turnover markers were also zzso No such zzso developed when zzso was expressed after the first 4 weeks of zzso life, indicating an exquisite zzso sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso This zzso may represent an important zzso of bone mass and may open future avenues for enhancing bone repair and treating zzso bone zzso
