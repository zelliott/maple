One of the most challenging aspects of zzso disease zzso control is the high genetic zzso of the zzso virus zzso In endemic settings such as the Indian zzso this zzso has resulted in the emergence of pandemic strains that have spread widely and caused devastating outbreaks in zzso zzso In countries trying to control and eradicate zzso using vaccination strategies, the constantly evolving and wide diversity of field zzso strains is an obstacle for identifying vaccine strains that are successful in zzso protection against infection with field zzso zzso quantitative knowledge on the factors that are associated with zzso of the zzso is prerequisite for preventing and controlling zzso in the Indian zzso A zzso linear model was used to assess the association between time, space, host species and the genetic zzso of zzso O zzso using viruses collected in Pakistan from 2005 to zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso variations were associated with spatial distance, but not with differences in host species, which is consistent with the frequent zzso infection of this zzso O zzso zzso from this study will contribute to the understanding of zzso zzso and to the design of zzso control strategies in zzso zzso zzso here also provide the earliest reported isolate from the Pan Asia zzso zzso which has caused several outbreaks in the Middle East and spread into Europe zzso and Africa zzso
