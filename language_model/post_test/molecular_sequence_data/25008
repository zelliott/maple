We report here on the zzso characterization and radiation hybrid mapping of the canine basic zzso gene zzso The gene spans zzso zzso consists of nine zzso and eight zzso and is characterized by the typical features of both basic zzso and zzso in general, including zzso head and tail zzso which flank an zzso rod domain of approximately 310 zzso zzso Comparisons of sequence and structure reveal that canine zzso is zzso similar to human zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences for human and dog reveals greater than zzso zzso In the rod domain, the zzso acid identity exceeds zzso We note, however, that canine zzso encodes a protein 21 zzso longer than human zzso due to the zzso of a zzso repeat zzso zzso in the head and tail zzso of the canine zzso This is the first report of the nearly complete zzso sequence for zzso of any zzso zzso hybrid mapping of canine zzso to zzso 27 of the dog is also zzso
