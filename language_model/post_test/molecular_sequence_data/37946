The gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso The gene contains 1 zzso and the zzso content is characteristic for the zzso usage of zzso zzso The predicted open reading frame codes for 337 zzso acids zzso and is zzso identical to the human zzso zzso zzso sequences from several field zzso of zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso analysis supports the hypothesis that zzso and zzso are closely zzso The protein zzso by the zzso was expressed zzso in zzso coli and exhibited zzso activity with zzso but not with zzso as zzso zzso raised against the zzso expressed zzso detected specifically all zzso stages of cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso
