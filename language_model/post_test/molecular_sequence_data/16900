To characterize energy metabolism in rat brown zzso tissue zzso we carried out differential screening of a zzso library of BAT with a zzso probe of white zzso tissue and isolated one novel zzso zzso It contained a single zzso frame of zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence showed the highest zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso I zzso from rat zzso The transcript corresponding to this zzso was found to be abundantly expressed not only in BAT but also in heart and skeletal zzso zzso is known to be a protein necessary for the zzso of zzso fatty acids in zzso zzso and it has been suggested that at least two zzso the liver type and muscle type, zzso From these zzso a zzso clone isolated from rat BAT was concluded to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso DNA clone revealed that the gene for human zzso consists of two zzso zzso 18 coding zzso and one zzso zzso spanning approximately 10 zzso and a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was located only about 300 zzso upstream from the zzso gene with the same strand zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso transcripts containing zzso of both zzso and zzso genes exist in human and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso of these transcripts is still unknown, it is interesting that such transcripts are produced from two tightly arranged and functionally unrelated zzso
