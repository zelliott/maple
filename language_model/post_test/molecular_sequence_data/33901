zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso of zzso storage material in neural zzso and zzso and has an age of onset in the third decade of life or zzso The genetic and molecular basis of the disease has remained unknown for many zzso We carried out linkage zzso zzso analysis, zzso sequencing, and zzso sequencing in affected individuals from 20 families and/or individuals with zzso zzso we identified in five individuals one of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein alpha zzso These zzso a zzso zzso and an zzso acid exchange, zzso zzso located within the zzso domain of the protein and affect both zzso sorting and the amount of zzso in zzso zzso The resulting depletion of functional zzso might cause in parallel the zzso dysfunction and the progressive zzso observed in affected individuals and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in the form of characteristic zzso deposits in zzso Our work represents an important step in the genetic dissection of a genetically zzso group of zzso It also confirms a zzso role for zzso in humans and demonstrates the need for detailed investigation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and other neurodegenerative diseases presenting with zzso protein zzso
