zzso zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrate a complex DNA zzso with inversion of zzso coding zzso deletion of upstream and zzso zzso and healing of the truncated zzso by zzso zzso An inversion intermediate that results in the zzso gene structure for zzso has been identified in the zzso This inversion creates a zzso stable zzso for the zzso addition of zzso repeats at the deletion zzso
