zzso of the zzso zzso are widespread in the environment, but their ecological role in zzso such as the plant zzso is not very well zzso To gain better insight into the distribution of different zzso species in diverse zzso a rapid and specific zzso method for detection of these organisms and analysis of their community structure is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for this zzso were designed and zzso These zzso were used in zzso in combination with a reverse primer that binds to the zzso zzso which is located upstream of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso products that were of different lengths were obtained due to the length zzso of the zzso of different zzso zzso This length variation allowed generation of fingerprints of zzso communities in environmental samples by automated zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso communities on leaves of different plant species in a natural field were compared using this zzso The new method allows rapid comparisons of zzso communities and is thus a useful tool to study zzso communities in different zzso
