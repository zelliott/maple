In previous studies involving zzso species we proposed that zzso zzso is the product of zzso zzso the zzso function of the zzso zzso is not to produce light but to produce zzso zzso zzso including its prosthetic group, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso but at relatively high zzso zzso It seems difficult to extend this idea to all luminous bacteria because the zzso gene is not present in the zzso zzso in zzso or zzso But we predicted that a zzso zzso which binds zzso should function like zzso in these zzso In this study, we isolated zzso binding protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso The obtained protein was a modified zzso as expected, in which the zzso was intact but about 25 zzso acid zzso at the zzso of the zzso were deleted and the prosthetic group was the fully reduced zzso These results strongly support that the zzso function of the zzso zzso is as described above even in luminous bacteria other than zzso zzso We propose that zzso B reported by Tu and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1975) zzso 14, zzso is the reduced zzso
