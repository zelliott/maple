We report here the zzso activity of regulatory elements that reside within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso light chain zzso gene zzso zzso promoter activity is first detected at embryonic day zzso in zzso zzso zzso gene expression is maintained in the spinal zzso until embryonic day zzso and at later zzso stages in the brain and sensory zzso After day zzso the promoter becomes active in zzso zzso zzso expression in both zzso and muscle is consistent with the detection of zzso zzso transcript in both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso and zzso activities of the zzso promoter decrease and are nearly zzso after zzso Thus, the zzso zzso promoter contains regulatory elements for initiation but not maintenance of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso analyses reveal that independent regulatory elements control the observed zzso activities and zzso a potential zzso binding site as the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso promoter contains distinct regulatory elements for both zzso and zzso gene expression and that these activities are temporally separated during zzso
