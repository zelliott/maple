The zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso is an zzso protein that mediates the active zzso of zzso from the bacterial zzso This protein comprises zzso zzso and is predicted to have 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence to that of several members of the major zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso copy of the zzso zzso zzso This region consists of the sequence zzso and is located within the putative loop joining zzso 2 and 3 in the predicted structural model of the zzso zzso To study the functional importance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to construct 17 point zzso that were then zzso for their effect on zzso resistance and their ability to produce an zzso zzso zzso Changes to the zzso zzso zzso were zzso whereas three independent zzso of zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso of the basic zzso showed that zzso is required for function, whereas zzso resistance was retained when zzso was zzso with zzso These results confirm that the region zzso this motif is important for zzso resistance and represents a distant version of the zzso A region found in other zzso proteins and members of the MFS zzso In addition, it was shown that zzso of the zzso zzso which is predicted to be located in zzso is important for resistance although a zzso with an zzso zzso at this position is also zzso
