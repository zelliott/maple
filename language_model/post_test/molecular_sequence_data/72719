In zzso zzso neural crest cell migration and motor zzso outgrowth are restricted to zzso zzso halves by repulsive factors located in the zzso zzso zzso We show that two zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso zzso halves, and that crest cells and motor zzso express receptors for these zzso In several independent in zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins can zzso guide both crest migration and motor zzso zzso These repulsive activities depend on a graded or zzso presentation of the zzso when tested in the context of zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso These results identify zzso and zzso as potential zzso of zzso pattern in the peripheral nervous zzso
