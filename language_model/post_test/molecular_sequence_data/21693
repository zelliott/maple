In this study, we developed a novel zzso protein preparation and zzso method for zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis and identification of proteins that involves using zzso carbon tape as a sample platform for sample preparation zzso and zzso and zzso under zzso heating and as a plate for zzso zzso This method allows for the zzso zzso products of proteins to be directly analyzed by zzso mass zzso and results in a marked reduction in sample zzso Our protocol requires only a small volume (1 zzso of reaction zzso which increases the frequency of zzso zzso thereby resulting in more efficient zzso of sample than conventional zzso zzso zzso To test this zzso we used magnetic iron zzso zzso oxide zzso as concentrating zzso to enrich zzso from a mixture of peptides in zzso zzso protein zzso We found that the zzso zzso protein preparation and zzso under zzso heating combined with the zzso enrichment method not only dramatically reduced the time required for zzso analysis but also allowed for the simultaneous identification of zzso The advantages of our protocol include ease of use, high zzso efficiency, high zzso and rapid (15 zzso identification of proteins and enrichment of zzso in a mixture of zzso zzso protein zzso
