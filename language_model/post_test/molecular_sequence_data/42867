The primary structure of toxin III of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by automatic zzso degradation of the reduced and zzso protein and derived zzso zzso Like other scorpion toxins that are active on sodium channels, zzso III, consisting of 64 zzso zzso is a 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso by four zzso zzso It belongs to the zzso group, as judged by competition experiments with zzso zzso II for binding to rat brain zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso III is the first zzso to be characterized that is highly toxic to mice zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso body zzso by subcutaneous injection, insects zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso body zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso (17 zzso body zzso When tested via the zzso route, the toxicity for mice zzso zzso (8 zzso was of the same order as that found by subcutaneous injection, indicating that zzso III has a higher affinity for peripheral sodium channels that for those of the central nervous zzso There are three differences between the sequences of zzso III and zzso alpha zzso an zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These zzso are found at positions 20, 24, and 64 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha IT is only zzso active in mice zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso while in insects its toxicity is similar to that of zzso III zzso zzso (20 zzso body zzso blowfly zzso These observations are relevant to the definition of scorpion toxin zzso zzso
