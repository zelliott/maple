zzso group zzso proteins repress zzso by zzso zzso structure in target zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein complex zzso and contains four zzso brain zzso zzso repeats involved in the recognition of various zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso in complex with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Only a single zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso analyses show zzso binding with low zzso sequence selectivity through zzso interaction of the zzso with an aromatic cage and positively charged zzso zzso with the surrounding zzso charged surface of the fourth zzso zzso zzso directly interacts with the zzso protein zzso a related zzso protein with similar zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso response elements of target genes in zzso and they strongly zzso in the repression of these target zzso suggesting that the combined action of these two zzso proteins is crucial for zzso zzso
