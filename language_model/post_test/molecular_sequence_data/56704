zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes occurs in immature zzso cells by an unknown zzso To identify components of the zzso machinery, we isolated a population of zzso zzso enriched for rearranging zzso zzso In the nuclear fraction of these cells, we detected a protein that specifically bound the zzso sequences that flank zzso zzso and zzso genes and are required for their zzso This protein recognized both zzso and zzso motifs of the zzso zzso separated by either 12 or 23 zzso The protein zzso with the zzso sequence zzso had an apparent molecular mass of 30 zzso The binding characteristics of the protein and its presence in rearranging zzso and cell lines suggest that it could serve as the recognition unit of a zzso zzso
