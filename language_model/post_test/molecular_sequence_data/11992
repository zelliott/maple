Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso acids whose zzso zzso region has four and twelve sites for potential zzso and zzso zzso In order to zzso the functional roles of these modification sites, we constructed a series of zzso truncated zzso and expressed them in zzso zzso All the truncated zzso showed zzso profiles similar to those of the zzso zzso The truncated receptors holding zzso retained both normal zzso calcium zzso response and its rapid zzso however, the deleted receptors lacking zzso failed to induce the zzso zzso These results showed that zzso of zzso is necessary for its zzso calcium signaling and that at least ten of twelve putative zzso sites are irresponsible for the zzso zzso
