We study the effects of the genetic sequence on the propagation of zzso zzso in simple models of DNA in which we incorporate actual data from the human zzso We show that zzso propagation requires forces over a certain zzso a phenomenon already found for zzso sequences zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso E 52, zzso zzso For forces below zzso the final stop positions are highly dependent on the specific zzso zzso to the conjecture advanced by zzso and co-workers, we find no evidence supporting the dependence of the zzso dynamics on the information content of the genetic sequences zzso We discuss possible reasons for that result as well as its practical zzso zzso the results of our model are consistent with the zzso dynamics of the unzipping process observed in zzso We also show that the effective potential, a collective coordinate zzso introduced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso 263 zzso is a useful tool to identify key regions in DNA that control the zzso behavior of large zzso As a side result, we extend the previous studies on zzso sequences by analyzing the effect of the initial position of the zzso leading to further insight on the zzso observed in such zzso
