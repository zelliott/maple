zzso zzso DNA sequences were used for investigating the evolution of an entire zzso of extinct zzso the endemic zzso zzso of the zzso Islands in the Indian zzso zzso DNA corroborates zzso evidence that there were five species of tortoise with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso of the group first zzso zzso where zzso produced zzso zzso and the zzso of the other species including a second zzso zzso form, zzso zzso A zzso derived from this lineage zzso zzso zzso zzso to the east, where a second zzso zzso took place producing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A recent colonization of zzso 150 zzso to the southwest produced zzso zzso In the virtual absence of zzso the defensive features of the shells of zzso zzso were largely zzso apparently in two zzso zzso shells with high fronts evolved independently on all three zzso This and other features, such as a derived jaw structure and small body size, may be associated with niche differentiation in zzso species and may represent a striking example of parallel differentiation in a large zzso zzso The history of zzso zzso contrasts with that of the zzso where only a single species is present and surviving populations are genetically much more zzso However, they too show some reduction in zzso mechanisms and multiple development of populations with zzso zzso
