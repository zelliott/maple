The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is essential for the maintenance of zzso DNA zzso and appears to play an important role in the zzso and copy number determination of zzso zzso zzso by a nuclear zzso is a member of zzso zzso protein family and has two zzso zzso zzso A and zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the control of zzso copy number, we asked if the in zzso functions of zzso are regulated by the possible modification such as zzso We found that the zzso extended segment zzso of zzso A is rapidly and specifically zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso The zzso in this region zzso the binding of zzso to all kinds of DNA including zzso junction DNA and the zzso activity of zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells with an zzso zzso defective in the zzso site have a severe zzso in the regulation of zzso content during zzso repression in zzso These observations suggest that the zzso via zzso that is activated during zzso repression, may regulate the in zzso functions of zzso for the control of zzso content during shift from zzso to zzso zzso
