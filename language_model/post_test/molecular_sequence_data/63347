Recently, several zzso zzso zzso have been completely zzso The zzso circles enclosed in virus particles and injected by zzso into zzso appear to mainly zzso zzso factors potentially involved in altering host immunity and/or development, thereby allowing the survival of the zzso larvae within the host zzso zzso zzso generally inject zzso factors produced in the zzso zzso As zzso zzso are inherited vertically by zzso through a zzso form, zzso zzso genes may have been transferred to this zzso form, leading to their incorporation into virus zzso Indeed, many gene products from zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso contain protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso however, zzso zzso gene products are not more closely related to insect proteins than to human zzso To determine whether the distance between zzso and insect proteins is a specific feature of zzso proteins or simply reflects a general high divergence of zzso zzso products, which might be due to zzso lifestyle, we have analyzed the sequences of zzso genes obtained from a zzso zzso zzso sequences having a high similarity with zzso zzso genes involved in a variety of biological functions could be identified indicating that the high level of divergence observed for zzso products is a hallmark of these viral zzso We discuss how this divergence might be explained in the context of the current hypotheses on the origin and evolution of zzso zzso
