zzso distribution of plant zzso zzso and zzso type free zzso produced by the zzso has been analyzed using zzso of pumpkin zzso as the model plant zzso Each zzso in the zzso was zzso by zzso with the zzso density zzso system and the zzso activity in each fraction was zzso with zzso labeled zzso as zzso The zzso activity was exclusively recovered in the soluble fraction zzso zzso but not in other specific zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso would reside predominantly in the zzso The quantitative analysis of zzso type free zzso occurring in each fraction showed that more than zzso of the free zzso was recovered from the soluble zzso suggesting the zzso would work in the zzso and the resulting free zzso would accumulate in the same zzso The pumpkin zzso zzso partially zzso from the zzso showed optimum activity around pH zzso supporting this zzso would reside in the zzso Furthermore, the detailed analysis of zzso specificity of zzso using various zzso type zzso showed that the pumpkin zzso as well as other plant zzso were highly active toward the zzso type zzso bearing the zzso zzso
