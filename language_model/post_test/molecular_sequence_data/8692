Previously, we reported the sequence of zzso clones zzso zzso acids 63 through zzso of the human zzso zzso heavy zzso zzso In this paper, we present the derived sequence of the remaining zzso zzso acids along with zzso and 3' untranslated zzso We made use of the differences between the derived zzso zzso heavy zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences to raise zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals a differential expression of both zzso heavy chain zzso in a variety of human adult and zzso zzso and zzso When extracts of human adult zzso were subjected to gel zzso two distinct zzso zzso bands and a fused band were seen zzso at approximately 200 zzso These bands can be detected with four different specific zzso recognizing the two different smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso and 200 zzso and the two different zzso zzso heavy chain zzso (A and zzso Using zzso we confirmed the presence of the four different zzso in adult and zzso zzso
