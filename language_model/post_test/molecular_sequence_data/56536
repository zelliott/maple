Mouse beta zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of five zzso wild mouse zzso genes have been determined from the large zzso of zzso DNA using the zzso chain zzso Relative to the standard zzso zzso the products of four zzso of zzso zzso origin zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ by only one or two zzso zzso zzso has a single zzso change, zzso and is identical to the c zzso zzso has two changes, zzso and zzso zzso differs at zzso and zzso at zzso and they share the zzso change with zzso and zzso zzso and c cells are zzso by zzso a zzso zzso specific for beta zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso cells are zzso Thus, distant changes appear to introduce subtle zzso effects on beta zzso zzso Five independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso differ the most from zzso with 12 zzso acid changes and only one silent zzso zzso predicted from the zzso sequence occur in zzso of the zzso facing away from the class I heavy chain and not in regions where beta zzso associates with class I alpha 3 zzso zzso the zzso zzso forms of beta zzso associate well with zzso heavy zzso The many zzso acid changes in the zzso sequence and the paucity of silent zzso suggest that zzso has been subject to positive zzso
