We have studied the DNA binding activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with particular interest in the role played by the zzso zzso zzso By comparing the DNA binding activity of wild type zzso zzso with a zzso form of zzso that lacks the zzso zzso domain zzso delta zzso we have determined that the zzso of zzso alters both the shape and the stability of the zzso zzso zzso of the DNA zzso angle indicate that the zzso enhances the zzso of the DNA that is induced by zzso binding and greatly zzso the zzso complex during native gel zzso In solution, the zzso has only a slight effect on the equilibrium zzso constant and the zzso rate zzso However, the zzso domain reduces the association rate constant in a temperature dependent manner and increases the apparent zzso energy of the zzso complex formation by 3 zzso These data suggest that a zzso change involving the zzso of zzso may be one of the zzso steps in the formation of a stable zzso zzso
