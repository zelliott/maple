The zzso family of small zzso proteins is composed by four different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this work we report the identification and characterization of a fifth member of this family of small zzso This new protein is highly zzso to zzso and zzso binds labeled zzso on zzso and is recognized by a specific zzso zzso but not by an zzso zzso The protein has thus been named zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso However, accurate comparison of the zzso of zzso binding and release revealed that zzso bound zzso less efficiently and possessed slower rate of zzso release compared to the highly zzso zzso Moreover, in the presence of zzso the relative affinity of zzso for zzso was only about twofold higher than that for zzso while, under the same conditions, zzso was able to bind zzso with about zzso higher affinity than zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso localized at the plasma zzso as dictated by the presence of a zzso motif at the zzso We found that zzso represented the zzso zzso protein expressed in circulating zzso zzso but was not present in zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed in human zzso suggesting that the protein may be zzso during zzso zzso This work demonstrates that zzso is a new member of the zzso zzso of zzso able to bind zzso zzso with peculiar properties, and differently expressed by various zzso zzso This new protein may therefore contribute to the still poorly clarified cellular events regulated by this zzso of zzso zzso
