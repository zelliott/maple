Numerous studies now support that human zzso virus type 1 zzso evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific zzso zzso and zzso within defined zzso zzso zzso Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of zzso zzso responses to demonstrate that zzso immune pressures also select for zzso zzso zzso zzso that impair zzso zzso In persons expressing zzso we demonstrate consistent selection for a zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the normally zzso zzso zzso zzso that prevents its processing and zzso resulting in a rapid decline in the zzso zzso zzso This single zzso acid substitution also lies within a second zzso zzso with the zzso directly zzso recognition by zzso T zzso zzso of the zzso to subjects expressing zzso was shown to prevent the induction of normally zzso zzso responses to both zzso However, subsequent in zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso with delayed induction of new zzso zzso responses to both zzso These data demonstrate that zzso within the zzso region of an zzso zzso can impair recognition by an established zzso zzso response and that transmission of these zzso alters the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of these zzso in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of zzso selected evolutionary zzso
