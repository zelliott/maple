The zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate numerous cellular functions by binding to members of a zzso protein zzso zzso These functions include the zzso of the cell zzso that is a feature of cell growth and zzso Two of these zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been recently characterized in zzso Both of these proteins zzso zzso zzso light chain, a prerequisite for the zzso of zzso zzso Here we report the zzso cloning of the human zzso of zzso zzso which was found by Northern zzso analysis to be expressed in a wide range of zzso The human zzso gene maps to zzso band zzso by FISH zzso
