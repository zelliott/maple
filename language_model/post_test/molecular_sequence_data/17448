The zzso peptides from zzso are composed exclusively of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Met, zzso and zzso Because these compounds does not contain functional groups which undergo easily zzso or zzso their zzso in zzso used usually for zzso analysis is not zzso A rapid and sensitive procedure for detection and structure zzso of the zzso peptides based on zzso with zzso and zzso zzso A zzso of zzso containing peptides with zzso zzso has been also zzso The extract of seeds of zzso zzso was analyzed directly by zzso and neutral loss zzso zzso The analysis confirms the presence of zzso reported zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which contain zzso oxide, were detected in relatively small zzso These peptides results likely from the zzso of their not reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso present at higher zzso in the extract protected from atmospheric zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso peptides were proposed on the basis of zzso experiments and zzso with peptides described by zzso and supported by the fragmentation of synthetic zzso of zzso of a known zzso
