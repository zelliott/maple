The zzso zzso is the zzso that mediates active zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso of the rat zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated, restriction mapped and a 2 zzso region immediate zzso to the zzso site was zzso The zzso start site for zzso was mapped to zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso translation initiation zzso A series of zzso zzso DNA fragments ranging from 233 zzso to 8 zzso were tested for promoter activity in both zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that the DNA regulatory elements within 8 zzso of the zzso zzso region of zzso are not sufficient to zzso zzso zzso However, consistent with the clinical observation that zzso expression is reduced in zzso tumors, the zzso promoter activity is suppressed in zzso transformed zzso cells, compared to zzso zzso zzso
