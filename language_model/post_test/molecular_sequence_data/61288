The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes an zzso component of zzso nitrate zzso which zzso a zzso model to account for the zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso with data to indicate that this gene encodes a zzso component of zzso nitrate zzso zzso plants expressing zzso zzso exhibited reduced zzso membrane zzso and nitrate zzso activities in zzso with 10 zzso zzso Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing zzso zzso in the zzso background exhibited an enhanced resistance to zzso (7 zzso as opposed to 2 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso yielded a zzso for nitrate of approximately zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was zzso expressed before and after nitrate exposure (it was zzso zzso only when the level of zzso zzso started to increase zzso and its zzso was found primarily in root hairs and the zzso in both young zzso zzso and mature regions of zzso We conclude that zzso systems of nitrate zzso like zzso systems, are composed of zzso and zzso components and that with their distinct functions, they are part of an elaborate nitrate zzso network in zzso
