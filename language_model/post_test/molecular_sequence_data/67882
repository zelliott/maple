zzso zzso A zzso zzso or zzso zzso a zzso bond formation reaction in the zzso of both vitamin zzso and zzso zzso is crucial to the activity of a large subset of its zzso but lacks a clearly defined structural and zzso zzso Here we determine the crystal structure of the zzso from zzso coli at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is bound to the zzso active site at a position equivalent to that of the side chain zzso of an zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso involves both zzso zzso attraction and specific hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso binding site is occupied by a zzso zzso or zzso an inhibitor directly competing with zzso These results provide a solid structural basis for the zzso dependence of the zzso activity of type I zzso zzso The unique location of the zzso zzso in relation to the expected position of the zzso zzso in the zzso active site suggests a critical zzso role for the zzso zzso as a zzso base in zzso zzso
