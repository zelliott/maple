zzso was obtained from a zzso zzso designated zzso isolated from a zzso library of zzso plants of zzso zzso zzso The clone zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso acid zzso with greater than zzso sequence identity to the regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli and contains a putative zzso signal at the zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested the presence of additional zzso genes in zzso zzso The expression of zzso gene was strongly induced by zzso but not by zzso zzso or zzso In addition zzso zzso was not strongly affected by treatment with plant growth regulators, such as zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso acid, or by zzso for 10 zzso
