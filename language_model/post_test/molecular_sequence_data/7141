zzso 12 zzso is an zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso that is critical for promoting T helper type 1 development and zzso immunity against zzso The zzso zzso expressed by activated zzso and B cells, is induced by several pathogens in zzso and in zzso and is zzso or inhibited by gamma zzso zzso or zzso zzso Control of zzso zzso expression is therefore important for understanding resistance and zzso to a variety of zzso including zzso major and perhaps human zzso zzso In this report, we provide the first characterization of zzso zzso gene regulation in zzso We zzso zzso activity of the promoter to the sequence zzso not previously recognized to bind zzso family zzso zzso We demonstrate binding of this sequence to zzso B zzso and zzso complexes in zzso activated by several zzso pathogens and provide functional data to support a role for zzso B family members in zzso zzso zzso Finally, we find that zzso treatment of cells enhances this binding interaction, thus potentially providing a mechanism for zzso zzso of zzso production by zzso
