The zzso is an essential part of the seed which sustains zzso development and contains storage zzso zzso development involves a series of nuclear divisions in the absence of zzso In this study, it is shown that a zzso zzso plant carrying the disrupted zzso gene exhibits severe defects during seed zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein and the transcripts of this gene are alternatively zzso consequently producing at least nine zzso spliced zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in this gene resulted in abortion of zzso of seeds, and the zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast zzso analyses revealed that the zzso has zzso zzso with more than one zzso and an zzso arrested at the zzso to heart stage zzso Because this zzso exhibits a zzso zzso it was designated zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso with quickly dividing cells as revealed in zzso zzso transgenic zzso It is proposed that zzso is likely to function as a key regulator of zzso nuclear zzso
