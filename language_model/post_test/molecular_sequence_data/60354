We have used genetic methods in zzso zzso to study nitrogen metabolism and its zzso We present evidence for a zzso zzso in zzso and zzso species containing genes of nitrogen metabolism that are regulated zzso at the zzso level via a common zzso binding site zzso or zzso The implied mechanism for regulation resembles the general bacterial paradigm for repression, but contrasts with well-known mechanisms of nitrogen regulation in bacteria, which occur by zzso Genes in the nitrogen zzso include those for nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the regulatory protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as a gene of unknown zzso We also studied the function of two novel zzso zzso that are zzso within the zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso The zzso resulting from a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso provides direct evidence that zzso genes are involved in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of nitrogen fixation upon addition of zzso Finally, we show that the gene zzso is not required for nitrogen zzso in agreement with findings in several zzso These studies illustrate the utility of genetic methods in zzso zzso and show the enhanced perspective that studies in the zzso can bring to known biological zzso
