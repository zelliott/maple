The zzso gene of zzso is a potent zzso of gene expression from the zzso long terminal repeat zzso To define the functionally important regions of the product of the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and single zzso acid substitution zzso within the zzso coding region of strain zzso were zzso The effect of these zzso on zzso was assessed by measuring the expression of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso reporter gene linked to the zzso These studies have revealed that four different zzso of the protein that map within the zzso 56 zzso acid region are essential for zzso zzso In addition to the essential zzso an auxiliary domain that enhances the activity of the essential region has also been mapped between zzso acid zzso 58 and zzso One of the essential zzso maps in the zzso 20 zzso acid zzso The other three essential zzso are highly zzso among the various strains of zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso virus zzso Of the zzso zzso one contains seven zzso zzso and single zzso acid zzso for several zzso zzso indicate that they are essential for zzso zzso The second zzso domain contains a zzso X zzso zzso zzso X zzso motif in which the zzso zzso is essential for zzso and the other zzso are partially zzso The third zzso domain is strongly basic and appears to play a dual zzso zzso lacking this domain are deficient in zzso and in efficient targeting of zzso to the nucleus and zzso The combination of the four essential zzso and the auxiliary domain contribute to the near full activity observed with the 101 zzso acid zzso zzso
