zzso acid, the major storage form of zzso in plant seeds is zzso by the zzso to yield zzso and free zzso contributing thereby to the improved zzso of zzso zzso and essential minerals in plant foods and simultaneous reduction in zzso pollution of the zzso and aquatic zzso As a possible strategy for altering seed zzso levels, the approach involving reduction of zzso content by zzso expressing zzso zzso gene during seed development of soybean zzso max zzso zzso zzso was attempted in the present zzso zzso zzso revealed the maximum expression of zzso gene transcripts in zzso zzso zzso 10 days after zzso compared to other zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso was amplified from the zzso zzso by zzso by overlap extension zzso and its sequence analysis revealed an zzso of zzso zzso including an N terminal signal zzso of 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso of molecular mass 62 zzso on alignment with related purple acid zzso in other plants shared five zzso zzso and seven zzso zzso acids involved in coordination of the metals in the zzso center of purple acid zzso zzso to a large number of zzso coli zzso zzso in soybean zzso zzso the modified gene was cloned into a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and its expression in zzso coli was confirmed by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso of the crude expression product in zzso coli revealed a functional zzso zzso showing a great potential for developing low zzso transgenic soybean through its zzso zzso in the early stages of seed zzso
