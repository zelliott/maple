To identify the genetic zzso of zzso factor zzso in a Chinese family with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso blood samples were collected from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso female, aged 15, 4 members of her family, and 100 healthy zzso zzso DNA was zzso All the zzso and zzso boundaries of zzso gene were amplified by zzso then the zzso products were zzso by direct zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed in all of the family members and the 100 healthy donors to exclude gene zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso was completed by molecular zzso 

Double zzso zzso in the zzso were zzso zzso zzso at position zzso and zzso zzso at position zzso resulting in zzso and zzso substitution zzso zzso for zzso was confirmed in the zzso mother and her elder zzso zzso for zzso was confirmed in the zzso zzso It was found by computer simulated molecular model that the zzso replacement, which was located on the surface of the zzso zzso might cause zzso hindrance and change the zzso and function of zzso zzso 

Double zzso zzso for zzso and zzso in zzso gene have been found in a zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso substitution in zzso gene is a novel zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene may change the zzso of zzso protein and result in zzso zzso
