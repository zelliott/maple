Engineering zzso selectivity into the zzso zzso zzso binding site is relatively zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which include zzso zzso zzso C, zzso and zzso Studies using a zzso synthetic zzso model of the zzso zzso binding motif have indicated that zzso will induce structural change in those zzso motifs containing three or four acid zzso in zzso positions with a zzso on the zzso zzso the zzso binding cavity size in zzso zzso motifs through replacement of zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso metal zzso zzso positions in the loop region by zzso acid has been successful in decreasing the calcium zzso zzso The same changes did not create or enhance zzso binding in the zzso model zzso zzso binding zzso
