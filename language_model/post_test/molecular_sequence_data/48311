zzso zzso zzso is one of the most widely used proteins for the diagnosis of breast and prostate zzso Of note, zzso displays zzso activity for the specific zzso sequence zzso which it recognizes and zzso In this study, we developed a zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso using zzso zzso zzso gold zzso zzso complexes zzso The zzso do not initially zzso in the spectral region associated with the zzso due to the zzso effect of the zzso zzso When zzso was added to a solution containing the zzso zzso recognized and zzso the specific sequence of the peptides attached to the zzso zzso As a result, zzso were separated from the zzso zzso and zzso strong zzso in their spectral zzso Using this detection method, zzso was successfully detected as a function of concentration (10 zzso zzso This approach is superior to the zzso with respect to the performance of zzso which is very zzso simple, and zzso method for the detection of zzso and other protein markers can be measured for the early detection of several zzso
