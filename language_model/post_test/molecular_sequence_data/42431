zzso of evolutionary relationships among zzso zzso of sequences of the zzso zzso b DNA gene are examined for five zzso of arboreal zzso of the zzso family zzso from the Amazon zzso Data are available for zzso zzso of sequence from a total of 24 separate localities in Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazil for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso corrected for multiple hits, is extensive, ranging from less than zzso for comparisons within populations of over zzso among geographic units within zzso Both the degree of differentiation and the geographic patterning of the variation suggest that more than one species composes the zzso distribution of the currently recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There is general zzso in the geographic range of zzso zzso for each of these zzso and the overall level of differentiation within them is largely zzso These observations suggest that a common zzso history zzso the respective diversification of each zzso However, estimated times of divergence based on the rate of third position zzso zzso for the major zzso within each zzso typically range above 1 million zzso Thus, zzso isolation zzso divergence must have been considerably earlier than the late zzso forest fragmentation events commonly invoked for zzso zzso
