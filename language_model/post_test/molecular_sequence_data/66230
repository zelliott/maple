zzso plants have many zzso genes zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are predicted to contribute to the production of various zzso compounds and to have resulted in a diversity of zzso zzso We identified gene zzso in the zzso factors regulating zzso zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso Three copies of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso factor that regulates zzso zzso were present in the zzso zzso zzso The organ specificity and stress responsiveness differed among the three zzso and correlations between zzso zzso and the expression levels of zzso were observed during zzso zzso Moreover, three zzso functionally zzso zzso in transient expression experiments in zzso zzso leaf zzso The different reporter activity caused by zzso was consistent with the affinity of physical interactions with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso experiments as well as the branching pattern of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso factors have diverse functions in the zzso in which they are zzso in particular, zzso is predicted to have evolved flexibility in interaction with other zzso regulators to resist environmental zzso
