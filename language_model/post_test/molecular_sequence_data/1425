This work describes the zzso and characterization of zzso that exhibit zzso activity in stem zzso of zzso This is the first detailed investigation that concerns the characterization of zzso properties and sequence identity of zzso with zzso activities in a zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso with apparent molecular masses of 75, 67, and 64 zzso respectively, were zzso to zzso zzso was identified as a putative zzso and zzso and zzso as putative zzso using zzso zzso zzso time of zzso zzso belongs to family 51 and zzso and zzso to family 3 of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have highest specificity for zzso and zzso for zzso and natural zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso was shown to release mainly zzso from zzso zzso zzso rye zzso wheat zzso and zzso zzso and zzso can also release zzso from these zzso but less efficiently than zzso Moreover, they can also release zzso from zzso and zzso Overall, the results indicate that zzso possesses zzso specificity characteristic for a zzso while zzso and zzso act as zzso zzso Analysis of the activity of these three zzso in stem zzso at different stages of development has shown that young stems possess the highest activities for all three zzso in comparison to the activities of the zzso present in stems at older stages of zzso High zzso activities are most likely related to the necessary modifications of cell wall structure occurring during plant zzso
