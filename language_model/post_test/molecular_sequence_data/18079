Plant zzso are zzso by complex and highly divergent zzso zzso Despite the general lack of zzso conservation in animal, zzso and zzso zzso zzso evidence is presented which indicates that higher plant zzso genes have an untranslated leader zzso with structural similarity to that found in zzso zzso zzso All functional higher plant zzso genes zzso to date contain a potential zzso zzso site in the zzso untranslated region 10 to 13 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso A leader specific zzso probe zzso to sequences over zzso zzso upstream from the coding region confirming the presence of an upstream zzso zzso extension of zzso with zzso zzso was used to analyze the zzso untranslated zzso and leader zzso from four divergent soybean zzso zzso zzso 4, 6 and zzso The zzso ends of all four zzso are zzso The consensus promoter elements of the zzso zzso promoter were zzso Gene specific primer extension sequencing of zzso zzso indicated that zzso of the zzso leader zzso occurred at the predicted zzso site in zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso untranslated zzso are small zzso zzso and the leader zzso are relatively large zzso zzso The presence of an zzso within the zzso zzso leader and an zzso which splits a zzso zzso at position 152 in all plant zzso genes and all zzso muscle zzso genes suggests that these structures may have been zzso due to a functional role in zzso zzso The zzso regions of these two soybean zzso genes contain many unusual features including zzso repeats and long stretches of zzso zzso The possible roles of the upstream zzso and the C + zzso regions are zzso
