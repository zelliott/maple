Apple zzso zzso virus zzso expressing green, zzso and yellow fluorescent proteins zzso zzso and zzso was constructed and used to analyze the local and systemic movement of the virus in infected zzso In zzso zzso plants zzso with zzso the infection zzso first appeared as small fluorescent spots 2-3 days post zzso zzso The zzso spots expanded as rings from 5 zzso then fused to each other, and most zzso faded out at zzso zzso In upper zzso leaves, zzso zzso was first observed zzso zzso on the zzso area of mature leaves and on the entire area of young developing zzso The appearance of fluorescent zzso on young leaves was first found on and near the class III and IV zzso zzso labeled with two different fluorescent proteins zzso and zzso were used to investigate the distribution of zzso but differently labeled viruses in mixed zzso Fluorescence from zzso and zzso was in each case observed in separate areas in both zzso and upper zzso leaves, indicating that populations of zzso but differently labeled viruses were zzso and distributed in discrete areas of infected zzso
