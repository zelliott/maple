zzso is the positive zzso of the major transfer zzso in the F zzso of zzso coli that zzso zzso zzso at the main transfer promoter zzso Multiple sequence alignment revealed a putative zzso zzso domain that might be involved in sensing zzso potential or energy levels in the zzso This domain, which contains a zzso zzso motif along with a zzso motif of variable position, was identified within the zzso region of zzso zzso including F zzso The 5 zzso zzso in F zzso were changed to zzso to give protein with single or multiple zzso Single C to S zzso had little effect on mating efficiency zzso whereas cumulative zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso to zzso gradually reduced ME to zzso zzso F zzso was able to bind to zzso zzso on an affinity zzso zzso This feature was severely impaired for the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso within the zzso domain could be the part of a zzso zzso zzso that plays a key role in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso
