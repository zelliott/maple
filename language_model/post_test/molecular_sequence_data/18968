Leigh syndrome zzso is an zzso progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by unique, bilateral zzso findings in zzso zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso is genetically heterogeneous, with the majority of the zzso genes affecting zzso zzso and many cases still remain zzso Here, we report male zzso affected with zzso showing zzso but no marked zzso of zzso and zzso To identify their genetic cause, we performed whole zzso zzso zzso zzso were narrowed down based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a: zzso in both affected zzso and a zzso change in their mother were identified, being consistent with the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso which plays an important role in the initiation of zzso zzso Based on the structural zzso the zzso can destabilize the structure and result in protein zzso Furthermore, in zzso experiments showed zzso zzso was unable to undergo the zzso which is observed in zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso in human, zzso a possible link between zzso zzso and zzso
