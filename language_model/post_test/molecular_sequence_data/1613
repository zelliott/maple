There is increasing evidence showing the involvement of zzso T cells in initiating and maintaining zzso immune zzso zzso is expressed by various tumors but not normal zzso except zzso We conducted a cancer clinical trial by using full-length zzso protein formulated with zzso zzso and injected into patients zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso in combination with overlapping synthetic peptides were used to identify zzso T cells from a vaccinated zzso We show here the identification and characterization of two novel zzso T cell zzso T cells specific to these zzso not only recognized zzso zzso cells loaded with zzso but also zzso tumor cell lines treated with zzso One of the two responses identified was greater than the previously identified zzso zzso response and correlated with zzso zzso T cell induction after zzso This T cell response was vaccinated in most patients who expressed zzso This study has systematically surveyed patients vaccinated with full-length tumor zzso for a vaccinated zzso helper T cell zzso
