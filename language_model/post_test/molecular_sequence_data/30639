In order to identify and characterize sequences within zzso elements which are required in zzso for zzso a series of zzso plasmids were constructed and tested for zzso zzso are deletion zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene products required for zzso are supplied in trans from a helper zzso which has intact open reading frames but lacks a 3' long terminal repeat zzso and therefore cannot transpose zzso Up to 5 zzso pairs of internal sequences of the zzso zzso element can be deleted without a significant effect on zzso The smallest zzso element capable of zzso contains the 3' zzso and the transcribed portion of the zzso zzso 285 base pairs zzso of internal sequence 3' to the zzso zzso and 23 zzso of internal sequence zzso to the 3' zzso We conclude that zzso proteins can act in trans and that zzso sequences in zzso are all within or near the zzso Further deletion of the zzso internal sequence adjacent to the zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso frequency, and the zzso zzso produced failed to be packaged into the zzso particles zzso Surprisingly, several zzso cellular zzso were also associated with zzso zzso
