The bacterial zzso is a complex molecular machine that is assembled by more than 30 proteins and is rotated to propel cells either through liquids or over solid zzso zzso gene expression is extensively regulated to zzso zzso assembly in both space and zzso In zzso zzso the proteins of unknown function, zzso and zzso and the alternative zzso factor zzso are required to activate expression of the zzso filament zzso zzso Here we determine that in the absence of zzso and zzso the zzso form of the response regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression indirectly by binding to the zzso promoter region and zzso expression of the zzso factor zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso is essential to inhibit zzso expression when zzso zzso body assembly is zzso zzso of zzso is poorly understood outside of zzso and differential control of zzso expression may be a common means of zzso zzso expression to zzso zzso
