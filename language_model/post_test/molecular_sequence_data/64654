zzso synthesis zzso a high proportion of the zzso energy of zzso cells, and most of this is used by zzso chain zzso An important regulator of energy supply and demand in zzso cells is the zzso protein zzso zzso The rate of zzso chain zzso can be modulated through the zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso 2, which zzso its activity and is zzso by a specific zzso protein zzso termed zzso zzso Here we show that zzso directly zzso zzso zzso and we identify the major site of zzso as zzso in a regulatory domain of zzso zzso zzso also zzso two other sites zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso We develop appropriate zzso zzso and show that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso is enhanced in intact cells under a range of conditions that activate zzso and increase the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso do not appear to be zzso by zzso within zzso Although zzso appear to contain a distinct zzso of zzso zzso it also contains a site corresponding to zzso that is zzso by zzso in zzso zzso that activate zzso and increase zzso zzso within cells increase the activity of zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso may provide a key link between cellular energy status and the zzso of protein zzso a major consumer of zzso zzso
