zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory system controls expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism including zzso and nitrogen fixation zzso The zzso zzso which are located immediately downstream of the zzso zzso code for a zzso system of unknown zzso zzso of zzso starts within the zzso zzso region as shown by primer extension analysis, but zzso zzso requires, in addition, the promoter of the zzso zzso While zzso and zzso single zzso strains were able to grow with either zzso or zzso as sole nitrogen source, a zzso double zzso (like a zzso zzso was no longer able to use zzso or zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso can substitute for each other as zzso towards the response regulator zzso
