The zzso gene of the zzso zzso has a zzso usage that is unusual for plant zzso zzso In the present study the evolutionary status of this zzso usage is tested by reconstructing putative ancestral zzso sequences to determine the pattern of change in zzso bias during zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso biases of the ancestral genes are much stronger than all extant flowering plant zzso zzso This is related to previous work that demonstrated a significant increase in synonymous substitution in zzso relative to other zzso zzso It is suggested, based on the two lines of evidence, that the zzso bias of this gene currently is not being maintained by zzso Rather, the zzso zzso bias simply may be a remnant of an ancestral zzso bias that now is being zzso by the zzso bias of the zzso zzso in other words, that the zzso gene is not at zzso A model for the evolution of selective pressure on the zzso usage of plant zzso genes is zzso
