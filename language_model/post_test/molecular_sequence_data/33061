In plants, zzso zzso zzso are considered to play crucial roles during development and in the zzso response to various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be divided into three zzso based on sequence similarity of their zzso zzso zzso The current study focuses on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are regarded as ideal candidates for monitoring cell wall integrity and are possibly functional in zzso zzso An inventory of the zzso zzso gene family is presented zzso It consists of 45 members including three that were recently zzso two zzso zzso truncated zzso one of which has two in tandem zzso zzso zzso trees derived from full-length zzso acid sequence alignments were highly zzso to zzso that were purely based on zzso motifs or zzso zzso The zzso allowed zzso of the zzso genes and hence a new proposal for gene nomenclature was zzso In addition, a comprehensive expression analysis was executed by exploring public zzso This revealed that several zzso genes are zzso expressed during plant growth and zzso Moreover, multiple zzso appear to be induced upon treatment with zzso and pathogen zzso Variation in gene expression was also zzso in zzso of diverse zzso zzso Taken together, this study provides a zzso overview of the zzso gene family and an up-to-date zzso using a novel and systematic gene zzso
