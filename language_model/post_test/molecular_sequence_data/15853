The primary sequence zzso has been found in a number of proteins which bind to cell surface zzso Studies with synthetic peptides have shown that the presence of charged side chains alone is not sufficient to zzso binding zzso Application of folding zzso to proteins and peptides having similar sequences indicates that binding activity is strongly correlated with the presence of two or more closely spaced zzso that each have a high probability of initiating a zzso zzso zzso studies on the zzso zzso whose sequence is contained in zzso and which also shows binding activity, demonstrate that it adopts an unusual zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso solution show that the two zzso zzso of zzso and zzso exchange very zzso zzso modeling using restrained molecular dynamics and energy zzso results in zzso that include two zzso of type zzso or zzso zzso bonds zzso and zzso fully consistent with constraints imposed by zzso and zzso zzso It is suggested that this unusual secondary structure provides an additional specificity zzso
