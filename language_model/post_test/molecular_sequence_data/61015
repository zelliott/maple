The zzso of components of the zzso factors such as zzso or zzso is essential for a zzso response of zzso cells during zzso The activity of such zzso is under zzso zzso The function of zzso is additionally modulated by the zzso zzso Here, we studied the expression of the zzso zzso the zzso protein in the sponge zzso zzso These animals contain high levels of zzso in their zzso zzso To understand the switch from zzso zzso cells to zzso mortal cells which undergo zzso the expression of the zzso gene was measured in this zzso The zzso termed zzso zzso the zzso protein was isolated from zzso zzso its zzso zzso long open reading frame encodes a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the sponge zzso protein revealed that it is closely related to other zzso zzso zzso and distinct from sequences of zzso or zzso Our investigations demonstrated that in zzso as well as in zzso tissue the expression of the zzso gene is significantly higher than in tissue which zzso induced zzso The level of the zzso protein even decreases drastically in cells that are induced to zzso zzso by zzso We suggest therefore that one event that is involved in the transition of sponge cells from their zzso zzso to the mortal zzso state may be the zzso of the zzso zzso a putative tumor zzso zzso
