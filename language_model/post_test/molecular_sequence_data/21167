The zzso cold zzso gene zzso is involved in the zzso response to low zzso This gene is zzso at the zzso level when zzso zzso flies are exposed 1 day to 15 zzso zzso (or zzso is a member of the zzso zzso In the current study, we characterized the members of this gene family in the 12 zzso species with available complete zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in all the zzso zzso species (9 of the 12 zzso and their presence was further confirmed in three other species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, only zzso was present in the species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analysis and the molecular organization of zzso that is a zzso zzso gene support that zzso arose by a zzso event from the ancestral zzso gene after the split of the zzso and zzso zzso but before the zzso zzso After the zzso event, the zzso fixation rate increased in the branch leading to zzso (but not to zzso suggesting the zzso of the former zzso Thus, zzso would have maintained the ancestral gene function, and zzso would have acquired a new function likely related to zzso zzso and cold zzso zzso evolution of zzso has been affected by its implication in the zzso response to cold zzso Indeed, the gene has evolved under stronger zzso selection in the temperate than in the tropical zzso species, as reflected by the ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso This result is consistent with functional constraints acting on the zzso protein to keep species adaptation to temperate zzso zzso and zzso also differ in their expression zzso The expression profile of zzso is similar to that of the anterior fat body protein gene zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is also a member of the zzso gene zzso zzso similarity and expression profile suggest that zzso and zzso are indeed zzso zzso
