New zzso genes zzso zzso were discovered when zzso DNA isolated from various animal species was amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso based on sequences of rabbit zzso From sequencing analysis of the products of zzso we found that zzso are present in several genes zzso zzso in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso were specific to genes zzso zzso and were not present in genes zzso zzso In addition, the sequences of the zzso were different from one zzso To confirm the results of our initial experiments, we isolated and zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso The gene for zzso from zzso contained an zzso whose sequence was the same as that identified by zzso and the gene formed a cluster with a corresponding zzso Several DNA regions of zzso zzso containing this cluster appeared to be zzso arrayed in the zzso zzso By contrast, the gene zzso zzso did not contain an zzso as shown also by zzso The zzso that corresponded to the analyzed gene was isolated and zzso The present study provides the first example of an zzso gene zzso a zzso in zzso and suggests the zzso of zzso in such genes in higher zzso
