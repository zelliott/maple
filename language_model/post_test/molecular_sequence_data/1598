zzso is a novel vaccine candidate recently identified in zzso zzso and involved in zzso to host zzso The zzso gene has been found in approximately 50% of the strains isolated from patients and in three of the four zzso lineages of zzso A zzso Here we investigated the presence of the zzso gene in 154 zzso strains isolated from healthy people zzso zzso Only 25 zzso of the 154 carrier zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso species zzso zzso was also found not to have the zzso zzso zzso of the carrier strains belonged to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that only the zzso of the genuine carrier population actually zzso zzso (7 of 136 zzso Five of the seven strains zzso a novel zzso of the zzso gene that was designated zzso The zzso protein was present on the bacterial surface as zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso protein were zzso against zzso zzso whereas the activity against other zzso zzso was zzso In conclusion, the zzso gene zzso differently in the population of strains isolated from healthy individuals and in the population of strains isolated from zzso The presence of zzso can therefore be used as a tool to study the dynamics of zzso infections and understand why this zzso which is mostly a zzso can become a severe zzso
