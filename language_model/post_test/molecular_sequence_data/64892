zzso acids zzso are toxic organic chemicals that are frequently detected in surface waters and in drinking water distribution zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was investigated in serum bottles containing a single zzso and zzso with washed zzso obtained from enrichment cultures maintained on either zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso as the sole carbon and energy zzso zzso was observed for each of the zzso tested at zzso similar to those found in surface waters and in drinking water distribution zzso The zzso culture was able to degrade both zzso and zzso acid zzso with zzso order rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, for zzso ranging from zzso to 2 zzso The zzso order rate constant for zzso degradation by the zzso culture was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso culture was also able to degrade zzso with the rate accelerating as incubation time zzso zzso with zzso zzso indicated that the zzso was primarily converted to zzso with minor incorporation into cell zzso The community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene fragments showed that each of the two enrichment cultures had multiple bacterial zzso none of which corresponded to zzso bacteria cultivated on zzso zzso zzso This research indicates that zzso is a potential loss mechanism for zzso in surface waters and in drinking water distribution zzso
