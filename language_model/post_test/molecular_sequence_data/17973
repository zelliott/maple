The B zzso portion of zzso toxin zzso is a safe and effective oral zzso agent in humans, zzso protection against both zzso and zzso caused by zzso zzso coli producing zzso toxin zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso may also be used as a carrier of various zzso zzso suitable for oral zzso To facilitate large-scale production of zzso for vaccine development purposes, we have constructed zzso zzso systems for zzso proteins in which the zzso gene is under the control of strong foreign zzso promoters and in which it is also possible to fuse zzso to the zzso gene and thereby achieve zzso of hybrid proteins zzso and Holmgren, zzso zzso et zzso zzso We here expand these findings by describing zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso promoter as well as by the zzso zzso promoter, and also by describing gene zzso leading to zzso of several hybrid proteins between zzso zzso coli zzso zzso peptides to either the zzso or zzso ends of zzso Each of the hybrid zzso when tested as zzso in zzso zzso significant zzso as well as zzso zzso formation, although the zzso zzso levels attained zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso were too low to give more than partial zzso of zzso zzso challenge in baby zzso The hybrid proteins also had a zzso zzso as apparent from their zzso nature and their strong zzso with both a zzso zzso against the B zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
