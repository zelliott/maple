zzso terminals contain highly organized zzso structures to facilitate neurotransmitter zzso In zzso zzso the typical zzso terminal has an zzso active zone surrounded by synaptic zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene result in zzso structured zzso terminals in zzso zzso junctions zzso most often zzso as a single zzso terminal containing multiple active zzso The zzso protein has an zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso is most similar to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso is localized to the zzso region independent of synaptic zzso and functions cell zzso The zzso period of zzso zzso with the time of zzso zzso may regulate the spatial arrangement, or restrict the formation, of zzso zzso
