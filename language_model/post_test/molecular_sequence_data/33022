The whole DNA sequences of 2 zzso zzso strains isolated from the blood of a cancer patient zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The 2 zzso exhibit extensive zzso but each is punctuated by about 40 zzso islands zzso which vary in size from 3 to zzso and may zzso up to about 50 zzso A large set of smaller DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to genetic zzso in a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso potentially zzso several proteins zzso interactions with the environment such as zzso zzso zzso components of type I and IV zzso systems, and zzso proteins having a role in metal and/or drug zzso The presence of specific zzso in the zzso zzso population was monitored by zzso and zzso zzso Data suggest that some islands are present at sites different from those identified in zzso and that alternative islands may be integrated at mapped zzso
