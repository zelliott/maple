We performed detailed DNA sequencing analysis on type III collagen zzso from 58 patients with either zzso artery zzso or cervical artery zzso The 58 patients were of seven different zzso among the patients were three pairs of relatives, so that 55 were zzso and of these, 29 had at least one blood relative with either an zzso artery aneurysm or a cervical artery zzso The age of the patients at the time of diagnosis ranged from 15 to 68 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The study group consisted of 25 males and 33 zzso The analysis covered zzso zzso of significant zzso sequences per zzso therefore, we analyzed as many as zzso zzso zzso in the coding sequences for the zzso domain of type III collagen were excluded in 40 individuals with zzso zzso and 18 individuals with cervical artery zzso zzso sequencing of zzso chain reaction products allowed zzso to be excluded with a high degree of zzso zzso that markedly decreased expression from one zzso were also excluded in 42 of the 58 individuals, since the presence of both bases at one or more zzso sites in the 42 patients showed that two zzso were zzso The results indicated that zzso in the gene for type III zzso zzso are not a common cause of either zzso artery zzso or cervical artery zzso
