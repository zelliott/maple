In zzso studies with primary human pancreatic zzso suggest that several zzso zzso are able to zzso and replicate in beta zzso Some zzso strains are highly zzso in zzso whereas others show virus replication with no apparent zzso zzso The capability to induce zzso destruction is determined only partially by the virus zzso since strain specific differences have been detected within some zzso including zzso 9 zzso In this study, the viral genetic factors determining the outcome of zzso infection zzso destructive zzso zzso were investigated by constructing parallel infectious clones of zzso zzso strain that was isolated from a small child at the clinical onset of type 1 zzso The capabilities of these zzso viruses to induce zzso destruction were monitored and the zzso potential of clones was modified by zzso zzso The zzso capabilities of these zzso viruses in human pancreatic zzso were modified by a single zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso protein zzso The data presented outline the importance of zzso acid point zzso in the zzso process leading to zzso zzso However, although the zzso acid substitution zzso zzso the zzso capabilities of zzso zzso zzso zzso it is likely that additional viral genetic zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso exist in other zzso zzso
