The zzso zzso zzso domain has been found to date exclusively in zzso zzso In humans, three copies of the domain are present in zzso five copies in zzso and six copies each in zzso zzso zzso I and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso These zzso are predicted to have arisen from gene zzso followed by gene zzso to result in the zzso zzso The subsequent loss of one, two or three zzso produced the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we conducted zzso and hidden zzso based searches of zzso and zzso databases to identify novel zzso domain containing zzso The variety in zzso suggests that the zzso domain has been tested in many molecular constructions during zzso Of particular note is zzso I protein zzso from zzso zzso which combines a zzso rich repeats zzso domain, seven zzso zzso and a zzso domain, thus combining many of the features of zzso I with those of zzso or zzso As such, the zzso domain zzso appears to have developed along complex zzso The distribution of these proteins was analyzed in the zzso completely zzso zzso mapped onto the tree of life, and zzso trees of the proteins were constructed to gain insight into their zzso zzso 2013 zzso zzso zzso
