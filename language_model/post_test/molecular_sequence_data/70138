In an effort to understand the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso agents which significantly increase zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes, formed by zzso and zzso which bind to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso seem zzso related to zzso gene expression in response to zzso However, although zzso DNA binding activity is strongly induced following exposure of zzso to zzso zzso gene expression in response to zzso does not correlate well with zzso activity and is not inhibited by zzso DNA to zzso and zzso We zzso that there is a zzso factor involved in zzso gene expression and that this factor competes with the binding of the zzso complex to its target response zzso
