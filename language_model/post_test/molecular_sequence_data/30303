To study the regulatory sequence elements responsible for zzso gene zzso we constructed a zzso gene containing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence and zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso gene fused to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso by the calcium zzso procedure into primary mouse zzso zzso cells prepared from pregnant zzso The zzso procedure had negligible effect on expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene required the synergistic actions of insulin, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene also depended on the appropriate zzso because the degree of hormonal induction of the zzso gene was much higher in cells cultured on a zzso basement membrane zzso than in cells cultured on either type I collagen gel or zzso On the other hand, the expression of a zzso virus zzso zzso gene in which the zzso gene was driven by the early promoter of the virus was not influenced by the hormonal milieu and occurred at the highest level in cells cultured on zzso Additional zzso experiments with a series of zzso zzso suggested the existence of regulatory elements responsible for hormonal induction and negative regulatory zzso
