To ensure accurate and rapid protein zzso nearby and zzso located functional regions of the zzso must zzso communicate and coordinate with one another through a series of information exchange zzso The zzso is approximately 2/3 zzso and information should pass mostly through this zzso Here, two viable zzso located in the zzso center zzso of zzso zzso were created using a zzso genetic system that enables stable production of zzso containing only zzso zzso The specific zzso were zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and genetic analyses of these zzso suggest that they may trap the zzso in the zzso or zzso bound zzso decreasing zzso zzso We suggest that these structural changes are zzso at the biological level by affecting large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso joining during zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the ability of zzso to properly decode termination zzso These studies also add to our understanding of how information is transmitted both locally and over long distances through zzso networks of zzso and zzso zzso
