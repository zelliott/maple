The zzso zzso zzso was first described as a DNA binding activity that specifically recognizes an 8 zzso motif known to be essential for zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso activity has also been found in cell lines which do not express erythropoietin, suggesting that zzso is part of a widespread oxygen sensing zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso zzso DNA binding activity is only zzso in nuclear extracts of cells cultivated in a low oxygen zzso In addition to zzso a zzso DNA binding activity also specifically binds the zzso zzso Here we report that zzso and zzso zzso efficiently zzso for binding of the zzso probe to this zzso factor, whereas zzso activity itself remained zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso binding factors zzso and zzso zzso the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso the zzso factor, while zzso and zzso family members, which constitute the zzso factor, were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins bound zzso zzso either as zzso or as zzso indicating a new binding specificity for zzso Finally, reporter gene zzso in zzso cells treated with either a zzso analogue or a zzso zzso suggest that the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso is involved in oxygen zzso
