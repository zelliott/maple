zzso zzso zzso can induce the expression of genes in response to zzso by binding to zzso response elements in the promoters of target zzso There is growing evidence that zzso can alter patterns of gene expression in response to zzso by regulating the activity of other factors through a direct zzso zzso To identify other factors that are regulated by zzso a zzso zzso screen was performed that identified a novel zzso zinc finger protein named zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso box domain and six zzso zinc zzso zzso from the zzso gene can have alternate zzso zzso and zzso either a zzso or zzso zzso The zzso protein interacts strongly with zzso in the presence of zzso whereas the zzso zzso has a zzso zzso domain that zzso the interaction with zzso A consensus zzso binding element was defined using zzso binding site zzso In zzso cells, both the zzso and zzso zzso can activate zzso through the zzso binding zzso however, in the presence of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is specifically zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was able to abrogate zzso by zzso zzso of zzso was largely restricted to the zzso zzso with a lower level of expression in the zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel zinc finger zzso factor in which regulation of zzso in zzso cells can be controlled by the relative level of expression of two distinct zzso
