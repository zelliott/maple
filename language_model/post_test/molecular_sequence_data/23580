Type II zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and animals have been known to regulate the level of zzso and thereby influence various cellular activities, such as zzso trafficking and zzso zzso In plants, little is known about the zzso involved in zzso of zzso and roles of type II zzso in plant cellular functions have not yet been zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso which encodes a type II zzso plays an essential role in the secondary wall synthesis in fiber cells and zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused a dramatic reduction in secondary wall thickness and a zzso decrease in stem zzso These zzso were associated with an zzso in zzso organization in fiber zzso zzso with the defective fiber and vessel zzso the zzso gene was found to be highly expressed in fiber cells and vascular zzso in zzso The zzso protein is composed of two zzso an zzso localized zzso domain and a zzso localized zzso zzso zzso In zzso activity zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity toward zzso zzso and zzso with the highest zzso affinity toward zzso The zzso zzso zzso which caused an zzso acid substitution in the zzso motif II of the zzso zzso domain, completely abolished the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso levels of zzso and zzso were found to be elevated in zzso zzso Together, our findings suggest that the zzso type II zzso is involved in zzso metabolism and influences secondary wall synthesis and zzso zzso
