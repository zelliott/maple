Very few data are available on the molecular biology of zzso zzso zzso which have been considered in several studies as indicators of zzso zzso zzso zzso initially isolated from an urban sewage sample using a strain of zzso zzso zzso isolated from a clinical zzso was chosen in this study as a zzso for zzso and molecular zzso Like most of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso Its zzso has been found to be a zzso DNA zzso of approximately zzso zzso containing a rather low percentage zzso zzso of G + zzso The ends of the zzso appeared not to be cohesive but zzso with a terminal zzso of zzso A zzso map was zzso Three major proteins zzso out of 15 peptides in the zzso profile were selected for zzso zzso From these data, zzso zzso were designed to locate the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by electron zzso revealed that zzso and MP3 were structural proteins of the zzso head and that zzso was a constituent of the zzso A zzso library of the zzso was prepared, and a clone including the zzso zzso was identified and zzso
