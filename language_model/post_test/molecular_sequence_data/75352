Analysis of the zzso T cell response to synthetic peptides representing the zzso 23 zzso acids from the zzso zzso D sequence revealed two zzso zzso for T zzso one localized between zzso zzso and the other between zzso zzso The zzso site, which is zzso was recognized in the context of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso site, which is zzso was recognized in the context of the zzso zzso The zzso response was found to be highly zzso zzso in that T cell zzso specific for the zzso zzso responded to zzso on zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso mice and showed differences in zzso fine specificity with zzso of different zzso These data support the idea of zzso zzso
