A real-time zzso zzso was developed using a zzso probe to detect and zzso zzso syndrome virus zzso in zzso zzso A pair of zzso zzso which amplify a 72 zzso DNA fragment, and a zzso probe were selected from open reading frame 1 zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso probe used in this zzso reacted with zzso zzso from Hawaii, Texas, Colombia, Mexico, Belize, Indonesia, and zzso but neither with zzso of healthy shrimp nor with an isolate of yellow head zzso A zzso zzso that contains the target zzso sequence was constructed and used to generate positive control zzso through in zzso zzso The positive control zzso was used to demonstrate that the real-time zzso zzso has a detection limit of 100 copies and a zzso range up to zzso copies of zzso zzso This quantitative method was found to be highly zzso with low zzso and zzso zzso zzso of variation zzso values were zzso and zzso respectively, for replicates within and among zzso This zzso was used to zzso zzso in both acutely and chronically infected shrimp in a laboratory zzso The quantities of zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso were not significantly different, and there was no difference in zzso levels between the acutely and chronically infected zzso However, in the chronically infected shrimp, the quantities of zzso were one to two orders of magnitude higher in the zzso organ than in either zzso or zzso This zzso proved to be specific with high sensitivity, and it can be used to detect and zzso zzso in shrimp zzso
