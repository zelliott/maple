zzso virus, isolated from mosquitoes and zzso was tentatively classified as a member of the family zzso Here we show that zzso virus is inhibited by the zzso zzso protein of mice which selectively blocks the growth of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso virus zzso is characterized by zzso of viral proteins in the nucleus and by budding of viral particles from the cell zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso viruses revealed a zzso relationship of these zzso as previously also proposed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso virus zzso and zzso genes were amplified by zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were similar to the corresponding zzso virus zzso zzso zzso virus should be classified into the newly established zzso zzso of the family zzso Finally, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso is a reliable marker in the hunt for new family zzso
