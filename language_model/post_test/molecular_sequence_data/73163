The zzso for soybean zzso a zzso was cloned from a root zzso zzso library and expressed in zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso was determined at a resolution of zzso zzso Rate zzso for zzso CO and NO binding to zzso zzso are identical with those of native soybean zzso Rate zzso for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were compared with those of zzso whale zzso At 37 degrees C and pH 7, soybean zzso is much less stable than zzso whale zzso due both to a fourfold higher rate of zzso and to a approximately zzso lower affinity for zzso The role of zzso in regulating oxygen binding was examined by zzso zzso Replacement of zzso with Ala, Val or zzso causes little change in the equilibrium constant for zzso binding to soybean zzso whereas the same zzso in zzso whale zzso cause 50 to zzso decreases in zzso These results show that, at neutral zzso hydrogen bonding with zzso is much less important in regulating zzso binding to the soybean zzso The zzso to zzso zzso does cause a significant decrease in zzso for zzso apparently due to zzso hindrance of the bound zzso The rate zzso for zzso zzso from zzso and native zzso decrease significantly with decreasing zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso rate zzso for zzso with zzso zzso zzso are independent of zzso suggesting that hydrogen bonding to the zzso zzso zzso in the native protein is enhanced under acid zzso All of these results support the hypothesis that the high affinity of zzso for oxygen and other zzso is determined primarily by enhanced accessibility and zzso of the zzso zzso
