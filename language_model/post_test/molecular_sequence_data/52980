The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays critical roles in executing zzso stress response by binding to the regulatory DNA sequence zzso recognition zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso partner of the zzso zzso zzso We show here how zzso is regulated by an zzso zzso conditional nuclear zzso In cultured cells, zzso was localized in zzso through its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso The CLS directed zzso zzso nuclear export of reporter zzso suggesting its dependence on the nuclear exporter zzso zzso However, the CLS sequence does not bear a resemblance to the zzso class of nuclear export zzso and zzso analysis indicated that a stretch of zzso zzso acids is essential for its zzso zzso zzso aborted the CLS activity and induced nuclear zzso of zzso Whereas zzso stress is known to activate zzso transcription, zzso of zzso in cultured cells silenced the zzso of zzso The results suggest that zzso mediates zzso communication to couple zzso stress and zzso repression in zzso zzso
