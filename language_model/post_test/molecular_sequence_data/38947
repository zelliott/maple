The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the articulate zzso zzso zzso is zzso Being one of the smallest of known zzso zzso it has an extremely compact gene zzso While the same 13 zzso two zzso and 22 zzso are zzso as in most other animal zzso lengthy zzso regions are zzso with the longest apparent zzso sequence being 54 zzso in zzso zzso sequence zzso are zzso and several stop zzso are zzso The genes are generally zzso and three of the zzso genes are the shortest among known zzso All of the zzso genes indicate size reduction in either or both of the putative zzso and zzso arms compared with standard zzso zzso of a TV zzso zzso zzso replacement loop is zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso arm appears to be zzso not only in zzso and zzso but also in zzso zzso and zzso a novel zzso All the genes are zzso in the same DNA zzso which has a base composition rich in zzso and zzso The zzso has an overall gene arrangement drastically different from that of any other organisms so far reported, but contains several short zzso composed of 2-3 zzso which are found in other zzso zzso Combined zzso of such gene zzso indicates that the zzso zzso zzso is similar to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso each with statistical zzso zzso accepted schemes of zzso zzso suggest that the similarity with the zzso could have arisen through a process of zzso evolution, while it appears likely that the similarities with the zzso and the zzso reflect zzso zzso
