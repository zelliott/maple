The ubiquitous zzso system, which is composed of two zzso removes cellular zzso zzso zzso In an effort to identify critical zzso zzso in the evolution of the first zzso in this system, zzso I zzso as well as the structural implications of sequence zzso in this zzso a search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information zzso database of unfinished zzso was zzso Eleven putative zzso sequences from zzso organisms were identified and analyses of these sequences in relation to the known and previously identified zzso zzso were zzso Several of these sequences show a very high similarity to the zzso coli zzso zzso most notably the zzso identity of the sequence identified from zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso In addition to the conservation of zzso critical to binding the zzso metal in all of the proposed zzso zzso four regions in the Homo sapiens zzso zzso are absent in all of the bacterial zzso zzso with the exception of zzso zzso zzso of these regions may alter the zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso in relation to that of the zzso zzso These differences may be targeted for the development of zzso selective to the bacterial zzso
