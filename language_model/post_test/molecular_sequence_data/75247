zzso located several zzso both zzso and 3' of the zzso transcribed portion of several genes zzso to zzso pure fragments of the alternating sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso The genes include the zzso DNA of zzso zzso and human, and also human zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has additional zzso sequences in zzso zzso that include the zzso sequences and up to 300 zzso of adjoining DNA show perfect runs of zzso zzso than zzso in all but the human zzso region of zzso which shows a somewhat different alternating zzso zzso zzso zzso Within 150 zzso of these sequences in various instances are found a number of other sequences reported to affect DNA zzso in model zzso Most marked is an enhancement of sequences matching at least zzso to the consensus binding sequence for zzso zzso Two to zzso less of such sequences were found in other zzso portions of the zzso zzso or in the transcribed portion of zzso The conservation of the locations of tracts of alternating zzso between zzso diverse species is consistent with a possible functional role for these zzso
