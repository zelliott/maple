To determine the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

Fourteen zzso medical zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso patients, zzso of whom had persistent disease after zzso surgery or zzso 

zzso zzso 100 zzso or zzso every 8 hours for 4 zzso Four weeks after the end of treatment, patients were zzso to receive 100 or 250 zzso zzso zzso every 8 hours for 6 zzso 

After 2 weeks of treatment, a single zzso injection reduced mean serum growth hormone zzso to zzso of the zzso concentration within 2 zzso The integrated mean zzso level was reduced over 8 hours from 39 zzso 11 zzso to 9 zzso 2 zzso zzso less than zzso Mean plasma zzso growth zzso zzso was reduced from zzso zzso 400 zzso to zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso less than zzso After 6 months, the mean zzso was reduced from 39 zzso 13 to 15 zzso 4 zzso by 300 zzso of zzso and from 29 zzso 5 zzso to 9 zzso 2 zzso by 750 zzso of zzso zzso The mean IGF-1 concentration was suppressed to zzso zzso 300 and zzso zzso 400 zzso after 300 and 750 zzso zzso zzso Integrated mean zzso levels were reduced to zzso 5 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso and IGF-1 levels were normal in zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso of patients receiving low- and high-dose zzso zzso A substantial decrease in headache, amount of zzso joint pain, and finger circumference occurred in two thirds of the zzso The zzso size was reduced in zzso zzso zzso to zzso and 37% zzso zzso to zzso of patients receiving 6 months of low- and high-dose zzso zzso Ten percent and zzso of patients in each treatment group developed transient zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso effectively decreased zzso and IGF-1 zzso in zzso and zzso of patients, zzso The higher dose resulted in increased frequency of tumor shrinkage but added no zzso or clinical zzso
