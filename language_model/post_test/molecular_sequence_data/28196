We have identified a composite element, zzso in zzso zzso that is ca zzso zzso in length and contains two zzso sequences as long terminal zzso According to zzso zzso zzso occurs in low but varying copy number (one to four zzso in different zzso zzso By several criteria, zzso is a novel type of zzso which is similar but not related to the other Ty elements in zzso Two zzso clones from strain zzso zzso and zzso carrying individual copies of zzso were zzso By restriction analysis and zzso sequence we show that zzso derives from the zzso right arm hot zzso of zzso III zzso The analysis of zzso revealed that an zzso zzso gene is present at this locus and that an unusual concentration of different Ty elements has zzso in addition to the zzso a zzso and a zzso element were detected in this region, confirming its highly zzso zzso
