The zzso status of two bacterial strains isolated from human blood was characterized using a zzso zzso zzso investigations revealed the presence of zzso zzso IV, zzso zzso acids that zzso with those extracted from members of the zzso zzso and that produce zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso fatty acids on zzso zzso and zzso zzso with nine zzso units as the zzso zzso The generic assignment was confirmed by zzso zzso gene zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that these zzso constitute a distinct zzso line within the zzso zzso displaying zzso and zzso % sequence similarities to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The two zzso could be distinguished from the type strains of the latter species on the basis of several zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data show that the strains merit zzso as a novel species of zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
