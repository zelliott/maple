A series of zzso expression plasmids which comprise segments of the zzso sequences zzso rat zzso II alpha have been zzso The zzso of these zzso is under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the cloned rat zzso II alpha zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso as well as a deletion zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso acids and/or 158 zzso zzso acids of rat zzso II alpha had no effect on its ability functionally to substitute for zzso Moreover, a zzso construct with zzso putative zzso zzso domain zzso acids zzso retained the zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso capable of conditional zzso II alpha expression can be exploited as a useful model system for studies on the zzso relationships of zzso and zzso zzso II zzso as well as the interplay of potential zzso drugs with the zzso
