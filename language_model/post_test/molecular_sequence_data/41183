zzso containing only zzso and zzso zzso is expressed in the serum of some birds and zzso such as ducks and zzso The duck zzso is produced by the same zzso gene that expresses the intact zzso form zzso using different zzso termination zzso In this study, we show that intact zzso and zzso are zzso by distinct genes in the zzso turtle zzso zzso zzso At least eight zzso and five zzso transcripts were found in a single zzso Together with Southern zzso our data suggest that multiple genes zzso both zzso forms are present in the turtle zzso Both of the zzso forms were detected in the serum using rabbit zzso zzso In addition, we show that multiple copies of the turtle zzso gene are present in the zzso and that alternative zzso is extensively involved in the generation of both the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso H chain zzso Although a single zzso gene was identified, the zzso gene was not identified in this zzso
