zzso to chemically induced lung zzso has previously been mapped to a zzso zzso of 27 zzso in the zzso class III region of the mouse using two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three genes are located within this zzso zzso zzso a viral envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a gene with unknown zzso A 70 zzso zzso spanning the 27 zzso region and extending 20 zzso either side, was constructed from zzso zzso libraries with zzso zzso derived from mouse strains zzso and zzso The region was analyzed for zzso zzso which would facilitate further fine mapping of the zzso Analysis of the expression levels of the candidate genes did not reveal any difference between zzso and zzso In addition, no differences were found at the sequence level in the 27 zzso zzso except for an A to T transition in zzso 7 of zzso A database comparison of the sequence surrounding this zzso did not identify any zzso or zzso consensus zzso In conclusion, the previously observed zzso could not be associated with or assigned to any of the candidate genes zzso zzso zzso or zzso nor could any of the other zzso zzso which have been reported to map to this region ( zzso zzso zzso and zzso
