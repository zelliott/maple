We undertook to identify the zzso involved in the in zzso degradation of the 100 zzso zzso toxin zzso from zzso zzso zzso and isolated a zzso zzso zzso gene flanked upstream by a typical zzso zzso binding site and downstream by a strong zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso encodes a 432 zzso acid protein with significant zzso throughout its sequence to two zzso zzso zzso from the Antarctic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso sequence suggests that the zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso a partially characterized zzso zzso from zzso zzso Only zzso zzso strains which produce zzso zzso activity zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso may be responsible for or contribute to the degradation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso with zzso activity and similar properties to zzso was also zzso from zzso cultures of zzso zzso zzso Further studies are needed to determine the relationship of this zzso to zzso and to the predicted product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
