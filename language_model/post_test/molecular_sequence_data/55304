In this study, the zzso hormone zzso genes in spotted zzso were cloned and zzso by zzso their zzso The species expressed three molecular forms of zzso in the brain: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis divided the molecular forms of zzso into three zzso zzso branch, zzso branch, and zzso zzso zzso The spatial expression showed that they had the highest expression levels in the zzso zzso was exclusively detected in the brain, while zzso had a global expression pattern in all examined zzso zzso was detected in the brain, zzso and zzso The zzso changes of brain zzso zzso expression levels were examined during zzso maturation and zzso and the serum steroid hormones and zzso index zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso substantially elevated zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso which zzso with considerable zzso of zzso and serum steroids zzso On the contrary, neither zzso nor zzso zzso levels showed significant changes during zzso maturation in this zzso These results suggested that these three zzso genes are the important regulators for the differential expression of zzso in spotted zzso and would help us better understand the zzso zzso mechanism of spotted zzso
