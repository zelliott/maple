zzso in the pore domain of the human zzso gene zzso zzso channel are associated with higher risk of sudden zzso However, in many zzso clinical presentation is zzso making it hard to predict zzso We hypothesized that in zzso zzso of the intrinsic severity of individual zzso can assist with risk zzso 

We analyzed 2 zzso pore domain zzso zzso and zzso Similar to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not traffic to the plasma membrane but could zzso with zzso zzso and resulted in a dominant negative suppression of zzso current zzso The zzso zzso traffic normally but have abnormal zzso zzso Computer models of human zzso zzso action zzso zzso incorporating zzso models of the zzso zzso indicate that zzso channels would cause more severe zzso zzso than that seen with zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso are 2 pore domain zzso that involve the same change in zzso but have very different in zzso zzso zzso causes a dominant negative trafficking zzso whereas zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso where the cause of disease can be exclusively attributed to enhanced zzso The zzso zzso is zzso more severe than the zzso zzso consistent with the overall clinical presentation in the 2 small zzso studied zzso Further investigation, involving a larger number of zzso to test the hypothesis that in zzso zzso of the intrinsic severity of a given zzso will assist with risk zzso is therefore zzso
