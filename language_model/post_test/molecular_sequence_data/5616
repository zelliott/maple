zzso of membrane proteins involves their recruitment into plasma membrane zzso pits, with which they are thought to interact by binding to zzso zzso protein zzso To investigate the interactions of membrane proteins with coated pits at the cell surface, we applied image correlation zzso to measure directly and zzso the zzso of influenza zzso zzso protein zzso carrying specific zzso zzso zzso The zzso system enables direct comparison between isolated zzso signals, because zzso itself is excluded from coated zzso The studies presented here zzso for the first time, a direct quantitative measure for the degree of zzso of membrane proteins in coated pits at the cell zzso The degree of zzso depended on the strength of the zzso signal and on the integrity of the zzso zzso and correlated with the zzso rates of the zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso fully correlated with their ability to zzso zzso from whole cells, the first such demonstration for a membrane protein that is not a member of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Furthermore, both the zzso in coated pits and the zzso with zzso were dramatically reduced in the cold, suggesting that low temperature can interfere with the sorting of proteins into coated zzso In addition to the specific results reported here, the general zzso of the image correlation zzso approach to study any process involving the zzso or zzso of membrane receptors at the cell surface is zzso
