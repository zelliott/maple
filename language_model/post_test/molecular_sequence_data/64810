Two zzso sequences are present in the zzso zzso Both genes are expressed in flower buds and zzso nearly identical zzso which contain four zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins interact with zzso and zzso zzso zzso aimed at zzso the zzso genes at zzso triggered a zzso zzso zzso which was associated with dramatic zzso zzso We obtained the same zzso upon introduction of zzso zzso aimed at zzso the zzso gene at zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso figures we observed strongly suggest that zzso zzso is highly disturbed in these zzso cells, leaving zzso zzso events to repair the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was eliminated in zzso zzso zzso Our experiments point to an essential role of zzso at zzso in zzso We also propose a role for zzso in the zzso zzso
