zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso in the fetus was successfully accomplished using maternal blood as a source for fetal cells in three zzso at risk for zzso Lepore zzso Taking advantage of the possibility of amplifying zzso DNA fragments by zzso chain reaction and of families in which zzso Lepore was inherited by the paternal side, we demonstrated in two cases and excluded in one case the presence of this zzso in the fetus directly on maternal zzso The diagnosis was zzso with that obtained by traditional approaches in all three zzso Our results unequivocally show that zzso fetal cells are present in maternal blood during pregnancy, and demonstrate for the first time that prenatal diagnosis of a genetic disease may be feasible without invasive zzso
