zzso II zzso is a zzso zzso initially isolated from the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso The recent cloning of the zzso precursor in zzso and human has demonstrated that the zzso is not restricted to the fish zzso but that it is also expressed in the central nervous system of zzso Here, we describe the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso in mouse and zzso A comparison of the primary structures of mouse and rat zzso with those of other zzso zzso reveals that the sequence of the zzso region of the zzso zzso has been fully zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso domain of zzso has markedly zzso with only zzso sequence identity between the mouse or rat and the human zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso gene is predominantly expressed in zzso of the zzso and spinal cord, suggesting that zzso may play a role in the control of zzso zzso
