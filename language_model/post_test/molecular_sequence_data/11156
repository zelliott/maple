We previously characterized a 105 zzso zzso for human zzso zzso on zzso human zzso zzso To delineate the role of the basic cluster zzso of zzso in the interaction with zzso cells, we isolated zzso deleted zzso species of molecular mass 80 zzso lacking two, three or four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from native zzso that had been treated with zzso Native zzso bound to zzso sites on zzso cells with a zzso constant zzso of 70 zzso zzso removal of zzso zzso zzso from zzso progressively increased the binding affinity but decreased the number of binding sites on the zzso A zzso zzso zzso lacking the first five zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso sites with a zzso of 12 zzso The binding parameters of bovine zzso zzso and native zzso did not significantly zzso whereas the binding parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso resembled those of zzso Culture of zzso cells in the presence of zzso which zzso zzso decreased the number of binding sites for both native zzso and zzso but not for zzso indicating that the zzso sites include zzso zzso We propose that the interaction of zzso with a large number of binding sites zzso zzso per zzso on zzso cells is dependent on zzso but not on zzso zzso with zzso zzso binding sites per cell, presumably the zzso zzso does not require the first zzso basic cluster of zzso Moreover, the affinity of zzso for the latter binding site is enhanced zzso zzso after removal of the first basic zzso Thus zzso zzso of zzso in zzso might serve to zzso the nature of its binding to cells and thereby its effects on cellular zzso
