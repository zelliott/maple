A set of zzso zzso which allow zzso cloning and expression of zzso DNA coding sequences has been zzso The zzso contain the zzso zzso zzso promoter, a synthetic translation initiation region zzso and convenient cloning zzso The cloning sites provide all or part of an zzso translation initiation zzso and facilitate the precise fusion of target DNA sequences to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were constructed with synthetic zzso because there is evidence which suggests that the efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso present in the parental zzso depends strongly on information contained within the zzso zzso coding zzso zzso brain zzso zzso chain zzso was zzso and used to demonstrate the expression capacity of the newly constructed zzso A significant increase in expression of zzso protein was observed when synthetic zzso were used in the place of the zzso zzso zzso levels vary from zzso to zzso of total cell zzso The effects of a reported zzso zzso from zzso zzso on expression of the zzso protein are also zzso The zzso should be generally useful for high level zzso protein expression in zzso zzso
