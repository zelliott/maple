zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso cells and plays a poorly understood role in the dynamic reorganization of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed five zzso repeats that were predicted to form a beta zzso They are followed by a 130 zzso extension and a 30 zzso zzso zzso domain that is responsible for zzso of the zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of zzso zzso without the zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso forms a zzso beta zzso composed of the five predicted zzso repeats and two additional zzso that lack any zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso extension adopts an extended zzso packs tightly against the bottom surface of the zzso and is likely to be required for the structural stability of the zzso Analysis of charged and zzso surface zzso delineate possible binding sites for zzso on the beta zzso
