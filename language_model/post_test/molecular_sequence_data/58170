Human zzso type 18 zzso zzso proteins bind zinc through zzso repeats located at the C zzso of the zzso In order to examine the role of these zzso motifs in zzso function, we expressed the zzso zzso protein in bacteria and found that zzso zzso forms a zzso through interactions with zzso zzso with single zzso within the zzso motifs bound a reduced level of zinc in a zinc zzso zzso while a double zzso lost all zzso zzso When expressed in zzso none of the zzso cooperated with an activated zzso zzso to transform primary rat zzso zzso but all zzso retained nearly zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso motifs play an important role in transformation by zzso zzso but do not contribute to zzso zzso
