Eleven zzso zzso pairs were identified by searching the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence database at The Institute for zzso Research with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Each pair appears to be a potential zzso system composed of a response regulator and a sensor zzso Seven of the zzso were disrupted in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso a zzso disrupted in one of these genes zzso the first gene of the gene pair designated zzso showed delayed killing and a higher 50% lethal dose in a mouse zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein sequence showed greatest similarity to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso similar to zzso and zzso similar to zzso When grown in zzso the zzso zzso was more sensitive to low pH zzso zzso and more resistant to high temperature (55 degrees zzso than zzso zzso In conclusion, many potential zzso systems are identified for zzso zzso one of which, zzso was shown to be involved in stress response and zzso
