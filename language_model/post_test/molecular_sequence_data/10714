zzso artificial zzso zzso clones have been successfully zzso to generate a zzso zzso map of the long arm of human zzso 21 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso where five genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are mapped is a zzso region and needs to be characterized in further zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were characterized previously by a functional zzso expression zzso and two new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso located at zzso whose zzso sizes are 800 zzso and 1,500 zzso respectively, were used in this zzso To obtain more markers useful for making a detailed physical map of the region, a zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso was used to screen the 3 zzso 1 S zzso zzso As a result three anonymous zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso were zzso In an attempt to make a detailed physical map of the region, the locations of five known genes as well as the three new markers were determined on the four zzso by Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso contained all markers except zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained three markers zzso zzso and zzso four markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent 1,500 zzso of the zzso zzso and half of the 3 zzso 1 S region, so it should be very useful for studying the zzso region of the human zzso functionally and zzso
