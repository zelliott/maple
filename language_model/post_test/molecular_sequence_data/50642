zzso with the zzso zzso and BK is ubiquitous in the human population and zzso is the only virus associated with the central nervous system disease progressive zzso zzso In the attempt to analyze the zzso of zzso infections we asked whether human zzso invade the brain during zzso Brain autopsy material from 67 individuals with disorders other than zzso was examined for the presence of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated zzso full-length virus zzso in healthy brain tissue in about zzso of the zzso zzso analysis with zzso chain reaction and sequencing confirmed these zzso Additionally, the presence of zzso DNA sequences covering an early gene zzso and the control region with zzso early and late protein coding sequences was zzso Cloning of the complete zzso zzso from two cases supported the assumption that not only full-length zzso DNA was present in those tissue specimens but also zzso zzso The data obtained demonstrate that dual infection of the brain with the zzso zzso and zzso is a common event and give strong evidence that both viruses frequently establish a zzso zzso zzso
