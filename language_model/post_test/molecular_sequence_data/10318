A novel protein zzso by the zzso gene in zzso locus zzso was characterized by zzso This zzso region is known to contain genes for human diseases such as zzso zzso zzso deafness zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced against the zzso peptides deduced from the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of the obtained zzso was tested with primary cells or established cell zzso On western zzso the zzso zzso recognized a single protein product of 25 zzso expressed in cell lines of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of several human zzso indicated the ubiquitous expression of the zzso zzso studies and zzso with a zzso dye suggest the zzso zzso of the protein to zzso zzso zzso is also predicted by computer analysis of the zzso zzso As deafness is known to be caused in some instances by defects in zzso function, zzso is a plausible candidate gene for zzso
