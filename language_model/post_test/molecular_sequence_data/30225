zzso coli integration host factor zzso is a small zzso protein that binds to a specific DNA consensus sequence and produces DNA zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter is zzso three- to fourfold by zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso binds with zzso to two tandem sites located just upstream from the zzso promoter and enhances the formation of zzso zzso closed zzso The rate of zzso to open complex is not influenced by zzso zzso may stimulate recognition of zzso by one or more of several zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso by making zzso contacts with zzso zzso or zzso by zzso a competing promoter upstream from zzso
