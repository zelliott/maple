The zzso probe, zzso was used to examine the zzso binding zzso in zzso zzso by zzso This zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso produced zzso zzso in excellent yield zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Studies performed over a range of drug zzso suggested a zzso zzso for the binding of the zzso probe to zzso Limited zzso zzso and zzso of the resulting fragments by either zzso or zzso provided two principal zzso zzso zzso acid composition and sequence analyses performed on these two peptides established that both the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso particularly the regions zzso terminal to zzso zzso 1 and 3, were modified by the zzso zzso zzso These data, particularly for the zzso domain, are in excellent agreement with the X-ray structure analysis of a zzso zzso zzso
