Novel proteins zzso predominantly in bone have been identified by zzso screening of bone cell zzso expression zzso Two unique zzso were identified whose structures do not match any known zzso acid or protein sequence in the zzso computer zzso The first zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso bases in size which was expressed at high levels in zzso rat zzso cells, rat zzso bone cells and zzso A second zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 1500 bases which was expressed at high levels in zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso of both zzso in zzso cells was modulated by the zzso hormone, vitamin zzso Southern zzso analyses indicated that the two zzso represented zzso single copy genes in the rat zzso These novel gene products may serve as potential new markers to study bone turnover in zzso bone zzso
