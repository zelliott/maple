An zzso truncated zzso of the zzso zzso (A zzso that begins with a zzso zzso zzso at position 3 zzso zzso is the zzso zzso found in senile zzso Based upon previous in zzso studies regarding A beta zzso truncated zzso it has been hypothesized that A zzso zzso may zzso more rapidly and become more toxic than corresponding zzso zzso However, the toxicity and zzso properties of A zzso and A zzso have not previously been zzso After initial zzso and zzso zzso of each zzso at 37 degrees C and pH zzso the toxicity of zzso zzso A zzso was similar to that of A zzso Moreover, the toxicity of A zzso paralleled that induced by A zzso in both 1 day in zzso zzso cortical and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not reveal major differences in secondary structure between aged A zzso A zzso A zzso and A zzso or freshly zzso forms of these zzso Overall, the data indicate that the loss of the two zzso zzso acids and the zzso of zzso at position 3 do not alter the zzso toxicity of A zzso
