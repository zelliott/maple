The single Ras zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulates two distinct zzso zzso Signal zzso through a zzso zzso protein zzso cascade in response to mating zzso In this zzso zzso interacts with the protein zzso zzso and leads to its zzso in conjunction with a signal from the zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso cell growth both during the cell cycle and during directed cell extension towards a mating zzso zzso interacts with zzso a putative zzso factor, which could activate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may regulate the dynamics of the zzso zzso
