zzso play a key role in both normal and pathological processes involving immune and inflammatory responses, to a large extent through their capacity to zzso a wide range of biologically active zzso To identify some of these as yet not characterized zzso we have used a zzso cloning approach designed to identify genes expressed in association with zzso zzso One of these zzso designated zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso encodes a protein that bears the structural characteristics of a transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso Although it belongs to this zzso it has no strong zzso to existing families, indicating that it is a divergent member that may represent the first of a new family within this zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells is zzso by a variety of stimuli associated with zzso including zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso factor but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso Its expression is also increased by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells results in the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso protein of Mr 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso production, suggesting that zzso acts in zzso as an zzso regulatory zzso Its production in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso may serve to limit the later zzso of zzso zzso
