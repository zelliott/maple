We define zzso zzso as the zzso or zzso of the function of a zzso by the zzso zzso expression of zzso binding zzso which zzso the zzso Such zzso zzso can be directed to different compartments of zzso cells by means of previously defined targeting signals, thus zzso the study of any zzso in any cellular compartment for which an zzso is zzso For this purpose, we have created a set of zzso based on the zzso zzso described zzso zzso Roberts, zzso Wilton, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) An integrated zzso system for the zzso expression of zzso or their fragments after selection from zzso display zzso Gene zzso zzso which has been modified to express zzso zzso chain zzso linked to specific targeting zzso These permit the zzso of zzso to different zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the nucleus zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and as zzso proteins zzso The function of these zzso has been assessed by the zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso containing the zzso zzso
