The zzso zzso zzso is required in immune processes such as zzso zzso migration, and immune zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso changes promotes zzso binding to its zzso zzso It was reported that different affinity states of zzso are required for binding zzso and zzso Recently, the bent, extended with a closed zzso and extended with open zzso zzso of zzso was zzso To address the overall zzso requirements of zzso that allow selective binding of these zzso we examined the zzso properties of these zzso zzso zzso with different zzso were generated by zzso and verified by using a panel of reporter zzso that detect zzso extension, hybrid domain movement, or zzso domain zzso We report a marked difference between extended zzso with closed and open zzso in their adhesive properties to zzso and zzso Our data show that the extension of zzso alone is sufficient to mediate zzso zzso By contrast, an extended zzso with an open zzso is required for zzso zzso
