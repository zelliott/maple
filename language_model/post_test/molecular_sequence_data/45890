Human zzso zzso infection is an important infectious agent that results in zzso disease and zzso zzso zzso infection may affect in many zzso The different symptoms and tissue zzso of zzso infection perhaps resulted from the genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso open reading frames zzso a zzso of the tumor necrosis factor zzso It seems important to study the zzso zzso of zzso sequence in zzso clinical zzso and to discuss if the zzso related to the clinical zzso zzso 

zzso gene was amplified by zzso zzso in 65 zzso clinical zzso and urine from 7 healthy children who were zzso positive by quantitative zzso All the positive zzso products were analyzed by zzso mobility zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 32 of them were zzso 

Fifty-five zzso and 5 urine specimens were zzso positive by zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that significant zzso zzso was present in the zzso zzso Comparing zzso sequences and the corresponding symptoms showed that zzso 2 did not exist in zzso zzso And zzso 1 and 3 were the major types among zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso existed in almost all the low passage zzso zzso zzso is an easy and effective method to detect the zzso of zzso zzso The characteristic of sequences in different zzso showed that zzso gene may play an important role in zzso zzso
