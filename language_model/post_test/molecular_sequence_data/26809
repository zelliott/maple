The plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a high intrinsic zzso tolerance and has been used in this work to study the molecular basis of bacterial responses to high zzso of zzso A collection of zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated by zzso zzso and screened for sensitivity to zzso One zzso designated zzso and unable to grow on zzso zzso salt zzso medium supplemented with 300 zzso zzso was selected and further zzso The zzso zzso carries a single zzso zzso in a gene showing a high degree of identity to the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of this gene was shown to be zzso by salt in the zzso zzso Moreover, evidence is presented for the requirement of the gene product for adaptation to zzso conditions as well as to overcome the toxicity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition to the altered tolerance to both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibited changes in colony and cell zzso zzso production, and an increased sensitivity to zzso
