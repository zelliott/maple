The three-dimensional structure of the alkaline zzso of zzso zzso a zinc zzso has been solved to a resolution of zzso A by multiple zzso replacement and zzso symmetry averaging between different crystal zzso The zzso is zzso with overall dimensions of 90 zzso 35 zzso 25 zzso it has two distinct structural zzso The zzso domain is the zzso zzso it has an overall zzso fold and active site zinc zzso similar to that of zzso a zzso isolated from a European freshwater zzso The zzso domain consists of a zzso beta zzso Within this domain is a novel zzso beta zzso structure in which successive beta strands are wound in a right-handed zzso and in which zzso zzso are bound within the turns between strands by a repeated zzso sequence zzso a motif that is found in a diverse group of proteins zzso by zzso zzso
