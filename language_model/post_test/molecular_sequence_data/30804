zzso 1 is demonstrated to inhibit skin zzso proliferation when added during the zzso phase of the cell zzso Human zzso zzso transformed with either zzso or zzso or zzso however, were resistant to the growth zzso effects of zzso zzso Since zzso 1 appears to inhibit zzso growth through zzso of zzso it was hypothesized that these DNA tumor viruses might be modulating the response to zzso 1 via this zzso zzso expression of proteins zzso zzso zzso type 5 zzso and zzso large T zzso is demonstrated to block zzso 1 suppression of zzso zzso This effect was not observed with DNA tumor virus transforming proteins zzso in their zzso binding zzso These observations indicate that zzso or another protein that interacts with this binding domain mediates zzso 1 regulation of zzso gene expression and growth zzso
