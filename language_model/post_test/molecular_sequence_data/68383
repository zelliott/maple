zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso are two hallmarks of zzso process in zzso zzso leaves in response to light zzso However, very little is known about the relevant signal zzso pathways zzso these essential processes that lead to zzso zzso It is shown here that a potent and specific protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid, efficiently blocks zzso zzso induced by light in zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso expression of two zzso fusion genes can be specifically suppressed by the structurally unrelated zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso A, using a sensitive and zzso zzso zzso transient zzso The specificity and effective concentration of the zzso in zzso and in zzso strongly suggest that zzso is required for zzso light zzso zzso several partial zzso zzso novel as well as zzso zzso can be identified in zzso leaves using the zzso chain zzso Studies of zzso promoters indicate that zzso activity is essential for the interaction of multiple regulatory zzso Although zzso and zzso have been implicated in the suppression of gene activity in zzso and animals, the present data indicate that zzso appears to be essential for zzso gene zzso in zzso
