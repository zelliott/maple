zzso zzso is capable of utilizing a variety of iron sources in zzso including human zzso human zzso zzso zzso complexes, zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a critical iron store for zzso zzso in the human male zzso The demonstration that zzso can zzso the lower zzso tracts of zzso zzso mice in the absence of human zzso however, suggests that other usable iron sources are present in the zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are not attenuated in mice, thereby ruling out zzso and zzso as essential for zzso zzso An increased frequency of phase zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso 50% of infected zzso this increase was temporally associated with an influx of zzso and zzso levels of zzso in the zzso suggesting that the presence of zzso in inflammatory zzso selects for zzso phase zzso during zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso support the growth of zzso zzso in zzso unless an iron zzso is added to the zzso We zzso that zzso zzso may enhance growth of zzso in zzso by promoting the zzso of iron on zzso surfaces through the production of zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso was detected on zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that although zzso replicate within the zzso tracts of mice, they may be sufficiently zzso to express zzso zzso In zzso these studies support the potential role of zzso zzso iron sources during zzso infection of the female zzso zzso
