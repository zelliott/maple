A small regulatory zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zinc zzso motifs separated by a basic motif in the zzso part and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein and its zzso with various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied in zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zinc zzso are essential for effective zzso activity of the zzso zzso suggesting the important role of zinc finger motifs in these zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region did not affect highly cooperative zzso zzso indicating that the zzso part of the protein contributes to the zzso interactions needed for the zzso zzso
