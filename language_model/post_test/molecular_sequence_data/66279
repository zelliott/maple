We have evaluated the roles of key zzso acids to the action of the natural inhibitor zzso of zzso zzso zzso A zzso substitution decreased inhibitor affinity for human zzso L zzso while zzso of zzso resulted in zzso increases in the zzso for zzso of zzso zzso A zzso double zzso had increased affinity for zzso L but not for zzso while the zzso deletion drastically affected zzso of both human and zzso zzso These differential effects reflect the occurrence of direct interactions between zzso and zzso 8 of zzso zzso interactions that do not occur with zzso
