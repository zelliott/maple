zzso zzso zzso tobacco plants expressing the coat protein of tobacco rattle virus were exposed to mechanical leaf zzso with tobacco rattle virus and to zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas plants were resistant to mechanical zzso the zzso zzso successfully transmitted tobacco rattle virus to the roots as well as to the leaves of these zzso It is suggested that transgenic resistance is overcome either because zzso zzso inject relatively large numbers of virus particles into a cell or because they inject zzso zzso The results indicate that coat zzso resistance is unlikely to be of value for controlling tobacco rattle virus in field zzso
