zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso viruses to allow for efficient translation of products zzso 3' in their zzso This strategy also provides a means for regulating the expression of such products via zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have studied the mechanism by which zzso zzso levels are controlled in tomato bushy stunt virus, a small zzso zzso virus which zzso two zzso zzso during zzso Neither the viral zzso nor movement proteins were found to play any significant role in modulating the zzso levels of either zzso zzso zzso analysis did, however, identify a zzso zzso sequence located approximately 1,000 zzso upstream from the site of initiation of zzso zzso synthesis that was required specifically for zzso of zzso zzso Further analysis revealed a potential zzso interaction between this sequence and a sequence located just zzso to the site of initiation for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which this interaction was either disrupted or maintained were analyzed and the results indicated a positive correlation between the predicted stability of the zzso interaction and the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso The functional significance of the long-distance interaction was further supported by zzso sequence analysis which revealed conservation of zzso interactions of similar stability and relative position in the zzso of different zzso It is proposed that the upstream sequence represents a zzso zzso element which zzso zzso zzso zzso by promoting efficient synthesis of zzso zzso via a long-distance zzso zzso
