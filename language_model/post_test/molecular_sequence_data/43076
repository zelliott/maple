A precursor to the zzso of sweet potato zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso zzso zzso of 45 zzso acid zzso and its zzso 18 zzso may form an zzso zzso which is typical of zzso targeting signals zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fusion genes consisting of sequences that zzso the 25 zzso 46 zzso and 73 zzso zzso zzso acids from zzso delta fused to the zzso of the coding sequence of bacterial zzso zzso were placed downstream of the zzso promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and used to transform zzso tobacco cells, rice zzso and tobacco zzso Fusion genes were also placed downstream of the zzso zzso promoter and introduced into zzso zzso zzso In these transformed cells, only the zzso zzso protein was transported into zzso and subjected to zzso zzso of the zzso Neither transport to zzso nor processing of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which contained the entire zzso and the processing site, occurred in either plant or zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso delta is not sufficient for the transport of the zzso protein into zzso in zzso rice and zzso zzso The requirement for the longer zzso from zzso delta in the transport of the zzso protein into zzso could be due either to the lack of sufficient information for zzso targeting within the zzso or to the nature of the passenger zzso zzso used in this zzso
