The zzso sequence of the zzso of the type strain of zzso green zzso mosaic virus zzso has been completely zzso The zzso structure and sequence of the virus were compared to those of zzso strain of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso zzso long consisting of zzso and 3' zzso regions zzso and four open reading frames coding for 131 zzso and 189 zzso viral zzso 28 zzso movement protein and 17 zzso coat zzso The zzso and zzso acid sequences identities of the four zzso proteins and two zzso between zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was directly amplified by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with a set of zzso primer zzso zzso zzso promoter sequence and zzso zzso This full-length zzso product allowed zzso to be transcribed in zzso The zzso zzso zzso product was cloned and used as templates for zzso for plant zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso transcribed from the full-length zzso clone as well as capped transcript zzso from the zzso zzso products were infectious and caused symptoms characteristic of zzso when mechanically zzso to systemic host plants such as zzso zzso cucumber and zzso zzso zzso progeny virus was indistinguishable from the zzso virus with the same biological and zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of the generation of a biologically active zzso zzso driven by the zzso promoter, that is highly infectious to zzso zzso
