zzso of zzso zzso is a primitive example of zzso between zzso changes and timing of gene expression during zzso A major early control of zzso activity is dependent on a new zzso factor, zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso gene and zzso as an inactive zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso in the zzso gene block the processing of zzso zzso Moreover, synthesis of both zzso and zzso products in zzso cells leads to expression of a zzso zzso promoter during growth, suggesting that zzso has zzso E processing zzso The zzso zzso which contains five potential zzso zzso is zzso during zzso 1 zzso before processing activity can be zzso We propose that zzso processing activity is triggered by the presence of the zzso zzso which is itself dependent on the zzso and zzso zzso These proteins are normally needed for zzso E processing during zzso but can be zzso in zzso zzso According to this model, a zzso structure would directly control the synthesis of a zzso zzso factor and would modify gene zzso
