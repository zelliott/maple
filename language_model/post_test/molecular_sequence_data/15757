We describe two different approaches to isolate human zzso sequences possessing zzso binding sites for the zzso virus 40 zzso large T zzso First, zzso T zzso was added to zzso human zzso the resulting zzso complexes were collected after repeated passages through zzso zzso The second approach involves the specific zzso of zzso fragments, generated by zzso treatment of nuclear zzso from zzso human zzso The DNA fragments obtained were cloned in zzso zzso for further zzso Using the filter binding approach we isolated four different fragments with zzso binding zzso The binding site in one zzso was related to the strong zzso binding site I in the zzso zzso The other three fragments contained multiple recognition zzso zzso Only one zzso with a zzso binding site was identified among the zzso zzso zzso This DNA zzso belongs to the zzso family of human repetitive zzso We present evidence suggesting that a significant fraction of human zzso elements possesses zzso binding zzso zzso sequences appear as zzso elements in an zzso human cell line, and the amount of zzso zzso DNA was found to increase after fusion of transformed cells to zzso monkey zzso
