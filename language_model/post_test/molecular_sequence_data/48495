In the zzso the dynamics of zzso zzso and the initial events of zzso zzso are controlled by the activity of an zzso zzso of the DNA zzso zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to identify the alternative zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and determine the gene expression pattern of the different zzso zzso during zzso zzso A rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso ) system was used to amplify the zzso zzso end of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein expression of zzso and zzso cells were analyzed by western zzso and zzso Two new zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at low but constant levels in zzso and zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were detected in zzso and zzso from the two- to the zzso to zzso zzso zzso of these zzso transcripts were low at the zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso was present in all the zzso cell types zzso zzso and zzso were not detected in any zzso zzso As predicted by the zzso sequence and verified by western zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso translate one zzso zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed that both the zzso and the zzso forms of zzso protein are present in zzso zzso and early zzso whereas zzso cells produce only zzso zzso zzso is localized mainly in the zzso of zzso and early zzso whereas zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of early zzso
