In order to reduce the number of classical DNA manipulation and zzso steps in the generation of zzso expression zzso a series of zzso is described which facilitate the assembly of such plasmids by the more efficient zzso in zzso zzso Two sets of zzso were zzso The first set, called zzso zzso contains an expression cassette with a zzso promoter and the zzso zzso separated by a zzso and an zzso coli zzso zzso in these zzso of a DNA zzso generates a zzso zzso which is compatible with the second set of zzso zzso shuttle zzso This set of zzso zzso contains a cassette for a functional copy of a gene zzso a host strain zzso or a bacterial gene zzso an zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso copy numbers can be modulated through the use of zzso or zzso as the selective marker together with an zzso and the 2 zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs by zzso between zzso zzso sequences during transformation in zzso or zzso zzso All the zzso contain the origin of replication of zzso zzso and allow the generation of zzso DNA in zzso coli for sequencing or zzso zzso
