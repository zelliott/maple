zzso derived from synthetic zzso have been previously engineered to degrade under the activity of zzso zzso zzso It is believed that these systems can act as zzso zzso zzso mimicking the degradation and zzso of the zzso through the activity of zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso derived from zzso were zzso In order to avoid the incorporation of zzso zzso often introduced in zzso modification strategies, the zzso was modified with zzso zzso zzso thereby introducing zzso zzso in the backbone and resulting in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso This strategy was favored to separate out the effects of random zzso and zzso zzso in the degradation of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso derived from collagen and susceptible to zzso A zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso and used to zzso the zzso These zzso were found to be zzso stable for more than 200 days yet zzso either within 30 h when exposed to bacterial zzso or within 16 days when exposed to human zzso demonstrating zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Further modification of the zzso zzso with zzso peptides enhanced cell zzso and survival, demonstrating the potential of these materials for use in tissue engineering zzso
