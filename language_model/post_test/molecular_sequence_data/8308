zzso schemes employing zzso with zzso vaccine candidates followed by zzso booster administrations have been explored and shown to have merit in the human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso In this study, we have assessed the zzso capacity of highly attenuated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso vaccine candidates expressing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes or zzso zzso expressing either zzso or zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso in combination protocols with zzso zzso zzso Following intravenous challenge exposure with 100 infectious doses of the zzso parental virus zzso mixture, seven of eight animals were protected from zzso The seven protected animals were zzso 6 months zzso challenge, without additional booster zzso with the same dose of the zzso parental zzso Five of the seven animals remained protected against zzso infection at 6 months following the second zzso In contrast, oral zzso with zzso zzso expressing the zzso gag and the zzso portion of the envelope either alone or in combination with zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso may zzso long-lasting protection and that these two highly attenuated zzso vaccine zzso may represent promising candidates for developing an acquired zzso syndrome zzso
