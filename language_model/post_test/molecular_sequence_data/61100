A clone expressing zzso activity in zzso coli has been selected from a zzso zzso library of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso from the zzso insert located the zzso activity to a zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence of this clone revealed an zzso of zzso zzso zzso a single domain zzso or family 10 zzso which was designated as zzso zzso of the zzso following zzso in zzso coli produced an zzso of 42 zzso with a temperature optimum of 75 degrees C which can efficiently bind and zzso zzso zzso The pH optimum of the zzso is zzso but it is active over a broad pH zzso A zzso model of the zzso has been constructed which reveals a series of surface aromatic zzso which form zzso zzso This unusual structural feature is zzso similar to the situation observed in the structure determined for the zzso zzso from the zzso D3 strain and may constitute a common evolutionary mechanism imposed on different structural zzso by which these zzso may bind potential zzso and exhibit zzso
