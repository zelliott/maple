zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare, zzso zzso disorder that presents in early infancy with a broad spectrum of symptoms, including failure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and neurological zzso Here we report a study of a family zzso and three zzso with two children suffering from zzso zzso caused by two different zzso in the zzso zzso Initially, molecular genetic analysis of zzso DNA revealed a zzso zzso in the zzso position of zzso 7 zzso G zzso zzso in the father and all three zzso zzso analysis indicates that this zzso causes zzso zzso and further experiments supported this hypothesis and suggested that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We did not identify further zzso in zzso DNA that could explain zzso zzso in the two zzso However, further efforts using complementary DNA zzso derived from zzso from blood zzso identified a large deletion removing the entire zzso 8, resulting in a zzso and a premature stop zzso zzso in the mother and the two affected zzso Our data indicate that if zzso DNA sequencing of zzso DNA does not uncover zzso corresponding to the zzso a systematic search for other zzso should be initiated by sequencing zzso or using zzso methods to detect large deletions in zzso
