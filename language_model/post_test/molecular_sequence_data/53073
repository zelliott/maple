zzso zzso channels zzso are zzso zzso channels that open and close in response to changes in the zzso concentration of the second zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Most notably, they zzso the chemical signal produced by the zzso of light in zzso into a membrane potential change, which is then transmitted to the ascending visual zzso zzso have also been implicated in the signal zzso of other zzso downstream of the zzso in particular the zzso cells, as well as in other areas of the central nervous zzso We therefore undertook a search for additional zzso zzso channels expressed in the zzso Following a zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction approach to amplify zzso number messages, a zzso zzso a new zzso zzso of zzso zzso was isolated from mouse zzso and classified as zzso An zzso raised against the zzso sequence identified the retinal cell type expressing zzso as cone zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated its membrane zzso in the outer zzso consistent with its role in zzso zzso experiments with zzso markers indicated that all cone zzso in the zzso zzso use the same or a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso defects in this channel would be predicted to severely impair zzso zzso
