zzso is a member of the zzso maintenance zzso family of zzso which have a role in the early stages of zzso DNA zzso Here, we show that zzso assembles into stable complexes with two other members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso The assembly of zzso into complexes with zzso does not appear to be cell cycle zzso making it unlikely that these interactions per zzso are a zzso step in the control of S zzso zzso is also shown to interact with zzso in zzso and to be a component of zzso zzso complexes in cell zzso Like zzso zzso zzso is essential for the initiation of zzso DNA replication in zzso zzso however, zzso remains in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, whereas zzso are nuclear only during zzso We characterize two zzso in zzso and zzso which arrest cells with zzso DNA as a result of single base zzso The corresponding zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso severely reduce the ability of these zzso to assemble in a complex with each other in zzso and in zzso This argues that assembly of zzso into complexes with other zzso zzso is important for its role in the initiation of zzso DNA zzso
