zzso zzso zzso zzso harbors zzso zzso zzso and, at least, two species of gut zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso coli than to any other zzso zzso Analysis of zzso of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggested that one of the gut microbes is a close relative of zzso coli and that the zzso zzso is still closer to this zzso than to zzso zzso In addition, the optimal temperature for the growth of this gut zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso coli suggesting that this zzso has been adapted to the ambient temperature of the host insect and shares a very close zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso
