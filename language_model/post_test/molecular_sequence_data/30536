zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso by zzso in a reaction which follows zzso zzso at pH 8 and 37 degrees zzso The concentration dependence of zzso revealed zzso zzso with an apparent Ki of 10 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso inhibitor zzso zzso can be protected from zzso by either the zzso zzso or the competitive zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso by zzso proceeds with the incorporation of a zzso amount of labeled zzso zzso zzso of the zzso labeled zzso followed by high performance liquid zzso allowed the isolation of a modified zzso with the sequence zzso in which zzso zzso is the modified zzso zzso zzso was used to generate a zzso form of the zzso in which zzso zzso was converted to a zzso zzso This zzso zzso retained less than zzso of the activity of the native zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is at the active site of neutral zzso zzso and suggest a zzso role for this zzso
