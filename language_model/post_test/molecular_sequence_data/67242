zzso and guinea pigs have frequently been used to study the development of the prostate and the mechanism of zzso action, but the mouse prostate has also become an attractive model for prostate research, because an enormous range of genetically altered mice is now zzso However, the zzso of proteins in the mouse prostate has not yet been thoroughly zzso In the present study, major zzso proteins from the zzso prostate zzso zzso prostate zzso and anterior prostate (AP) of mice were identified by means of zzso zzso followed by zzso mass zzso zzso A quantitative reverse zzso method was further employed to examine the zzso zzso regulation of the identified zzso zzso analysis revealed that the VP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and a 91 zzso hypothetical scavenger zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a protein similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one of the experimental zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso protein 78, zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso zzso of animals led to a decrease in the zzso of these zzso zzso although the zzso of changes varied zzso different zzso We present here an outlined view of mouse prostate zzso which should contribute to an understanding of the biological functions of the prostate zzso as well as the zzso dependency of prostate zzso
