The zzso of zzso cell leukemia zzso remains largely unknown since no specific genetic zzso has been identified in this zzso Previous zzso analysis from our group has shown that zzso abnormalities involving the zzso band are common in zzso occurring in approximately 1/3 of zzso The data suggest that the zzso band is likely to harbor a gene involved in the transformational events of this zzso We have recently found two zzso zzso the zzso zzso in patients with zzso and the distance between them is approximately 35 zzso as analyzed by zzso The two zzso have been located between the markers zzso and zzso by radiation hybrid zzso Five of 11 patients with zzso had a zzso deletion of the two zzso indicating that the function of a tumor zzso gene may be zzso With the aim of zzso the critical region of zzso loss in patients with zzso we have constructed an integrated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones that covers the zzso Within this area, three expressed sequences were identified as candidates for the putative zzso tumor zzso gene involved in the zzso of zzso
