The mouse zzso zzso zzso is functionally distinct from the extensively studied rat zzso on the basis of differences in binding and biological activity of zzso zzso zzso of zzso These are partial zzso at the rat zzso and full zzso at the mouse pancreatic zzso To explore this, we cloned the zzso for the mouse type A zzso zzso established a zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell line and characterized its binding and biological zzso Despite 25 differences in zzso acid sequence from the rat zzso including a zzso acid zzso in the third zzso loop, mouse and rat receptors were functionally indistinguishable when expressed in zzso zzso Of note, in the mouse pancreatic cell environment, a stable analog of zzso zzso significantly inhibited binding of zzso whereas it had no effect on binding to the same zzso on the zzso cell line or to the rat zzso in either environment of the zzso zzso This likely reflects a difference in zzso of the mouse zzso to its G protein in the natural environment of the zzso zzso This may relate to differences zzso to the zzso in the zzso or character of G proteins or in the composition or organization of the zzso environment of the mouse zzso cell zzso Although this may require zzso of the unique sequence of the mouse zzso that structure alone is insufficient to explain this zzso zzso zzso makes an important, yet often ignored, contribution to zzso zzso
