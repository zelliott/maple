Using the zzso procedure of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a modification of the method, we produced a series of zzso forms from spinach and zzso extracts that were characterized by a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Limited zzso of the zzso resulted in the generation of even shorter zzso zzso of the zzso from crude extracts revealed that the sequences of the intact zzso from zzso spinach and zzso started at a position zzso identical with that established for the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated by conventional methods was shown to represent the intact zzso Thus, the zzso regulatory and structural properties of the various truncated forms could be compared with those of an intact zzso zzso of 5 or 11 zzso zzso as occurred during isolation of the pea zzso was without any significant zzso The zzso were all zzso and still exhibited the characteristic zzso zzso However, removal of 31 and 37 zzso acids using zzso K resulted in the formation of active zzso characterized by only slightly lowered affinities towards the zzso a shift of their pH optimum from 8 to 7, the loss of zzso zzso and an increased zzso zzso Although these forms lacked most or all of the zzso zzso including the 2 zzso involved in zzso they were still sensitive to the zzso However, the low concentration of zzso required for immediate and complete restoration of any lost activity (40 zzso zzso suggested that this reaction might not be relevant for zzso in zzso
