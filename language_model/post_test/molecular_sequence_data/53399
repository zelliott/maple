zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso zzso factors with a household fatty acid, an zzso and a zzso group at the zzso zzso and with a zzso an zzso group, or both at the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso was carried out with a set of bacterial zzso that produce well characterized zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factors were tested for their capacity to induce root hair formation and for their stability in an in zzso degradation zzso with extracts of zzso zzso zzso The zzso increased zzso the zzso efficiency and the capacity to induce root zzso and they protected the zzso factor against zzso The zzso group was more important than the zzso group for zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso group by a zzso zzso did not affect zzso factor stability, but reduced zzso efficiency, indicating that the zzso group may play a role in zzso The zzso group contributes to zzso efficiency, biological activity, and protection, but could be replaced by a zzso group for root zzso The results demonstrate that none of the studied zzso is strictly required for triggering normal zzso zzso However, the zzso efficiency was greatly determined by the synergistic presence of zzso Within the range tested, fluctuations of zzso factor amounts had little impact on the symbiotic zzso
