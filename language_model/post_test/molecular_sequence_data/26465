The zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso plasmids resembling zzso zzso The presence of a zzso locus needed for stable maintenance of zzso has been expected by zzso with the functions zzso by other zzso plasmids such as zzso DNA and zzso We found such a locus and designated it zzso The zzso locus was zzso within 371 zzso in a unique region of zzso This region is included in the zzso region where no transcript was zzso No prominent feature of the zzso sequence was found in this region except for a direct repeat with zzso zzso consisting of 27 zzso and 29 zzso This is in clear contrast with the structure of the zzso locus of zzso DNA which has five and a half tandem repeats consisting of a highly zzso 62 zzso zzso By analyzing the sites hypersensitive to zzso using partially zzso zzso containing zzso the zzso locus was found not to be tightly folded into a zzso zzso
