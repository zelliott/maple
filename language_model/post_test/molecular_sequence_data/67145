zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso first isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso first isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is especially zzso to strains of zzso zzso zzso activity is not zzso in the zzso of cultures of zzso grown in liquid media at 25 degrees C, but at temperatures less than 19 degrees C zzso activity can be zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso 126 zzso is zzso in zzso at higher temperature, and zzso 126 zzso is not detected when zzso is grown at 25 degrees zzso zzso production in zzso grown at 15 degrees C can be induced by addition of zzso M of chemically zzso zzso 126 induction zzso zzso However, induction of zzso production in zzso grown at 25 degrees C requires zzso M of zzso The sequence of the zzso 126 zzso in zzso contains 34 single zzso differences compared with the zzso 126 zzso in zzso including single zzso differences in the zzso zzso zzso dedicated zzso and accessory zzso as well as a single zzso deletion in the transport accessory zzso This deletion causes a zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso transport accessory protein in zzso
