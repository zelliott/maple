zzso zzso therapy, although effective for treatment of zzso B, might select the emergence of drug-resistant zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and determination of viral zzso are two crucial parameters for monitoring treatment response and occurrence of zzso In this study, we take zzso resistance as an example to develop a method that can determine both parameters in a zzso zzso zzso 

The method contained two consecutive steps: in the first step, real-time zzso was used for zzso in the second step, a novel zzso curve analysis was used for detecting zzso zzso For accurate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were chosen from highly zzso regions to ensure the equivalent amplification of all zzso zzso Within the sensor probe, there were signature zzso zzso that could effectively differentiate zzso zzso from wild type by distinct melting temperatures zzso zzso The clinical zzso of the zzso was tested in serial samples from 90 patients receiving zzso zzso 

This zzso could readily differentiate zzso zzso and zzso zzso by their distinct zzso zzso The zzso results showed great consistency in a linear range from zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso could detect zzso zzso accounting for zzso or zzso zzso of the total viral zzso Its clinical feasibility has been verified in primary zzso 

The newly designed zzso detection method is simple, sensitive, zzso zzso and provides a useful tool for follow-up of patients treated with zzso or other zzso zzso
