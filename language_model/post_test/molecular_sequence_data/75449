A mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso factor IX zzso detects a zzso in the plasma of normal zzso Its zzso has been narrowed down to less than 6 zzso acids in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso position 148 of the zzso Using synthetic zzso we have demonstrated that zzso the zzso which zzso with zzso has zzso at position 148 and zzso that which does not has zzso Positive zzso zzso are designated zzso A, and negative zzso zzso are designated zzso zzso The plasma levels of AA women are indistinguishable from those of A men, and both B men and zzso women are zzso against zzso zzso The plasma level of zzso A in AB women is approximately half that of AA women, and zzso is clearly operating in the zzso The zzso is in strong linkage zzso with two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso double zzso to have occurred between the three zzso Seven of the eight possible zzso have been identified, five in men and two others in zzso The zzso that identifies approximately 50% of the AB women in the pool of zzso A females with zzso confidence identifies men zzso as A or zzso The zzso would be very useful for zzso studies of the zzso zzso if the studies were limited to zzso
