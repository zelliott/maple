We cloned two beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression showed that zzso expression is enriched in zzso and zzso expression is very prominent in zzso We zzso BK channel alpha zzso and zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso currents with those of smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso slowed zzso zzso more significantly, led to a steeper apparent calcium sensitivity, and shifted the zzso range of BK current zzso to more negative zzso than zzso zzso channels were not blocked by 100 zzso zzso or zzso and were activated by zzso
