A zzso expression cassette has been constructed to study the conditional expression of sense or zzso zzso of any sequence of interest in transgenic plants or plant zzso The construct includes the promoter and all but 5 bases of the zzso leader from the soybean zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso to remove the zzso and a zzso that contains the zzso signal and site from the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of transient expression of a construct containing the zzso zzso coding sequence cloned in the cassette and introduced into zzso zzso zzso by zzso shows that the promoter has high expression at heat shock zzso This construct is expressed at a roughly zzso higher level per unit time than a cauliflower mosaic virus zzso gene zzso zzso The heat shock promoter is regulated positively by zzso in this transient zzso zzso The level of expression of zzso constructions with the zzso sites from either the zzso zzso gene or the zzso gene was zzso zzso with a perfect fusion at the zzso end had higher levels of expression than those with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso
