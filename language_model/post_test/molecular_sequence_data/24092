The zzso rhythm of about 24 hours is a fundamental zzso function observed in almost all organisms from zzso to zzso Identification of clock genes has allowed us to study the molecular bases for zzso behaviors and zzso zzso processes such as hormonal zzso and has prompted the idea that molecular clocks reside not only in a central zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso but also in peripheral zzso even in immortalized zzso Furthermore, previous molecular dissection revealed that the mechanism of zzso zzso at a molecular level is based on zzso regulation of clock and zzso zzso 

We systematically analyzed the zzso expression of clock and zzso genes in mouse peripheral zzso Eight genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso given in the zzso order of the rhythm zzso showed robust zzso expressions of zzso in all zzso except zzso suggesting that these genes are core molecules of the molecular biological zzso The zzso analysis revealed that these genes have one or a combination of 3 zzso elements zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso among human, zzso and rat zzso zzso and indicated that these 3 elements may be responsible for the biological timing of expression of zzso clock zzso 

The observation of zzso profiles of zzso clock genes is not only useful for zzso and pathological examination of the zzso clock in various zzso but also important for systematic understanding of zzso regulation on a zzso zzso Our finding of the zzso expression of zzso clock genes with a zzso order provides us an interesting hypothesis, that zzso timing of all clock and zzso genes may be dependent on several zzso elements including 3 known zzso zzso zzso and zzso
