zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso carrying three plasmids zzso zzso zzso and a single zzso system zzso for the production of fusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were investigated in continuous cultures under selective and zzso zzso In a zzso system, zzso was lost gradually together with zzso from the host under zzso zzso The selective pressure against zzso stabilized the zzso This indicates that the loss of zzso under zzso conditions was caused by the loss of zzso gene zzso by zzso which resulted in the overproduction of the toxic gene product zzso by zzso In the case of single zzso zzso system, the zzso lost from the host under zzso zzso This zzso was stabilized in the host growing under selective zzso During this period we obtained some zzso resistant colonies which gave low levels of zzso activities compared to the normal zzso bearing zzso zzso analysis from the above cells showed that the zzso has undergone structural zzso Further, restriction analysis of this zzso exhibited an additional zzso site in a zzso zzso zzso that was integrated near the zzso promoter which controls the expression of the zzso E zzso thereby resulting low levels of zzso zzso Our results indicate that some of the IS elements which are present in the host zzso were responsible for such zzso to turn off the synthesis by inserting into the zzso promoter region to lower the protein formation during the zzso
