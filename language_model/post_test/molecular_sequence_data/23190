zzso is a zzso dye that binds to the unique sequence zzso (where zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso We attached a single zzso to a zzso with an inserted zzso motif and immobilized individual zzso to a glass surface at low zzso Total internal reflection zzso zzso was used to image individual zzso zzso We determined the zzso of the distribution of photons in the image of a single zzso in order to determine the position of the dye within 5 zzso precision and with an image integration time of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was also characterized and observation times ranging from several seconds to over a minute were zzso We found that zzso acid increased the number of collected photons from zzso molecules by a factor of zzso Individual zzso molecules were then moved via a zzso stage in 25 or 40 zzso steps, either at a constant rate or at a zzso zzso Individual steps were clearly seen, indicating that the observation of zzso motion on this scale, which is relevant for many zzso motors, is possible with zzso
