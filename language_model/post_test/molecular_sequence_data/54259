zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso The vertically transmitted zzso not only delivers the zzso zzso zzso to its host but is also essential for zzso spore formation of the zzso To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model zzso we zzso the whole zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso thus providing the first zzso insight into an zzso zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of a zzso and two zzso zzso The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the zzso of zzso zzso Besides the zzso zzso gene zzso there are 14 zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly lines, which represent novel targets for zzso mining of cryptic natural zzso Furthermore, the zzso are equipped with a repertoire of zzso factors, which can now be studied to zzso molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso
