The zzso cells of the zzso compound eye are precisely organized in elementary units called zzso The outer zzso and inner zzso zzso zzso represent two zzso distinct systems with two different projection targets in the brain (for review see zzso zzso All cells of the primary system, zzso express the same zzso and are functionally zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso are different from each zzso They occupy zzso precise positions, with zzso on top of zzso In fact, there are several classes of zzso pairs, which differ zzso and functionally and are characterized by the expression of one of two zzso zzso zzso or zzso Here, we describe the identification of a new zzso zzso zzso 5, expressed in one zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso represents zzso cells that are directly underneath the zzso zzso expressing zzso but are never under those expressing zzso These results confirm the existence of two zzso of zzso and zzso cells, which coordinate the expression of their respective zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling pathways between zzso and zzso lead to the exclusive expression of a single zzso gene per cell and to the coordinate expression of another one in the neighboring zzso zzso with this, zzso expression in zzso disappears when zzso cells are absent (in zzso zzso We propose a model for the concerted evolution of zzso genes and the zzso of the architecture of the zzso
