zzso zzso of peptides by the zzso compound zzso has been shown to permit zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso spaced at i and i + 7 positions with the trans form of the zzso was found to produce a decreased zzso content compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso form of the zzso led to substantially higher zzso content than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the system leads to the conclusion that zzso of zzso content does not involve specific interactions between the zzso and the zzso Instead, the change in zzso zzso content caused by zzso can be predicted by comparing the length ranges of the zzso and trans forms of the zzso with the expected distance distribution of the zzso attachment points in the intrinsic zzso ensemble of the zzso The analysis presented here should help to guide the use of these and related zzso for the zzso control of a variety of zzso and protein zzso
