Early in mouse development, two classes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso but as development zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes is selectively zzso to a barely zzso zzso We show here that during in zzso differentiation of mouse embryonic stem zzso cells, both zzso introduced and zzso zzso genes are subject to normal zzso zzso Thus, zzso cells represent a convenient zzso system for studying the control of expression of zzso regulated zzso zzso Using this system, we have identified a region in the zzso zzso region, located outside the zzso element, that is responsible for differential zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in both developing cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
