zzso of zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso when cells are grown in the absence of zzso and zzso when the cells are grown in its zzso We have previously suggested that this response to zzso may be dictated by regulating zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it was also known that cells which harbor a zzso zzso zzso express zzso zzso levels of target genes zzso and zzso implicating the zzso negative regulatory gene in the response to zzso These observations suggested that the response to zzso may involve both regulation of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We investigated these possibilities by examining the effect of zzso on target gene expression in a strain containing the zzso gene under control of the zzso zzso In this strain, zzso of the zzso gene was regulated in response to zzso but was insensitive to zzso The expression of the zzso and zzso target genes was still responsive to zzso even though expression of the zzso gene was zzso However, the level of expression of the zzso and zzso target genes correlated with the level of zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso on target gene expression was eliminated by deleting the zzso gene in the zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso gene product is the primary target zzso of the zzso response and that zzso of zzso zzso determines the degree of expression of the target zzso
