zzso are among the major classes of zzso natural products used to treat microbial infections, cancer, and other zzso Here we describe a zzso to zzso as a zzso zzso building block in the zzso of zzso A, a marine microbial zzso whose chlorine atom is crucial for potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is converted to zzso zzso in a reaction zzso by a zzso zzso as previously zzso By using a combination of gene zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso experiments with putative zzso we now provide evidence that zzso is converted to zzso in a zzso route via the penultimate intermediate zzso Because zzso often increases the zzso of drugs, the availability of a zzso zzso building block may be useful in molecular engineering approaches toward zzso zzso
