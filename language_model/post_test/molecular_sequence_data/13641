The green fluorescent protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso is rapidly becoming an important reporter zzso for monitoring gene expression and protein zzso in zzso in zzso and in real zzso zzso zzso bright green light zzso max zzso zzso zzso when excited with zzso or blue light zzso max zzso 395 zzso minor peak at 470 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are similar to those of zzso and the conditions used to zzso this zzso are also suitable for zzso Unlike other zzso reporters, the zzso in zzso is intrinsic to the primary structure of the zzso and zzso zzso does not require a zzso or zzso zzso zzso is stable, zzso and can be monitored zzso in living cells and, in the case of transparent organisms, whole zzso Here we demonstrate zzso zzso in bacterial and zzso cells and introduce our Living zzso line of zzso reporter zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso The reporter zzso for zzso include a zzso zzso zzso for monitoring the expression of cloned zzso in zzso cells and a series of six zzso for creating fusion protein to either the N or C zzso of zzso
