To identify the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso type zzso 13 peptides covering zzso of the protein were chemically zzso zzso guinea zzso and rabbit zzso raised against zzso native zzso were tested for their zzso against the peptides in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Six zzso linear zzso zzso were mapped to zzso 103 to zzso 189 to zzso 248 to zzso 307 to zzso zzso to zzso and 400 to zzso of the mature zzso zzso When zzso peptides were screened for their zzso with three human zzso serum zzso peptides corresponding to zzso 39 to 64, 226 to zzso and 400 to zzso reacted strongly with the zzso Four regions zzso 39 to 64, 226 to zzso 339 to zzso and 400 to zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for their zzso with the zzso peptides and zzso protein by zzso and zzso All zzso zzso zzso except those raised against zzso zzso zzso 279 to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to be specific for their respective zzso peptides by zzso In addition, rabbit zzso raised against the synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso 1 to 29, 39 to 64, 103 to zzso 189 to zzso 226 to zzso 248 to zzso 307 to zzso and 400 to zzso of the mature zzso protein recognized the zzso protein from both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that these peptides contain zzso highly zzso among zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso However, none of the zzso zzso have zzso activity, nor were they protective against zzso zzso type b in the infant rat model of zzso
