We used a zzso cluster detection approach designed to zzso significant rare zzso zzso clusters within a region of interest to systematically search for schizophrenia zzso zzso genes within 49 zzso zzso previously implicated by de zzso copy number zzso Using two independent zzso sequencing family zzso and a follow-up zzso spectrum disorder zzso zzso zzso sequencing zzso we identified zzso in one zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as being associated with both zzso and zzso zzso is located in a region on zzso zzso implicated by a zzso copy number zzso which zzso to an array of psychiatric and zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso rare zzso risk zzso cluster significantly in affected individuals within a zzso window that spans several key functional zzso of the zzso Our finding suggests that zzso is a key driver in the zzso locus for the associated psychiatric and zzso zzso zzso encodes a DNA repair zzso thus implicating abnormalities in DNA repair in the zzso to zzso or zzso
