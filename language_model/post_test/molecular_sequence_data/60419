Most of the zzso breast zzso are attributed to zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso nonetheless, zzso zzso of these genes in zzso zzso families are found less frequently than expected from linkage zzso Recent findings suggest that major zzso zzso of the zzso gene might account for at least some of the apparently zzso negative zzso We studied 60 affected zzso belonging to families with a strong history of breast and/or zzso cancer who scored negative for zzso gene zzso by zzso and zzso zzso DNA was zzso by the Southern zzso procedure using three different restriction zzso and two zzso obtained by zzso of the zzso and 3' zzso coding zzso A 3 zzso deletion encompassing zzso 17 and causing a zzso zzso was identified in two independently zzso zzso zzso and long-range DNA zzso were employed to characterize the zzso that was finally shown to be the result of a zzso between two very similar zzso zzso This type of zzso is not identified by the conventional methods of zzso detection which are based on zzso amplification of single zzso zzso further search for gene zzso is needed to better define the proportion of zzso zzso families that might be explained by gross zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
