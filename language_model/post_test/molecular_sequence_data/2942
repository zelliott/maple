We have generated four zzso zzso specific for one or more members of a series of two zzso derived zzso influenza virus zzso Three of these zzso share zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of these zzso were determined, and it was found that two of these zzso use genes from the zzso family, whereas the third uses a gene from the zzso zzso All four zzso zzso derive from different families of genes zzso the variable region of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the parent zzso virus as well as the zzso sequences of the sequential zzso were also determined, and it was demonstrated that the zzso zzso molecules differed from the parent zzso by only a single zzso acid zzso Despite these subtle differences in zzso structures of zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso their primary structures were very zzso These data reinforce the idea that a wide variety of zzso structures exist which are directed against subtly different structures in biologically important zzso
