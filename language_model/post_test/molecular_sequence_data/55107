The glacial cycles of the zzso have been recognized as important, large-scale historical processes that strongly influenced the demographic patterns and genetic structure of many zzso Here we present evidence of a zzso expansion for the zzso zzso zzso zzso a common member of the forest bird communities in North America with a zzso zzso DNA sequences from the zzso zzso and zzso 6 and 8 zzso and zzso data from seven variable zzso were combined with a species distribution model zzso to zzso possible historical scenarios for this species after the last glacial zzso zzso of zzso zzso from 23 geographic areas suggested little zzso shallow zzso zzso and limited population structure across the zzso zzso zzso which have higher resolution and are able to detect recent differences, revealed two geographic groups where populations along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains zzso Utah, Colorado, and southern zzso were genetically isolated from the rest of the sampled zzso zzso DNA, an important marker to detect historical patterns, recovered only one zzso However, populations in Idaho and southeast BC contained high zzso diversity and, in general were characterized by the absence of the most common zzso zzso The zzso suggested several areas in the southern US as containing suitable zzso zzso habitat during the zzso The lack of considerable geographic structure and the zzso zzso network, combined with several population genetic tests, suggest a scenario of demographic expansion during the last part of zzso and early zzso
