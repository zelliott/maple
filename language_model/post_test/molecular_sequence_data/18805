For molecular study of marine bacteria zzso zzso using zzso a novel zzso zzso belonging to the family zzso was isolated, and its zzso was completely zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso DNA with a zzso content of zzso and it was predicted to have 62 open reading frames zzso which were classified into functional groups, including zzso structure, packaging, DNA zzso regulation, and additional zzso The zzso life style prediction using zzso showed that it may be a temperate zzso However, genes related to zzso and host zzso were not detected in the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso information about zzso zzso zzso in the zzso databases may not be sufficient for the functional prediction of their zzso zzso This is the first report of a zzso zzso zzso and this zzso zzso study will provide useful information for further molecular research on zzso zzso and its zzso as well as their zzso
