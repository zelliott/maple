Several zzso zzso have been zzso zzso labeling in zzso Here we report that simultaneous zzso of fluorescent protein zzso can give zzso results caused by the conversion of spectral zzso Under standard zzso conditions, approximately zzso of cells produce zzso results, but, depending on the conditions, up to zzso of the cells permanently express altered fusion zzso This compromises the interpretation of the zzso The conversion is independent of zzso methods or cell zzso Our results show that the effect is based on zzso zzso process events that occur between the zzso sequences of the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso or low sequence similarities avoided zzso The appearance of conversion zzso exchanges of spectral properties infusion zzso the creation of libraries, or the assembly of DNA fusion zzso in zzso The detailed zzso of the conversion rate allows the investigation of zzso processes in zzso
