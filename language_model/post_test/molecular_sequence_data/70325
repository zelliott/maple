The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso a zzso group to a single zzso in several cellular zzso zzso include the zzso zzso nuclear zzso and several retinal zzso all of which end with a zzso where C is zzso A is an zzso zzso acid, and X is zzso or zzso zzso zzso for the alpha and beta zzso of the rat zzso have been zzso and both have been shown to be essential for zzso zzso Here we have used the rat zzso to clone zzso for the human alpha and beta zzso zzso of the human and rat zzso acid sequences revealed a remarkable degree of conservation zzso identity for the alpha zzso and zzso identity for the beta zzso The functional genes for the alpha and beta zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were localized to human zzso bands zzso and zzso respectively, by Southern zzso zzso and zzso analyses of panels of human zzso Chinese zzso zzso cell hybrid lines and by zzso zzso in zzso zzso We also found several related zzso zzso zzso was assigned to zzso zzso to zzso 13, and zzso to zzso zzso
