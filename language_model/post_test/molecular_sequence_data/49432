Although zzso zzso are critically involved in the zzso II zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso how zzso receptors activate zzso zzso is not fully zzso We examined the structural requirements of the zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso zzso receptors indicated that the zzso acid sequence between 312 and 337 is required for zzso of zzso The role of the zzso zzso motif in this sequence in zzso of zzso was investigated by mutating zzso zzso zzso II failed to activate zzso in cells expressing zzso whereas zzso was activated even without zzso II in cells expressing zzso which mimics the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso II increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso but not with zzso in response to zzso II zzso whereas the zzso zzso interaction was inhibited in the presence of dominant negative zzso The requirement of zzso seems specific for zzso because zzso zzso zzso of other zzso zzso including zzso and zzso was preserved in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also maintained in zzso through zzso of zzso zzso of wild type zzso zzso in cardiac zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso failed to enhance cell zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso in response to zzso II and plays a key role in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and cell zzso possibly through its interaction with zzso and zzso
