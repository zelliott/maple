zzso zzso causes trench fever, zzso and the zzso disorders zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Little is known about the interaction of this pathogen with host zzso We attempted to zzso the interaction of zzso zzso with human zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso strain zzso induced zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso from zzso and zzso 229 cells upon infection similar to the zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso whereas other strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not induce such zzso zzso testing and electron zzso revealed that the zzso zzso strains unable to induce zzso zzso did not express the variable outer membrane proteins zzso on their zzso Surprisingly, the increase in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was not paralleled by elevated host cell adherence rates compared with the rates for zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso play a leading role in the zzso zzso of host cells by zzso zzso but not in the adherence to host zzso
