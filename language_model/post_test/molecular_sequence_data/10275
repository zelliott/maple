We describe an approach for identifying novel inflammatory zzso based on screening for immediate zzso response genes whose induction by an inflammatory stimulus is attenuated by zzso This procedure can be applied to a wide range of cell types and zzso using a variety of zzso In an initial test of this idea, we identified zzso for 12 zzso zzso response genes zzso by differential zzso screening of a zzso zzso zzso library from zzso zzso zzso Seven of the zzso were known zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso One of the novel zzso was a new zzso zzso that we designated zzso for zzso zzso zzso Because the 12 zzso zzso were identified in a single screening of only 15,000 zzso and four were found as single zzso these results suggest that there are many zzso not yet zzso Furthermore, six of the seven known zzso zzso proteins that zzso zzso zzso These results support our hypothesis that zzso predominantly zzso products that function in zzso cell zzso Here we provide an overview of the zzso strategy and the differential zzso procedures used in our initial zzso A variety of other methods for identifying zzso expressed genes may be used in future searches for novel zzso
