We have characterized two zzso gene family members expressed in the prostate and zzso zzso of zzso One zzso zzso is identical with the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes an zzso closely related to zzso The second zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso that retains key zzso acid zzso responsible for the characteristic zzso zzso specificity of zzso Two zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso sequence were used to demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso in the prostate and zzso zzso and its absence in eight other rat zzso known to express one or more members of the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was identified among zzso clones containing zzso family members by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The identification of the zzso gene was verified by zzso zzso the zzso sequences of zzso match the zzso zzso zzso The upstream region of zzso where zzso regulatory elements likely zzso is very similar to that of other rat zzso family genes which are expressed in distinct zzso zzso
