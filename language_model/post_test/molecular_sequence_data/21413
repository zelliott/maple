To investigate the role of the zzso zzso factor 2 zzso zzso factor family in retinal diseases, zzso expression was assessed during retinal zzso in the zzso mouse model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso genes was further zzso 

zzso of zzso members was analyzed by zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso was the only zzso member markedly zzso during retinal zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso level was decreased by more than zzso at 2 and 4 months and by zzso at 6 months in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the protein level was confirmed in zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso levels in the developing zzso zzso from zzso day zzso 13 zzso was zzso with the decreased expression of the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso was further shown to drive zzso zzso activity, supporting a zzso role for zzso in the zzso In addition, zzso appeared to act as a zzso zzso of its own expression and the expression of the zzso retinal zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings highlight the early altered regulation of the zzso zzso network in zzso zzso They also indicate that zzso may act as a novel zzso factor involved in the development and the maintenance of zzso zzso
