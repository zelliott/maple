The zzso zzso zzso at zzso is fused with two different molecular partners, zzso and zzso following two zzso zzso zzso in childhood zzso zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso by virtue of its fusion with zzso and by a combination of molecular zzso zzso was localized on zzso suggesting that the novel zzso originated by a cryptic zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso expressed at low level in a variety of human zzso including zzso cell lines from different zzso zzso zzso zzso displays high zzso with a number of zzso clones from different human zzso High zzso was found also with zzso clones from mouse and zzso suggesting that the sequence might be zzso at least among zzso The function of the putative zzso zzso however, is currently unknown as database sequence comparisons have failed to reveal strong zzso with known zzso The zzso fusion appears to be a zzso feature of zzso zzso suggesting that it might have a role in the development and/or progression of zzso
