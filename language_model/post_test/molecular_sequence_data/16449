Genome zzso produces a considerable number of putative proteins lacking sequence similarity to known zzso These are referred to as zzso The proportion of orphan genes varies among zzso and is independent of zzso zzso In the present study, we show that the proportion of orphan genes roughly zzso with the isolation index of organisms zzso an indicator introduced in the present study, which represents the degree of isolation of a given zzso as measured by sequence zzso However, there are zzso zzso with respect to the linear zzso consisting of those zzso that may contain excess amounts of orphan zzso Comparisons of zzso sequences among closely related strains revealed that some of the zzso genes are not zzso suggesting that they are zzso occurring by zzso zzso of these zzso zzso within closely related zzso improved the correlation between the proportion of orphan genes and the zzso zzso Assuming that the correlation holds in general, this relationship was used to estimate the number of zzso orphan genes in a zzso Using this definition of authentic orphan zzso the anomalies arising from zzso zzso the percentages of structural zzso were corrected for 16 zzso including those of five zzso
