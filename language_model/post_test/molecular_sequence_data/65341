The production of zzso zzso is a direct consequence of the zzso tolerance of the module 3 zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid motifs in the active site of AT zzso influence zzso selection for zzso zzso or zzso zzso This motif appears in hybrid form zzso in zzso and may represent the molecular basis for the relaxed specificity of the zzso To investigate this possibility the AT zzso from zzso 2 and 3 of the zzso zzso were examined in the zzso zzso model zzso zzso of zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso both resulted in functional zzso although lower yields of total products were observed when compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso As expected, zzso was significantly more zzso in keeping with its nature during zzso zzso When the mixed motif zzso of zzso within the hybrid zzso was zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso it resulted in a zzso zzso When this mixed motif was converted to zzso zzso of zzso zzso the selectivity of the hybrid zzso for zzso showed no statistically significant increase, and was associated with a loss of zzso
