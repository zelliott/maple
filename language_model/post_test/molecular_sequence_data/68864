The alpha 6 beta 4 zzso is structurally distinct from all the other known zzso because the zzso domain of beta 4 is unusually large and contains four type III zzso zzso toward its zzso To examine the function of the beta 4 zzso tail, we have expressed full-length and truncated human beta 4 zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso cells, which form zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso beta 4 zzso associated with zzso alpha 6 and was recruited at the cell surface within zzso zzso A zzso form of beta 4, lacking almost the entire zzso domain associated with alpha 6, reached the cell surface but remained zzso zzso A beta 4 zzso lacking almost the entire zzso portion did not associate with alpha 6 but was correctly targeted to the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso portion of beta 4 contains sequences that are required and may be sufficient for the assembly of the alpha 6 beta 4 zzso into zzso To zzso these sequences we examined the properties of additional zzso forms of beta zzso A truncated beta 4 zzso lacking the most zzso pair of type III zzso zzso zzso was incorporated into zzso zzso but another zzso beta 4 zzso lacking both pairs of type III zzso repeats, was zzso Finally a zzso beta 4 zzso which was created by adjoining the region of the zzso domain including all type III repeats to the zzso segment, was efficiently recruited in zzso zzso Taken together these results suggest that the assembly of the alpha 6 beta 4 zzso into zzso is zzso by a zzso acid region of beta 4 tail that comprises the first pair of type III zzso repeats and the segment between the second and third zzso These data imply a function of a specific segment of the beta 4 zzso domain in interaction with zzso components of zzso
