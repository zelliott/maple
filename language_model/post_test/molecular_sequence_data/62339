The free energy governing zzso zzso through zzso A channels is characterized by using over zzso zzso of zzso molecular dynamics simulations with explicit zzso and zzso The results provide encouraging agreement with experiments and insights into the zzso zzso The free energy surface of zzso as a function of both zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso for simulation artifacts due to zzso and the lack of hydrocarbon zzso the calculated single-channel zzso for zzso zzso is zzso zzso closer to experiment than any previous zzso In addition, the estimated single zzso zzso zzso are within the range of experimental zzso The relatively small free energy barrier to zzso zzso arises from a balance of large opposing contributions from zzso zzso water, bulk zzso and zzso Mean force decomposition reveals a remarkable ability of the zzso water molecules to stabilize zzso by zzso zzso roughly half the bulk zzso free zzso The importance of the zzso water confirms the conjecture of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso 46, zzso Ion association with the channel involves gradual zzso from approximately six to seven water molecules in the first zzso to just two inside the narrow zzso Ion zzso is influenced by the orientation of the zzso water column, which can present a barrier to zzso and give rise to long-range zzso of zzso on either side of the zzso Small changes in the potential function, including contributions from electronic zzso are likely to be sufficient to obtain quantitative agreement with zzso
