Human zzso 71 zzso is a common zzso agent of hand, foot and mouth disease zzso In recent years, the virus has caused several outbreaks with high numbers of deaths and severe neurological zzso Several new zzso zzso were identified from these zzso The mechanisms that contributed to the emergence of these zzso are zzso 

Six zzso zzso from an outbreak in zzso in 1997, were zzso zzso These zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso B4 and zzso A zzso tree that correlated well with the present zzso zzso scheme was established using these full zzso sequences and all other available full zzso sequences of zzso and human zzso A zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions, however, zzso of zzso zzso B3 and C4 zzso away from other zzso zzso into a cluster together with zzso A16 zzso and zzso zzso C2 clustered with zzso zzso from the similarity plot analyses supported the zzso of these zzso with other zzso In contrast, at the same zzso regions, a zzso zzso zzso clustered with zzso This suggests that amongst zzso and zzso only the structural genes were zzso The 3' end of the virus zzso varied and consisted of sequences highly similar to various zzso zzso Numerous zzso crossover zzso were identified within the zzso genes of some of these newer zzso zzso 

zzso evidence obtained from analyses of the full zzso sequence supports the possible occurrence of zzso zzso involving zzso and various zzso including zzso the most common zzso agent of zzso It is suggested that these zzso events played important roles in the emergence of the various zzso zzso
