A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso in order to assess the effect on DNA binding of zzso that arises because of lack of zzso correspondence between zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso estimated from zzso zzso are from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values for calf zzso DNA and for zzso are approximately zzso and approximately zzso zzso respectively reflecting the anticipated AT zzso zzso binding was examined by reflecting the anticipated AT zzso zzso binding was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso complementary strand zzso on an zzso restriction zzso of zzso DNA with r zzso zzso and zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso linked by zzso where zzso zzso 2, 4 or 6, give evidence of zzso binding in zzso sequences from zzso at r zzso zzso By contrast, those zzso linked by zzso where zzso zzso 1, 3, 5 or 7, bind in a predominantly zzso zzso zzso activity against zzso human zzso cancer cells has shown enhanced zzso compared with zzso for those linked zzso with zzso zzso 2, 4 and zzso That the increased potency may be attributed to more effective DNA binding in the latter cases is indicated by the fact that the zzso zzso 1, 3, 5 and 7 zzso zzso do not exhibit comparable enhanced zzso zzso
