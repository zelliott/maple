zzso are zzso zzso responsible for iron zzso zzso and delivery in many higher zzso The two zzso zzso of zzso are thought to have evolved by gene zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso In the present study, a zzso primitive zzso zzso zzso or zzso from the serum of the model zzso species zzso zzso was isolated by using an immobilized zzso column and characterized by using mass zzso and zzso zzso The protein binds one equivalent of zzso and exhibits an electron zzso resonance spectrum that is zzso The zzso spectrum of zzso has a shoulder at 330 zzso in both the zzso and the zzso forms, but does not display the approximately 460 zzso zzso charge transfer band common to zzso serum zzso under the conditions zzso This result suggests that iron may adopt a different binding mode in zzso compared with the more highly evolved zzso zzso This difference in binding mode could have implications for the zzso role of the protein in the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso has genes for both a zzso and a zzso zzso and the sequences of both proteins are discussed in light of the known features of zzso serum zzso as well as other zzso zzso
