Y zzso are small zzso zzso which are components of the zzso zzso complexes in higher zzso These complexes are frequently recognized by zzso present in zzso zzso In this study we zzso the occurrence of Y zzso in various zzso and human cell lines and zzso by means of zzso with human Y zzso zzso Y zzso zzso to their human counterparts, both in length and in zzso were detected in all zzso cells zzso While zzso and zzso zzso were found in all cells, zzso and zzso zzso could not be detected in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was absent from bovine zzso Attempts to determine the sequence of rat Y zzso by zzso cloning resulted in the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso content of various human cell lines showed that all four human Y zzso were present in all cell lines zzso However, the relative levels to which these zzso were expressed showed marked zzso
