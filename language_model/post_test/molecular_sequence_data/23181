In mouse male germ cells, global DNA zzso occurs in zzso at zzso days zzso In the present study, we examined which de zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso or zzso is expressed in zzso at these zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses revealed that zzso was the major DNA zzso expressed in zzso at zzso day zzso zzso which is necessary for zzso was zzso in zzso at identical stages to zzso On the other hand, zzso was expressed not in germ cells but in the zzso cells and zzso tissue cells that surround zzso and zzso zzso an zzso of zzso was expressed faintly but significantly in zzso at 16 days zzso and increased in zzso at 4 and 6 days zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso was confirmed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction amplification and zzso sequencing of the amplified zzso The results strongly suggest that zzso and zzso are responsible for the global DNA zzso in mouse male germ zzso
