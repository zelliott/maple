The gene of zzso zzso that encodes a major zzso protein zzso was cloned in zzso zzso The gene was designated zzso as zzso was previously shown to represent an zzso protein zzso Kuhn and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso coli clone expressed zzso as shown by zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a putative zzso signal sequence of 27 zzso acids and an extended repeat region consisting of 19 zzso zzso zzso with the entire zzso gene revealed the presence of zzso sequences in most other zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso internal zzso probe which contained the whole repeat region zzso only with zzso DNA from zzso zzso Four zzso previously described as specific zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1988) were shown to be part of the zzso zzso
