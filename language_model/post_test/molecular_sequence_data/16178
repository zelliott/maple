We monitored zzso interactions that occur on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoters in nuclear extracts derived from frozen zzso zzso zzso All four of these promoters were found to be transcribed in zzso at comparable levels by extracts from both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in both types of extracts that block zzso zzso from a downstream site at zzso zzso and zzso base pairs from the start of zzso of all four of these zzso In addition, factors in extracts from zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso at sites zzso the heat shock consensus sequences of zzso and zzso Competition experiments indicated that common factors cause the zzso and zzso barriers on all four promoters in both zzso The formation of the barriers at zzso and zzso required a zzso box but did not appear to require specific sequences downstream of zzso We suggest that the factors responsible for the zzso and zzso barriers are components whose association with the promoter precedes zzso zzso
