zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a successful target for a zzso contraceptive approach, but the agents tested to date have had unacceptable side zzso zzso the structure of the zzso zzso to allow rational inhibitor design has therefore been a goal for a number of years but has proved intractable because of the zzso nature of both native and zzso zzso We have obtained soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso with the zzso coli zzso zzso in a ratio of zzso and have solved the structure of the zzso which we believe represents a novel strategy for structure determination of an zzso zzso A structure was also obtained where zzso zzso binds in the zzso pocket in the active site of the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Modeling and comparison of the structures of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed few differences at the active site and hence zzso the long presumed structural specificity of zzso for the zzso zzso The contraceptive activity of zzso and its apparent specificity for the zzso zzso in zzso are likely to be due to differences in metabolism to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso However, further detailed analysis of the zzso zzso zzso structure revealed sites in the zzso that do show significant difference compared with published zzso zzso zzso structures that could be exploited by zzso drug design to identify leads for novel male zzso
