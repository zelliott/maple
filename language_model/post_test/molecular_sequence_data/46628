zzso and long terminal repeat zzso zzso share a common structural zzso The main difference between these zzso is the presence of a functional envelope zzso gene in zzso which is absent or zzso in zzso zzso Several similarities between these two groups of zzso have been detected for the reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso Assuming that each of these zzso shares a common ancestral zzso several hypotheses could account for the emergence of zzso from zzso zzso In this context, the positions of elements such as gypsy and the members of the zzso zzso are not clear, since they are classified as zzso but zzso they are assigned to the zzso zzso zzso We compared the zzso gene products of these zzso and identified two similar motifs in zzso and zzso zzso These two regions do not occur in the same zzso If we assume that they are derived from the same ancestral zzso this could result from independent acquisition of the various zzso rather than the single acquisition of the whole zzso zzso However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the zzso gene was reorganized after being zzso Trees based on these regions show that these two groups of elements are clearly zzso These trees are similar to those obtained from reverse zzso or zzso In trees based on reverse zzso the zzso with complete or partial zzso genes can be distinguished from the other zzso zzso
