The success of gene therapy using a zzso interference approach relies on small interfering zzso zzso expression from a highly zzso zzso zzso II promoter rather than from ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso we have developed a zzso zzso that expresses zzso from the human zzso zzso promoter, a zzso zzso II zzso Our data demonstrate zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso in the zzso prostate cancer cell line, zzso The biological significance was evidenced by altered zzso activity through the zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso These results demonstrate that zzso gene zzso from a zzso zzso zzso II promoter could be a potential tool for zzso gene zzso
