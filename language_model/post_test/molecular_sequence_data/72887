zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso that encodes a novel member of the zzso zzso family was zzso The protein zzso by zzso contained 619 zzso zzso zzso of which were identical with those of the zzso zzso family proteins previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso incorporation experiments in zzso cells verified a high affinity system zzso zzso activity of zzso First, zzso zzso incorporation was zzso and zzso with zzso constant zzso values of 103 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Second, the incorporation was specific for zzso zzso acids as evidenced from the zzso by zzso zzso and zzso Third, neither sodium nor zzso zzso in the zzso medium were required for the zzso Fourth, the incorporation was inhibited by high zzso membrane zzso On Northern zzso using zzso from various rat zzso the expression of zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso These results indicated a role of zzso in the system zzso zzso activity in the nervous zzso
