zzso cloning of zzso was first described a decade ago and was based on transient expression of zzso libraries in zzso zzso In contrast to transient zzso of zzso zzso gene transfer delivers genes zzso into a wide range of target zzso We zzso a simple packaging system for production of zzso zzso stock from zzso libraries to establish a zzso expression cloning zzso In two model experiments, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were infected with libraries of zzso expressed zzso derived from human zzso zzso or human zzso zzso cell line zzso These infected zzso cells were selected for the expression of zzso by flow zzso or for the alpha zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 in zzso and zzso alpha zzso 1 in zzso zzso zzso zzso were readily detected in small-scale experiments, indicating this zzso expression cloning system is efficient enough to clone zzso zzso by their expression or zzso
