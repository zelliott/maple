The zzso stress caused by zzso of the zzso machinery and template generates zzso in a closed zzso domain, but has been presumed to be too short-lived to be significant in an open zzso This report shows that zzso zzso zzso zzso sustain sufficient zzso to zzso DNA structure even on linear zzso zzso to capture and measure zzso generated zzso and to trap short-lived zzso in DNA structure and zzso showed that the transient forces upstream of active promoters are large enough to drive the zzso far upstream element zzso of the human zzso into zzso zzso An alternative non-B zzso of zzso found in zzso zzso DNA is not accessible zzso These results demonstrate that dynamic zzso of DNA structure provides a real-time measure of ongoing genetic zzso
