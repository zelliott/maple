We are interested in learning more about the zzso of zzso zzso the fungus that causes common bean zzso zzso of the proteins that differentiate zzso stages and distinguish infectious bodies such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be used to define zzso interactions or serve as targets for chemical zzso of the zzso We have used zzso zzso to identify more than 400 proteins from asexual zzso A majority of the proteins appear to have roles in protein folding or protein zzso We present a model by which an abundance of heat shock proteins and translation zzso factors may enhance a zzso ability to survive environmental stresses and rapidly initiate protein production upon zzso
