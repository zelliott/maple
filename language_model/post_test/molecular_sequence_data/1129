zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso that zzso bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the zzso intermediate zzso II and blocking its zzso to form the zzso chains of zzso Although zzso is a promising compound for certain zzso it has limitations that impede IV administration for systemic zzso However, it may be possible to overcome these limitations with zzso In this zzso we dissect the effects of structural changes to zzso The studies described here combine total synthesis with zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso to shed light on the roles of key structural features in this zzso in zzso II zzso zzso zzso and biological zzso The results should serve as a foundation for the design of zzso accessible zzso with improved biological zzso
