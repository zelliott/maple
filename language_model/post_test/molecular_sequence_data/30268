A zzso zzso zzso library was constructed from zzso zzso from zzso B viral surface zzso human plasma with high zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso designated as zzso was isolated by zzso with mixed zzso from zzso non-B zzso zzso carrier and zzso zzso The zzso protein produced by zzso reacted specifically with zzso of patients in the chronic phase of zzso The sequence of zzso zzso zzso did not zzso with any human or zzso zzso DNA, and had no zzso with those of primates and zzso The existence of this sequence in zzso of possibly infectious plasma was shown by zzso zzso zzso and by Southern zzso analysis of products amplified by the zzso chain zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is derived from the agent of this viral zzso
