zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso has a zzso signal at the zzso region, two long zzso regions in the middle part, and a zzso zzso domain, which involves zzso acid sequences zzso to the zzso zzso zzso A zzso disrupted zzso grows in rich medium at 37 degrees C but not at 42 degrees zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cell division and zzso ring formation are inhibited at 42 degrees C without zzso zzso resulting in zzso cells with multiple zzso and finally in cell zzso Five percent zzso suppresses the temperature sensitivity of the zzso disrupted zzso The zzso has the same sensitivity to drugs, such as zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso as the parental zzso zzso protein is recovered in the inner membrane and zzso zzso but not in the outer membrane zzso zzso suggest that the zzso regions and the zzso zzso domain of zzso are localized in the zzso space, not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso activity that split the zzso zzso
