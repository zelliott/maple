In the zzso death program, zzso and zzso of different zzso and zzso zzso proteins are critical in the determination of cell zzso From a rat zzso fusion zzso library, we isolated a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso killer zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 and a zzso zzso region present in other zzso zzso but lacked the zzso domain found only in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso system, zzso zzso strongly with some zzso zzso and zzso but not other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding is in direct contrast to the ability of other zzso members zzso zzso and zzso to interact with all of the zzso zzso In addition, negligible interaction was found between zzso and different zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso induced zzso that was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Cell killing induced by zzso was also suppressed following zzso with zzso and zzso but not with zzso further indicating that zzso zzso only with selective zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso was highly expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso analysis localized zzso zzso in zzso cells, the cell type that underwent zzso during zzso zzso Identification of zzso as a new zzso zzso protein with restricted tissue distribution and zzso properties could facilitate zzso of zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso cell zzso
