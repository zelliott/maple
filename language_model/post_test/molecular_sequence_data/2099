A zzso zzso zzso detected with the human zzso zzso and the zzso zzso I has been reported to be associated with zzso diabetes zzso zzso in White and Black populations and zzso with diabetes in two small zzso with zzso diabetes of the zzso A size difference of approximately 500 base pairs zzso was demonstrated between the zzso of this and several other zzso that mapped to the same zzso region near the zzso coding region of the zzso zzso thus suggesting the presence of an zzso in this region that could affect zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments containing this zzso were cloned from an individual zzso for the putative zzso and the differing fragments of the two zzso were zzso The presence of a zzso zzso was thus confirmed and was demonstrated to be entirely within an zzso No significant zzso differences from published zzso sequences were detected in four zzso zzso from the region of the zzso zzso The zzso regions included multiple zzso repeat zzso The zzso was unusual in that the larger zzso consisted of an additional zzso repeat sequence that included a new zzso I zzso Because the nature and location of the zzso did not suggest a role in zzso function, the association of this zzso with zzso and zzso was zzso in a small sample of zzso No association could be demonstrated, and the zzso also failed to segregate with zzso in five White zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
