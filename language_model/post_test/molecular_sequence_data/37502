The mechanisms by which zzso zzso receptors are zzso following chronic exposure to zzso are not well zzso Interestingly, the human zzso zzso does not zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso does zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence of the third zzso loop of these two receptors shows that the zzso zzso zzso contains a potential G zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso with four zzso zzso whereas the human zzso zzso motif only contains two zzso zzso zzso Because a similar zzso zzso motif zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be zzso by zzso and all four zzso are required for zzso of the zzso we sought to determine whether the zzso sequence was involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used to mutate the zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso in place of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments on zzso cells zzso with the receptors demonstrated that neither of the zzso receptors zzso following 24 h exposure to zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso to 65 zzso zzso of the zzso 

These results indicate that a motif with four zzso zzso acid zzso in an zzso environment is important for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because these are potential zzso zzso sites, we suggest that zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso
