In chronic zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso the zzso zzso zzso is the most frequent zzso aberration zzso At the molecular level the zzso gene from zzso 9 is zzso to the zzso gene on zzso zzso As a result, a zzso zzso gene is generated, which encodes zzso zzso Since these proteins are only expressed in zzso positive cells, they are per definition zzso In this report we describe the zzso of zzso zzso raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso Native zzso proteins were specifically recognized by these zzso zzso Therefore we conclude that the zzso junctions are zzso exposed on the zzso zzso We discuss the relevance of these zzso for zzso and ALL zzso
