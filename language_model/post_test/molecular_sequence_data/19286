Biological zzso have evolved different mechanisms to modify their composition in response to chemical stimuli in a process called zzso zzso Among these mechanisms, modifications in the ratio of zzso fatty acids and in zzso fatty acid zzso zzso and changes in the zzso head group composition have been zzso To further understand the role of zzso head groups in zzso stress adaptation, we knocked out the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso zzso contained less zzso than those of the zzso zzso Although no significant growth rate zzso was observed in the zzso zzso compared with the zzso strain, zzso cells were significantly smaller than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was more sensitive to zzso shocks and to several antibiotics than the parental strain, suggesting either that the zzso zzso pumps involved in the zzso of these drugs were not working efficiently or that membrane zzso was altered in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strain seemed to be more rigid than those of the parental strain, as observed by zzso of zzso polarization using the zzso probe, which zzso into the zzso zzso zzso is pumped out in zzso zzso by at least one zzso zzso pump involved in zzso and zzso resistance, and the higher rate of zzso of zzso zzso inside zzso cells indicated that functioning of the zzso pumps was compromised as a consequence of the zzso in zzso head group zzso
