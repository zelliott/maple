zzso of the reactions responsible for the zzso fusion of zzso zzso with the plasma membrane in zzso cells would be facilitated by the identification of participant proteins having known zzso zzso The successful characterization of zzso and zzso proteins that may function in zzso zzso has not yet revealed the molecular events underlying this zzso zzso zzso consists of sequential zzso and triggering steps which depend on zzso and zzso respectively, and require distinct zzso zzso zzso of zzso factors zzso zzso should enable the zzso reactions to be zzso Here we show that one of the zzso zzso factors zzso is identical to zzso transfer protein zzso The zzso role of zzso was previously zzso We also find that zzso the zzso zzso transfer protein which is essential for zzso zzso can substitute for zzso in zzso Our results indicate that a role for zzso transfer proteins is zzso in the zzso and regulated zzso zzso
