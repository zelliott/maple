A highly sensitive quantitative zzso detection method has been developed and applied to the distribution analysis of human zzso zzso by combining real-time zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso detection of serially diluted DNA extracted from cultured zzso was linear for cell counts ranging from zzso to 10 cells per zzso zzso It was also found that the method was zzso to the detection of zzso in feces when it was present at zzso of zzso cells per g of zzso zzso the distribution of zzso species in zzso zzso the zzso zzso group, the zzso zzso group, and zzso zzso were found to be the three zzso species by examination of DNA extracted from the feces of 46 healthy zzso We also examined changes in the population and composition of zzso species in human zzso zzso of six healthy adults over an zzso zzso The results showed that the composition of zzso zzso was basically stable throughout the test zzso
