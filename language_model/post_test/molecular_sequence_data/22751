The levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso proteins zzso from the larvae of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso are lower than what are present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso is dependent not only on zzso concentration but also on the presence of enhancers that may be either proteins (including other zzso zzso or zzso mass enhancers such as zzso The purpose of this study was to identify zzso protein enhancers using zzso zzso zzso and finally the enhancement of zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso protein from zzso zzso until recently known only from plants, significantly enhances the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso can further this enhancement, presumably by promoting the interaction of the zzso and zzso zzso
