A zzso corresponding to the zzso of rat liver zzso was chemically zzso employing the solid phase zzso synthesis zzso Its zzso properties that depend on the coordinated zzso have been studied using zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Unlike the intact zzso which has been converted into the zzso species, the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso showed a red shift by 20 zzso and 65 zzso respectively, suggesting a more compact and stable zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso coordination was reached in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso when the zzso was used and 12 zzso zzso zzso were specifically bound by the intact zzso The zzso bands were homogeneous and no decline of the cluster structure was observed when excessive zzso was added after zzso A zzso of the zzso in zzso during its formation seems to be zzso
