A novel means of recording the expression status of the total gene population is zzso zzso of zzso by class zzso restriction zzso produces a zzso with a zzso zzso stretch and a zzso zzso with an unknown zzso This zzso contains information such as the class zzso zzso that cuts zzso nearest to the zzso zzso stretch, the sequence of the zzso zzso and the size of the zzso zzso genes can be zzso and displayed by the zzso as zzso zzso cut the zzso with one class zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to that from a pool of 64 zzso zzso cohesive to all possible zzso zzso digest by other two class zzso zzso zzso recover the zzso molecules with zzso zzso zzso zzso perform zzso with the zzso and an anchored zzso zzso zzso separate the amplified fragments by zzso zzso gel zzso Repeat the experiment with 64 zzso three zzso and three anchored zzso zzso displays most of the expressed zzso Because zzso is zzso this technique is also ideal for generating tags for expressed zzso with which to construct a transcript map of the zzso
