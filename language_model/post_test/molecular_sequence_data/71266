zzso zzso zzso zzso are a group of zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from peptides and zzso The bacterial and zzso zzso are members of a zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is more zzso than the bacterial zzso with which it has up to zzso sequence zzso The zzso activity in zzso and zzso is proposed to be involved in zzso processes and in zzso zzso zzso counterparts of the zzso are involved in the processing of biologically active zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso has been determined by multiple zzso replacement techniques at zzso A resolution and refined to an R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso of single open zzso domain zzso with a prominent zzso core formed from zzso coming together from each zzso The zzso zzso have been identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of different specificity and mechanism has been zzso 

The zzso zzso has no sequence or structural zzso with other members of the zzso zzso zzso It does, however, show considerable similarities to other zzso zzso of widely varying zzso specificity and zzso suggesting that they are the products of divergent evolution from a common zzso The enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso may arise from zzso interactions between the zzso and the presence of zzso zzso zzso
