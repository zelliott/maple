zzso and cell zzso proteins are important to both zzso tuberculosis zzso and the generation of protective immunity to zzso zzso We used an in zzso zzso zzso system to identify exported proteins of zzso zzso The system is simple and efficient, and the zzso zzso randomly into target zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso libraries were targeted with zzso zzso and these libraries were screened in zzso zzso for active zzso zzso zzso zzso different zzso tuberculosis open reading frames were zzso eight contain standard signal zzso six contain zzso signal zzso and zzso contain one or more zzso zzso Four of these proteins had not yet been assigned as exported proteins in the zzso tuberculosis zzso This collection of exported proteins includes factors that are known to participate in the immune response of zzso tuberculosis and proteins with zzso suggesting a role in zzso Nine of the proteins appear to be unique to zzso and represent promising candidates for factors that participate in protective immunity and zzso This technology of creating comprehensive fusion libraries should be zzso to other zzso
