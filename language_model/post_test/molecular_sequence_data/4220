The zzso element in the promoter of the rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors which interact with these elements were zzso Six zzso binding sites and zzso box exist in the region from zzso start site to zzso zzso which showed the highest promoter activity in zzso promoter zzso In the region from zzso to zzso zzso binding site and other protein binding sites were also zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter suggested that multiple zzso sites might be involved in the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso against zzso and zzso revealed that DNA binding efficiency of zzso is increased in the liver of rats zzso low zzso zzso diet after zzso These results suggest that zzso is one of the most important zzso factors for zzso promoter to produce zzso and induced zzso by low zzso zzso zzso
