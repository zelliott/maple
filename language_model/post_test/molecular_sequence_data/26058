The ends zzso of zzso zzso are protected from degradation and from loss during DNA replication by buffers of simple tandem repetitive zzso The zzso sequence of these zzso zzso is fundamental to zzso function as a site for protein and zzso binding and varies only slightly in a wide range of zzso We present evidence that zzso of this human zzso zzso zzso are present not only at the ends of human zzso but also at numerous zzso zzso These zzso zzso share zzso sequence similarity outside the repetitive zzso suggesting that they are related functionally or have evolved from a common zzso zzso
