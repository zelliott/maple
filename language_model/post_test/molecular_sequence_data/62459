The sterile alpha motif zzso is a zzso acid domain found in over 300 proteins that are involved in either signal zzso or zzso zzso and zzso SAM zzso have been shown to mediate both zzso and zzso and in some cases zzso Here, we present the solution structure of the SAM domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which control zzso zzso growth, and zzso This is the first example of the structure of a SAM domain from a zzso module zzso We have studied the zzso behavior of zzso SAM in solution and shown that it is zzso We have examined the SAM domain from zzso the zzso zzso zzso that associates with zzso in zzso and shown that it forms zzso with a zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso We have also analyzed the interaction of zzso SAM with zzso SAM and the effects of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso on the zzso properties of zzso zzso We have found that zzso and zzso abrogate the zzso interaction with zzso and we compare these data with the known interaction sites defined for other SAM domain zzso
