The zzso gene product of zzso zzso has been shown to complement both zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso activities in zzso zzso comparison has revealed that zzso is related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and belongs to the zzso zzso protein zzso We have solved the crystal structures of zzso in the zzso and in complex with a bound product zzso The structure confirms an overall fold similar to that of zzso Most of the zzso zzso of zzso are also zzso in zzso suggesting that similar zzso mechanisms are used by both zzso zzso in zzso zzso show that zzso is indeed a zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso comparable with those of other zzso More interestingly, using high pressure liquid zzso zzso we have demonstrated that zzso is able to further transfer the zzso group to zzso using zzso as the zzso group zzso indicating that zzso has a novel zzso zzso zzso
