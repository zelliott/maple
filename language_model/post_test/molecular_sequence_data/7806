The membrane zzso of the zzso zzso 2011 zzso protein involved in zzso and export of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reporter genes to the zzso zzso Based on this analysis, the zzso protein could be divided into an zzso domain mainly located in the zzso space and a zzso domain located in the zzso Whereas the zzso domain of zzso is characterized by a potential zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain contains the sequence motif zzso which is also present in proteins involved in the determination of zzso chain zzso zzso zzso strains carrying zzso zzso zzso exclusively zzso the zzso zzso domain, produced a reduced amount of zzso This reduction could be suppressed by a zzso in the regulatory gene zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso zzso was significantly increased in the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso strain only zzso zzso could be zzso Based on sequence zzso and similar zzso profiles, the zzso domain of zzso was proposed to be a member of a protein family thought to be involved in zzso zzso zzso
