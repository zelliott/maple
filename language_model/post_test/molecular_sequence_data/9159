This study investigates sequence variation in zzso zzso c zzso zzso 1 gene within zzso zzso recorded recently in zzso Fourteen sequence types zzso were characterized for zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso DNA samples prepared from skin samples from dogs and from zzso zzso zzso from different geographical areas of the Mediterranean basin zzso Italy, Spain and zzso The most prevalent sequence types represented zzso I zzso and X zzso followed by zzso VIII zzso and other 11 zzso zzso Three zzso zzso V and zzso were found exclusively in zzso The overall zzso zzso variation among zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas a mean zzso difference of zzso was detected as compared with other zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence data showed a zzso of zzso zzso with the other zzso species (with strong statistical zzso to the exclusion of other zzso The number of zzso identified here might be explained by complex ecology and transmission patterns as well as the high zzso rate of zzso DNA and/or zzso associated with hosts and their zzso
