The zzso sequences of a specific region of the zzso gene were compared in order to investigate the genetic population structure of marine viral zzso zzso virus zzso Analysis of the sequence from 128 zzso of diverse geographic and host origin renders this the most comprehensive molecular zzso study of marine zzso conducted to zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene sequences confirmed the existence of the 4 major zzso previously identified based on zzso and subsequent zzso based zzso The range of zzso I included zzso of zzso associated with rainbow trout aquaculture zzso zzso and those from the Baltic marine environment zzso zzso to zzso the relatively close genetic relationship between these zzso The existence of an additional zzso circulating within the Baltic Sea zzso zzso was also zzso zzso III included marine zzso from around the British zzso in addition to those associated with zzso zzso highlighting a continued risk to the development of this zzso zzso IV consisted of zzso from the marine environment in North zzso Taken together, these findings suggest a marine origin of zzso in rainbow trout zzso The implications of these findings with respect to the future control of zzso are zzso The capacity for molecular zzso analysis to resolve complex zzso problems is also demonstrated and its likely future importance to disease management issues zzso
