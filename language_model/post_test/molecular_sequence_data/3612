We previously demonstrated that zzso of mice with zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso provided synergistic protection against zzso viral challenge, while zzso with plasmids expressing putative zzso proteins provided no or inconsistent zzso In this report, we sought to augment protection by increasing the breadth of the immune zzso We identified another zzso gene zzso zzso zzso that provided strong and consistent protection against viral replication in the zzso We also found that zzso with a DNA pool containing 10 zzso genes that individually were zzso zzso zzso protection against low to intermediate doses of challenge zzso Moreover, inclusion of these plasmids into a mixture with zzso zzso and zzso zzso provided even greater protection than did zzso with zzso and zzso The highest level of protection was achieved by zzso of mice with the pool of 13 zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and of greatest importance, mice zzso with both the combined zzso pool and zzso had zzso levels of virus in the zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso mice showed that zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso and zzso zzso T cells, whereas both zzso and zzso zzso generated strong zzso responses against zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso with zzso and zzso virus provides strong zzso and zzso immunity against zzso zzso
