zzso growth factor zzso protein families are zzso that occur as a large number of zzso zzso Three major zzso of these proteins with marked zzso for their receptors have been zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso Although structural information is available for some members of the zzso family of zzso and zzso very little is known about the way these growth factors interact with the zzso zzso of their cell surface zzso especially the type II zzso In addition, the elements that are the zzso of binding and specificity of the zzso are poorly zzso The structure of the zzso domain of the zzso is a zzso fold similar to some toxin zzso zzso acid exchanges between multiply aligned zzso sequences of type II receptors point to a zzso at the surface, specifically finger 1, as the zzso of zzso specificity and complex zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was predicted to be the surface that interacts with the type II zzso The zzso on strands zzso zzso zzso zzso and the loop region joining zzso and zzso and joining zzso and zzso of the zzso were identified as zzso of binding and zzso These results are supported by studies on the zzso of the type II zzso to the zzso zzso I zzso zzso
