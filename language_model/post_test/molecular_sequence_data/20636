Four sibling species in the zzso zzso complex have earlier been reported, including species D from the zzso and zzso Islands of India where it constitutes zzso of all zzso population and is a major malaria zzso Earlier, we have reported the identical sequences for zzso DNA markers among the specimens of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso islands irrespective of their zzso These zzso sequences were also identical to the reported sequence of zzso III of Southeast Asian zzso zzso In the present study, we describe variations in three zzso DNA markers among these specimens from zzso and zzso zzso There were two different zzso for each locus of zzso and zzso and three zzso for zzso zzso locus resulting in three different combined zzso zzso I, II and zzso in the zzso zzso with combined zzso I zzso zzso were found only among the zzso zzso population breeding in fresh water whereas two different zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso and zzso III zzso zzso were present in the population breeding in brackish zzso Thus, the zzso zzso population breeding in fresh water was zzso with single zzso zzso and can be distinguished from the zzso zzso population breeding in brackish water with these zzso These zzso and zzso sequences of zzso zzso species D were also different from the reported Southeast Asian species of zzso zzso
