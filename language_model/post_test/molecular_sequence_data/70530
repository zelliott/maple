There is considerable interest in the structure of the zzso state and in the role local interactions play in protein stability and protein zzso Studies of zzso fragments provide one method to assess local zzso preferences which may be present in the zzso state under zzso zzso A set of peptides corresponding to the individual elements of secondary structure derived from the zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso have been zzso This small 56 zzso protein adopts a mixed zzso zzso and has been shown to fold rapidly in an apparent two-state zzso The zzso preferences of each zzso have been analyzed by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso corresponding to each of the three zzso and to the first zzso are zzso as judged by CD and zzso In contrast, a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso is remarkably zzso This 17 zzso zzso is 53 % zzso at pH zzso 4 degrees zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the zzso structure is distributed approximately zzso throughout the zzso although there is some evidence for fraying at the C zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso indicate that the zzso is zzso in part, by a native zzso interaction involving zzso A zzso zzso which lacks zzso is only 32 % zzso pH and zzso zzso studies suggested that charge charge interactions make only a modest net contribution to the stability of the zzso The protein contains a trans zzso zzso bond located at the first position of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and of a smaller zzso containing the zzso zzso indicates that only a small amount of zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso is likely to be populated in the unfolded zzso
