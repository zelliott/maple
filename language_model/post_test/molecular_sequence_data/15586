zzso regulates a variety of stress responses and zzso adaptation in zzso In the present study, the zzso is adopted to investigate the differential protein zzso by zzso in zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso A total of 224 zzso were identified, of which 64 zzso were detected three or more zzso zzso zzso a general reduction in zzso proteins in zzso zzso three zzso and three zzso unique zzso were identified, zzso zzso of the cellular functions of these zzso revealed that zzso of them are related to signaling and gene zzso zzso sequence alignment reveals two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso with zzso proteins reveals five zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso present in these zzso zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso 4 zzso are predicted to contain one of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso peptides has been validated by the in zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso The differential regulation of zzso by zzso is substantiated by Western dot zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso signals may be zzso by a zzso from receptors to zzso events via both zzso and zzso zzso
