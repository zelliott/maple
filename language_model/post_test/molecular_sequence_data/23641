To understand the molecular processes regulating zzso changes during zzso life histories we focused on zzso zzso zzso a family of zzso factors essential for pattern formation during zzso In this study we report the isolation of the partial sequence of zzso a zzso gene of zzso zzso Other members of this gene family, characterized in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute to cell fate determination of various zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso clusters with members of the zzso group and that zzso have at least two different zzso zzso By real time zzso we determined that zzso expression is zzso greater in segmented worms than in zzso The enhancement of zzso expression during zzso could be associated to changes in the zzso pattern occurring in zzso zzso
