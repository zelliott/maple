Lake zzso is an important freshwater lake for the southeast United States, as it represents the main source of drinking water for the Atlanta metropolitan area and is popular for recreational zzso zzso freshwater lakes such as Lake zzso are underrepresented among the growing number of environmental zzso data sets, and little is known about how functional gene content in freshwater communities relates to that of other zzso To better characterize the gene content and zzso of this freshwater zzso microbial community, we zzso several samples obtained around a strong summer storm event and during the fall water mixing using a random zzso shotgun zzso zzso Comparative zzso revealed that the gene content was relatively stable over time and more related to that of another freshwater lake and the surface ocean than to zzso However, the zzso diversity of Lake zzso communities was distinct from that of soil and marine zzso We identified several important zzso adaptations that account for these findings, such as the use of zzso (as opposed to zzso zzso by freshwater organisms and differences in the community average zzso zzso We show that the lake community is predominantly composed of zzso populations and describe a simple method to assess community complexity based on population richness and zzso and to determine the sequencing effort required to cover diversity in a zzso This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and zzso potential of a temperate zzso freshwater community and advances approaches for comparative zzso
