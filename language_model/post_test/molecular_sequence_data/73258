We have previously identified a zzso region in the zzso zzso P zzso zzso of which the expression is completely zzso in liver of the zzso At least three zzso factors bind to multiple zzso in this zzso Since zzso zzso 4 zzso is a dominant element in this zzso we zzso the zzso binding zzso called zzso Factor A zzso zzso zzso was separated into several proteins on an zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequences of four major components of zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequences of three fragments were identical to those of rat zzso and that of the other zzso was the same as that of zzso zzso It is known that nuclear factor 1 zzso family proteins are zzso by at least four independent genes in zzso and zzso and zzso are derived from different zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso revealed that at least two types of zzso existed in rat zzso zzso analysis by using zzso protein in zzso cells revealed that zzso represented the zzso activity from human zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that multiple forms of the zzso family bind to the zzso region and contribute to the negative regulation of the zzso gene zzso
