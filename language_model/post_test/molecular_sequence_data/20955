The purpose of this study was to screen for genes involved in zzso zzso in an attempt to develop an effective zzso therapy for zzso zzso We constructed zzso expression libraries for the human zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and performed a focus formation zzso with zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso and zzso 8 zzso were identified from zzso and zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso 1 zzso 4 zzso zzso maturation factor beta zzso and zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso gene analysis revealed a zzso zzso AAA substitution at zzso 61, resulting in a zzso zzso zzso change at position zzso When the zzso zzso was introduced into zzso for its zzso many transformed zzso were generated, confirming the transforming ability of the zzso zzso
