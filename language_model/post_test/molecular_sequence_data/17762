A zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso to the zzso was isolated from the fox zzso and zzso This zzso is an zzso arranged zzso Its zzso zzso consist of three zzso zzso each 245 zzso long, abundant with overlapping imperfect tandem repeats which in turn are rich in short direct related repeats (each zzso zzso in zzso The zzso are mainly composed of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso CT, zzso All zzso in the zzso are flanked by motifs zzso to zzso zzso At certain points the sites are zzso The above data allow to assume that the zzso complex structure is likely to have developed throughout long zzso evolution of relatively simple DNA sequences which had emerged de zzso Single zzso small zzso and zzso multiple zzso and zzso events seem to have most contributed to the evolution of the zzso Single zzso in zzso with respect to the consensus are not equally distributed along their zzso A zzso pattern of this distribution is the evidence for zzso character of zzso zzso A correspondence was noted between conservative regions in zzso and the presence zzso of functional motifs zzso to the binding sites of already known regulatory zzso
