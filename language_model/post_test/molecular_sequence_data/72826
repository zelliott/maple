A zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso An zzso deduced from this zzso sequence was used as a probe to isolate the zzso zzso gene zzso from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the entire zzso gene revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso shared a high similarity with a zzso zzso from zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso with an overall identity in zzso acid sequence of zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the similarity to zzso zzso of zzso coli or zzso zzso was only about zzso of identical zzso zzso By construction of zzso expression plasmids the specific activity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli was increased from zzso U zzso zzso to 10 U zzso zzso After fusion of six zzso zzso to the 3' end of zzso gene and expression in zzso coli active zzso zzso could be zzso in a zzso procedure by affinity zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a specific activity of 46 U zzso zzso and was shown to be a zzso zzso with a broad zzso spectrum zzso efficiently zzso zzso and zzso
