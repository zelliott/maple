zzso zzso is an important zzso of plasma zzso level in both humans and zzso This study showed the zzso impact of zzso on insulin zzso in rat pancreatic zzso zzso zzso In order to precise the mechanism of action, binding experiments coupled to mass zzso were performed to identify a potential membrane zzso zzso showed an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the plasma membrane zzso of this zzso after the treatment of zzso cells with the zzso zzso protein and indicated that the cell surface zzso could be involved in zzso zzso since these two proteins were zzso at the plasma membrane or in the zzso zzso This zzso is correlated with an increase in insulin zzso in a dose zzso manner during short incubation zzso Reduction of zzso expression by small interfering zzso duplexes revealed a decrease in the ability of these zzso cells to zzso insulin in presence of zzso Competition experiments for the zzso binding at the cell surface using zzso directed against zzso is able to influence zzso cell function as insulin zzso Our results showed zzso ability to enhance insulin zzso in zzso and provide evidence of an zzso zzso involving the zzso as zzso
