Two zzso zzso natural zzso zzso and zzso obtained from the fusion of normal, zzso zzso mouse zzso cells and zzso myeloma cells were selected on the basis of their zzso with zzso and zzso and chemical zzso zzso sequence analysis of the variable and constant regions of the heavy and light chains showed the zzso zzso The zzso arise from different genetic elements with very low or no zzso from a zzso variable region zzso of family zzso and zzso zzso variable region zzso zzso from a group zzso zzso derives from a zzso of family zzso and V zzso derives from group zzso zzso zzso and zzso are probably of zzso origin, as suggested by high zzso with zzso genes from the zzso zzso Compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a single zzso difference leading to a silent zzso at position 15, whereas zzso seems to be zzso by zzso zzso 101 with one zzso difference causing replacement of zzso by zzso zzso The genetic V zzso and zzso elements for zzso and zzso also give rise to different responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and influenza virus zzso zzso from normal and zzso mice with zzso zzso activity are also zzso to zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso are zzso by zzso genes and that, starting with the zzso zzso and zzso repertoire, zzso forms of zzso recognizing zzso zzso can be obtained and zzso
