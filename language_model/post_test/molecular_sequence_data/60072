A bacterial strain, zzso isolated from a medieval wall painting of the chapel of zzso zzso zzso was characterized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso shared zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso The zzso characteristics including polar zzso pattern, whole cell zzso zzso system, zzso pattern, cell wall composition and fatty acid profile were in good agreement with those of zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was determined to be 74 zzso The value of zzso DNA zzso obtained after zzso zzso between DNA of zzso zzso and strain zzso as well as differences in the zzso acid composition of the zzso and in zzso characteristics demonstrate that the isolate represents a new species of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the new species zzso isolate zzso The type strain is zzso zzso
