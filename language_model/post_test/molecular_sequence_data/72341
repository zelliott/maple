Recent experiments in zzso zzso zzso cells have identified a zzso region of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso located at zzso zzso According to the human zzso structure, this region is part of a zzso zzso in the first repeat of the zzso core zzso In this report, we systematically analyze four positions in this region zzso zzso zzso and zzso that together have been shown previously to be important for zzso zzso function in zzso Our experiments suggest that all of these four positions, and in particular positions zzso zzso and 152, are critical for zzso zzso ability to support cell zzso In addition, we describe an zzso zzso screening experiment to identify zzso that reverse, or partially reverse, the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso acid changes at these four positions to human zzso The zzso zzso reveal changes at positions zzso zzso and 182 that are located outside the zzso region of zzso zzso suggesting an extended surface available to interact with other zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso restore gene zzso in zzso further supporting the idea that one important function of zzso zzso in living cells is to mediate gene zzso
