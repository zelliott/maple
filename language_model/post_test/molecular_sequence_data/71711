zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor which is essential in mice for the development of anterior and intermediate zzso of the zzso zzso We report the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein exhibits strong similarity to zzso zzso within the zzso terminal zzso zzso and the zzso however, it is zzso in regions outside these zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso zzso reporter genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein specifically bound to a target site within the zzso zzso gene upstream zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso induced zzso from zzso zzso reporter genes in cooperation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso with zzso protein in solution and also with the zzso zzso protein zzso Together, these data indicate that many aspects of zzso function in the zzso zzso are zzso and that zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso hormone genes during early and late stages of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso acid sequence between zzso species may suggest distinct activities for this protein in some species and may help identify important functional zzso of this key zzso zzso zzso
