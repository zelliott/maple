We have used a zzso library of zzso zzso to transform zzso zzso and screened for genes that act similarly to dominant negative zzso by interfering with zzso cell cycle zzso Six different plasmids were identified from 2000 zzso four have been zzso One gene zzso encodes a protein with structural motifs characteristic of a zzso zzso A second gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso a third zzso encodes a protein with sequence similarity to zzso proteins of the zzso family, and a fourth zzso encodes a putative zzso of the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso a zzso similar to that of the structurally related zzso zzso gene zzso but cannot complement a zzso zzso it is evident that dominant negative selection can identify proteins that zzso screens would zzso Because dominant negative zzso exert their influence even in zzso strain backgrounds, this approach should be a general method for the analysis of complex cellular processes in organisms not amenable to direct genetic zzso
