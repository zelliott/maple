zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is known to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce differentiation and zzso It usually activates gene expression by binding to a nuclear zzso that interacts with zzso zzso elements zzso and then activates the zzso protein zzso signal zzso zzso a newly identified zzso zzso has recently been proposed as an important zzso for cellular differentiation induced by some zzso including zzso zzso To investigate the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso of cellular proliferation and induction of zzso by zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with sense or zzso zzso to establish cell lines that zzso or were deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to induce cellular differentiation and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso caused increased expression of zzso in zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner, accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso However, zzso zzso induced by zzso was inhibited in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso showed more significant zzso effects and induced more zzso zzso The reporter gene zzso showed that zzso (5 zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso by interacting with its promoter in the region from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso promoter did not contain zzso but did contain two zzso boxes in this zzso spanning zzso to zzso zzso which may be responsive to the zzso nuclear zzso factor zzso binding proteins zzso or interacting zzso zzso zzso cellular proliferation and zzso zzso in zzso cells may be dependent on zzso zzso via its zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso of proliferation and the induction of zzso by zzso are dependent on zzso expression in zzso zzso The findings may represent a novel mechanism by which the effects of zzso in regulating cellular proliferation and zzso are zzso at least in part, by zzso zzso
