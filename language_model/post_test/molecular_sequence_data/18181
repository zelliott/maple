Plant zzso viruses commonly exploit leaky translation termination signals in order to express internal protein coding zzso As a first step to zzso the zzso by which zzso bypass leaky stop zzso in zzso we have devised a system in which zzso is coupled to the transient expression of zzso zzso in tobacco zzso zzso zzso that contain the stop zzso and surrounding zzso from the zzso regions of several different zzso viruses were constructed and the plasmids were tested for the ability to direct transient zzso zzso These studies indicated that zzso bypass the leaky termination sites at efficiencies ranging from essentially 0 to zzso zzso depending upon the viral zzso The results suggest that the efficiency of zzso is determined by the sequence surrounding the stop zzso We describe improved zzso expression zzso and zzso zzso conditions which made it possible to zzso low-level zzso zzso
