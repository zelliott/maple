zzso translation zzso factor zzso directs the correct zzso to zzso zzso In addition, zzso is involved in zzso and zzso and can interact with large number of zzso zzso There are two zzso of zzso which are zzso zzso Despite the strong zzso the zzso differ in some zzso zzso the appearance of zzso in zzso in which the zzso is not normally expressed can be coupled to cancer zzso reasoned that the background for the functional difference of zzso and zzso might lie in changes of dynamics of the zzso 

It has been determined by multiple MD simulation that zzso shows increased zzso flexibility of structural zzso I and II and less average distance between the zzso while increased zzso zzso atom motions within protein zzso characterize zzso The divergence in the dynamic properties of zzso and zzso is caused by interactions of zzso acid zzso that differ between the two zzso with neighboring zzso and water zzso The main correlated motion of both protein zzso is the change in proximity of zzso I and II which can lead to disappearance of the gap between the zzso and transition of the protein into a zzso zzso Such a transition is zzso and the protein can adopt an zzso zzso zzso This finding is in line with our earlier experimental observation that the transition between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso could be essential for binding of zzso and/or other biological zzso The putative zzso region zzso is less flexible in zzso zzso its increased affinity for zzso The ability of zzso rather than zzso to interact with zzso is shown zzso in an zzso zzso 

We have found that zzso transitions between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso provide a molecular background for the earlier observation that the zzso zzso is able to change the shape upon interaction with zzso The ability of zzso rather than zzso to interact with zzso is predicted by MD analysis and showed zzso The differential ability of the zzso zzso to interact with signaling molecules discovered in this study could be associated with zzso properties of zzso
