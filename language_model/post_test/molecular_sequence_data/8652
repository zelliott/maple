zzso of zzso DNA packaging requires the gene 1 and gene 2 products zzso and zzso which are different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso specifically recognizes the zzso packaging initiation region zzso The apparent equilibrium constant for the zzso complex was estimated to be 9 zzso zzso I zzso experiments reveal that the zzso region can be subdivided into three discrete sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso binds zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso zzso bind to the target sequences which map close to the zzso zzso site zzso zzso but do not overlap with zzso zzso interacts in a different fashion with the zzso zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso interaction with the zzso bent zzso DNA occurs only on one face of the DNA double zzso zzso binding to the zzso and in the zzso region results in a DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso shows that the protein is an zzso in zzso zzso binding to the core region of the zzso site could facilitate the formation of a zzso zzso zzso This specialized complex would allow the zzso DNA to form a loop between binding sites brought together by interaction with zzso The results presented here suggest that zzso could provide a tool to discriminate the first zzso end, which contains zzso from the zzso zzso zzso
