The tax gene product of the human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso zzso the nuclear expression and biological function of the zzso zzso family of host zzso factors although the underlying mechanism remains zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be inhibited by a zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso reactions in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reporter gene zzso have revealed that Tax zzso the zzso function of I zzso B alpha in both zzso zzso cells and zzso T zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of I zzso B alpha requires a 16 zzso acid sequence element located at the zzso region zzso acid zzso of I zzso B zzso which is also required for tumor necrosis factor zzso degradation of this zzso zzso We further demonstrate that the zzso inhibitor also blocks the degradation of I zzso B alpha observed in zzso T zzso Interestingly, zzso of I zzso B alpha degradation in these cells led to the zzso of a zzso form of I zzso B zzso Together, these studies suggest that Tax zzso of zzso zzso may involve induction of zzso and subsequent zzso degradation of the inhibitor I zzso B zzso
