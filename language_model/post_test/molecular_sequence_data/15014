zzso is the most commonly used and most effective zzso in the zzso However, its use is limited by the zzso Evidence indicates that the zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso however, their underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso 5 zzso activated in zzso zzso zzso directly zzso zzso at zzso in zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso in the second loop of zzso but not the corresponding zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso is required for normal cell surface expression of zzso and the formation of zzso zzso Our studies indicated that zzso of zzso activity or zzso of a zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso site displayed relatively low cell surface expression and relatively low abilities to form zzso of zzso and zzso zzso delivery of a construct expressing the zzso zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso tolerance in rats, suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso contributed to zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, an engineered zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the second zzso loop of zzso zzso reduced the cell surface expression of zzso disrupted the formation of zzso zzso and significantly attenuated the development of zzso zzso tolerance after zzso zzso The present study indicates that zzso zzso of zzso at zzso plays a crucial role in the development of zzso tolerance and suggests the possibility of targeting zzso zzso at zzso to zzso zzso zzso tolerance during pain zzso
