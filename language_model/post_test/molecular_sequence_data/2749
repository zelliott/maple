zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso selectively replaced by zzso have been prepared by zzso zzso Both zzso zzso are highly active for zzso reactions measured with both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is virtually identical to the wild type with respect to zzso zzso binding zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso spectrum zzso max zzso zzso and 337 zzso and pH dependence zzso alpha zzso zzso pH profile for zzso and rate of zzso acid zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso exhibits a reduced affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso a shift in the zzso zzso spectrum to zzso zzso and an altered zzso alpha zzso zzso an alkaline shift in the pH profile for zzso and resistance to zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is altered to zzso also zzso an zzso to an zzso state upon storage at 4 degrees zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso groups of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso However, these data suggest that zzso is located within or very near the active site of the zzso and is the zzso zzso zzso previously observed by zzso
