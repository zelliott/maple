Recently, concern has been voiced about the potential effect that zzso divergence of circulating strains of zzso zzso might have on the efficacy of zzso zzso In order to model zzso drift of zzso zzso a critical component of many zzso vaccines, and to examine the effects of such drift on zzso zzso we engineered a strain of zzso zzso to produce a zzso zzso toxin zzso that contains many of the zzso acid changes found in the toxin zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso This altered form of the zzso which is efficiently zzso by zzso zzso and which displays significant biological activity, was found to be neutralized by zzso induced by vaccination as readily as toxin produced by zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that significant zzso acid changes in the zzso toxin sequence can occur without drastically altering the ability of zzso to recognize and neutralize the toxin zzso
