We describe a modification of the tandem affinity zzso method for zzso and analysis of zzso complexes, termed here zzso (for differential zzso zzso after tandem affinity zzso Its essential new feature is the use for last zzso step of zzso interaction, which is resistant to a variety of harsh washing conditions, including high zzso strength and the presence of organic zzso This allows us to use various zzso schemes before the zzso zzso which is expected to improve the coverage of the analyzed protein mixture and also to provide an additional insight into the structure of the zzso zzso complex and the nature of zzso interactions zzso We illustrate our new approach by analysis of soluble nuclear complexes containing zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso In particular, we observed different zzso patterns of zzso and zzso proteins as compared with zzso zzso all identified as interaction partners of zzso zzso In addition, we report all components of the licensing zzso complex and the zzso zzso protein among the interaction partners of the soluble zzso Finally, we show that zzso requires zzso tail of zzso for its stable association with this zzso
