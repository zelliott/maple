We have cloned and characterized a zzso from zzso zzso that most likely encodes a novel member of the vast zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso By taking advantage of zzso acid sequence similarities between plant expressed sequence tags zzso and established zzso zzso zzso a probe was obtained which was used for the screening of an zzso zzso zzso The zzso which was found is very infrequently represented in the zzso library, suggesting a low and/or zzso restricted zzso A region of the translated sequence of the zzso shows the highest similarity to zzso receptors from the slime mold zzso zzso The same region is also similar to that in members of the animal zzso family of zzso Another region of the putative zzso however, is similar to sequences of zzso receptors and other receptors of the so-called zzso family of zzso The zzso family has numerous members in higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the regions of similarity yielded results in accordance with other evolutionary zzso Our zzso thus occurred on a distinct major branch in relation to the rest of the zzso zzso In relation to the zzso family, our zzso and zzso receptors occurred together on a distinct major branch but appear to have zzso from each other shortly after their divergence from the rest of the zzso zzso Other features further argue for a tentative identification of it as a zzso It displays seven discrete and strongly predicted zzso zzso when analyzed in zzso zzso The preferred orientation is with the zzso zzso towards the zzso It has one zzso zzso in zzso loop 1 and another in zzso loop zzso zzso zzso in these zzso are known to form zzso bridges in many other zzso Finally, it has several fully zzso zzso acids that belong to the most zzso in previously known zzso that occur in the above regions of zzso
