zzso I, a zzso zzso zzso is important in zzso degradation of proteins and appears to be a central coordinator for zzso of many zzso zzso in zzso zzso Little is known about the molecular zzso of the zzso In the present investigation the gene for zzso I was cloned and zzso The gene spans approximately zzso zzso and consists of two zzso and one zzso The zzso organization is distinct from the complex structures of the other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso in zzso zzso the gene was mapped to zzso region zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso region revealed no classical zzso or zzso box in the zzso region upstream of cap zzso A number of possible regulatory elements that could account for zzso expression were zzso Northern analyses demonstrated that the zzso I message is expressed at high levels in zzso zzso and zzso at moderate to low levels in many zzso and at barely zzso levels in the brain, suggesting zzso zzso Among zzso cells, the message is expressed at high levels in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their precursor zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso resulted in a significant increase in zzso I zzso levels, suggesting that this gene is subjected to zzso zzso The results provide initial insights into the molecular basis for the regulation of human zzso zzso
