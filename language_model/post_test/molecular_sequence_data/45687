The zzso zzso is essential for replication of the zzso C zzso This zzso zzso 2 zzso protein zzso zzso acid duplexes in a zzso zzso zzso Although kinetic features of its mechanism are beginning to emerge, little is known about the physical zzso for zzso zzso along a strand of zzso zzso For example, it is not known whether zzso can traverse zzso or physical zzso on the tracking zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso zzso with a mechanism that is different from its well-studied relative, the zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso along the loading strand (the strand bearing the zzso and it fails to unwind zzso that contain zzso or zzso zzso in the loading zzso However, unlike zzso zzso readily zzso zzso duplexes that contain long stretches of zzso which are zzso that bear no resemblance to zzso zzso Whether located on the tracking zzso the top zzso or both, long zzso regions fail to disrupt the function of zzso This suggests that zzso does not require the continuous formation of specific contacts with the zzso backbone as it zzso along an zzso duplex, which is an observation consistent with the large zzso kinetic step size (18 zzso Rather, once zzso loads onto a zzso the zzso can zzso along the loading strand of an zzso duplex like a zzso train following a zzso zzso in the track do not significantly disturb zzso zzso but a break in the track zzso the zzso
