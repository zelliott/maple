zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso have received considerable attention recently, as they share structural properties with zzso zzso and exhibit zzso zzso zzso Although many zzso have been zzso knowledge about their detailed characteristics and zzso zzso is relatively zzso We previously identified several zzso activities activated by zzso zzso in zzso a zzso was required for programmed cell death zzso but zzso was not zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso Thomas and zzso in Nature zzso zzso Here we report identification of a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso a signature zzso for zzso A detailed characterization of the zzso zzso zzso activity revealed that, like other zzso it has zzso activity and requires an zzso pH for zzso Unlike other zzso it also exhibits zzso and zzso activities and apparently does not require processing for zzso The zzso zzso zzso to a zzso compartment resembling the zzso zzso of zzso activity using zzso imaging of zzso tubes revealed zzso activity in zzso of growing zzso zzso The unexpected features of zzso together with evidence for zzso activity in plant zzso indicate that zzso zzso their zzso and functions in plant cells merit further zzso
