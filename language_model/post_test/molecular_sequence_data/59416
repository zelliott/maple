The zzso family of protein zzso zzso is highly enriched within the zzso Members of this family are alternatively spliced to produce both zzso and zzso zzso This manuscript describes the distinctive zzso distribution and zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso in brain zzso show that zzso is an intrinsic membrane protein of zzso zzso and is associated with the zzso zzso In addition, structural analysis of the novel zzso region of zzso reveals several motifs not present in the zzso zzso zzso These include two putative zzso zzso two sequences rich in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso Like zzso zzso is enriched in the brain, but the zzso protein has less zzso activity than zzso Because zzso is contained in its entirety within zzso and differs only in the extended N zzso of zzso this zzso acid sequence is responsible for the association of zzso with membrane compartments and may also regulate its zzso zzso
