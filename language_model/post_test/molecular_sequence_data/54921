Type I zzso zzso provide powerful and universal innate zzso defense mechanisms against zzso Among the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso proteins of some species appear as key components of defense against influenza A zzso The body of work published to date suggests that to exert zzso activity, an zzso protein should possess a zzso site, structural bases allowing zzso and a specific zzso zzso zzso domain zzso Both the human zzso and bovine zzso proteins meet these minimal requirements, but the bovine protein is more active against influenza zzso Here, we measured the zzso activity exerted by 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that substituting the bovine zzso for the human one in human zzso does not affect the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso however, substituting the human zzso for the bovine one in bovine zzso yields a zzso protein with a much higher zzso activity than the human zzso We zzso in contradiction to the hypothesis currently in vogue in the literature, that the zzso is not the sole zzso controlling the magnitude of the zzso activity exercised by an zzso protein that can bind zzso and zzso Our results suggest that 1 or several motifs that remain to be discovered, located zzso with regard to the zzso may interact with a viral component or a cellular factor so as to alter the viral zzso zzso in the zzso portion of bovine zzso the zzso responsible for its higher zzso activity could contribute to the development of new zzso zzso
