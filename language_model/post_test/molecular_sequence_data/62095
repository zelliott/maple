zzso of the zzso factor zzso determines which zzso cells in the developing zzso will differentiate into the zzso cells of the zzso of zzso To better understand how zzso directs zzso zzso we examined the mechanisms by which zzso regulates the promoters of three zzso factor genes expressed in zzso precursor zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the human gene zzso zzso zzso The function of all three promoters depends on at least one critical E box, a common DNA sequence that forms a binding site for basic zzso proteins like zzso zzso bound to and effectively activated zzso through the zzso and zzso E zzso In contrast, zzso strongly zzso the zzso promoter, although a zzso E box was required for activity in the absence of zzso suggesting that a ubiquitous zzso zzso may bind to this site, and that zzso could act as a competitive inhibitor of this zzso This hypothesis was supported by the lack of evidence for significant intrinsic zzso repression capacity in the zzso zzso and by the ability of isolated zzso basic zzso zzso to repress the zzso zzso zzso produced additional repression, however, when the protein included an intact zzso zzso domain, suggesting that it may also induce the expression of a downstream zzso zzso In zzso while zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation by zzso zzso cell zzso factor zzso it simultaneously zzso its own zzso
