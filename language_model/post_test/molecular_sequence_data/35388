The zzso zzso outer membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso that is essential for zzso zzso Unlike zzso however, the specific zzso of zzso on the cell surface is zzso To determine the distribution of zzso a zzso zzso zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso zzso loop 5 using zzso by zzso Extension zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso of zzso was then zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with and without zzso to zzso zzso zzso O zzso zzso showed that zzso was zzso distributed on the surface of zzso and zzso cells, and that this distribution was masked by zzso zzso in zzso zzso Double zzso IF zzso of zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso to the new pole of zzso cells and to the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in a rough zzso zzso zzso zzso strain (with no zzso was also investigated and a similar distribution of zzso was zzso zzso of the rough zzso strain with zzso resulted in restored zzso zzso chain expression and loss of zzso zzso providing further support for zzso zzso masking of surface zzso Our data presents for the first time the distribution for the zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso and the effect of zzso zzso masking on its zzso
