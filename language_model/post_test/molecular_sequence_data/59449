We have found a common structural motif in human zzso heat shock proteins and viral zzso zzso zzso after sequences present in those molecules were zzso and zzso properties zzso They share a core of 15 zzso acid zzso and a common pattern zzso zzso characterized by requirements at fixed positions with respect to a Pro zzso zzso an zzso zzso or a zzso at position 2; and a zzso zzso or zzso at position zzso Any of these zzso when added to cultures of zzso cells, caused the zzso of zzso zzso by a release of zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso A release of INF gamma and zzso took also place; this release was abolished by zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso could be zzso This suggests a presentation by zzso and the appearance of cells with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells freshly obtained from 12 patients of zzso disease, 8 of zzso disease and 8 of primary zzso zzso exhibited zzso features similar to those found in cells from healthy subjects incubated in the presence of peptides with a zzso motif and representing fragments of zzso Their zzso properties suggest their involvement in the initiation or progression of the zzso response zzso by activated zzso and zzso zzso
