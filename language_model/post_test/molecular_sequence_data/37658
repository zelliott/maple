Human zzso zzso is a T zzso zzso structurally related to zzso and zzso with potent zzso activities on T cell zzso zzso induction and T cell help for B zzso We have now cloned and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a protein with a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso which is zzso % identical to zzso On the cell surface, zzso is expressed as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso of approximately 26 zzso With a panel of zzso zzso we have determined the expression of zzso in zzso and in zzso Following zzso of zzso T cells via zzso zzso became zzso at 12 h and reached a maximum of expression at around 48 zzso thus exhibiting expression zzso similar to zzso In zzso zzso was found to be substantially expressed in the zzso zzso and in the zzso centers and T cell zones of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue was zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to a region of zzso 1 also harboring the zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we determined that zzso a recently cloned zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso
