We have used one single zzso covering the 17 zzso zzso acids of the zzso C virus zzso core protein zzso to zzso the human immune response against zzso zzso within this zzso The sequence zzso was obtained from two zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso by a newly developed zzso The zzso was zzso with 144 human zzso which had all been zzso for zzso to zzso zzso using commercial zzso zzso zzso were found to be positive for zzso using these zzso 40 of these were found to be positive with our zzso zzso zzso zzso The class zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specific reactions were determined using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of mainly zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso gave specific reactions with this zzso Using omission zzso zzso of the region zzso the sequence zzso within zzso zzso was common to 34 out of 37 zzso of which the zzso zzso binding site could be zzso It is unusual for a single zzso zzso to have such high sensitivity since B cell zzso within a protein are often zzso It seems that at least zzso of zzso infected individuals develop zzso of various zzso to the zzso site zzso located in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso Thus, the immune response to this zzso should be further investigated with regard to the zzso zzso zzso developing during zzso zzso
