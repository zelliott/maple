A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso as a main chain, zzso zzso infection of human peripheral blood zzso zzso by binding to the zzso region of zzso zzso We previously showed that T cell zzso zzso zzso are over zzso more sensitive to zzso by zzso than zzso zzso zzso which possesses a relatively less charged zzso acid composition in the zzso zzso To analyze the interaction of zzso with zzso and its association with zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso we examined the effect of zzso on the binding of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso 120 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso clones in which the zzso loop was either deleted or zzso by zzso of another zzso Our results showed that the presence and the zzso acid composition of the zzso loop appears to determine the extent of interaction of zzso with the V2 and zzso regions on native zzso 120 zzso however, the positive charge of zzso has less effect on this interaction on zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our results established that only the zzso masking of zzso on zzso zzso appears to be associated with the zzso activity of zzso in zzso Our findings underline the usefulness of zzso for understanding the structural constraints on zzso 120 that drive the transition from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and enable the virus to use multiple fusion zzso
