We have recently reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40, 651 zzso the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene purportedly encodes the zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso In this present communication, we report the sequences and identities of three putative hem zzso Two of these genes are located immediately upstream from zzso zzso analysis of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the comparison of the zzso zzso sequences with those of zzso zzso and zzso showed that these two open reading zzso zzso and zzso are likely to be the zzso gene coding for zzso zzso and the zzso gene coding for zzso III zzso zzso The third hem zzso zzso is located immediately downstream of zzso and encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso of the region which extends past zzso indicates that no further hem genes are located downstream of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are proposed to constitute a hem cluster zzso zzso required for the synthesis of zzso III from zzso zzso zzso
