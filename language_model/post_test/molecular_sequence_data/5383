Two zzso zzso which have zzso beyond the point where their zzso can be zzso by a simple direct comparison, can be related through a third sequence that is suitably intermediate between the zzso High scores, for a sequence match between the first and third sequences and between the second and the third zzso imply that the first and second sequences are related even though their own match score is zzso We have tested the usefulness of this idea using a database that contains the sequences of zzso protein zzso whose structures are known and whose zzso identities with each other are some zzso or less zzso On the basis of sequence and structural information, zzso pairs of these sequences are known to have an evolutionary zzso zzso in an zzso comparison of the sequences in the database, detected 320 zzso of these relationships as well as three false positive zzso zzso error zzso Using intermediate sequences found by zzso matches of zzso sequences to those in the large zzso zzso database we could detect 550 evolutionary relationships with an error rate of zzso This means the intermediate sequence procedure increases the ability to zzso the evolutionary relationships amongst the zzso sequences by zzso
