The zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso receptors which control zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso zzso The promoter of the gene coding for this zzso was zzso A zzso region (from minus zzso to minus zzso was responsible for the zzso activity observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Within this region two zzso elements that bind zzso factors zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of the two elements indicated that they cooperate for the zzso zzso activity of the zzso The human zzso promoter, that was also zzso shared structural and functional zzso with the bovine zzso Thus, two adjacent binding elements for zzso and zzso were zzso Whereas the zzso site was an important zzso of the promoter activity, the zzso site may have zzso zzso Given that these promoters showed no structural or functional zzso with the previously characterized rat zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Gardner, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso except for the involvement of an zzso binding element, we propose that zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene in these three close species may be controlled by the general zzso factor zzso Nevertheless, other components could determine zzso zzso zzso zzso
