zzso is an essential gene in zzso that is required for the formation of sister zzso zzso While recent studies have provided insights into how sister zzso cohesion is established, less is known about how specifically zzso zzso the formation of cohesion, and essentially nothing is known about how sister zzso cohesion is established in zzso In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso zzso in that it lacks an zzso extension, exhibits zzso activity, and can complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts are found throughout the plant, with the highest levels present in zzso zzso containing zzso insertions in zzso exhibit zzso defects in the zzso Interestingly, the zzso developed normally in zzso seeds, suggesting that zzso is not essential for zzso in zzso zzso Minor defects were observed in female zzso of zzso plants, and plants that zzso zzso exhibited female zzso zzso zzso development appeared normal in both zzso knockout and zzso zzso zzso proper levels of zzso are critical for female zzso and zzso development but not for the establishment of zzso cohesion during zzso or during zzso zzso
