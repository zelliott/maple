The high plasma levels of zzso zzso are associated with zzso The zzso gene is responsible for the zzso of zzso concentration and its expression is zzso By zzso analysis, we, in a zzso gene reporter zzso have identified a zzso zzso region of upstream zzso gene zzso to zzso that binds to multiple zzso zzso The 64 zzso zzso contained three zzso symmetry elements zzso that are crucial for synergistic binding to the zzso We have demonstrated that both zzso and zzso together are responsible for factor binding in zzso and for gene zzso in liver zzso Further, we have zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso complexes to zzso by zzso magnetic zzso zzso The identification of a further upstream negative regulatory region zzso to zzso led us to predict that as yet unidentified zzso zzso might also repress zzso gene zzso
