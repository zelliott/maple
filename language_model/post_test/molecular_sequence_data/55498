The indigenous microbial community utilizing zzso aromatic, and polar components from the oily sludge as sole source of carbon and energy was selected from the soil samples of zzso India for zzso zzso zzso of zzso production was done using screening zzso such as surface tension reduction, zzso activity, zzso activity, zzso zzso and cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was achieved after 5 days of growth from zzso zzso zzso which was identified by zzso zzso technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed it to be zzso in nature with zzso protein content and zzso zzso zzso zzso group analysis was also done by using zzso transform infrared zzso which showed it to be a zzso zzso thereby zzso them special zzso Analysis by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance revealed that the major constituents of zzso are zzso and zzso Gas zzso analysis data indicated that oily sludge components of chain length zzso and aromatic zzso were zzso effectively by zzso zzso zzso after 5 days of zzso These results collectively points toward the importance of zzso zzso zzso as a potential candidate for zzso zzso
