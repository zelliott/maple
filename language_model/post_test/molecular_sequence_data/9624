We have isolated and characterized zzso a novel protein component of the zzso small zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was first identified in human cells by its zzso with an zzso that recognizes specific sites of zzso zzso To study the functional role of zzso in zzso processing, we identified the zzso protein by performing a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to the human protein over its zzso zzso to the zzso zzso protein recognize a zzso zzso in zzso extracts and zzso the zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a specific protein component of the zzso zzso in zzso As a first step in the genetic analysis of zzso function, zzso zzso zzso cells were transformed with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicate that zzso is an essential zzso A strain was constructed where zzso is expressed from a zzso zzso zzso zzso After depletion of zzso by growth in zzso cell growth is arrested and levels of zzso and its zzso precursor are reduced or absent while the zzso and zzso precursors zzso This pattern of zzso of zzso precursors suggests that zzso is required for zzso at sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of newly zzso zzso in zzso zzso confirms that little mature zzso zzso zzso These results reveal a novel protein essential for zzso zzso and further zzso the composition of the zzso zzso
