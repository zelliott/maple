zzso virus is a highly zzso virus, but the steps that lead to virus penetration into cells, the first event in virus zzso have not been zzso We have shown that a zzso envelope protein of zzso virus might play a major role in zzso acting at the level of cell fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Esteban, zzso zzso zzso zzso 61, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Esteban, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To carry out structural and functional studies on the zzso zzso zzso it would be desirable to have a high level expression system, since the amount of protein that can be obtained from zzso virus or from infected cells is very zzso In this investigation we demonstrate that the zzso envelope protein of zzso virus is expressed in zzso coli in soluble form and at high zzso We zzso by several criteria, that the zzso zzso virus protein expressed in zzso coli is similar to the protein found in the virus particle based on apparent molecular mass, occurrence of zzso zzso zzso against specific zzso zzso and identity in zzso sequence with the predicted DNA sequence of the zzso We define several structural and functional properties concerning the zzso envelope protein of zzso zzso 1) 14 zzso is a zzso of identical zzso 2) A zzso binds to itself more strongly than to a zzso or a zzso 3) zzso does not require cellular zzso 4) zzso induce high zzso zzso zzso in animals which correlate with overall zzso 5) zzso binds with specificity to the cell surface of cultured zzso
