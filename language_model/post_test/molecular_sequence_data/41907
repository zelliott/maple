In zzso translation of zzso prepared from barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed at 40 degrees C directed the synthesis of major heat shock proteins zzso with molecular masses of zzso 70, 42 and zzso zzso A zzso library prepared from the 40 degrees C zzso and screened by differential zzso led to the isolation of heat shock specific zzso One of these zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso translation as zzso for an zzso zzso The barley zzso sequence has an open reading frame zzso a 160 zzso acid zzso zzso protein that is zzso identical to wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identical to soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso Lower similarities were found with class II plant small zzso such as soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with animal small zzso and zzso The zzso zzso sequence was used to pick up zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso for another class I zzso zzso By computer analysis of the zzso sequence the zzso box, two heat shock promoter zzso a zzso response element, and the zzso signals were zzso zzso zzso has an additional zzso region when compared with zzso mapping at the zzso terminal zzso
