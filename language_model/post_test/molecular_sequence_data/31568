In zzso Mediterranean zzso zzso plant species are practically zzso and only some species of palm trees can support zzso growing in their lower crown area, such as Phoenix zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we focused on zzso zzso zzso plants growing as zzso zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso forms growing in adjacent zzso Our aim was to determine the possible presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in these peculiar zzso and to relate zzso communities with zzso zzso We investigated the zzso community composition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso plants along a temperature and zzso zzso across 12 zzso zzso roots were zzso by zzso as determined by microscopic zzso all of the zzso and zzso samples analyzed showed zzso sequences from zzso belonging to the zzso zzso which were grouped in 30 zzso operational zzso zzso The zzso community composition was clearly different between zzso and zzso root samples, and this could be attributable to zzso constraints and/or the contrasting environmental and zzso conditions prevailing in each zzso Across sites, the richness and diversity of zzso zzso communities was positively correlated with zzso amount during the most recent growing zzso In contrast, there was no significant correlation between climate variables and zzso richness and diversity for zzso zzso communities, which suggests that the composition of zzso communities in zzso zzso appears to be largely determined by the availability and zzso of zzso zzso from adjacent zzso zzso
