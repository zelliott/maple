zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the regulation of zzso migration, cell zzso zzso zzso and nerve zzso zzso has been also reported to concentrate at zzso zzso zzso and zzso although detailed zzso studies remain zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso were employed to evaluate zzso zzso in various zzso cell zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed no zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells, whereas abundant zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso in all cells revealed strong zzso zzso zzso with all of the above zzso except zzso Given the positive zzso results in cells lacking zzso zzso zzso analyses were zzso Western blots revealed a prominent protein band at 52 zzso in all cells tested with all zzso except zzso However, the correct size of zzso zzso zzso was only detected in cells containing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso revealed zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1) at zzso zzso by zzso identified the zzso 52 zzso protein band as zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso interfering zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in diminished zzso zzso along with a reduction in the intensity of the 52 zzso protein zzso Using an zzso specific for zzso zzso at zzso the 52 zzso protein was identified as this zzso form of zzso 

The results from the present study demonstrate that a majority of available zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and suggest that cellular zzso studies using these zzso should be interpreted with zzso Of the zzso zzso tested, only zzso zzso is zzso for human zzso zzso using zzso reveal that zzso expression is variable in different zzso cell lines with zzso at zzso
