The concentration of proteins in cells is an important zzso that determines how a protein will interact with other proteins or pharmacological zzso Recent developments in Western zzso techniques have now made this a method of choice to measure protein concentration in complex solutions such as total cell zzso We show that detection of zzso secondary zzso by zzso analysis produces signals that approach zzso with respect to protein concentration over a zzso zzso We used this technique to estimate cellular levels of zzso which is an important protein component of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso By producing specific protein standards based on sequences that are available from public databases, it is now possible to estimate the concentration of almost any protein by this zzso
