zzso a rare sugar produced by the zzso reaction of zzso zzso zzso has been used extensively for the zzso of various rare zzso Recently characterized zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was found to belong to the zzso family and to catalyze the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso the zzso position, with marked efficiency for zzso The crystal structures of zzso and its complex with the true zzso zzso were zzso zzso is a zzso and each zzso belongs to a zzso zzso The active site in each zzso is distinct from that of other zzso zzso which use zzso zzso as the zzso It contains a metal zzso with zzso coordination to two water molecules and four zzso that are absolutely zzso across the zzso zzso Upon binding of zzso the zzso zzso water molecules in the active site, with a zzso mimicking the intermediate zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso loop undergo significant structural changes, zzso off the active zzso zzso evidence and zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso suggest that the metal zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso by zzso the bound zzso and zzso and zzso carry out an zzso reaction at the zzso zzso
