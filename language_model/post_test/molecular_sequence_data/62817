zzso proteins zzso are zzso that remove a specific zzso from the zzso loop of the large zzso thus arresting protein synthesis at the zzso zzso In the present study, a protein termed tobacco zzso zzso was isolated from tobacco zzso zzso leaves and zzso using zzso exchange and gel zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a molecular mass of 26 zzso as evidenced by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and showed strong zzso activity as zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso with zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso released fewer amounts of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, zzso and zzso compared with other zzso zzso inhibited translation in wheat zzso zzso germ more efficiently than in rabbit zzso showing an zzso at 30 zzso in the former zzso zzso zzso using highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conducted against various zzso and bacterial pathogens showed the strongest zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso acid internal zzso sequence of zzso was identical with the internal sequences of the zzso zzso zzso from wild tobacco zzso zzso zzso and potato zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity, and zzso coli zzso was observed to have zzso activity zzso Thus, zzso may be considered a dual activity zzso showing zzso activity and zzso zzso
