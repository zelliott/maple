zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain genes were investigated by zzso chain reaction for 109 bacteria isolated from four South China Sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, the zzso zzso of bacteria with zzso genes were carried out to confirm the screening of zzso zzso Fifteen bacteria were found to contain zzso genes and grouped into two zzso zzso (13 of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso according to zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso analysis of the zzso A domain zzso acid zzso most of the zzso fragments (11 of zzso showed below zzso similarity to their closest relatives suggesting the novelty of these zzso zzso All of the 15 bacteria with zzso genes have zzso activities, with most of them exhibiting activity against multiple indicators including zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The different zzso zzso indicate the chemical diversity of biologically active zzso of zzso bacteria and the possible role of bacterial zzso in the zzso zzso chemical zzso zzso analysis based on the representative zzso genes shows high diversity of marine zzso zzso The combined molecular technique and zzso strategy will be useful to obtain zzso bacteria with the potential to zzso zzso zzso
