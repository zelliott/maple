zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso motif within the zzso loop of the classical zzso is replaced by zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and activate the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The classical zzso zzso and zzso interact with downstream zzso zzso and zzso zzso through zzso clusters of zzso zzso zzso which constitute the common zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the classical zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso is strictly dependent on zzso of the zzso motif of these zzso Here we report that the zzso CD domain is zzso for the interaction of zzso and zzso with zzso Using zzso overlay zzso we have defined a novel zzso interaction motif zzso within both zzso and zzso that is essential for binding to the zzso region of zzso This motif is located within the zzso extension lying zzso to the CD domain in zzso and zzso and a single zzso to zzso substitution in zzso totally abrogates zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by both zzso and zzso These findings are the first to demonstrate binding of a zzso zzso via this region of the zzso loop in a zzso Furthermore, the link between zzso loop zzso and accessibility of the zzso interaction motif suggests a switch mechanism for these zzso zzso in which the zzso status of the zzso loop regulates the ability of both zzso and zzso to bind to a downstream zzso
