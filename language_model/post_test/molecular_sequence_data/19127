In most organisms, the zzso genes are transcribed by zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso like zzso and zzso In flowering plants, zzso of the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the evolution of additional zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso or in both zzso and zzso zzso Two putative zzso zzso were previously described to be zzso by the nuclear genes zzso and zzso in the moss zzso zzso Here, we report on a third zzso zzso zzso We determined the sequence of the zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence with sequences of plant zzso zzso zzso suggests that this gene encodes a functional zzso zzso zzso The 78 zzso zzso acids of the putative zzso zzso were fused to zzso and found to target the fusion protein exclusively to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only known zzso to possess three zzso zzso zzso
