zzso is a unique scorpion zzso Acting from the zzso side, zzso blocks the zzso zzso pore in not only the zzso and zzso zzso channels, but also the zzso zzso zzso This finding argues that the three-dimensional structures of the pores in these zzso channels are zzso However, the zzso acid sequences that form the external part of the pore are minimally zzso among the various classes of zzso zzso Because zzso can bind to all the three classes of zzso channels, we can use zzso as a structural probe to examine how the zzso zzso sequences are arranged in space to form similar pore zzso In the present study, we determined the three-dimensional structure of zzso using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso connected by an zzso loop zzso zzso to zzso The zzso has two zzso zzso strands zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso which are connected by a type zzso zzso centered between zzso zzso and zzso The zzso segment zzso zzso to zzso appears to form a zzso strand of the zzso
