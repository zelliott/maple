We have used transient zzso zzso to analyze zzso shuttling of zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated that receptors that accumulate within zzso upon zzso binding are not zzso confined to that zzso but rather have the capacity to zzso zzso the nuclear zzso The ability of various zzso zzso to shuttle between zzso of zzso excluded zzso zzso and DNA binding as zzso for zzso shuttling of zzso However, a zzso nuclear zzso zzso that has fused at its zzso zzso the zzso virus 40 large tumor zzso nuclear zzso signal sequence was unable to efficiently export from zzso unless zzso These results uncover an unexpected effect of zzso binding to zzso the overriding of a dominant negative effect on nuclear export of a zzso nuclear import signal zzso Furthermore, they demonstrate that a nuclear import signal sequence can influence nuclear processing pathways that culminate in efficient nuclear zzso
