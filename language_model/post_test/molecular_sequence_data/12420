zzso containing the zzso gene which encodes zzso protein zzso 3 of zzso zzso were detected by zzso by zzso amplification with zzso based on the zzso sequences of zzso zzso The translated zzso acid sequence demonstrated zzso identity and had a total of zzso zzso zzso acids relative to the zzso coli zzso The zzso gene was located upstream of a gene zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene product reacted with zzso G and had an apparent molecular weight of zzso
