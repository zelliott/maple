zzso factors zzso that play an essential role in zzso trafficking and zzso structure are small zzso zzso which have been identified recently to be involved in virus zzso However, little is known about the zzso and their relationships with viral infection in the economically important crustaceans to zzso In the present study, two novel members of the zzso family, designated as zzso and zzso respectively, were cloned from the shrimp zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso belongs to Class I zzso which has very high zzso in sequence to the known zzso zzso of insects and zzso of other animals zzso whereas zzso is an unidentified zzso which has only zzso identity to other known zzso In High Five cells, the distribution of zzso was dependent on its zzso binding state but the distribution of zzso was not affected by zzso Both zzso were zzso expressed in examined zzso Further investigation with real-time quantitative zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were significantly zzso after zzso zzso In zzso zzso however, no distinct fluctuation of zzso expression was found and zzso was even found to be notably zzso These results suggested that zzso and zzso might be involved in the shrimp innate immune response in zzso infection and zzso might play a role in zzso zzso These studies may contribute to a better understanding of host defense and/or virus invasion interaction and for the control of marine zzso zzso
