Surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso is essential for the T cell zzso zzso zzso to couple zzso with its second zzso zzso zzso may be required to zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso which then zzso an zzso signal from the zzso A zzso zzso that contained zzso and zzso sequences from an zzso of a major zzso class I zzso and zzso sequences of zzso restored zzso signaling in a zzso zzso T cell zzso Thus, expression of the complex zzso domain of zzso is not required for the zzso to couple to its signaling zzso
