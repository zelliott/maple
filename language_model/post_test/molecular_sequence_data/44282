zzso zzso proteins zzso as well as interact with the inner nuclear membrane protein zzso zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of these proteins that mediate their various interactions have not been entirely zzso zzso proteins are predicted by zzso cluster analysis to consist of two zzso but distinct zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso and zzso shadow domain, separated by a hinge zzso We show here that the zzso shadow domain mediates the zzso of zzso proteins and is also necessary for binding to zzso both in zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster analysis also predicts that the zzso zzso portion of zzso contains two zzso zzso separated by a hinge zzso The interactions of the zzso zzso with an zzso protein were also analyzed by the zzso zzso and in zzso binding zzso which showed that a portion of the second zzso domain is necessary for zzso The modular domain organization of zzso proteins and zzso can explain some of the diverse zzso interactions at the zzso interface of the nuclear zzso
