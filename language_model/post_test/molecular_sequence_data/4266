zzso of zzso the human form of zzso (the zzso zzso channel zzso are responsible for some forms of the zzso syndrome, an zzso of cardiac zzso zzso was cloned from brain and has properties similar but not identical to the rapidly zzso component of the native cardiac zzso channel current zzso We identified in the mouse an alternatively processed form of zzso zzso zzso that is expressed abundantly in heart but only in trace amounts in zzso zzso B has a unique zzso acid zzso domain that is strongly basic and considerably shorter than the zzso acid zzso domain of zzso When expressed in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso B current were best fit by a zzso function, with the fast components dominant over the slow zzso The fast component of zzso had a mean zzso value of zzso zzso 16 zzso at zzso zzso and 8 zzso 4 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The fast component of zzso had a mean zzso value of 145 zzso 29 zzso at zzso zzso and 12 zzso 4 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso B current was blocked by the selective zzso blocker, zzso with an zzso of 54 zzso In addition, we isolated zzso B, the human zzso of zzso B, which has zzso characteristics zzso similar to those of zzso zzso We have identified zzso B, an alternatively processed zzso of the zzso zzso expressed selectively in heart and with zzso characteristics similar to those of native cardiac zzso
