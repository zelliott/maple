zzso zzso display contrasting zzso patterns depending on the ambient zzso zzso grown in the light develop zzso characterized by short zzso and expanded green zzso In contrast, zzso grown in darkness become zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso on an zzso zzso Light signals, perceived by multiple zzso and zzso to downstream regulators, dictate the extent of zzso development in a quantitative zzso Two key downstream zzso zzso and zzso act zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that binds directly to the promoters of zzso zzso promoting their expression and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with zzso repeats whose nuclear abundance is zzso regulated by zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso in the nucleus to regulate its activity zzso Here we show that the abundance of zzso is directly correlated with the extent of zzso development, and that the zzso interaction may specifically target zzso for zzso degradation in the zzso
