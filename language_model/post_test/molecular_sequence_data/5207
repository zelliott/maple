Human zzso zzso zzso is a type II zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso The protein is not expressed on resting zzso but is rapidly induced on these cells after cellular zzso zzso interaction of zzso with its zzso zzso gives a zzso signal for zzso zzso Whereas zzso has been zzso characterized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was undefined until zzso Here, we describe the zzso cloning and initial characterization of zzso and the determination of its gene zzso zzso is a zzso of 195 zzso acids that has zzso zzso with its human zzso In zzso to human zzso zzso transcript levels are strongly but zzso zzso during zzso zzso which is in line with a role for the zzso zzso pair early in the immune zzso In accordance with the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso Finally, the zzso gene consists of three zzso spanning approximately 4 zzso of DNA and is localized on zzso zzso
