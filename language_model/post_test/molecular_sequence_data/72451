We present a series of zzso cloning zzso that are derived from a zzso of zzso possessing an elevated number of copies per zzso zzso These zzso are compatible with any zzso replicating from a zzso origin and use zzso and/or zzso as a selective zzso They can be used whenever the simultaneous presence of several plasmids in the cell is zzso We use this zzso system for the zzso expression of the genes that are responsible for the production of the zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso from promoters carried on a second zzso can thus be measured within the living cell over a range of 3 orders of magnitude using bacterial zzso as a reporter zzso
