Three elements in the promoter of rice zzso genes are important for their zzso specific zzso One of these, an zzso zzso has been shown to be a negative regulator in zzso zzso and has a similarity to the barley zzso responsive element recognized by zzso DNA binding zzso A zzso library constructed from immature rice seed was screened using two types of zzso gene zzso to isolate zzso clones representing genes zzso zzso DNA binding proteins that may recognize the zzso motif in rice zzso gene zzso We obtained four zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso C1 zzso Another zzso zzso zzso was obtained by screening a rice seed zzso library with zzso designed to recognize the zzso binding domain in zzso and zzso zzso was used to analyze zzso expression during rice seed development and their presence in other rice zzso as it was not possible to detect these zzso by conventional Northern zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso genes were expressed in all zzso zzso In seed, the zzso levels of zzso and zzso genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering zzso suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed zzso As zzso exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both zzso and zzso which can bind to the zzso zzso there is a possibility that the zzso protein may bind to the zzso motif of zzso zzso
