A zzso method for the zzso of proteins termed zzso analysis (or zzso has been introduced zzso Although this method has been applied to the analysis of various types of biological samples, a thorough evaluation to assess the performance of this approach has yet to be zzso Presented here is the first systematic and comprehensive study investigating the zzso approach for quantitative analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that this method has a linear dynamic range spanning three orders of magnitude with a limit of zzso of zzso in zzso samples and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, comprehensive sequence coverage was obtained and accurate zzso achieved for expression ratios ranging from zzso to zzso However, zzso of ratios was detected independent of sample type, consistent with other quantitative zzso zzso The present study provides validation of the zzso approach for accurate quantitative zzso analysis of biological samples while, at the same time, proving high sequence coverage of target zzso
