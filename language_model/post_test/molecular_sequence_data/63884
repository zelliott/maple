In the immune response against a typical T zzso protein zzso the affinity maturation process is fast and is associated with the early class switch from zzso to zzso As such, a comprehension of the molecular basis of affinity maturation could be of great importance in biomedical and zzso zzso zzso maturation of zzso zzso has been reported to be the result of small structural changes, mostly confined to the periphery of the zzso zzso However, little is understood about how these small structural changes account for the increase in the affinity toward the zzso zzso we present the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso from zzso mouse zzso zzso in complex with the zzso zzso This zzso was obtained from a long-term exposure to the zzso zzso zzso and the previously described zzso zzso are the result of identical or nearly identical zzso zzso zzso However, different zzso in the framework and variable regions result in an approximately zzso higher affinity for the zzso zzso The comparison of the three-dimensional structures of these zzso complexes reveals that the affinity maturation produces a fine tuning of the zzso of the zzso site toward the zzso explaining at the molecular level how the immune system is able to increase the affinity of an zzso zzso to zzso zzso
