zzso zzso causes zzso leaf blight and stalk rot of zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify a gene in this fungus that is required for zzso to both stalks and zzso The predicted zzso zzso by this zzso which we have named zzso is similar to a family of proteins that comprise one zzso of the zzso zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso integration in the 3' untranslated region of the zzso 19 zzso downstream from the stop zzso The result is a significant reduction in transcript levels in comparison to the wild type, perhaps as a result of increased transcript zzso We were unable to knock out the zzso zzso and it may be essential for zzso zzso examination of the zzso zzso on zzso leaves revealed that it is fully capable of penetrating and colonizing host cells during the initial, zzso zzso of the disease interaction but, unlike the wild type, it appears to be unable to switch to a zzso mode of zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may be unable to zzso sufficient quantities of zzso zzso to support that zzso The zzso zzso zzso provides us with a useful tool for future studies of the role of zzso protein transport in this important stalk rot disease of zzso
