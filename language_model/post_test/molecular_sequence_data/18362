The expression of many genes is regulated at the level of zzso zzso zzso advances over the last few years have led to new insights into the mechanism of initiation and the different ways that it can be zzso Many of the proteins involved have now been identified and in some cases extensively zzso Some of these proteins or zzso factors bind to specific DNA elements either alone or in collaboration with other zzso often resulting in stimulation of zzso zzso An understanding of how these factors function, therefore, is essential to understanding the zzso zzso and how it is zzso zzso within some of these factors that are responsible for DNA interaction and zzso zzso have been identified by a combination of zzso zzso and physical approaches and these studies are beginning to provide valuable information concerning the possible mechanisms that can regulate their zzso The zzso process itself is highly zzso many of the components being interchangeable between zzso and zzso
