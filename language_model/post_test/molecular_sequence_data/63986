DNA with two sites of damage in close proximity might not be repaired as efficiently as DNA with a single damage zzso 

To study this hypothesis, we zzso short zzso with a stable zzso 7 or 16 zzso zzso downstream from an zzso (AP) zzso zzso by extracts of human breast zzso zzso cells was zzso by zzso the incorporation of zzso 

The level of repair of an zzso with an zzso site 7 zzso from a stable zzso was comparable to that of the zzso with only an zzso zzso A decrease in overall repair of zzso containing an zzso site and a stable zzso was observed if these zzso were 16 zzso apart compared to the presence of only an zzso zzso 

The ability of human breast zzso cells to repair DNA zzso and zzso sites is affected by other zzso zzso
