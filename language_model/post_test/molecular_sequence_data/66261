The zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of zzso active against other zzso zzso zzso In this study, we further investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso by testing the zzso of 31 bacterial species zzso zzso We showed that zzso displays an zzso spectrum targeted toward related zzso bacteria, including pathogens such as zzso zzso Using deletion zzso we investigated the contribution of the three putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso which encodes a putative modification zzso to the zzso spectrum and immunity of strain zzso Our results present evidence that the zzso locus encodes a zzso zzso system called zzso zzso Among the four class II zzso peptides zzso within the zzso zzso zzso alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene forms an zzso with its associated immunity zzso and this functional zzso module could easily be transferred to zzso zzso The remaining three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso poor zzso activity but act as enhancers of the zzso activity of zzso 9 by an unknown zzso The zzso gene was also shown to be specifically required for the zzso activity of zzso 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most zzso zzso By zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso we showed that zzso encodes a functional zzso zzso suggesting an important role for zzso bridges within zzso zzso
