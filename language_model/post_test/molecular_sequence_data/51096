zzso of reducing zzso in ammonium zzso was found to be a simple procedure for the formation of zzso of zzso complex zzso in zzso zzso These provide valuable zzso for the synthesis of a wide range of zzso zzso and derivatives by zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso function showed different rates of zzso with different zzso In general, interactions with large ring systems such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave zzso yields of products, which consisted of zzso of both zzso forms, whereas smaller zzso zzso gave zzso yields of the desired zzso zzso effects may explain differences in zzso zzso derivatives could be obtained in high yield with retention of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso function afforded the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso thereby introduced retains the zzso function, possesses the useful properties of fixed zzso zzso improved stability, and uniform zzso with a variety of zzso and is structurally analogous to an zzso side zzso The potential therefore exists for the generation of zzso derivatives tailored for different zzso
