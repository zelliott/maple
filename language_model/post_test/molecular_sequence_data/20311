zzso is a 99 zzso acid membrane protein zzso by zzso such as polio and zzso viruses with two zzso zzso The protein is found to make zzso of infected cells zzso Using a zzso approach which positions the models and zzso stability by molecular dynamics zzso simulations a putative zzso bundle model of zzso is zzso The zzso show a pore lining motif of three zzso followed by a zzso The bundle is discussed in terms of different possible zzso of the zzso in the membrane and the consequences this has on the in zzso activity of zzso
