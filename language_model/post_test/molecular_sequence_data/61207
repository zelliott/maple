A novel zzso zzso protein framework containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 434 zzso was used to construct zzso zzso libraries in order to isolate zzso zzso with altered zzso The library members contain one zzso zzso and one zzso domain with zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso Based on previous studies, the zzso zzso derivatives are expected to recognize a general zzso zzso zzso where zzso is contacted by the zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso In principle, any sequence can stand for zzso and serve as a selection zzso Here an in zzso library screening method was used to isolate zzso zzso zzso that interact with an zzso operator containing the zzso zzso Several zzso showed high affinity in zzso binding to operators containing the target and strong (up to zzso preference for the zzso target over the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that certain zzso bound with substantially higher affinities zzso approximately zzso to operators containing the zzso zzso a close zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, we have zzso isolated zzso zzso zzso that show up to a several zzso preference for zzso over zzso
