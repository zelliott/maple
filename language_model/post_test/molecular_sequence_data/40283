The zzso rule zzso is a regulated zzso system that targets proteins containing zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso degradation in zzso The zzso of type 1 zzso contain an zzso basic zzso that is recognized by the zzso box domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We describe structures of the zzso box of zzso zzso zzso alone and in complex with zzso zzso including that of the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso and targeted for degradation at the zzso zzso The structures reveal a previously unknown protein fold that is stabilized by a novel zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso side chains of the zzso are coordinated in a zzso binding zzso zzso the structures together with our in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analyses reveal a previously unknown zzso of binding specificity by the zzso at position 2 of the zzso
