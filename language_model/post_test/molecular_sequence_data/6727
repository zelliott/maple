The zzso step in the zzso of zzso is the formation of zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso via a zzso reaction from zzso zzso by the action of zzso zzso and zzso zzso To initiate an investigation of the regulation of the second step in zzso formation, the zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso Da was zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the zzso zzso Z and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding approximately to zzso zzso One zzso start site was located 280 zzso upstream of the zzso start site of the zzso zzso No classical zzso zzso promoter was zzso zzso stress induced by the addition of zzso to the growth medium led to an approximately zzso increase in zzso expression as determined by zzso dot zzso zzso zzso zzso growth led to a zzso stimulation of zzso zzso Two additional open reading frames were detected downstream of the zzso zzso One open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso encodes a protein of 182 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
