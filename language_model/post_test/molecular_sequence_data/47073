zzso zzso is member of a novel family of zzso proteins and functions in head induction during zzso zzso acting as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso Here we report: zzso the isolation of two additional zzso members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso and zzso analysis of adult and embryonic gene expression of mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as chicken zzso Comparative zzso analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso in mice indicate that these genes are both temporally and zzso zzso They define overlapping deep zzso in zzso lineages suggesting a zzso mode of zzso All zzso show distinct and elevated expression patterns in zzso that mediate zzso zzso transformations suggesting that they may participate in heart, zzso hair and zzso zzso limb and bone zzso In the limb buds expression of these genes are found in regions of programmed cell zzso In a given organ, zzso tends to be the earliest member zzso zzso with zzso zzso and chicken zzso shows zzso zzso expression zzso Our observations indicate that zzso genes constitute a new family of zzso proteins that may mediate zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso
