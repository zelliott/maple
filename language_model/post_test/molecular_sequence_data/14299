zzso protein 4 zzso zzso activity is critical for the replication and assembly of zzso A zzso zzso however, the dramatic primary sequence divergence of zzso across zzso raises the possibility that zzso activity is not a common feature among zzso We tested for zzso zzso activity from divergent zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs were identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the arrangement of basic zzso and the zzso zzso was substantially different between zzso Using zzso coli and zzso cell zzso we showed that each zzso tested had zzso activity, but zzso zzso zzso were zzso Only zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso zzso coli cell zzso a classical zzso activity zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was universally zzso to zzso coli and disrupted zzso activities, as measured by a new zzso dye zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso were initially localized in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso structures that were mutually exclusive with zzso zzso The zzso structures partially localized to the zzso intermediate compartment zzso but primarily zzso with zzso zzso a marker for zzso Similar to zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso significantly elevated zzso calcium levels, demonstrating that despite strong primary sequence zzso RV zzso has maintained zzso activity across zzso A to zzso These data suggest that elevated zzso calcium is a common critical process for all zzso zzso
