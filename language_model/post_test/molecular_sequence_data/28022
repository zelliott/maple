zzso zzso a zzso contains a peculiar zzso zzso DNA called zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be required for the production of zzso zzso of proteins that bind to one of the two zzso in zzso zzso zzso was examined by gel zzso zzso Total zzso extract yielded two distinct retarded zzso Both bands were sensitive to treatment with zzso K, indicating that there is a zzso that is able to bind to zzso Further, the formation of the bands was inhibited by the addition of zzso zzso but not by a large excess of zzso in the presence of a zzso excess of zzso In zzso zzso using zzso zzso revealed that the zzso stretch from 60 to 161 is zzso When a zzso zzso cell zzso was zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso in two zzso a major peak corresponding in size to 14 zzso and a minor one at 5 zzso These results indicate that zzso exists as a complex with specific proteins in the zzso
