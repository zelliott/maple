zzso evidence suggests that long term memory zzso formation is dependent on the zzso of zzso second zzso systems and requires protein zzso The zzso response element binding protein zzso is a zzso expressed regulatory zzso factor that couples changes in second zzso levels to changes in cellular zzso Several recent studies suggest that zzso and related zzso factors regulate gene expression necessary for zzso plasticity and zzso However, the role of zzso within defined zzso brain structures, in zzso the cellular events underlying zzso formation has not been zzso We examined whether zzso zzso within the zzso zzso is critical to zzso consolidation of water maze spatial training, which is known to depend on zzso zzso zzso zzso infusions of zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso were used to disrupt zzso zzso protein levels in adult zzso Control groups received zzso infusions of zzso of the same base composition but in a zzso order zzso zzso or zzso Task acquisition and memory up to 4 h zzso short term zzso were similar in zzso zzso zzso and control zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso rats exhibited significantly impaired memory 48 h later zzso zzso Moreover, administration of zzso zzso 1 day after training did not affect subsequent retention zzso These findings provide the first evidence that zzso zzso is integral to zzso memory consolidation zzso
