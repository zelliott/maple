Recently, we identified a zzso zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso hinge zzso and which exerts a panel of pharmacological effects in breast cancer zzso zzso these effects can result from the interaction of zzso with the plasma zzso zzso we show that zzso adopts a zzso secondary structure when in contact with zzso zzso and that it is engulfed within the zzso zzso While zzso increases the fluidity of membrane zzso it zzso zzso in living zzso In light of the above, one may evoke one important role of the zzso region of the zzso the corresponding zzso could be zzso to the zzso medium to interact with neighboring cells, both zzso and at the membrane zzso Finally, the zzso region of zzso being in proximity to the zzso the zzso site of the zzso raises the question of its involvement in the zzso of the protein with the zzso
