zzso representing 3 species of zzso were collected from the water python zzso zzso and 3 additional zzso species in the Northern zzso Australia, and tested for the presence of zzso zzso the most common blood zzso of zzso In addition, blood zzso were collected from 5 zzso including the water zzso and examined for the presence of the zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in all tick and zzso species, with zzso of tick samples zzso zzso zzso and zzso of blood zzso zzso showing evidence of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene demonstrated that half of the sequences obtained from positive tick samples matched closest with a zzso species previously identified in the water python zzso The remaining sequences were found to be more closely related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study confirms that species of zzso harbor DNA of the same zzso species detected in the water zzso The detection of an additional zzso suggests the ticks may be exposed to 2 zzso species, providing further opportunity to study multiple zzso zzso
