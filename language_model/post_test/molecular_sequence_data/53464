The zzso breakdown of zzso by zzso is considered the major source of the second zzso zzso Studies on the contribution of the various described zzso and neutral zzso to the signaling pool of zzso have been hampered by the lack of molecular data on the neutral zzso zzso We recently identified a zzso zzso an integral membrane protein with remote similarity to bacterial zzso However, its ubiquitous expression pattern is in contrast to previous findings that zzso activity is found mainly in brain zzso By using an improved database search method, combined with zzso analysis, we identified a second zzso zzso zzso with zzso expression in the zzso The zzso activity of zzso has a neutral pH zzso depends on zzso zzso and is activated by zzso fatty acids and zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso with a zzso marker in a number of cell zzso The likely identity of zzso with zzso a rat protein involved in contact zzso of zzso zzso suggests a role for this zzso in cell cycle zzso Both zzso zzso are members of a zzso of zzso zzso which also contains zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso
