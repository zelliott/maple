zzso of the human zzso I gene is induced by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Both types of regulation are zzso by the major zzso element of the zzso which is localized between positions zzso and zzso The zzso zzso to transmit positive and negative signals to a zzso promoter or to a minimal promoter carrying only the zzso both detected by the appearance of zzso transcribed from the reporter gene linked to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso its zzso zzso and zzso of gene zzso which contain only the zzso zzso linked to a zzso promoter, are independent of ongoing protein zzso suggesting zzso modification of the zzso factor binding to the zzso zzso by zzso depends on an activated zzso zzso a tenfold lower zzso concentration is needed for repression of the zzso gene as compared to the zzso of the mouse zzso tumor virus long terminal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso contain zzso suggesting a direct interaction of both zzso zzso this interaction may lead to the zzso of zzso The action mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso confirms the central role of zzso in proliferation control and tumor zzso It appears that the most effective tumor promoter zzso zzso and the most effective zzso promoter zzso exert their action through the zzso of the same zzso zzso
