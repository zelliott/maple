The zzso region of a cell cycle regulated human zzso zzso gene appears to contain at least six promoter DNA elements that are shared with some, but not all human core zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that two of these elements represent separate binding sites for two zzso partially zzso zzso The first promoter domain contains zzso rich repeats and is involved in the binding of zzso a nuclear factor previously found to bind to zzso rich direct repeats in the promoters of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso The second domain, containing the general promoter element zzso zzso acts as a binding site for a two component mosaic factor we have designated zzso These data suggest that coordinate zzso regulation of human zzso and core zzso genes may involve two classes of zzso factors: those specific for zzso gene promoters and those that act on a broad spectrum of human gene zzso
