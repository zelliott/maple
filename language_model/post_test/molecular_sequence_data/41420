zzso is one of the leading causes of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso In this context, we investigate the possible zzso in the promoter and coding regions of the zzso gene among patients suffering zzso zzso glaucoma zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso for zzso in 61 unrelated Taiwanese zzso with zzso and in 100 healthy control zzso zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood zzso and then subjected to zzso The amplified products were screened for base zzso by zzso Next, data from the two groups were compared using the zzso zzso Additionally, three-dimensional zzso zzso of the human zzso and zzso zzso was performed using zzso an automated zzso zzso zzso Finally, the figure was prepared for the zzso structures by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Analysis results indicated two zzso zzso and five zzso The prevalence of zzso gene zzso in this study was zzso zzso The zzso included a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso revealed that this zzso zzso affects the zzso interaction in the zzso interaction with zzso and zzso thus altering significantly the efficiency of the zzso and proper folding of the zzso 

As a result, the zzso zzso might affect the protein structure and, ultimately, the normal function of zzso zzso we suggest that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be a risk factor for the development of zzso
