Two zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from commercial salt samples made from seawater in Japan and Indonesia, zzso zzso of the two strains were zzso and zzso zzso zzso was pink zzso while zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to grow at zzso zzso zzso (with zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and at zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso zzso zzso was able to grow at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso zzso zzso required at least 1 zzso zzso while zzso required at least 10 zzso for zzso Both strains reduced nitrate and zzso under zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and the closest relative was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso between these strains was zzso and zzso zzso while that between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso (each an average), zzso Based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that the zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from solar salt produced in zzso
