Important classes of antibiotics acting on bacterial cell wall zzso such as zzso and zzso are used extensively in therapy and are now faced with a challenge because of the progressive spread of resistant zzso A discovery program was devised to target novel zzso zzso zzso capable of overcoming these resistance zzso The microbial products were first screened according to their differential activity against zzso zzso and its zzso Then, activities insensitive to the addition of a zzso cocktail or zzso affinity zzso were zzso Thirty-five zzso were identified from a library of broth extracts produced by 40,000 uncommon zzso Five of them showed structural characteristics that did not match with any known microbial zzso In this study, we report on the production, structure determination, and biological activity of one of these novel zzso zzso zzso which is produced by the uncommon zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso Da zzso originating from 24 zzso zzso zzso It contains zzso and zzso zzso acids generating five zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively blocks zzso zzso and causes zzso of zzso zzso precursors in growing bacterial zzso On the basis of its mode of action and zzso structure, zzso can be assigned to the zzso (20 zzso zzso 1825 zzso and the zzso (19 zzso zzso 1890 zzso zzso of type B zzso Considering its spectrum of activity against zzso pathogens of medical importance, including zzso clinical zzso and its efficacy in zzso zzso represents a potentially new zzso to treat emerging zzso
