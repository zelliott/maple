To genetically characterize zzso strains in injecting drug users zzso in Bangkok, Thailand in 1994, and compare these with strains found earlier in Thai zzso such information is essential for zzso vaccine development and zzso 

zzso blood zzso cells were collected from 84 zzso attending 14 drug treatment clinics in Bangkok in zzso DNA was amplified using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso procedure and zzso directly (without zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso regions zzso zzso of the zzso gene were analyzed using a zzso zzso 

Only one zzso strain was a typical zzso B virus, 69 zzso were genetically distinct zzso zzso viruses zzso B), and 14 zzso were zzso E strains zzso zzso zzso with recently acquired infection were more likely to have zzso E viruses zzso zzso zzso than those in our 1991 survey, who were more likely to have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences within zzso E and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, compared with zzso and zzso among strains collected in 1991 in zzso 

The genetic diversity within zzso zzso and E in Thailand and the proportion of new infections due to zzso E viruses among Bangkok zzso are increasing zzso These data highlight the importance of monitoring the molecular epidemiology of zzso in populations being considered for zzso vaccine zzso
