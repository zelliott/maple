The zzso gene of zzso coli codes for a zzso zzso and forms a single gene zzso containing its own promoter and zzso zzso An analysis of the in zzso processing of zzso precursor revealed that the processing of the zzso end took place in a zzso reaction zzso by zzso P while the 3' processing involved two successive zzso The zzso zzso activity of the 3' precursor sequence was found to zzso with zzso zzso Heat zzso of zzso zzso P from two independent zzso coli zzso abolished the zzso activity of both the zzso and 3' zzso These results altogether suggest that zzso P carries the activity of 3' end zzso as well as that of zzso zzso In the presence of zzso alone, the zzso precursor was found to be zzso at a site approximately 13 zzso inside from the zzso end of mature zzso The zzso precursor zzso was no longer processed by the 3' zzso suggesting that the 3' zzso recognizes a specific zzso of the precursor zzso for zzso
