zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso by zzso zzso It has a relatively higher zzso and zzso and a better conversion ratio for zzso production than other known zzso from different sources at zzso By zzso acid sequences and the zzso motif alignment of zzso zzso zzso it was found that zzso zzso zzso acid zzso contains a particular zzso zzso that is not found in most other zzso To verify the function of this fragment, zzso deletion and zzso fusion were respectively performed to explain the important role this zzso plays in the formation of zzso First, the C zzso zzso 415 zzso acid zzso of zzso is deleted to construct a zzso containing 550 zzso zzso Furthermore, a novel zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and then a fusion protein was created with zzso at the C zzso of zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso had a lower zzso and a higher byproduct than zzso in catalyzing the conversion of zzso into zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso had a higher zzso and a lower byproduct than zzso in their zzso The zzso results allowed the zzso that the C zzso of zzso plays a key role in maintaining its zzso and hence in modulating the side reaction to reduce zzso production at a high zzso A new, simple, and fast method to improve zzso by fusing this zzso with particular zzso to a zzso zzso is zzso
