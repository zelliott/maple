Treatment failure and drug resistance create obstacles to long-term management of zzso zzso Nearly zzso of infected persons fail their first highly active zzso therapy zzso regimen, partially because of zzso requiring a switch to a second regimen to prevent drug zzso Among zzso youth, a group with rising infection rates, treatment switch is often zzso zzso and zzso consequences of this delay are zzso We conducted a retrospective, zzso study of drug resistance outcomes of initial zzso in zzso youth enrolled between zzso in a zzso zzso study and experiencing delayed switch in their first zzso treatment regimen for up to 3 zzso zzso zzso was performed on plasma samples collected zzso and changes in drug resistance zzso zzso T cell numbers and viral replication capacity were zzso zzso percent zzso zzso zzso of youth in the parent study experiencing zzso zzso were maintained on their initial zzso regimen for a median of 144 zzso Drug resistance was detected in zzso zzso of subjects during the zzso zzso on zzso reverse zzso inhibitor zzso regimens developed more zzso drug resistance zzso than those on zzso zzso regimens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso developing zzso zzso showed a trend toward lower zzso T cell gains zzso zzso zzso per zzso than those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso youth maintained on initial zzso zzso zzso regimens are more likely to develop drug-resistant zzso than with zzso zzso This finding may have implications for initial treatment regimens and transmission risk in zzso youth, a group with rising infection zzso
