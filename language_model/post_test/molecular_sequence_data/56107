In this study, the primary sequence and location of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso was derived from an adult zzso zzso zzso zzso has been partially defined previously with zzso zzso zzso and is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso From the zzso primary zzso acid sequence of the zzso sets of zzso overlapping by five zzso were zzso on pins and used to scan the expression of zzso zzso in the V regions of the light and heavy zzso A zzso rabbit zzso raised against the native zzso zzso and absorbed to make it zzso specific, was found to react with eight major zzso distributed between the zzso and zzso zzso Half of these zzso mapped to the zzso determining regions, with the others in framework zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at least in part, continuous linear zzso in both zzso and framework zzso The process of absorbing the zzso zzso on normal mouse zzso removed much of the background zzso activity against V region zzso but left the activity against the dominant zzso The sequence of a major zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region is zzso to sequences of human zzso that express the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is at least in part defined by this region of the zzso The same zzso area is also zzso to sequences in bacterial and zzso zzso proteins zzso Thus there may be a functional link through zzso connections, especially those involving zzso between zzso responses and production of zzso and some bacterial zzso may function indirectly as zzso for B zzso
