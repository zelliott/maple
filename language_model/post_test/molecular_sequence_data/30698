Several genes zzso putative zzso regulatory factors have been isolated on the basis of their ability to convert zzso cells into zzso Four of these genes code for nuclear proteins that belong to a larger family characterized by a zzso zzso motif required for zzso and zzso At least one zzso zzso can function as a zzso factor and activate zzso genes during zzso But the promoter of the zzso gene of the mouse zzso zzso zzso was recently reported to be functional in the absence of zzso binding sites and it has been suggested that the genes coding for the zzso could be regulated independently of zzso zzso Here, we identify two functional zzso sites in the zzso zzso of the chicken zzso zzso gene that are essential for full activity in zzso zzso
