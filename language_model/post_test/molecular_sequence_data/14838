zzso are small zzso that, based on their structural differences, are classified into four groups, one of which is called zzso zzso In this study, we identified a zzso zzso zzso from zzso tongue sole zzso zzso and analyzed its zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains 115 zzso and is zzso distinct from known zzso zzso zzso possesses the zzso zzso motif in the form of zzso but lacks the zzso sequence that is found in some zzso zzso zzso of zzso as determined by quantitative real time zzso occurred abundantly in immune zzso and was zzso by bacterial and viral infection in time dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited comparable zzso activities against tongue sole and zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso as the major cellular population in zzso that responds to zzso zzso study showed that when the two zzso zzso in the zzso motif of zzso were zzso by zzso the zzso activity of zzso was completely zzso Further study showed that treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso cellular proliferation and respiratory burst activity, zzso zzso the expression of a wide spectrum of immune relevant zzso and zzso enhanced cellular resistance against bacterial zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is likely a new type of zzso zzso that exerts zzso and zzso effects on zzso
