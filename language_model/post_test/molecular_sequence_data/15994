zzso zzso zzso 138 zzso zzso is an unstable zzso associated with a mild zzso It has the same zzso mobility as and cannot be resolved from zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso of blood and zzso do not indicate zzso oxygen zzso showing that the functional properties of the zzso are very similar to those of zzso zzso This implies that the introduction of zzso into the zzso at position 138 does not disrupt the critical zzso and zzso hydrogen bonds and salt bridges at the beta zzso zzso since these polar interactions are essential for the normal zzso properties of zzso X-ray zzso data are consistent with these findings and show that the consequences of the beta 138 zzso substitution are almost entirely confined to the immediate vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso probably results from the inability of a buried hydrogen bond to form between Pro 138 beta and Val zzso zzso
