One hallmark of innate immunity apparently zzso from primitive life forms through to humans is the ability of the host to recognize zzso molecular patterns zzso Since zzso pattern recognition receptors are not well defined in zzso we set out to identify such zzso Our findings reveal that zzso zzso express multiple pattern recognition receptors and that the zzso scavenger zzso zzso is one such zzso capable of recognizing both zzso and zzso bacteria, but not zzso Our data indicate that scavenger zzso bacterial recognition is zzso from insects to humans and may represent one of the most primitive forms of microbial zzso
