The zzso of the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso encodes necrosis and zzso zzso 1 zzso proteins zzso Although zzso are widely distributed in zzso and zzso plant zzso it was surprising to find these proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso family and identified 12 zzso genes and 15 zzso Most of the 27 genes form an zzso zzso cluster when compared with other zzso zzso zzso suggesting this class of zzso has recently expanded in zzso zzso zzso transcripts were mainly detected during early infection zzso zzso zzso transient expression and zzso of zzso zzso into tobacco and zzso leaves revealed that all zzso tested are zzso zzso Even zzso which is most similar to zzso zzso proteins of other zzso and which contains all zzso acids that are critical for zzso activity, did not induce zzso zzso constructed between zzso and the zzso zzso protein demonstrated that most of the zzso protein is functionally equivalent to zzso except for an exposed domain that prevents necrosis zzso The early expression and zzso expansion of the zzso genes is suggestive of an alternative function of zzso zzso proteins during zzso infection of zzso
