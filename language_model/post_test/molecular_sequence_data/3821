zzso integrity is maintained throughout the cell cycle through repair mechanisms and zzso by the ordered packaging of DNA in association with zzso zzso however, zzso zzso within and between zzso do zzso The role of the nuclear zzso protein zzso II zzso in generating zzso zzso has been a focus of recent zzso zzso zzso binds in zzso to zzso regions zzso and is involved in many DNA processing activities that require zzso zzso zzso zzso defined DNA elements rich in A + zzso have been proposed to serve as structural boundaries for zzso zzso and to delineate functional zzso In our investigation of gene zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs from zzso were mapped in the regions of three zzso gene clusters in an in zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso Sites with similarity to the 15 zzso consensus for zzso zzso were found predominantly in A + T enriched zzso zzso zzso of sites matching the zzso core consensus led to the identification of a novel core zzso gene on zzso IV and provided evidence for zzso and inversion in each of the three zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of DNA zzso reiterated regions revealed potential sites for zzso zzso and a base composition phenomenon suggestive of a trigger for inversion zzso
