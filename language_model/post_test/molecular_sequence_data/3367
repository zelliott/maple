The precise control of cell division during development is pivotal for zzso and the correct formation of zzso and zzso One important gene family involved in such control is the zzso class of negative cell cycle zzso Loss of function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes extra cell divisions in numerous zzso including the zzso the zzso and the zzso We have sought to better understand how cell divisions are controlled upstream or in parallel to zzso in specific zzso during zzso zzso zzso By taking advantage of the zzso cell lineage of zzso zzso we used an zzso zzso reporter in a screen to identify zzso that undergo cell division abnormalities in the zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso with twice the zzso complement of zzso cells, all of which arise during zzso This zzso called zzso is a fully dominant, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell cycle zzso that zzso the zzso lineage to an extra cell zzso We showed that zzso acts at the zzso transition, as zzso expression of zzso caused entry into S phase in zzso zzso In addition, we showed that the zzso requires zzso zzso The extra cell division zzso was shown to be restricted to the E lineage and the E fate is necessary and sufficient to sensitize cells to this zzso
