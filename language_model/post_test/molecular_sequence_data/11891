zzso zzso zzso is a zzso found associated with zzso in the zzso zzso has also been functionally characterized as an zzso for diverse zzso and a zzso for zzso zzso To determine the structure of mouse zzso we isolated and characterized clones from a zzso strain lung zzso library using a zzso zzso zzso The deduced sequence predicts a zzso acid signal zzso a zzso acid long zzso zzso with two zzso followed by an uninterrupted collagen domain with 59 zzso zzso Next, a short zzso domain of 28 zzso zzso with a potential to form zzso zzso coiled zzso is found ending in a zzso zzso acid zzso recognition zzso The mature mouse zzso protein of zzso zzso acids shows strong zzso to rat zzso zzso human zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Northern zzso and zzso analysis revealed that the mouse zzso gene is expressed predominantly in lung and, surprisingly, also in heart, stomach, and kidney but not in zzso In contrast, mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was found to be restricted to zzso Human lung and stomach, but not heart or liver, were found to express zzso zzso as determined by zzso The mouse zzso gene zzso has been localized to zzso 14 (to a region zzso to human zzso 10), closely linked to the genes for other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
