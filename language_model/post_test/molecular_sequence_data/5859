zzso is essential for eye development and for zzso gene expression within the zzso zzso of an alternative zzso zzso leads to zzso DNA binding specificity in zzso Here we show that in the mature bovine eye the relative abundance of the alternative zzso zzso varies zzso particularly between the lens and zzso Additional alternative zzso products were identified which may lead to zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes revealed highly zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso including potential zzso sites which may have a role in the mechanism of alternative zzso
