The third variable domain zzso zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso zzso contains a substantial number of positively charged zzso acid zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso of basic zzso acid zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso and 325 in the zzso domain of zzso strain zzso resulted in a dramatic elimination of both virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso at position zzso to zzso zzso or zzso at position 320 to zzso zzso had variable effects on zzso for a panel of T cell lines zzso These zzso are located on opposite sides of the zzso sequence in the center of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso allowed us to determine if these basic zzso are important for virus zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso of both zzso for zzso cells, although their 50% zzso effective doses were slightly higher than those required to achieve complete protection against zzso zzso zzso This result emphasizes that the basic zzso acids of zzso and zzso are not essential for the zzso effect of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso
