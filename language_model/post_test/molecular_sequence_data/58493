zzso is an zzso protein composed of two zzso H and zzso zzso of these zzso assemble to form zzso whose zzso composition varies in a characteristic way in different zzso Using zzso zzso we have assessed the role of H and L zzso in mouse zzso function and compared these to human zzso zzso We report that mouse zzso zzso exhibit considerable functional similarity to their human counterparts, including a prominent role of the H zzso in the zzso of rapid iron zzso and a key role of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso In addition, zzso acid zzso important to assembly of the protein are zzso between mouse and human, permitting the formation of fully functional hybrid proteins containing both mouse and human zzso However, zzso and human zzso H zzso also evidenced substantial functional zzso zzso zzso H showed a consistent reduction in iron zzso activity relative to human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso H zzso by zzso zzso mapped the domain of the protein critical to this activity difference to the DE zzso These findings suggest a novel functional role for zzso zzso of the zzso H zzso
