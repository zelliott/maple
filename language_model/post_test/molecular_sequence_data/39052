Cloning of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides additional evidence that zzso although present in the brain of zzso zzso is not zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso and the open reading frame contains the sequences of seven zzso zzso There are five copies of the zzso zzso as well as an zzso zzso sequence zzso and a zzso zzso sequence zzso In the zzso sequence of zzso zzso the penultimate zzso is a zzso sequence rather than the zzso present in zzso zzso The same order of zzso sequences also is observed for the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso standpoint the organization of zzso zzso has been remarkably zzso What remains to be resolved is whether the zzso sequence found in zzso zzso is an ancestral trait or a derived trait for the zzso Unlike the zzso precursor of zzso zzso all of the zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are flanked by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso In this regard the zzso sequence for zzso zzso is more similar to zzso zzso than the zzso sequence of zzso zzso However, a comparison of the zzso sequences in human, zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed several zzso features in the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, a comparison of zzso zzso sequences with the partial sequence of a sturgeon zzso zzso indicates that the position occupied by the penultimate zzso sequence in zzso zzso may be a highly variable locus in this zzso
