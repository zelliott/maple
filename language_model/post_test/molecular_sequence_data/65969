zzso zzso zzso is a plant zzso zzso To determine the factors involved in plant growth promotion by this zzso we zzso zzso strain zzso using zzso elements and isolated one zzso zzso which is defective in plant growth promotion, in a zzso culture zzso A zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of the parent zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that the genes responsible for plant growth promotion reside in a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence of the zzso identified 11 putative open reading zzso consisting of seven known and four previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso genes showed expression only in zzso conditions in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of culture zzso confirmed that zzso zzso produces zzso whereas zzso defective in plant growth promotion do zzso Application of zzso zzso on tomato zzso zzso plants cultivated in a zzso culture system significantly increased the zzso flower number, fruit number, and total fruit weight, whereas none of the strains that did not produce zzso promoted tomato zzso Furthermore, 5 to 1,000 zzso of synthetic zzso zzso a significant increase in the fresh weight of cucumber zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso is a plant growth promotion zzso Treatment of cucumber leaf discs with zzso and zzso zzso resulted in the scavenging of zzso oxygen species and hydrogen zzso suggesting that zzso acts as an zzso in zzso
