Three different zzso zzso fragments, zzso zzso and zzso were obtained by zzso from zzso isolated from zzso hybrid zzso leaf fragments cultured for 11 days under zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso coli the proteins zzso by the three zzso were recognized by zzso raised against 38 zzso zzso zzso studied previously zzso et zzso zzso 205 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso may represent expressed zzso of one gene because their sequences showed a very high identity zzso and are only zzso identical with zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso genes coding for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the genes corresponding to the three clones zzso by zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso were only zzso in zzso hybrid zzso leaf fragments from day 3 of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were already present in zzso leaf tissue of both the zzso hybrid zzso and a zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso was particularly high when zzso cells were dividing to produce zzso and when the amount of zzso deposited in cell walls surrounding zzso cells and young zzso zzso These results indicate that expression of the zzso gene is correlated to the zzso zzso process and that it encodes a 38 zzso zzso protein that may be involved in the degradation of zzso localized around zzso cells and young zzso A full-length zzso zzso clone was obtained using 3' and zzso zzso and its sequence revealed that it encodes a zzso that is equally zzso to both class III and class IV plant zzso
