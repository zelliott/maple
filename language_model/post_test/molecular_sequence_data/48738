zzso zzso zzso are extensively contributed to determine the zzso zzso state and zzso in human zzso zzso molecular evolution and functional diversity of the zzso is an important standpoint to describe the fundamental behind in the vaccine designing for bacterial zzso In the present study, we have evaluated the origin and functional evolution of zzso zzso within the zzso by analyzing their zzso zzso To represent the evolution history of zzso zzso trees were constructed based on their protein zzso structure and zzso zzso using different evolutionary zzso zzso divergence and genetic diversity were studied zzso to deduce the functional evolution of zzso zzso across the family and zzso The results of sequence similarity search have shown that three hypothetical proteins (above zzso were identical to the members of zzso and their functions were zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis of this study has revealed the family members of zzso were zzso related to one another, functionally zzso within the same family, and dispersed into closely related zzso The presence of core substitution pattern in the zzso zzso would determine the zzso function of zzso zzso diversity of the zzso was exclusively distinguished by zzso positive selection zzso toxin C and zzso toxin zzso and neutral selection zzso zzso zzso A and zzso toxin zzso acting on the existing zzso Many of the family members were sharing their zzso features from members in the zzso zzso zzso Conservative functions of members in the zzso have shown to be expanded only within closely related families, and retained as such in zzso bacteria by evolutionary process zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso we conclude that evolutionary significance of the members in the zzso would provide an insight for experimental zzso on zzso zzso and vaccine zzso
