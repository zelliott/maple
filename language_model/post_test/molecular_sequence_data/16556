Variation in zzso to zzso infection depends on numerous factors, and host genetic variation has been zzso as an important zzso As a zzso regulator, zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso plays a key role in both innate and zzso immunity against viral zzso zzso has also been shown to directly interact with zzso zzso zzso and efficiently initiate or amplify zzso zzso By complete gene sequencing, we investigated genetic zzso of the zzso gene in an zzso Kenyan zzso This population displayed extensive genetic diversity at the zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso were identified in this population, including 26 novel zzso Two zzso and one deletion zzso in zzso were also zzso zzso zzso zzso among these genetic variations was shown to be common in zzso The functional consequences of these zzso in the context of zzso remain to be zzso We also identified 35 consistent discrepancies between zzso zzso sequences and our population based sequencing data, suggesting that the previously submitted zzso data were not representative of the majority of human zzso zzso
