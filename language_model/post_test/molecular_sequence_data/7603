A model system using an zzso zzso virus shuttle zzso was recently developed to study the zzso virus zzso zzso integration event in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso In this study, we analyze the zzso junctions generated after integration of the zzso zzso into an zzso virus shuttle zzso carrying zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso 19 zzso sequence zzso zzso In most of the zzso one end of the viral zzso was joined to a portion of the zzso DNA previously shown to be a minimum target for zzso zzso Within this zzso segment, the zzso zzso points were zzso clustered around a binding site for the zzso regulatory zzso In all cases, the second junction with zzso occurred with zzso DNA outside of the zzso zzso With respect to the viral zzso one junction with the shuttle zzso DNA occurred either within the zzso zzso terminal repeat zzso or near the zzso promoter, approximately 100 zzso zzso to a modified zzso The modified zzso in 5 of 11 zzso involved a zzso zzso In one such instance, the zzso insert contained slightly more than one zzso equivalent arranged in a zzso manner with a junction close to the zzso zzso the zzso insert in this zzso zzso could be rescued by zzso infection and zzso to virus zzso The significance of the zzso organization is discussed in terms of the possible zzso of zzso DNA before or during zzso
