Two overlapping zzso clones that cover the complete length of the zzso for human type III zzso were zzso The data provided about zzso base pairs of sequence not previously defined for human type III zzso Two zzso sequences of zzso were identified that were not detected previously by zzso acid sequencing of human type III zzso The two additional zzso units, together with three previously zzso establish that the alpha 1 zzso chain is 15 zzso acids longer than either the alpha 1 zzso or alpha 2 zzso chains of type I zzso The additional zzso units made zzso plots of the zzso and zzso regions of type III collagen distinctly different from those of type I zzso The data also demonstrated that human type III zzso has the same third base preference in zzso for zzso zzso and zzso that was previously found with human and chick type I zzso In addition, comparison of two zzso clones from the same individual revealed a variation in structure in that the zzso for zzso acid 880 of the alpha 1 zzso chain was zzso for zzso in one clone and zzso for zzso in the zzso
