Two new zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso called zzso and zzso are located in a tail to tail arrangement adjacent to the zzso phase promoting zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso are flanked by zzso and repeated sequences of Ty elements suggesting an zzso gene zzso followed by an zzso gene zzso Based on their deduced protein sequence the zzso and zzso genes form a new pair of zzso zzso They are most related to each other and then to the deduced protein sequence of their adjacent genes zzso and zzso Both genes are periodically zzso zzso early in the cell zzso Loss of function zzso are viable, but zzso zzso exhibit a delay in S phase whereas zzso zzso show a delay in late zzso and/or S zzso The zzso zzso zzso is somewhat more pronounced in a double zzso zzso Both zzso have the potential to interact with the zzso zzso in zzso
