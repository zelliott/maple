zzso are zzso members of the zzso of seven zzso domain, G zzso zzso Study of the properties of several zzso activated zzso is deepening understanding of the normal functioning of this ubiquitous class of zzso The new findings suggest an expansion of the classical zzso complex model of zzso action to include an explicit zzso of the receptors from an inactive to an active state which couples to the G protein zzso zzso complex zzso This zzso involves zzso changes which may occur spontaneously, or be induced by zzso or appropriate zzso which abrogate the normal zzso function of the zzso allowing it to zzso into the active zzso Robert Lefkowitz and colleagues discuss the zzso and zzso implications of these new insights into regulation of zzso zzso
