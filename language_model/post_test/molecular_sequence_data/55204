In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recognized as the main signal zzso zzso the growth and initiation of zzso of zzso The molecular mechanism regulating zzso zzso in zzso remains zzso This project reports two zzso zzso zzso genes zzso isolated from cultivated zzso zzso and zzso are most zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with overlapping but distinct zzso During fruit development, both transcripts of zzso and zzso in zzso reach a peak around large green fruit zzso stage, but the sudden rise in zzso transcript level is much steeper and begins earlier than that in zzso zzso is also obviously expressed in the receptacles from green zzso hinting another zzso source for zzso development, other than zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits typical zzso zzso zzso in many aspects, such as the narrow and downward curled leaves, strong zzso dominance, short and zzso zzso It is also severely zzso due to the disruption of floral zzso initiation and floral zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso gene may hold zzso role in zzso zzso like their zzso in other zzso Integrated with the zzso expression features, these results led us to propose that zzso may involve in many zzso processes including flower and fruit development in zzso 

This paper is the first report of isolation and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso And their zzso functions in zzso zzso were confirmed after zzso zzso
