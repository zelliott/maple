A zzso zzso zzso model is proposed to predict the zzso sites in proteins by zzso with extended specificity zzso In addition to the probability of an zzso acid occurring at each of these zzso as observed from a training set of zzso known zzso by zzso zzso the conditional probabilities as reflected by the zzso effect along the zzso sequence are also taken into zzso These conditional probabilities are derived from an expanded training set consisting of sufficiently large zzso sequences generated by the zzso Carlo sampling zzso Very high accuracy was obtained in predicting protein zzso sites by both zzso and zzso zzso The new method provides a rapid and accurate means for analyzing the specificity of zzso zzso and hence can be used to help find effective zzso of zzso zzso as potential drugs against zzso The principle of this method can also be used to study the specificity of any zzso zzso
