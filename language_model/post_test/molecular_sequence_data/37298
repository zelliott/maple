Two zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso were zzso One we named zzso as it has high similarity to the zzso gene of zzso zzso The other zzso zzso showed more similarity to zzso zzso zzso than to zzso or zzso This suggests that divergence of the two zzso occurred before the evolutionary separation of the species and that the different functions have been zzso In line with this idea is the regulation of zzso of the zzso The mode of regulation appeared to be maintained between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso The zzso transcript was absent in zzso cells, whereas zzso levels in zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso of the zzso gene did not result in growth defects on zzso or zzso The growth rate on zzso however, was reduced by a factor of zzso zzso was expressed at similar levels during growth on zzso and zzso whereas expression on ethanol was slightly zzso A zzso zzso in this gene showed a reduced growth rate on all three carbon zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso is used during growth on zzso and that zzso is most dominant during growth on zzso zzso in which both zzso genes are deleted could only be retrieved when a zzso containing the zzso gene was present, suggesting that the double zzso is zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso spores with a deduced zzso zzso zzso but could not divide zzso It therefore appears that, as in zzso zzso the zzso zzso bypass formed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso is essential for zzso These results are in apparent contradiction with the growth on zzso of a strain with a disruption in the only structural zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity might, however, account for this zzso or zzso zzso an additional as yet unknown function, separate from its zzso zzso
