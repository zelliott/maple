The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a protein of 235 zzso acids not similar to any protein of known zzso zzso zzso zzso were poor in mating and zzso zzso of zzso which encodes a key zzso factor for sexual development, was not zzso by nitrogen zzso in these zzso zzso defective in zzso could express zzso and enter sexual development under incomplete zzso zzso Although expression of zzso is regulated primarily by the zzso zzso genetic analysis indicated that this cascade and zzso can partially compensate for each other in the regulation of sexual development, and that neither of them is zzso over the zzso Thus, zzso appears to control zzso expression via a signaling zzso independent of the zzso zzso
