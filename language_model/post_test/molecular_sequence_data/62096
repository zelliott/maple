zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso to both the nucleus and the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In some cells, zzso appears to be excluded from the nucleus, and it is unclear whether zzso signaling takes zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso or whether this pool of receptors strictly serves zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso tail of bovine zzso zzso activates zzso response zzso zzso only in the presence of zzso the activity is antagonized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso of zzso and is unaffected by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso indicating that this was due to direct zzso zzso The activity of zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso was also zzso dependent, suggesting that zzso gated the entry of zzso into the zzso Indeed, cell zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso in contrast to zzso that was nuclear at zzso was excluded from the nucleus in the absence of hormone, and localized to the inner nuclear membrane on incubation with zzso These data demonstrate that membrane zzso zzso is capable of nuclear function and that its zzso activity is regulated by zzso entry into the inner nuclear zzso Furthermore, these experiments provide evidence that under certain circumstances, membrane proteins are capable of nuclear function without zzso zzso zzso
