The hairpin zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of unknown three-dimensional zzso Here, we, demonstrate that zzso interactions are required for zzso function by zzso of activity following separation of an essential, independently folding domain zzso zzso from the zzso binding strand at a zzso zzso The resulting construct relies on long range zzso contacts for zzso For this work, we used an zzso zzso and zzso which included sequence changes to minimize the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried out using both single and multiple turnover methods and shows that the zzso efficiency zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso lower than that of the intact zzso The decrease in zzso results entirely from a zzso increase in the apparent zzso whereas the zzso zzso is essentially zzso zzso zzso chemistry appears to be zzso but the reaction is limited by the productive assembly of the two zzso Our results strongly support a previously proposed model in which the zzso zzso of the zzso contains a bend at a zzso zzso
