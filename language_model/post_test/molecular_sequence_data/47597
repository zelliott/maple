We selected zzso zzso mimicking the surface structure of zzso binding sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso from a random zzso acid zzso library containing a zzso bridge in a fixed position and displayed on a zzso zzso The varying of selection conditions, either by zzso of the association time or by competitive zzso with zzso was crucial for the selection of zzso zzso that could be aligned with the primary sequences of the envelope zzso zzso and zzso zzso when the envelope zzso sequences were zzso as overlapping peptides as spots on zzso the same site in primary structure was found as with zzso display, which corroborates the use of the two methods in mapping of zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso with zzso zzso from zzso virus infection were defined with the zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso of the selected zzso clones to a zzso zzso zzso site and to a linear zzso zzso were zzso
