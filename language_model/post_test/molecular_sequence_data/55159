A novel zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso sample collected from zzso County, zzso Province, Northern China and its zzso position was investigated using a zzso zzso The strain was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso zzso gene sequence clearly revealed that strain zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso The strain is closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with similarities of zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, the low zzso zzso levels between strain zzso zzso and its closely related zzso zzso demonstrated that this isolate represents a new zzso species in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso tests showed that growth of strain zzso zzso occurred at zzso zzso pH zzso and with a zzso tolerance up to zzso % zzso The zzso contained zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso mainly contained zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso could be clearly distinguished from other species of the zzso zzso It is therefore concluded that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso zzso
