In this chapter, we describe a procedure for identification of efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso sites in target zzso An active zzso library, containing zzso recognition sequences flanked by fixed zzso and 3' regions, is designed to generate enormous zzso The library is incubated with target zzso at an elevated temperature in the absence of zzso and bound library pools are isolated, zzso and rebound to target zzso After two zzso the active zzso library pool is incubated at 37 degrees C with target zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso products are directly identified on sequencing zzso The protocol identifies highly active zzso which typically have zzso of zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso
