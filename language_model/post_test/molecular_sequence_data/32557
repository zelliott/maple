zzso roles of zzso zzso being the zzso donor and zzso zzso make it an excellent zzso protein within the zzso zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To our surprise, this zzso zzso showed no gross defects in muscle development or function but, however, is highly sensitive to zzso of zzso zzso By taking advantage of the viable zzso zzso we investigated the zzso of zzso that are important for zzso and cellular zzso and required for its correct zzso zzso In transgenic animals rescued with various zzso zzso the in zzso patterns of zzso and zzso of several zzso zzso were observed to correlate with the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso is essential but not sufficient for correct cellular zzso and function of zzso In addition, direct interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was found for the first time, suggesting that the cellular zzso of zzso in zzso zzso is indeed modulated by zzso through a physical zzso
