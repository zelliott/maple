zzso of zzso receptors controls zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso but the underlying molecular zzso are zzso The zzso of zzso signaling protein zzso drives zzso degradation of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso depending on zzso zzso of a specific zzso located in a zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that, despite zzso of other zzso positioning of a zzso within the zzso region is indispensable for this zzso Neither zzso of the motif nor fusion of zzso to the zzso of the zzso could drive zzso zzso However, within this region, the zzso could be shifted 12 zzso acids toward the zzso without losing its function, arguing against the existence of a linear sorting motif and demonstrating that positioning of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso site is zzso zzso zzso peaked after zzso was inhibited by zzso as well as zzso zzso and severely reduced in zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso mainly occurs at zzso Apart from zzso structural and zzso aspects of zzso zzso these findings have implications for the abnormal signaling function of zzso zzso found in severe zzso zzso a zzso disorder with a high leukemia zzso
