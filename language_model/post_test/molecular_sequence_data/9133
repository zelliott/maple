The identification of suitable targets is crucial for the discovery and development of new zzso Since the zzso cell wall is an essential zzso the identification of genes involved in cell wall zzso is expected to help discover new zzso zzso From our previously obtained collection of cell wall zzso with a zzso active cell wall stress response pathway, we selected a zzso zzso zzso with decreased resistance to zzso for zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso were zzso by a gene zzso a protein with high sequence similarity to zzso d of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso revealed that the conditional zzso zzso encodes a protein that lacks 12 zzso acids at the zzso due to a point zzso that introduces a stop zzso zzso of the entire gene resulted in very poor zzso The conditional zzso displayed several zzso that are typical for zzso zzso including increased sensitivity to zinc zzso and reduced zzso of the zzso as observed by zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso induced the expression of zzso and other cell wall related zzso zzso genes involved in cell wall zzso like zzso zzso and zzso were clearly zzso in the conditional zzso Our results indicate that the zzso transport of zzso and zzso of the zzso is crucial for the strength of the zzso cell wall and that reduced activity of the zzso zzso the cell wall stress response zzso
