zzso are common pathogens responsible for a wide spectrum of systemic zzso Conventional diagnosis of these infections relies on the isolation of viruses in cell culture and their identification by zzso with zzso or zzso zzso Among zzso zzso B have been involved as zzso agents for viral zzso Most of the time, in the case of cardiac zzso viral isolation is zzso zzso biology techniques appear to be an alternative to conventional diagnosis and could supply evidence for the direct implication of zzso in these severe zzso In this paper, we describe a zzso experimental model of infection with the presumed highly zzso zzso B type zzso A zzso of infection was observed for a period of 31 days, and the classical zzso markers zzso isolation from feces and heart zzso zzso were monitored and compared by means of molecular techniques zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso In this zzso period, the detection of zzso B type 3 zzso in the heart was possible only by using two successive zzso zzso After 9 to 11 days of active viral zzso when all other zzso markers were negative, positive zzso signals were zzso which supports the hypothesis of a shift to persistent zzso zzso
