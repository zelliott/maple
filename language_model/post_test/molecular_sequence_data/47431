zzso 3 zzso of zzso zzso zzso II is a zzso of the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso which plays a key role in zzso assembly of this complex zzso by providing the contact surfaces for both beta and zzso zzso Previously we demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso protein forms a core zzso together with zzso (the beta zzso and zzso (the second alpha zzso zzso as in the case of the zzso zzso zzso In order to obtain further insight into the zzso zzso of zzso we subjected the zzso zzso zzso gene to zzso A total of nine zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated, each (with the exception of one double zzso carrying a single zzso in the zzso gene in one of the four regions (A zzso that are zzso between the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The three zzso zzso were all located in region A, in agreement with the central role of the corresponding region in the assembly of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in contrast, were found in all four zzso Growth of the zzso zzso was reduced to various zzso at zzso zzso Since the zzso stability of most zzso zzso zzso proteins was markedly reduced at zzso temperature, we predict that these zzso zzso proteins are defective in zzso assembly or the zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso are zzso In accordance with this zzso the zzso zzso of all the zzso was suppressed to varying zzso by zzso of zzso the pairing partner of zzso in the core zzso We conclude that the majority of zzso zzso affect the assembly of zzso even though their effects on zzso assembly vary depending on the location of the zzso zzso
