The zzso zzso zzso represents an important zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Valley fever zzso By preparing a series of zzso substitution zzso the importance to zzso of individual zzso within this zzso has been zzso Here, we investigated a simple and rapid zzso analysis to test for correlations between the observed zzso of the substitution analogue peptides and the calculated zzso preferences in local regions of the zzso zzso energy analyses were carried out on all zzso combinations represented in the zzso zzso and in the zzso substitution analogue zzso zzso similarities and differences between zzso and substitution zzso pairs were zzso The results of these zzso analyses were then compared with the data on the relative zzso of the zzso zzso and the substitution zzso This comparison revealed a positive zzso zzso peptides showing changes in zzso possessed significant changes in the calculated backbone zzso relative to wild type in the zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso peptides showing no change in zzso similarly showed no significant changes in zzso zzso The potential utility of zzso zzso energy analyses and this preliminary zzso correlation are zzso
