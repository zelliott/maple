Many zzso cell surface proteins are anchored in the zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso anchors are zzso attached in the zzso zzso zzso The modified proteins are then transported through the zzso zzso to the cell zzso We have identified two genes in zzso zzso zzso and a novel gene termed zzso (for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso structurally related proteins with multiple zzso zzso Both proteins are localized to the zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso of either gene caused no zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso cells displayed growth defects and a significant delay in zzso transport of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso zzso functionally redundant or overlapping zzso The rate of zzso anchor attachment was not affected, nor was the transport rate of several zzso zzso zzso with a role of zzso and zzso in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso cells deposit zzso multilayered cell zzso Both proteins have significant sequence similarity to zzso a zzso membrane protein thought to be involved in protein zzso across the zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies, however, did not detect any defects in protein zzso in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that neither zzso gene plays a role in this zzso Instead, we propose that zzso and zzso facilitate efficient zzso transport of zzso zzso
