zzso zzso produces two zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso from an zzso zzso gene library diminished zzso production by zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The zzso sequence and predicted zzso acid sequence of the locus responsible for the zzso suppression revealed zzso identity to zzso zzso a zzso sensor zzso of the zzso regulators, whose zzso response regulator, zzso is a global zzso regulating several products and zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso and a strain carrying a zzso zzso zzso were zzso Either zzso or the zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso production and zzso of zzso the gene coding for the key zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso and impaired zzso Taken together, these data indicate that in zzso zzso the zzso global system regulates zzso zzso
