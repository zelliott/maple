zzso of thin filament from zzso zzso zzso body wall muscle were found to be contaminated with large amounts of an unknown protein which, when zzso migrated to 29 zzso on zzso and was thus named zzso To zzso its zzso function, we have determined the primary structure of zzso by zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that zzso is divided to four zzso by three zzso It is composed of 251 zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso is blocked by an zzso zzso The zzso domain of 150 zzso is zzso and from zzso 36 to 92 there are three similar repeated sequences of 19 zzso The zzso domain showed no significant sequence zzso with other zzso On the other hand, the zzso domain of 100 zzso has zzso with those of small zzso proteins and zzso of lens zzso zzso is thought to be a fusion protein of two different zzso Recently alpha zzso was identified in skeletal muscle and suggested to be a zzso protein zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso may also be a zzso zzso as suggested by the sequence similarity of the zzso domain with zzso although the origin and role of the zzso domain are not zzso
