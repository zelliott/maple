The zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been cloned previously and the products of zzso and zzso were shown to be functionally zzso to their zzso coli counterparts by zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso leads to an zzso zzso are the first three zzso of a nine zzso zzso unit with a total length of 11 zzso This zzso called zzso is located at about 256 degrees on the zzso zzso genetic map and contains six new genes named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is directed by a strong zzso zzso promoter identified within a 150 zzso DNA zzso upstream from the translation start site of zzso Analysis of the sequence of the zzso zzso showed that the putative products of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to bacterial components of zzso transport systems and zzso most probably encodes an zzso The functions of zzso and zzso are zzso An in zzso zzso zzso in the region downstream from zzso allowed us to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not essential for zzso zzso Studies with strains bearing zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso coli zzso gene revealed that expression from the zzso promoter is induced by zzso and zzso by zzso
