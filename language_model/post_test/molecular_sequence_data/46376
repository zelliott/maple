zzso zzso proteins contain short zzso motifs that recruit cellular zzso zzso proteins to facilitate virus zzso zzso late zzso often contain the core consensus sequence zzso (where zzso can vary in sequence and zzso However, some zzso zzso virus zzso zzso proteins lack this consensus zzso yet still bind zzso We mapped zzso zzso late zzso within the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Crystal structures revealed that zzso zzso (in zzso and nearby zzso zzso zzso contact the zzso V domain, revealing how zzso employ a diverse family of zzso sequences to bind zzso and promote virus zzso
