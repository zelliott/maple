Floral zzso of zzso plants is commonly infested with zzso yet little is known about the zzso inhabiting the floral zzso of zzso In this study, we investigated microbial communities occurring in the floral zzso of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria and zzso were isolated and identified by partially sequencing the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using three different culture media, we found that bacteria were common inhabitants of the floral zzso of zzso The most widely distributed bacterial operational zzso units zzso in zzso of zzso were representatives of the family of zzso with an unspecified zzso zzso as the most zzso In contrast to previous studies investigating microbial communities in floral zzso very few zzso species zzso of the zzso zzso were observed, and most of them occurred in very low zzso Total zzso richness zzso the number of bacterial and zzso zzso per zzso zzso varied between 4 and zzso zzso analysis revealed that microbial communities of zzso species differed from those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study extends previous efforts to identify microbial communities in floral zzso and indicates that the floral zzso of the zzso investigated mainly contained bacterial communities with moderate zzso zzso
