The three-dimensional structure of a zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso in complex with a zzso of proposed formula zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution in space group zzso using zzso zzso zzso The structure refined to R zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and has revealed new zzso details in addition to those detected for the zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso A resolution, respectively zzso et zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso The cholesterol zzso structure is a zzso with four zzso separated zzso contact areas and two zzso pairs of openings to an internal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in each zzso face each other across a central zzso zzso The zzso zzso have zzso chains attached to their zzso and zzso zzso with two ordered zzso zzso visible at each zzso The side chains of 14 zzso have two alternative zzso with occupancy values of zzso zzso zzso For each zzso the electron density in the zzso zzso zzso is well modeled by a zzso fatty zzso
