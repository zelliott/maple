The zzso cryptic zzso zzso has been used as a zzso for the cloning of zzso resistance genes directly in zzso and in the construction of zzso zzso shuttle zzso The results of zzso experiments located the basic zzso of zzso within a zzso zzso The zzso base sequence of this region was determined and contained a single complete open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a predicted size of 29 zzso This zzso and a region of the DNA zzso zzso to the zzso zzso it shared zzso with the replication protein and plus origin, respectively, of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Data from zzso zzso and zzso studies indicated that the protein product of the zzso was required for zzso replication in zzso zzso of a region of the basic zzso zzso to the plus origin and zzso produced an unstable zzso and resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso consistent with the loss of a minus zzso All of these results suggest that zzso replicates by a rolling circle mode, and is most closely related to the zzso family of zzso DNA zzso
