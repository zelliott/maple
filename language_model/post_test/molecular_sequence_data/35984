zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is specific for zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso of zzso is removed by substitution of zzso with zzso In the present study, the zzso potency of zzso determined in a system composed of a zzso human plasma zzso submerged in zzso zzso was found to be only twofold higher than that of intact zzso zzso zzso but zzso higher than that of zzso a zzso of zzso in which the zzso site was removed by substitution of zzso with zzso The zzso potency of zzso with an intact zzso site, was zzso higher than that of zzso zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso or zzso into their zzso derivatives with zzso occurred at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso inhibited the zzso potency of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly higher than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso or of zzso These findings suggest that the zzso increase in zzso potency of zzso relative to that of zzso is due both to targeting of the zzso to the zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a more efficient conversion of zzso zzso to its zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, targeting to clots by means of zzso zzso results in a significant increase of the zzso potency of zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
