The mouse gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso was mapped at 42 zzso on zzso 1, a position identical to that of the gene for zzso zzso zzso from linkage analysis of a zzso cross test with zzso zzso and zzso as marker zzso The zzso for mouse zzso and zzso zzso isolated after amplification by zzso shared an identical zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that mouse zzso and zzso zzso are expressed from a single gene and involve alternative zzso zzso We also detected zzso of the gene for zzso zzso in all mouse strains examined with the exception of zzso and zzso
