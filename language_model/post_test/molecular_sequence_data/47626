zzso is a basic zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso also endowed with zzso zzso The protein consists of a zzso zzso zzso onto which an zzso zzso zzso zzso is packed, and of a small zzso stretch at the zzso Furthermore, the two zzso zzso an aromatic cluster displaying a zzso zzso We previously cloned the zzso zzso expressed it in zzso coli, and produced several zzso zzso either of zzso located in the zzso core or of zzso which is exposed to the zzso and plays a major role in DNA zzso The zzso zzso was dramatically zzso with a loss in zzso and zzso by at least 27 K and 10 zzso zzso Here, we report the solution structure of the zzso zzso which was determined by zzso zzso using zzso distance constraints obtained from analysis of zzso zzso in conjunction with simulated zzso zzso The most remarkable finding is the change in orientation of the zzso side chain, which in the wild type is completely exposed to the zzso whereas in the zzso is largely buried in the aromatic zzso This prevents the formation of a cavity in the zzso core of the zzso which would arise in the absence of structural zzso We found additional changes produced by the zzso notably a strong distortion in the zzso with loss in several hydrogen bonds, increased flexibility of some stretches of the zzso and some local zzso On one hand, these features may justify the dramatic zzso provoked by the zzso on the other hand, they highlight the crucial role of the zzso core in protein zzso To the best of our knowledge, no similar zzso has been so far described as a result of a zzso zzso
