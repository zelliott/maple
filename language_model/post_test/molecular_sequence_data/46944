The zzso has long been known as a functionally highly specialized zzso compartment where zzso zzso zzso and processing of zzso zzso take zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso contains all the zzso factors that are responsible for the accurate and efficient synthesis of the eight zzso zzso and three zzso zzso carried by the zzso zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso in the zzso small zzso zzso are also present and functionally active in the zzso For selection of the correct target zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso factors rely on short sequences located around the target zzso to be zzso This observation further underscores a recently proposed role for small zzso guide zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso You, zzso zzso Graham, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We demonstrate that a novel zzso zzso can be generated in the zzso zzso zzso by use of an artificial zzso small zzso guide zzso We also show that a short zzso of the zzso zzso when expressed as part of the human zzso zzso is faithfully zzso and zzso These results are most consistent with a trafficking zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso cycles through the zzso to undergo zzso zzso zzso
