zzso zzso zzso represent a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso found in bacteria and zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of several zzso zzso zzso have great zzso potential, as they zzso the formation of zzso bonds, and therefore may be exploited for the zzso synthesis of zzso acids that are biologically active or constitute building blocks for pharmaceutical zzso Many zzso showing different zzso towards the zzso zzso have been zzso Because of their potential to carry out zzso zzso zzso have been subjected to zzso functional and zzso zzso Nevertheless, their zzso mechanism and the structural bases of their zzso have not been zzso In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso coli at zzso resolution, in the zzso form and zzso with zzso and zzso Furthermore, several active site zzso have been functionally characterized in order to zzso the reaction mechanism and the molecular bases of zzso No active site zzso zzso was revealed, and a structural water zzso was assumed to act as the zzso base in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the very large active site opening of zzso coli zzso suggests that much larger molecules than zzso zzso may be easily zzso and zzso may actually have diverse zzso functions in different zzso zzso recognition and reaction specificity seem to be guided by the overall zzso that surrounds the zzso at the zzso active site, rather than by one ore more specific zzso
