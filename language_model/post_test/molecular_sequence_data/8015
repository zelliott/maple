zzso is a widely zzso multifunctional, zzso zzso that has been implicated in the regulation of normal zzso In addition, expression of particular zzso of zzso has been associated with zzso transformation and/or the acquisition of zzso zzso In this study, we used two recently developed zzso zzso zzso one zzso with an zzso shared by many zzso zzso and the other with an zzso unique to zzso zzso containing zzso acids zzso by the alternatively spliced zzso zzso to compare the expression of zzso on primitive zzso cells from the zzso of normal individuals and their zzso counterparts present in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso analysis and cell sorting studies showed that zzso is normally expressed at high to very high levels on both long-term zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso units zzso In contrast, primitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso were more homogeneous in their expression of zzso and very few (less than zzso showed the very high levels of zzso seen on zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso to be restricted to a small zzso zzso to zzso of zzso recognizable mature zzso zzso cells within the zzso fraction of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis showed the presence of two zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso a significantly greater proportion of the circulating zzso zzso expressed very high levels of zzso and these zzso were accompanied by an increased number of light density zzso cells, including some that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobilized by prior chemotherapy and growth factor treatment of patients with Hodgkin's disease or acute zzso leukemia in zzso showed no changes in zzso expression relative to normal zzso zzso These results provide evidence of early zzso changes in zzso expression during normal zzso in zzso that may be zzso in the zzso clone of patients with zzso
