The gene coding for the major zzso factor of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated utilizing an zzso as a probe to a zzso region of major zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1905 zzso that could zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with a calculated molecular size of 73 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 73 displayed extensive zzso with major zzso factors from a variety of zzso zzso of the major zzso factors from zzso coli and zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 73 produced in zzso coli zzso migrated as a zzso protein when analyzed by sodium zzso zzso zzso This anomalous migration is characteristic of zzso major zzso factors and agrees with the migration noted for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite a similarity to the zzso coli zzso 70 zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 73 did not complement zzso coli zzso zzso zzso
