zzso of the zzso zzso which mediates iron zzso from zzso is zzso regulated zzso by zzso iron through zzso elements in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms are also involved in zzso zzso but these are poorly zzso In this study we have characterized the zzso zzso promoter region and identified a functional zzso response element that contains a binding site for zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso and zzso cells to zzso for 16 h resulted in a zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso A motif with zzso organization similar to the zzso response element of a number of zzso genes such as zzso was identified within a zzso pair sequence upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso of a site similar to the consensus zzso site zzso in this motif attenuated the hypoxic response by zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced the wild type zzso zzso promoter activity, but that which contained a zzso zzso yielded no such zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso was zzso and bound to the zzso zzso zzso upon hypoxic zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso is a target gene for zzso
