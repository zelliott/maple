Rapid progress in sequencing various zzso has highlighted the need for the development of zzso zzso for the detection of thousands of expressed gene zzso The magnitude of this detection problem exceeds current technical zzso In an attempt to address this zzso a novel approach has been developed called mimicry of zzso zzso tags have been designed to bind to a specific region of zzso on the basis of zzso acid sequence zzso with this zzso zzso zzso were produced by zzso the synthetic peptides to activated zzso zzso and binding was assessed by zzso of enhanced zzso reactions using a high density of target protein at the binding zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso was strongest under zzso conditions that enriched for native zzso protein and was affected by zzso temperature and zzso zzso The results suggest that it should be possible to develop specific zzso for tagging proteins on the basis of sequence and secondary structure zzso
