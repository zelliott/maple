zzso cattle yield carcasses with yellow zzso consumers often reject the resulting meat products because they assume they come from old and/or culled zzso zzso bacteria expressing zzso 15, zzso introduced into the rumen of the animal, might help to reduce the zzso since this zzso converts zzso to zzso thereby eliminating the source of zzso The goal of this work was to evaluate the effect of a zzso zzso 15, zzso zzso from zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso The genetically modified zzso was introduced into zzso fluid, and zzso conversion to retinal was zzso Under optimum conditions the zzso produced zzso zzso of retinal per 1 zzso of protein in 1 hour at 37 zzso The data on in zzso zzso in zzso fluid showed no differences in zzso breakdown or in retinal production zzso zzso zzso between zzso coli with zzso zzso alone and zzso coli with zzso The zzso zzso was stable in zzso coli for 750 zzso These results indicate that the protein did not break zzso into retinal in zzso fluid, perhaps due to its location in the zzso space in zzso zzso Future research must consider strategies to release the zzso into the rumen zzso
