The zzso zzso of zzso controls the abundance of specific regulatory zzso The zzso complex is a type of zzso zzso zzso that contributes to this zzso in many biological zzso In zzso and zzso the zzso complex consists of common zzso including zzso zzso and zzso as well as variable components known as zzso zzso Whereas only one functional zzso gene is present in the human zzso the zzso of zzso zzso has now been shown to contain at least 21 zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties, zzso and function of the zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso 

Of the 17 zzso proteins zzso eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to interact with zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis or a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso proteins exhibited diverse binding zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The tissue specificity of expression of the zzso zzso proteins was also zzso zzso of zzso or zzso genes by zzso zzso interference resulted in embryonic death, whereas that of zzso zzso zzso or zzso was associated with slow growth and zzso zzso 

The multiple zzso zzso zzso proteins exhibit marked differences in their association with zzso and zzso zzso in tissue specificity of zzso and in zzso associated with functional suppression by zzso At least eight of the zzso proteins may, like zzso zzso act as variable components of the zzso complex in zzso zzso
