A zzso strain designated as zzso isolated from a soil sample collected from zzso Island, Korea, was subjected to zzso zzso The isolate was strictly zzso zzso were short rods and zzso zzso growth temperature and pH was 28 degrees C and zzso zzso It was characterized zzso as having a zzso zzso type based on zzso acid and zzso as the zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that strain zzso is affiliated to the zzso zzso and formed a distinct lineage within the zzso zzso showed highest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso having a similarity of zzso Based on the zzso zzso gene sequence divergence and zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso should be classified as representing a novel member of the zzso zzso for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
