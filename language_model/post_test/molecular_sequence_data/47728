The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor II zzso a member of the squash family of zzso zzso is composed of 28 zzso acid zzso and is a potent inhibitor of zzso Its compact structure is defined by a zzso zzso zzso which is held together by three zzso zzso bonds forming a zzso zzso In order to explore the potential of the zzso zzso to serve as a structural scaffold for the presentation of zzso zzso we constructed two zzso zzso where the zzso inhibitor loop was replaced by a zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso and by a zzso zzso from human bone zzso zzso and derived zzso were produced via fusion to zzso binding protein zzso By zzso of the fusion into the zzso space, fully oxidized and correctly folded zzso was obtained in high zzso zzso and derived zzso could be presented on the zzso coli outer membrane by fusion to truncated zzso which comprises the first nine zzso of mature zzso plus the membrane spanning zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso Gene expression was under control of the strong and tightly regulated zzso zzso Cell viability was found to be drastically reduced by high level expression of zzso fusion zzso To restore cell zzso net zzso of fusion protein in the outer membrane was reduced to a tolerable level by introduction of an amber zzso at position 9 of the zzso sequence and utilizing an amber zzso strain as expression zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso containing an zzso were shown to be surface labeled with the respective zzso zzso by indirect zzso corroborating the cell surface exposure of the zzso sequences embedded in the zzso zzso knot zzso zzso displaying a particular zzso sequence could be enriched zzso by combining magnetic cell sorting with zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate that zzso cell surface display of zzso constrained peptides zzso to the zzso zzso knot scaffold has the potential to become an effective technique for the rapid isolation of small zzso molecules from zzso libraries that bind with high affinity to zzso zzso
