The characterization of the multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso is fundamental to our understanding of how cells control the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso We now describe our isolation of a zzso zzso zzso clone of a rat zzso form of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso includes an 18 zzso acid region that aligned with approximately zzso identity with the zzso domain of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the similarity zzso conservation of the zzso signature of the zzso acid zzso zzso A zzso truncated form of zzso was expressed in zzso coli and the zzso specificity of the zzso protein was zzso zzso was zzso first to zzso and then to zzso by consecutive 3- and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso without specificity towards a particular zzso group, but in contrast, zzso only removed the zzso from the zzso group of zzso zzso These data, which are consistent with the zzso zzso of native (but not zzso zzso isolated from rat liver, provide the first demonstration that a single zzso is responsible for this diverse range of specific zzso zzso A zzso zzso transcript of zzso zzso was present in all rat zzso that were zzso but was most highly expressed in kidney and zzso The predicted zzso of zzso is comprised of the zzso zzso which is considered a signal for retaining soluble proteins in the zzso of the zzso zzso the presence of this sequence provides a molecular explanation for our earlier zzso demonstration that the zzso zzso contains substantial zzso activity zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
