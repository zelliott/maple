To identify novel tumor zzso genes at zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were selected from zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso were used to detect the expression of the zzso in zzso cell line, zzso and primary cultures of normal zzso zzso zzso One zzso which was substantially zzso in the zzso cell line, was detected in 19 zzso biopsy zzso zzso library screening was used to get its full sequence and the sequence of this novel gene was zzso 

A novel gene located at zzso zzso was obtained and named zzso It was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso biopsy zzso Its zzso zzso full length zzso had a potential open reading frame predicting a 94 zzso acid protein with a molecular weight of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso gene showed that it was a zzso protein containing a protein zzso C zzso site and a zzso zzso It has no significant zzso to any reported genes in the database of zzso 

zzso is a novel gene zzso in zzso suggesting that it may be involved in the development of zzso
