Currently, the major challenge for cancer treatment is to develop new types of smart zzso that can efficiently retain the zzso drug during blood circulation and quickly release the drug in tumor cells under zzso In this study, the dual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully prepared by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and then zzso with zzso zzso which was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso onto the main chain of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited good zzso according to the zzso zzso against zzso zzso The cell viability was maintained higher than zzso after 24 h incubation with zzso even at a high concentration of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso drug zzso zzso was selected as a model drug and loaded into zzso zzso The results of in zzso evaluation showed that the zzso zzso could be quickly released at low pH with the light zzso Meanwhile, the zzso zzso displayed a better zzso against zzso cancer cells under zzso zzso and zzso of the loaded zzso was as low as zzso zzso zzso which was close to that of the free zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the flow zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso cells efficiently and release zzso inside the tumor cells to enhance the zzso of cell zzso zzso such excellent zzso zzso provide a favorable platform to construct smart drug delivery systems zzso for cancer zzso
