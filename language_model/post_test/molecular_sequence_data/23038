zzso zzso zzso which is zzso from the larger zzso zzso precursor zzso is found deposited in the brain of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is linked with zzso We report the results of studies of zzso and the effect of metal zzso zzso and zzso on model zzso using zzso and zzso solid-state zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and metal zzso interact with the zzso zzso and the effects on the zzso zzso and the zzso structure were different for membrane incorporated or associated zzso zzso zzso alone zzso the zzso zzso and induced formation of smaller zzso but when zzso was associated with the zzso membrane copper did not have this zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso adopted more zzso structure when incorporated in a zzso zzso in comparison to the associated zzso which was largely zzso zzso peptides appear to disrupt the membrane more severely than associated zzso which may have implications for the role of zzso in disease zzso
