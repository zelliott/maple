The zzso and the zzso sequence of zzso protein zzso zzso of the giant panda zzso zzso was cloned using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso These two sequences were zzso and zzso and the zzso of the zzso gene was zzso in zzso coli zzso We compared the zzso sequences of the coding region and the zzso acid sequences with those of seven other zzso species retrieved from zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso cloned from the giant panda is zzso zzso in size, containing an zzso frame of 456 zzso zzso 151 zzso zzso The length of the zzso sequence is zzso zzso with five zzso and four zzso The coding sequence shows a high degree of zzso to those of Homo zzso zzso zzso zzso lupus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Pan zzso the degree of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for the deduced zzso acid sequences reached as high as zzso zzso structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative zzso protein is zzso zzso with a theoretical zzso of zzso Based on zzso zzso there is one protein zzso C zzso site, one zzso zzso II zzso site, two zzso sites, and one zzso protein zzso signature in the zzso protein of the giant zzso The zzso gene can be expressed in zzso coli and the zzso protein fused with the zzso zzso form, which gave rise to the addition of an expected zzso zzso
