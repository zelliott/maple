Two gene groups, designated energy converting zzso A zzso and energy converting zzso B zzso each zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso of zzso zzso The length of the zzso units was determined using reverse zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be composed of 20 and 17 open reading zzso zzso Competitive zzso was used to compare the amounts of zzso and zzso transcripts with the amounts of transcripts of genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso In cells grown under conditions in which zzso was zzso the zzso transcripts were zzso and zzso less abundant and the zzso transcripts were approximately zzso and zzso less abundant than the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In cells grown under zzso zzso the amounts of zzso and zzso transcripts were about zzso higher than in cells grown with sufficient zzso when compared to the amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the deduced proteins indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso each zzso a zzso zzso large zzso a zzso zzso small zzso and two zzso integral membrane zzso These proteins show high sequence similarity to zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso coli zzso 3 and 4, and zzso zzso from zzso zzso all of which form a distinct group of zzso zzso zzso zzso and show high sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso I) from various zzso In addition to these four zzso the zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso a zzso zzso four zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso integral membrane zzso the zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso a zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and nine zzso integral membrane zzso A function of these putative zzso zzso zzso as zzso pumps involved in zzso zzso such as the synthesis of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso is zzso
