Both laboratory and early clinical studies to date have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso may have potentially significant application in cancer zzso The clinical development of zzso as zzso has been zzso however, by the difficulty in preparing the materials in sufficient quantity and quality by traditional zzso In recent years, a variety of zzso methods has been developed for efficient production of zzso both as zzso fragments and as full-length zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso approach for the production of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with two zzso sites to each of its target zzso by genetically fusing a single variable domain zzso to the N zzso of the light chain of a functional zzso zzso of different zzso A model zzso was constructed using a single variable domain zzso to mouse zzso growth factor zzso alpha and a conventional zzso zzso to mouse vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso cells and zzso to zzso by zzso protein A affinity zzso Furthermore, the zzso retains the zzso binding specificity and the zzso zzso activity of both of its parent zzso This design and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso should be zzso to the construction of similar zzso from zzso recognizing any pair of zzso
