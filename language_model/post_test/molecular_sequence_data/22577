We present a minimalist approach for the modeling of the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso coiled zzso The approach is based on empirical principles introduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1953, zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso hypothesized that keeping the distance between the zzso at the interacting interface of zzso constant would lead to zzso or the formation of a coiled zzso through the zzso mode of zzso We have implemented the latter hypothesis in a simulating zzso protocol in the simple form of zzso distance restraints zzso per zzso between zzso at the zzso positions zzso To demonstrate the authenticity of zzso hypothesis and the precision and accuracy of our approach, we have modeled the crystal structures of six synthetic coiled coils in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean root mean square zzso zzso between the backbone atoms of the ensemble of structures calculated and those of the corresponding geometric averages is always below zzso A, indicating that our protocol has an excellent degree of convergence and zzso The zzso between the backbone atoms of each of the six geometric average structures and the backbone of the corresponding crystal structures all range between zzso and zzso A, indicative of excellent accuracy and proving the authenticity of zzso zzso Moreover, without specifying any zzso angles, we found that in zzso of the zzso the most populated zzso of the side chains at positions and in the ensembles calculated were identical to those observed in the crystal zzso This shows that our simple approach, which is the simplest reported so far, can generate accurate results for the backbone and side zzso Finally, as a test case for a wider application of our approach in the field of structural zzso we describe the successful modeling of the overall structure of zzso and the organization of its zzso zzso layer known to play an important functional zzso
