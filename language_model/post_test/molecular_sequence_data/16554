zzso are drugs widely used in humans to treat zzso zzso act by zzso cholesterol synthesis resulting in the zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso that controls the expression of genes involved in cholesterol zzso zzso therapy also decreases plasma zzso and zzso fatty acid levels, but the mechanism behind this effect remains more zzso Liver fatty zzso protein zzso plays a role in the influx of zzso fatty acids into zzso Here we show that zzso is a target for zzso In rat zzso zzso treatment induced zzso zzso levels in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso promoter activity was induced by zzso zzso Progressive zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso element located at position zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a synergistic induction of zzso expression zzso and zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso This effect was also observed in zzso in zzso mice but not in zzso animals demonstrating the direct implication of zzso in zzso regulation by zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in a rise in zzso zzso levels both in zzso and in zzso and activated the mouse zzso promoter in a reporter zzso Altogether, these data demonstrate that zzso expression is zzso by statins through a mechanism involving zzso Moreover, zzso might be a zzso target zzso These effects might contribute to the zzso fatty zzso properties of zzso
