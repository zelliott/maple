A zzso zzso and zzso marine zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth occurred zzso at zzso degrees C, between pH zzso and zzso and with zzso % zzso Energy was zzso by the zzso zzso of a range of complex zzso carbohydrates and organic zzso or zzso by zzso reduction, nitrate reduction coupled to the zzso of organic carbon or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were facilitated by the presence of an organic carbon zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso The significant fatty acids were 16 : zzso summed feature 3 zzso : 0 zzso : zzso 16 : 0 and 18 : zzso Analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fits within the zzso cluster of the zzso zzso and is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso The degree of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso was 56 zzso The results of a zzso study indicated that strain zzso is a representative of a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The capacity for zzso reduction or zzso has not been demonstrated previously for this zzso
