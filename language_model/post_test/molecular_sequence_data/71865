The highly zzso rat zzso system was investigated at the gene zzso Two regions of the zzso zzso gene cluster from a zzso rat were zzso Four zzso Dash zzso clones carrying rat zzso zzso genes were localized on two distinct gene zzso A region of approximately zzso was found to contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso and another of approximately zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are considered to be active, coding the zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso and zzso are identical except for six zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso locus is a truncated zzso The putative promoter region of an zzso zzso gene is joined directly to the third zzso zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso as evidenced by several deletions located in the zzso regions of these zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibit extensive zzso but the restriction maps of these genes and their zzso regions differ zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses of the total liver DNA from six rats showed the existence of three zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that the two gene regions investigated are not zzso zzso but may be generated by block zzso This is the first report of the existence of zzso zzso zzso
