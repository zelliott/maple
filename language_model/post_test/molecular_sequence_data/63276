An zzso was isolated from several fish species in the USA (including healthy golden zzso that is not closely related to members of species zzso A, B and zzso The virus, which is zzso (does not cause zzso in cell cultures at neutral zzso was implicated in a winter zzso of grass carp zzso and has therefore been called 'American grass carp zzso zzso Complete zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso and comparisons to the other zzso showed that it is closely related to golden zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso identity in zzso and zzso However, comparisons with grass carp zzso zzso zzso and zzso salmon zzso zzso zzso showed only zzso to zzso zzso identity in different viral zzso These findings have formed the basis for the recognition of zzso and zzso as members of a new zzso species zzso zzso by zzso Further sequence comparisons to other members of the family zzso suggest that there has been an zzso zzso involving a change in the number of zzso zzso between the zzso (11 zzso and zzso (12 zzso zzso 7 of zzso encodes two zzso from two distinct zzso which are zzso of two zzso proteins zzso by zzso segments 9 and zzso A similar model has previously been reported for the zzso and zzso
