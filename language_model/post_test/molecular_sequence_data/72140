Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to genes required for viral zzso an unique set of zzso genes which may be part of viral mimicry and contribute to viral replication and zzso in zzso Among these, zzso encodes four open reading frames zzso that show zzso to the zzso factors of the zzso regulatory factor zzso zzso In this study we demonstrate that one of these zzso zzso encodes a protein with mobility of 18 zzso which has distinct pattern of expression and properties from the cellular zzso and the previously characterized zzso 

We cloned zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and studied its expression by Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso activities were tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We characterized its DNA binding specificity by zzso mobility shift analysis zzso and its zzso interactions by in zzso pull-down zzso 

Although low levels of zzso zzso can be detected in the zzso zzso tumor cell line, zzso zzso treatment does not stimulate expression of zzso gene together with primary zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso which can form zzso does not bind specifically to the zzso repeats corresponding to the zzso response element zzso but it does bind to the zzso B binding zzso The fusion protein generated from zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain stimulates zzso activity of zzso zzso which contains two zzso B sites, but does not stimulate the zzso zzso promoter, which contains only one zzso B zzso zzso between zzso zzso and cellular zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso was detected by in zzso binding zzso but no interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso part of zzso was also zzso In a transient zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene promoter in infected cells and zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso 

These results suggest that, by interacting with cellular zzso factors and zzso zzso may zzso the expression of the early inflammatory genes and potentially zzso the immune zzso
