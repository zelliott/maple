The zzso zzso is a zzso nuclear protein recognized by zzso from patients with zzso zzso It consists of two zzso of 86 and 70 zzso zzso clones zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were isolated by probing zzso zzso zzso zzso expression libraries with a zzso zzso specific for this zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso comprises zzso zzso acids and zzso to a protein with molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso determined by protein sequencing corresponded to the sequence deduced from the zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence contains a region with repeating zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso structure observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The largest zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso clones expressed fusion proteins zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso from patients with zzso zzso
