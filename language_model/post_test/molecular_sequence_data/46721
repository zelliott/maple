Green plants appear to comprise two sister zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or land zzso To gain insight into the nature of the ancestral green plant zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These two green algae are zzso members of the zzso This class is thought to include descendants of the earliest zzso green zzso We find that zzso and zzso zzso differ markedly in size, gene content, and gene zzso Of the green zzso zzso zzso so far, that of zzso zzso zzso is the most ancestral zzso zzso and occupies the zzso most zzso position within the zzso Its repertoire of 69 genes closely resembles that in the zzso of zzso zzso a later zzso zzso green zzso Three of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso have not been identified in previously zzso zzso of green algae and land zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso contains only 22 genes and retains few recognizably ancestral zzso In several respects, including gene content and rate of sequence zzso zzso zzso resembles the reduced zzso of zzso algae, with which it is robustly affiliated in zzso zzso Our results confirm the existence of two radically different patterns of zzso zzso evolution within the green zzso
