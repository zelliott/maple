zzso of human zzso with zzso of protein zzso C such as zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown previously to zzso the ability of zzso both to suppress formation of zzso and to stimulate zzso of zzso In the present study, we have examined whether the zzso caused by zzso can be attributed to the zzso of the alpha zzso of zzso a zzso regulatory protein implicated in several pathways of signal zzso zzso was found to promote the zzso of several proteins within zzso and intact zzso incubated with zzso and zzso zzso None of the zzso however, was zzso by either of two zzso containing zzso differing in zzso for zzso within zzso zzso despite zzso of a substantial fraction of the zzso zzso In contrast, other zzso containing zzso specific for the recently described zzso alpha or both zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of this protein occurred not only in response to zzso but to zzso and the zzso zzso analog zzso These data suggest that zzso of protein zzso C lead to the zzso within zzso of a select population of G alpha zzso The identified zzso is not zzso zzso but is similar or identical to zzso zzso Because zzso alpha does not contain the consensus site for zzso by the zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso the data also suggest that effects of zzso on processes otherwise sensitive to this toxin are not exerted at the level of G proteins responsible for zzso
