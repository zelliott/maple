The specific expression of zzso gene in eight different zzso of Beijing fatty chicken was investigated by zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was inserted into zzso zzso sites to construct zzso zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso method was used to zzso the zzso into Beijing fatty chicken zzso zzso The open reading frame of Beijing fatty chicken zzso gene was zzso base pairs in zzso which was expressed higher in liver and lung than in zzso This gene did not express in heart and zzso The expression efficiency ranged from zzso to zzso in 24, 48, and 72 h after zzso The green zzso mainly concentrated in the zzso With the increase of the expression of green fluorescence, zzso was observed in the zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses showed that zzso had been integrated into the zzso of Beijing chicken zzso cell with normal expression zzso In zzso condition, there was no significant effect zzso on zzso ratio, positive cell shape, growth and zzso state comparing with the control zzso This research established the foundation for further function research of zzso gene and application in transgenic animal zzso
