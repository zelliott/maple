The structures of the fourth zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso and its complex with the zzso of the Lewis b human blood group zzso zzso are reported at high zzso The native zzso crystal is zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The space group is zzso with unit cell dimensions a zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso A with one zzso of the zzso zzso to 1 zzso in the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The native zzso structure was solved by the molecular replacement technique and zzso refined zzso and zzso The orientation of the zzso zzso in the complex was established from a zzso A difference map with zzso zzso and calculated phase angles from the native zzso Both the final native and complex zzso models consist of 1904 protein zzso zzso one zzso zzso one zzso zzso one zzso zzso and three zzso sugar zzso zzso to zzso In addition, the complex model has 47 zzso zzso zzso The two structures have 135 water molecules in common in addition to eight and nine unique water molecules in the native and complex structures, zzso The zzso zzso from ideal bond distances and angles are zzso A, zzso degrees and zzso A, zzso degrees, for the native and zzso zzso zzso The R index for all unique data from 8 to zzso A is zzso for the native zzso zzso and zzso for the complex zzso zzso The zzso structure of each zzso is similar to that of other zzso zzso but the zzso structure of the molecular zzso is different from that of any other zzso reported to zzso The zzso about the zzso zzso is zzso zzso (with 1 long zzso zzso and the zzso about the zzso zzso is zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to be important because they are zzso to each other and to groups that zzso the zzso zzso There are three zzso in the zzso zzso two involve zzso zzso one of which is zzso with other zzso zzso and the other is unique to zzso The two zzso zzso are located in the zzso site and are important for the specificity of the zzso The molecular recognition of zzso by zzso involves both polar and extensive zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
