zzso zzso zzso c is a naturally occurring protein that possesses an unusually zzso zzso that zzso zzso with a complicated solution chemistry which includes spontaneous zzso and poorly characterized zzso zzso For this reason previous studies of this typical member of the zzso zzso have been relegated to zzso proteins in which the 102 position has been zzso with most common changes involving zzso and zzso However, we have determined sequential zzso resonance assignments for the zzso native protein because it is the actual participant in zzso zzso electron transfer processes and because the zzso native protein should be the fundamental assignment zzso In addition to zzso resonance assignments for 97 of 106 zzso zzso we have also provided an extensive database of long-range zzso zzso of these zzso and a chemical shift index based upon zzso zzso has lead to identification of solution secondary structural elements that are consistent with the solid-state crystal zzso Although there is currently no efficient expression system that would facilitate isotope labeling of zzso zzso zzso we tried to assess the usefulness of future zzso experiments by using zzso zzso zzso experiments to zzso assign 35 zzso zzso
