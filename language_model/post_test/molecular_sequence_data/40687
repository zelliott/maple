This paper investigates species zzso within the zzso zzso species complex and explores its zzso and geographical zzso A combined molecular zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences is constructed and zzso characters are zzso While zzso zzso was originally described from North America, it has later been reported from all over zzso Therefore a worldwide sampling range was aimed at, including species exhibiting zzso affinities with zzso zzso The zzso analyses indicate that intercontinental zzso in zzso zzso is zzso Thirty strongly supported zzso are retrieved of which 18 are zzso identifiable zzso The group is elevated to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It includes, apart from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso nature of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso appears not affiliated with zzso zzso and this can be substantiated zzso No representatives are known from Europe, Africa or South zzso The high frequency of intercontinental sister relationships observed between America, Asia and the Australian region, suggests multiple migration and zzso events have occurred across zzso
