zzso 18 zzso a recently described zzso plays an important role in the zzso immune response, in particular through its ability to induce the production of zzso zzso We cloned pig zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cell line zzso using a reverse zzso chain reaction method with zzso derived from the human zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from pig zzso zzso encodes a 192 zzso zzso that exhibits 92, 90, 81, and zzso similarity to zzso from zzso dog, human, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso protein with zzso and zzso showed that zzso shares several characteristics with the zzso zzso family: the zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso zzso zzso site, and the presence of 12 predicted beta zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso gene on the short arm zzso of pig zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression in different zzso of zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the kidney and the zzso By contrast, we observed highly zzso expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso particularly in the small zzso indicating a potential role for zzso as a first line of host defense in the zzso zzso
