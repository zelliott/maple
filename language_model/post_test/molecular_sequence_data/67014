The zzso expression zzso system zzso is a powerful and versatile system for protein zzso which has many zzso However, a limitation of any zzso viral expression system, including zzso is that death and zzso of infected insect cells zzso protein zzso This results in interruption of protein production and higher production costs due to the need to set up new infections, maintain zzso cells, and produce pure viral zzso zzso methods to slow or prevent cell death while maintaining zzso zzso protein production could dramatically increase protein zzso Several approaches have been used to improve the zzso and increase the synthesis of functional zzso zzso enhancement of the zzso was obtained when various gene elements were added to the virus, zzso and zzso processing were zzso or protein integrity was zzso A gene family from the insect virus zzso zzso zzso zzso was discovered that delays zzso of zzso cells, thereby significantly enhancing zzso protein production in the zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso gene family, protein production in the zzso zzso zzso was increased by a factor of zzso to zzso by either zzso the zzso protein from a dual zzso or by providing its activity in trans by expressing the zzso protein from a zzso transformed cell zzso In sum, zzso is an enhancement of the existing zzso technology that markedly improves protein expression levels while reducing the cost of labor and zzso
