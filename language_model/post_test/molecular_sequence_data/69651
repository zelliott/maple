In a first experiment, groups of zzso and zzso were characterized zzso by the slopes of zzso lines fitted to yellow intensity settings from their zzso zzso In a second experiment, color normal male subjects were characterized by their 2 and 8 zzso zzso match zzso All subjects had been previously characterized genetically by the presence of the zzso acid zzso or zzso at position 180 on their L cone or zzso hybrid zzso zzso and color normal subjects with zzso had greater sensitivity to the red primary than did those with zzso zzso based on zzso results suggest that the substitution of zzso by zzso in the L cone zzso or zzso hybrid zzso produces a shift in zzso max of the expressed zzso toward shorter zzso by an amount varying between zzso and zzso zzso with the shifts in zzso max for the zzso being larger than those for the color normal zzso
