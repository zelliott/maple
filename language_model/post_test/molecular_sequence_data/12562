zzso zzso zzso shows zzso specific expression and consists of two zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A comparison between the human and mouse zzso zzso gene promoters revealed four highly zzso DNA regions, while the remaining sequence showed a low degree of zzso Two regions, alpha and zzso were earlier identified as protein binding regions in the mouse zzso promoter by using zzso zzso zzso The two new regions are located to the zzso start and to a DNA sequence about 40 base pairs downstream from the zzso zzso shift zzso using zzso zzso and competition with an zzso representing the terminal zzso zzso inhibitor element identified the start region as a zzso binding zzso zzso The zzso downstream region, called zzso also formed specific zzso complexes in gel shift zzso zzso studies, using synchronized cells zzso transformed by zzso zzso reporter gene zzso indicated that the zzso and the gamma elements together were necessary for cell zzso zzso promoter zzso Earlier published data, indicating zzso binding to the zzso zzso regions, could not be confirmed, suggesting that the zzso zzso element may function independent of zzso
