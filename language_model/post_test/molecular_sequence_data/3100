In the rice blast fungus zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate zzso formation and infectious zzso zzso Since zzso is zzso to the zzso and zzso genes that regulate the zzso factor zzso in zzso we functionally characterized the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A zzso chain zzso approach was used to isolate the zzso gene that is zzso to zzso zzso Four zzso deletion zzso were isolated by gene zzso No obvious zzso in zzso growth, zzso or zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso were zzso on rice and barley zzso In contrast to zzso zzso that did not form zzso zzso zzso produced typical zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso formed by zzso zzso failed to penetrate onion zzso zzso When zzso through wound sites, zzso zzso failed to cause spreading zzso and appeared to be defective in infectious zzso These data indicate that zzso may function downstream of zzso to regulate genes involved in infectious zzso zzso A zzso factor or factors other than zzso must exist in zzso zzso and function downstream from zzso for zzso zzso
