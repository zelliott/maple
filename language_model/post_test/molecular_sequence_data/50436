zzso zzso protein zzso can zzso linear viral DNA at a specific site near the ends and integrate zzso viral DNA into target zzso We have made a series of 43 zzso point zzso of human zzso virus type 2 IN and zzso zzso zzso proteins for the following activities: zzso zzso of viral DNA zzso zzso integration zzso zzso and zzso In general, the different activities were similarly affected by the zzso We found three zzso that zzso totally abolished IN zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas 25 zzso did not affect IN zzso A few zzso affected the different activities zzso Near the zzso zzso a zinc zzso sequence motif zzso is present in all zzso IN zzso Two zzso in this region zzso and zzso strongly inhibited donor cut but had less effect on strand zzso The central region of IN is most highly zzso between zzso zzso Three zzso in this region zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited in strand transfer but were inhibited less strongly in donor zzso zzso of zzso (to zzso zzso or zzso resulted in changes in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in interactions with target zzso We did not find a zzso in which one activity was lost and the others were zzso supporting the notion that IN has only one active site for the zzso of donor cut and strand zzso
