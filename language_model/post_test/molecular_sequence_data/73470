The proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 was found in a complex with zzso zzso of 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso and two novel proteins characterized zzso rat zzso and zzso both zzso oriented integral membrane zzso The complex appears to zzso zzso zzso interactions of proteins originating from distinct zzso since zzso 5, zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso whereas mouse zzso and zzso accumulate in the zzso zzso zzso interactions in the complex are dramatically rearranged by zzso zzso The complex consists of two or more zzso with some members zzso zzso and zzso 5) in common and others zzso and zzso mutually exclusively zzso We propose that these protein interactions determine zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso
