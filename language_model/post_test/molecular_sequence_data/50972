DNA sequences zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso were reconstructed from a zzso zzso product for expression in zzso zzso A synthetic DNA primer containing most of zzso III was fused to zzso IV sequences by means of zzso The fused product was then inserted into the novel zzso zzso by restriction and zzso This initial zzso construct was zzso in zzso form through use of a helper zzso and subjected to zzso zzso for the purpose of introducing additional coding sequences from zzso II and zzso The final construct zzso a fusion protein consisting of the zzso signal zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso and the soluble form of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing this construct produced a protein which was recognized by zzso zzso zzso in Western blots and which was zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso material was zzso with zzso to remove the zzso zzso Both the zzso form and the zzso form were shown to have zzso activity in a zzso cell zzso zzso
