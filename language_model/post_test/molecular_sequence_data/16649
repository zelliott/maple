zzso is one of the zzso zzso by zzso and regulates energy zzso associated with insulin sensitivity, suggesting a possibility of nutritional regulation of zzso gene zzso In this study, we showed that the zzso of zzso gene was induced 4-6 h after zzso of zzso Also, differentiated zzso zzso that were treated with high zzso expressed significantly increased zzso zzso zzso analysis using nuclear extracts from white zzso tissue revealed that zzso binding protein zzso and nuclear zzso zzso bound on the zzso region of the zzso zzso This region was critical for the activity of the zzso promoter as the deletion or zzso of this region markedly diminished the promoter activity to a zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso binding increased in both zzso animal and high zzso zzso zzso in an zzso mobility shift zzso suggesting that zzso is responsible for the dietary response of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated the binding of zzso and zzso in both mouse and differentiated zzso zzso and also that zzso binding increased in response to high zzso These findings demonstrated that zzso and zzso are critical for the regulation of the zzso expression in response to nutrients and in the course of zzso zzso
