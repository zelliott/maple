We have prepared novel DNA zzso zzso that contain all 64 symmetrical zzso zzso These were contained in two restriction fragments that were cloned into the zzso zzso zzso each zzso was also obtained in both zzso These fragments were used to assess the sequence binding preferences of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso We found that, although the zzso binds to most zzso steps, the affinity is affected by the zzso zzso The best binding sites contain the zzso sequence zzso although zzso is a better site than zzso zzso always is a poor binding site, especially zzso The binding to zzso is strongly dependent on the zzso zzso with good binding to zzso but none at all to zzso
