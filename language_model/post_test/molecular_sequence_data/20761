Down syndrome zzso children have a unique genetic zzso to develop zzso in particular, acute zzso leukemia zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The study of this genetic zzso with the use of zzso as a model of zzso has broad zzso to the understanding of leukemia in children zzso On the basis of the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso to begin zzso possible mechanisms by which these sequence zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a predominance of small zzso duplication, and base substitution zzso including zzso zzso and zzso This zzso spectrum points to potential zzso stress and zzso folate metabolism secondary to genes on zzso 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso as potential causes of zzso zzso Furthermore, DNA repair capacity evaluated in zzso and zzso patient samples provided evidence that the base zzso repair zzso is compromised in zzso zzso suggesting that inability to repair DNA damage also may play a critical role in the unique zzso of zzso children to develop zzso A model of zzso in zzso is proposed in which zzso is driven by zzso zzso and altered folate zzso that becomes fixed as the ability to repair DNA damage is zzso
