zzso zzso of zzso disease is primarily associated with a particular combination of and zzso zzso however, this does not fully account for the genetic zzso zzso the aim of this study was to examine whether zzso zzso zzso genes may be zzso genes in zzso zzso 

zzso class II typing was performed by zzso chain reaction amplification in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso were investigated by restriction zzso length zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso variable genes were compared between patients with zzso disease zzso zzso zzso and control patients zzso zzso zzso and relative risk zzso estimates were zzso The zzso was zzso for zzso C1 at zzso zzso for zzso zzso at zzso zzso for zzso B2 at zzso and zzso for zzso B at zzso showing no significant zzso Additionally, linkage analysis was performed in 23 zzso The zzso of odd scores for zzso disease zzso the zzso variable genes at zzso zzso and zzso showed no significant zzso 

These data suggest that the analyzed zzso variable gene segments V alpha zzso V gamma 11, and V beta 8 do not play a major role in zzso to zzso zzso
