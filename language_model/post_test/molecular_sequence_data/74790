zzso are zzso zzso well studied in zzso and found to be zzso zzso important in the fight against bacterial zzso zzso in fish have only recently been identified and little is known about their function and importance in the immune system of zzso In this study we have identified several novel zzso proteins in far related fish species such as Atlantic cod zzso zzso and Arctic zzso zzso zzso Atlantic cod was found to have at least three zzso genes of which two are nearly identical except for a zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The predicted mature peptides of cod were found to be unusual zzso made mainly of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and form a novel class of zzso zzso zzso in Arctic zzso and brook trout zzso zzso were found to have an zzso deletion in the zzso region of the zzso which would lead to the deletion of the predicted loop 2 of zzso and its adjacent zzso This is the first report of a deletion of a whole zzso in the family of the zzso zzso of fish with zzso bacteria caused an zzso of the expression of the zzso in Arctic zzso and Atlantic cod and indicates a role of these proteins in fish innate zzso
