zzso virus zzso is one of the most destructive honey bee zzso The virus causes failure to zzso and death in both larvae and adult zzso zzso analysis of zzso infected honey bees zzso zzso from five different provinces was carried out based on three zzso zzso one partial structural protein coding sequence and two zzso protein coding zzso zzso amplified by three specific primer pairs were aligned and compared with reference sequences deposited in the zzso zzso zzso alignments revealed a low level of sequence variation among Korean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regardless of the zzso regions studied or the geographic origins of the zzso Multiple sequence comparisons indicated that Korean zzso zzso are genetically closely related to Chinese and other Asian zzso Interestingly, the Korean zzso zzso showed a number of unique zzso and zzso acids that had not been observed in other published zzso Korean and other Asian zzso from the host zzso zzso and the zzso European and Japanese strains from the host zzso zzso showed differences in zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso This suggests that zzso exists among zzso strains isolated from different zzso zzso zzso between compared sequences was analyzed by zzso zzso software using the zzso zzso method with a zzso value of 1000 zzso zzso zzso were in agreement with previous studies, in which a distinct group of zzso was formed by UK and European zzso and another group was comprised of Asian zzso including strains that originated from China, Japan zzso India and zzso However, zzso based on a partial protein structural coding sequence grouped all Korean zzso zzso identified in zzso zzso as a separate zzso Our findings suggest that further study, including Korean zzso isolated from zzso zzso is zzso
