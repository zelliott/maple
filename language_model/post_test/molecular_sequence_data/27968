The zzso I core complex isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of eight zzso proteins of 18, 14, 12, zzso 9, zzso 5 and zzso zzso in addition to the zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of all these components were determined and compared with those of higher zzso Clearly, the zzso zzso component zzso to the protein which carries the zzso zzso centers A and zzso This protein is so poorly zzso by zzso that it has probably been overlooked in gel zzso zzso The 18, 14, 12 and 9 zzso components show appreciable zzso with respective zzso of higher plant zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso 5 and zzso zzso components do not zzso to any known proteins except that the sequence of the zzso zzso component matches an unidentified open reading frame zzso 42 zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso
