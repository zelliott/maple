A sensitive, zzso quantitative strategy has been developed for zzso zzso A structural database has been constructed that currently contains zzso parameters for more than 50 zzso enabling identification of zzso at the zzso zzso The database contains the structure, molecular weight, and both normal and zzso zzso zzso positions for each zzso These observed parameters reflect the mass, three-dimensional shape, and zzso of the zzso and, therefore, provide information relating to linkage and arm specificity as well as zzso zzso zzso the database was constructed by analyzing zzso released by mild zzso from bovine serum zzso synthetic zzso human zzso A, and serum zzso The structures of the zzso labeled zzso were determined from a combination of zzso data, mass zzso composition and mass fragmentation data, and zzso zzso This approach was then applied to human zzso zzso B and zzso zzso where 18 and 25 zzso were identified, respectively, and the parameters of these zzso were added to the zzso This approach provides a basis for the analysis of zzso quantities of zzso from normal levels of natural zzso
