zzso is a common problem of aging and results from a failure of zzso mechanisms to regulate osteogenesis and zzso zzso and human forms of zzso zzso bind to the transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and block their zzso activity in cell culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prominent serum zzso and a major zzso component of zzso bone in zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso and native serum protein have similar potency as zzso of osteogenesis in zzso rat bone zzso cell cultures zzso zzso bovine zzso also bound to zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso similar to native zzso Although zzso is required for osteogenesis in zzso the zzso also inhibited osteogenesis at zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso into the bone zzso cultures in the presence of 10 zzso zzso restored zzso whereas zzso of the same zzso into cultures with zzso zzso added zzso were zzso confirming the zzso nature of the zzso zzso zzso of osteogenesis by both zzso and the zzso proteins required their presence within the first 6 days of culture, well before zzso at zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that both zzso and high dose zzso suppressed expression of the zzso transcripts alkaline zzso zzso collagen type I, and bone zzso The suppression of osteogenesis by zzso and by high dose zzso was accompanied by the differentiation of an alternate cell lineage with zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso response to zzso suggests that overlapping zzso of zzso zzso and zzso regulate osteogenesis in zzso zzso
