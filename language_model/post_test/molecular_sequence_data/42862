We report the rapid generation of DNA zzso for several zzso zzso This method does not require any knowledge of the zzso and/or the molecular biology of the zzso zzso to be zzso The procedure is based on the generation of random amplified zzso DNA zzso fingerprints using zzso with an embedded restriction zzso The amplification zzso peculiar to one strain or common to two or more strains can be zzso zzso zzso and used as molecular zzso in zzso experiments for the detection and identification of zzso We have tested this methodology in the zzso zzso zzso by zzso the total DNA extracted from several zzso zzso We have used amplification bands with different specificity as molecular zzso in zzso experiments performed on amplified zzso zzso obtained have demonstrated the usefulness of this methodology for zzso Its use in microbial ecology studies as a general strategy to generate specific DNA zzso is also zzso
