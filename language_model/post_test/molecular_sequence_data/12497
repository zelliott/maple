zzso zzso and DNA zzso may be useful as zzso for zzso and other in zzso applications if convenient methods for zzso attaching zzso such as zzso can be zzso 

To zzso DNA with zzso we have used the zzso zzso zzso zzso developed zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso was used to label DNA with zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso each with a primary zzso attached to either 3' or zzso end with a zzso zzso on the opposite zzso The DNA was zzso with zzso by a zzso zzso with zzso by the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis showed that essentially complete zzso was achieved in both zzso The zzso zzso was zzso with zzso by zzso from zzso at labeling efficiencies of up to zzso and zzso with zzso zzso at up to zzso zzso After zzso the ability of the zzso to bind to zzso through the zzso zzso and to zzso with their complementary DNA in saline was retained for both zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of serum zzso showed a shift to zzso but not zzso to a high molecular weight, strongly suggesting serum protein binding in the former case zzso zzso weight degradation products were seen with zzso but not with zzso and may be related to the use of zzso zzso As a further measure of label stability, the zzso were bound to zzso magnetic beads and incubated in fresh 37 degrees C human zzso Less than zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso was lost in 24 zzso 

zzso zzso DNA can be zzso zzso with zzso by the zzso zzso without loss of zzso
