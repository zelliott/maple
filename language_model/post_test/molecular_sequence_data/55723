zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso but recent sequence analyses have shown that they are related to zzso zzso zzso Two models of zzso structure have been zzso Both models indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso zzso but the models differ in the designation of the third member of the zzso zzso which is assigned as either zzso or zzso To test the importance of these four zzso in the zzso activity of zzso of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso of the zzso family, single zzso acid zzso were introduced at each of the four zzso All of these zzso resulted in the reduction or zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso precursor protein expressed in zzso coli, suggesting that all of these zzso are essential for the zzso zzso The substitution of zzso with Ala abolished zzso activity while the zzso in which zzso was replaced with zzso retained reduced zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso Our results strongly support the proposal that zzso of zzso functions as a zzso analogous to zzso of zzso zzso zzso
