The target site for zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing multiple terminal zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso zzso containing a single zzso attached to the reducing end were used as zzso for human milk zzso to prepare zzso zzso zzso beta zzso alpha zzso terminated zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and examined for their zzso and zzso in zzso The liver was the major target site in mice at 30 zzso which accumulated zzso of the dose for zzso zzso compared with zzso for a zzso Gal zzso By comparison, zzso and zzso zzso accumulated in the liver with a targeting efficiency of 66 and zzso zzso The liver targeting of zzso was partially blocked by zzso with either zzso or zzso whereas zzso zzso targeting was only reduced by zzso with zzso In contrast to these results in mice, in zzso experiments performed in rats established that both zzso and Gal terminated zzso target the liver with nearly identical efficiency zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso in mice zzso recognize zzso zzso over Gal zzso whereas little or no differentiation exists in zzso zzso the mouse zzso zzso apparently possesses additional binding pockets that accommodate a zzso zzso when presented as zzso
