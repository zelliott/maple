The propensity of zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso to delete a segment of zzso 9 has provided zzso information that has allowed us to identify a gene necessary for zzso It has been termed the zzso asexual gene zzso zzso encodes at least nine zzso and is expressed in blood zzso The zzso profile of the predicted zzso protein identifies up to four zzso zzso We show here that targeted gene disruption of zzso zzso zzso to zzso melanoma cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso gene product reacted with a zzso of 220 zzso in the parental malaria clone but not in clones with a disrupted zzso zzso
