To investigate the possible role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cadmium zzso tolerance in zzso zzso larvae, a new zzso zzso zzso gene was identified and cloned from zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso consisted of an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso a protein of 76 zzso zzso with 21 zzso zzso and a zzso structural pattern zzso at the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed about zzso identity with previously published zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the expression level of zzso zzso at different zzso zzso zzso stages under zzso exposure zzso zzso showed that zzso could induce the expression of zzso zzso in the larvae, and the expression level increased zzso and zzso in zzso larvae and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the stressed larvae revealed that zzso was zzso in almost all of the soft parts at the zzso and zzso zzso whereas it was only zzso in the zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activities of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also were measured in larvae at different zzso zzso Increased zzso activities were detected mainly in zzso larvae and zzso under zzso stress, suggesting that these zzso respond zzso with zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso played important roles in zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso zzso
