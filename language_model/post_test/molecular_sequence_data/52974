The cell surface molecules zzso and zzso greatly enhance the sensitivity of zzso zzso recognition, acting as zzso by binding to the same major zzso complex zzso molecules as the zzso zzso zzso Here we use surface zzso resonance to study the binding of zzso to class I zzso zzso zzso bound the classical zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a range of affinities distinctly lower than that of zzso zzso We suggest such affinities apply to most zzso class I zzso interactions and may be optimal for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso bound both zzso and zzso with a significantly lower affinity zzso zzso consistent with the finding that interactions with these zzso are unable to mediate zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso bound normally to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 150 zzso but only zzso to the natural killer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that variation in zzso binding affinity can be explained by zzso acid differences within the zzso zzso Taken together with zzso studies, these results indicate that subtle zzso changes in the zzso exposed zzso domain loop zzso zzso can account for the differential ability of both classical and zzso class I zzso molecules to bind zzso
