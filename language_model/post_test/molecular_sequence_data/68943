To determine whether certain zzso zzso participate in zzso zzso wound healing, the authors used the zzso chain reaction to detect different zzso patterns of the zzso segment of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cornea of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso from rat cornea with total zzso were amplified with various sets of synthetic zzso zzso 

The authors detected both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso wound zzso The zzso of zzso expression of both total zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso an initial decrease was followed by an increase at 45 minutes, a second increase at 2 hours, and a third increase at 4 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso not found in normal zzso also was detected during zzso 

The expression of total zzso zzso and both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso during zzso zzso wound zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso during wound healing, a zzso zzso that was highly expressed in embryonic zzso suggests that this zzso zzso is involved functionally in zzso wound zzso
