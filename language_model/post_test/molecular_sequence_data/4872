We report a case of zzso zzso in a Pakistani child whose zzso express less than zzso of the normal amount of zzso zzso on their zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of the patient's zzso and zzso genes showed an zzso in zzso 4 of the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the patient was zzso for a T zzso G zzso substitution in this zzso resulting in the replacement of a highly zzso zzso at position 117 with zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso in zzso cells confirmed the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso substitution and showed that it resulted in the zzso retention of zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso at position 117 indicated that, although the smaller zzso zzso acid Val could be zzso for the zzso zzso the larger zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso or the charged zzso acids zzso and zzso were not zzso These studies indicate that zzso in zzso plays a critical role in attaining the correct folded zzso of zzso zzso These studies also suggest that the zzso side chain of zzso is likely folded into the interior of zzso where it serves to stabilize internal packing of the protein and determines its overall zzso
