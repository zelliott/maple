Plants can sense the direction of gravity and change the growth orientation of their zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms of gravity perception and the signal zzso of zzso we have characterized a number of shoot zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso shows reduced zzso in the zzso stem but its root and zzso have normal zzso zzso encodes a zinc finger protein with a zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein is localized in the nucleus of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may act as a zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression under the control of the zzso promoter revealed that zzso is mainly expressed in the zzso the zzso tissue in zzso zzso Furthermore, the observation that zzso expression of zzso using the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso restores shoot zzso indicates that it could function in the zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso reported zzso almost all zzso in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso in the direction of zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso may be involved in an early event in shoot zzso such as gravity perception and/or a signaling process subsequent to zzso zzso as a putative zzso factor in zzso zzso
