It is generally assumed that zzso fragments derived from zzso proteins are either zzso or adopt zzso secondary structures, in particular zzso which are similar to those occurring in the early stages of protein zzso Since the structured zzso of short peptides are zzso zzso zzso is often used to stabilize zzso To examine the folding process of zzso we zzso three fragments of zzso corresponding to two zzso and one zzso region, and examined their zzso by circular zzso and nuclear magnetic zzso These regions were chosen because, according to secondary structure zzso all three should have high zzso zzso In zzso solution, the three peptides had only a little ordered structure, but when zzso was added, they exhibited marked zzso zzso as also observed for the whole zzso of zzso These results indicate that the intrinsic zzso propensity of a zzso zzso zzso by the addition of zzso is not necessarily related to the secondary structure in the native zzso The results further suggest a case of zzso protein folding model, in which non-native structures may be involved in the early stage of zzso
