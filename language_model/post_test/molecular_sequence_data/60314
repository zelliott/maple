zzso has been shown to contribute to zzso inflammatory processes during zzso Prior work from this laboratory has demonstrated that zzso zzso also is required for the zzso production of zzso in zzso smooth muscle cells, a normal, zzso process that occurs zzso during zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso of the zzso gene in these cells, we isolated and characterized zzso zzso of the zzso region of the rat zzso zzso zzso and primer extension identified a single zzso start site and multiple potential regulatory zzso including a zzso box at - 30 zzso a zzso box at - 74 zzso and a zzso zzso site at - 9 zzso This zzso DNA exhibited low zzso promoter activity that was zzso by zzso zzso promoter activity was unaffected or induced by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso This occurred despite the ability of both of these hormones to markedly decrease zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a strong zzso in the region between - 147 and - 98 zzso removal of this sequence resulted in a fivefold higher zzso promoter activity that was still zzso zzso zzso promoter activity appeared to reside between - 97 and - 22 zzso zzso of this promoter region, which contained the zzso and zzso boxes and an zzso site, resulted in decreased zzso zzso activity to the low level seen in larger zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso activity was zzso at least in part, by the zzso zzso site at - 9 zzso This site is located within a larger extended zzso zzso zzso that together effects both the zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso
