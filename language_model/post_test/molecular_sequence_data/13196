An analysis of the initial zzso step in the destruction of target cells by zzso zzso T zzso zzso shows that a relationship in the form of the law of mass action can be used to describe interactions between zzso receptors on T cells zzso and their natural zzso on target cells zzso zzso protein complexes, termed zzso zzso even though these zzso are confined to their respective cell zzso For a designated level of zzso and zzso affinities below about 5 X zzso zzso the product of the required number of zzso complexes per target cell zzso zzso and zzso affinity for zzso complexes is zzso therefore, over this range zzso affinities can be predicted from zzso zzso (or vice zzso At higher zzso affinities zzso zzso the zzso density required for zzso zzso reaches a lower limit of less than 10 complexes per target zzso
