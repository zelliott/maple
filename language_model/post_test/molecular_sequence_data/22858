zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disease characterized by progressive depression of zzso zzso function and zzso zzso Thirty percent of zzso patients belong to the inherited genetic zzso the rest may be zzso zzso zzso or zzso associated with a viral zzso zzso in zzso and cellular immunity have been described in cases of zzso and zzso A number of zzso against cardiac cell proteins have been identified in zzso In this study, we have zzso the zzso repertoire of plasma from zzso patients against a human protein array consisting of zzso zzso zzso human proteins and performed qualitative and quantitative validation of these putative zzso on protein zzso to identify novel putative zzso specific zzso In addition to analyzing the whole zzso zzso repertoire, we have also analyzed the zzso zzso repertoire in the plasma samples to study the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso By combining screening of a protein expression library with protein zzso technology, we have detected 26 proteins identified by the zzso zzso repertoire and 6 proteins bound by the zzso zzso Several of these zzso found in plasma of zzso patients, such as the zzso against the zzso zzso zzso are associated with heart zzso
