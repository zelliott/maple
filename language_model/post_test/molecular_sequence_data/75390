zzso sequences are a zzso family of long, zzso repetitive zzso present as approximately zzso copies dispersed throughout the zzso The full-length zzso sequence is zzso zzso but the majority of zzso elements are truncated at the zzso end, resulting in a fivefold higher copy number of 3' zzso The zzso sequence of zzso elements includes an zzso 3' end and two long open reading frames zzso and zzso the second of which encodes a potential zzso having sequence zzso with the reverse zzso This structure suggests that zzso elements represent a class of zzso zzso A number of zzso complementary zzso including a nearly full-length element, have been isolated from an zzso zzso cell zzso We now report insertions of zzso elements into zzso 14 of the factor VIII gene in two of 240 unrelated patients with zzso zzso Both of these insertions zzso and zzso zzso zzso contain 3' portions of the zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and create target site zzso of at least 12 and 13 zzso of the factor VIII zzso In addition, their zzso sequences following zzso are nearly identical to the consensus sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that certain zzso sequences in man can be zzso presumably by an zzso zzso and cause disease by zzso zzso
