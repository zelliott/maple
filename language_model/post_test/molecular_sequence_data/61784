Recently, we described the identification of a novel zzso nuclear zzso protein 80 zzso which is highly expressed in zzso and appears to have a role in regulating gene zzso To identify proteins interacting with this zzso we performed zzso zzso screening using full-length zzso as zzso This screen identified one zzso clone zzso a novel zzso protein zzso referred to as zzso zzso encodes a basic protein with a mass of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is highly zzso zzso between mouse and zzso The mouse and human zzso genes map to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso zzso was highly restricted to the zzso and temporally regulated during zzso zzso zzso zzso was greatly induced between Day 21 and Day 25 of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso signal for zzso zzso was strongest in sections of zzso zzso at stages zzso of zzso consistent with the conclusion that zzso is most highly expressed in round zzso Study of zzso expression in several zzso zzso of zzso cells confirmed maximum levels of expression in round zzso zzso zzso expression was absent in zzso from vitamin zzso mice, which do not have any round zzso and was reduced in zzso zzso mice, which have lowered numbers of round zzso in their zzso These results indicate the possibility that zzso protein plays a role in the zzso phase of germ cell zzso zzso contains two putative nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the cellular zzso showed that the green fluorescent zzso fusion protein localized to both zzso and zzso After deletion of zzso but not zzso zzso localized solely to the zzso indicating a role for zzso in the nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso suggests a nuclear function for zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso form a complex in intact zzso
