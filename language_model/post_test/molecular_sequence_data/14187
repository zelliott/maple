zzso markers facilitate both zzso zzso essential for modern animal and plant zzso and the isolation of genes based on their map zzso zzso in sequencing technology have made possible the identification of single zzso zzso zzso for any zzso zzso Here a sequence based zzso zzso marker technology for generating molecular markers for targeted zzso regions in zzso is zzso 

A zzso zzso coverage sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by applying zzso sequencing by synthesis zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence with the assembled zzso zzso zzso sequence identified putative single zzso zzso zzso throughout the entire zzso Multiple 75 base pair zzso sequence reads containing zzso and originating from individual zzso DNA molecules were the basis for developing zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso supported by transcript sequences or sequences from multiple zzso zzso were compared to the respective zzso sequences to identify possible restriction zzso zzso site zzso Small zzso zzso amplified from both zzso were zzso with suitable restriction zzso and resolved on a gel to reveal the sequence based zzso By applying this technology, 21 zzso markers for the marker poor regions of the zzso map representing zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso marker technology described here allowed the development of molecular markers for targeted zzso regions of zzso It should facilitate isolation of zzso molecular markers for targeted zzso regions of any animal or plant species, whose zzso sequences have been zzso This technology will particularly facilitate the development of high density molecular marker zzso essential for cloning genes based on their genetic map positions and identifying tightly linked molecular markers for selecting desirable zzso in animal and plant breeding zzso
