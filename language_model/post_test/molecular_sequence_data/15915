A number of genes zzso proteins involved in zzso and translation are clustered between 68 and 69 minutes on the zzso coli zzso map and are transcribed zzso as two zzso the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and about a zzso further zzso the zzso and zzso zzso The DNA sequence between zzso and zzso was determined and two open reading frames were detected which code for proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a relatively strong expression of zzso whereas zzso was zzso more zzso An overlap of the termination zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso suggests that translation of zzso and zzso may be zzso zzso zzso mapping of in zzso transcripts between zzso and zzso provided no evidence for major promoters but detected a moderately efficient zzso zzso between zzso and zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso are expressed as part of the zzso zzso but that some zzso read through into the zzso zzso also occurs, zzso functionally linking the expression of these two complex zzso
