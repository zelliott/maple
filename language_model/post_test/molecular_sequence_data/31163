From a zzso zzso zzso expression library derived from zzso of the asexual blood zzso we isolated and zzso five different zzso clones whose predicted protein products were unusually rich in zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso contain tandem zzso repeated sequences based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The other three, zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso contain stretches of zzso varying in length from 2 to 26 zzso zzso of DNA zzso experiments with the individual zzso sequences as zzso suggest that each of the five clones zzso to a different zzso zzso zzso The fragments of zzso zzso proteins expressed by the zzso clones shared zzso zzso zzso which were present on multiple zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments, zzso monkey zzso selected for binding to the zzso expressed by clone zzso zzso or zzso reacted with the expressed proteins from all 5 zzso and with at least 10 proteins from zzso infected zzso The zzso zzso could be modeled by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose sequence was based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose sequence was based on the zzso repeat of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that bound to each zzso were selected from zzso of immune monkeys that had never been exposed to zzso The selected zzso bound all 5 expressed proteins in zzso zzso and also bound to several proteins from zzso zzso Such cross zzso between the zzso repeating unit and several zzso zzso has not been previously zzso
