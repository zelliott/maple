zzso acid has been used clinically for over 40 years in the treatment of zzso producing a desirable zzso of a range of cardiovascular risk factors, including a marked zzso of high density zzso and a reduction in zzso The precise mechanism of action of zzso acid is unknown, although it is believed that zzso of a zzso zzso zzso may zzso zzso available information on the tissue distribution of zzso acid zzso we identified candidate orphan zzso The selected orphan receptors were screened for responses to zzso acid, in an zzso for zzso of zzso zzso Here we describe the identification of the G zzso zzso zzso as a low affinity zzso for zzso zzso We then describe the subsequent identification of zzso in follow-up zzso searches and demonstrate that it acts as a high affinity zzso for zzso acid and other compounds with related zzso The discovery of zzso as a molecular target for zzso acid may facilitate the discovery of superior drug molecules to treat zzso
