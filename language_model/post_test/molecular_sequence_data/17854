Substances which regulate expression of nerve growth factor zzso were examined in embryonic rat zzso cultures containing both zzso and zzso zzso Both cell types expressed zzso zzso when cultivated in zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso beta evoked a similar increase in zzso zzso which was accompanied by a rise in zzso zzso The zzso increase was partially blocked by zzso suggesting that zzso might mediate this zzso Treatment of the cultures directly with zzso zzso resulted in elevated levels of both zzso zzso and zzso Thus, agents which promote inflammatory activity appear to increase zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso of zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso Our observations indicate that a variety of zzso regulate zzso expression in the zzso
