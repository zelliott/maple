Expansion of zzso treatment programs have led to the growing concern for the development of zzso drug zzso The aims were to assess the prevalence of drug resistant zzso zzso and to identify circulating zzso among zzso zzso Plasma specimens from zzso zzso zzso adult were collected between March 2008 and August 2010 and viral zzso were extracted for zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were protein aligned and checked for transmitted drug resistance zzso zzso reconstruction and zzso analysis were performed to determine the zzso Based on the WHO consensus guidelines, none of the recruited patients had any transmitted drug resistance zzso When analyzed against the Stanford guidelines, zzso of patients had at least one reported zzso that may reduce drug zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The commonly detected zzso that may affect current first line therapy was zzso zzso which may lead to reduced zzso to zzso The zzso circulating zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The prevalence of unique zzso forms zzso was zzso five distinct zzso structures involving zzso and zzso zzso were observed, among them a cluster of three zzso that could form a novel circulating zzso form zzso zzso zzso drug resistance prevalence among zzso patients was low in this cohort of patients in zzso zzso despite introduction of zzso 5 years zzso zzso to the high genetic diversity, continued molecular surveillance can identify the persistent emergence of zzso zzso and novel zzso with significant zzso zzso
