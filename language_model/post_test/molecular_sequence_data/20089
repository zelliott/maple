zzso ozone pollution is described as having major negative effects on plants, compromising plant zzso zzso metabolism is especially zzso In the present work, the effects of chronic ozone exposure were evaluated at the zzso level in developing leaves of young zzso plants exposed to 120 zzso of ozone for 35 zzso zzso proteins zzso intrinsic membrane zzso were extracted from leaves after 3, 14 and 35 days of ozone exposure, as well as 10 days after a recovery zzso zzso zzso 4 to 7) were analyzed by zzso zzso experiments, followed by zzso zzso Additional observations were obtained on growth, zzso formation, and leaf zzso zzso Although treated plants showed large zzso spots and zzso in mature leaves, growth decreased only slightly and plant height was not zzso The number of zzso leaves was higher in treated plants, but new leaf formation was not zzso A decrease in zzso and zzso contents was zzso A large number of proteins involved in carbon metabolism were zzso In particular, proteins associated with the Calvin cycle and electron transport in the zzso were zzso In contrast, proteins associated with zzso zzso increased in response to ozone zzso Other identified zzso are associated with protein zzso nitrogen metabolism and zzso zzso
