Many zzso peripheral zzso have zzso zzso zzso zzso that generate zzso rhythms thought to be important for the daily timing of zzso zzso The extent of zzso gene regulation in peripheral zzso is zzso and to what degree zzso regulation in different zzso involves common or specialized pathways is zzso Here we report a comparative analysis of zzso gene expression in zzso in mouse liver and heart using zzso zzso representing zzso zzso We find that peripheral zzso gene regulation is extensive zzso or zzso zzso of the genes expressed in each zzso that the zzso of zzso zzso in the two zzso are markedly different, and that very few genes show zzso regulation in both zzso This specificity of zzso regulation cannot be accounted for by zzso gene zzso Despite this zzso the zzso genes in liver and heart participate in zzso extremely diverse zzso A core set of 37 genes with similar zzso regulation in both zzso includes candidates for new clock genes and output zzso and it contains genes responsive to circulating factors with zzso or zzso zzso
