zzso zzso from zzso zzso was efficiently expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso After introduction of restriction sites by zzso the zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso fused behind the zzso zzso 10), zzso and zzso zzso This resulted in expression at 30 degrees C up to 38 and zzso of the total soluble cellular protein with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression under control of the zzso promoter was below zzso of the soluble cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into inclusion bodies was found during growth at 37 degrees C but not at 30 degrees zzso zzso were also formed from intact zzso upon incubation at 37 degrees C of cells or crude extracts containing active mature zzso The high level of expression resulted in a short zzso procedure in which zzso zzso highly enriched zzso zzso was obtained from an zzso zzso For the production of zzso DNA an zzso origin was introduced in the zzso expression zzso
