During the development of selective peptides against highly zzso targets, a reliable tool is sought that can predict information on both mechanisms of binding and relative zzso These tools must zzso be tested on known zzso before application on novel therapeutic zzso We therefore present a comparative zzso protocol in zzso using critical zzso and use it to zzso the various selectivity zzso of several major zzso scorpion toxin families versus zzso zzso and zzso By zzso results across toxins of similar zzso a comprehensive set of functional zzso can be zzso zzso models of zzso interactions can be then drawn that are consistent with known zzso and zzso Without biological information on the interaction, zzso reproduces mechanisms underlying the universal binding of zzso zzso and zzso selectivity of zzso zzso The addition of constraints encouraging the critical zzso zzso zzso these zzso and gives analogous explanations for other families, including models of partial zzso in zzso While zzso zzso the zzso scoring function is not yet zzso for accurate zzso False zzso in zzso complexes often resemble true binding in zzso complexes, despite zzso penalties apparent from visual zzso This contamination zzso zzso energetic analysis, although it is usually possible to obtain correct ranking via careful interpretation of zzso characteristics and elimination of false zzso Aside from adaptations to the broader zzso channel family, we suggest that this strategy of comparative zzso can be extended to other channels of interest with known structure, especially in cases where a critical motif exists to improve zzso zzso
