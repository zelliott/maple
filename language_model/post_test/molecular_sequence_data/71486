zzso zzso zzso zzso from fetal cartilage zzso the zzso synthesis of zzso and inhibited the growth of vascular zzso cells in zzso The human counterpart of this bovine growth regulating factor has not been zzso We report here the cloning of human zzso precursor zzso and its functional expression in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso We first identified a zzso DNA zzso which zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso and then isolated human zzso zzso from zzso tissue by zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that mature human zzso consists of 120 zzso zzso In total, 16 zzso acid zzso were zzso in the human zzso compared to the bovine zzso Almost of all the zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso domain (from zzso to zzso the zzso acid sequence was identical except for zzso indicating a functional significance of the zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso indicated a specific expression of zzso zzso in zzso We also successfully determined the zzso zzso of zzso zzso using a specific zzso against zzso human zzso Multiple zzso of the precursor zzso into zzso cells enabled us to isolate the mature form of human zzso from the culture zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso synthesis in cultured zzso In contrast, it inhibited the tube zzso of cultured vascular zzso cells in zzso and zzso in chick zzso membrane in zzso
