The characterization of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso natural zzso revealed zzso zzso A Hill zzso of zzso indicates that the zzso exists as a zzso zzso that shows zzso A mild form of zzso with high zzso levels has been linked to zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso We have now cloned and expressed two zzso forms of the protein based on a patient's DNA zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso zzso reveal a zzso decrease in zzso but no change in zzso zzso 5 zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is not involved in zzso zzso Its replacement by zzso possibly causes a zzso change in the active zzso Like the zzso zzso this zzso is heat stable and forms a zzso The zzso to zzso of zzso however, is markedly increased in zzso compared with the zzso zzso We have also observed a decrease in the expression levels of zzso protein in zzso zzso cells, which could be due to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso termination could not be completely zzso and characterized due to minute levels of expression and its extremely low zzso as a fusion zzso No zzso activity was detected in crude extracts from transformed bacteria or zzso zzso zzso Considering the decrease in specific activity and stability of the zzso we conclude that the patient probably has less than zzso residual zzso activity, which could be responsible for the mild zzso and the high zzso zzso
