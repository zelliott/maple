To zzso the mechanisms by which dietary factors influence the risk of colon cancer, we investigated the effect of select dietary fats and fibers on zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and saline zzso rats were fed diets containing either corn oil or fish oil (15 zzso zzso and either cellulose or zzso (6 zzso zzso and killed at two time points (15 and 37 zzso in a 2 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso levels were determined using zzso and relative competitive zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso protein levels compared with the saline controls at both time points, and this suppression was partially blocked by fish oil feeding at 15 zzso and zzso at 37 zzso Also, at 15 zzso zzso rats fed corn oil had higher levels of membrane zzso zzso relative to the other treatment zzso Overall, expression of zzso zzso zzso was not correlated with differences in the respective zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso effects of dietary fish oil and zzso are associated with the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso
