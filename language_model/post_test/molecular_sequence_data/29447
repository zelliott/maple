The human zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso and zzso activities of type I zzso zzso This zzso is comprised of zzso zzso and zzso the latter exhibiting zzso affinity for zzso Here the zzso domain of zzso zzso a soluble 25 zzso zzso zzso and its complex with zzso 2 were studied using zzso zzso zzso is comprised of two zzso zzso zzso connected by a zzso hinge zzso The deduced global fold was zzso to improve the alignment of zzso against structurally related receptors and to model its zzso A striking feature of zzso is the limited and localized zzso in chemical shifts exhibited upon zzso zzso observed for only zzso of its backbone zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of these zzso maps the zzso 2 binding site upon zzso to a zzso surface on the zzso domain, including the zzso loop zzso zzso the zzso loop and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and the hinge region zzso zzso The zzso domain contributes only marginally to zzso zzso and no change in the hypothesized zzso interface is zzso The proposed binding domain encompasses all zzso implicated by zzso studies in zzso zzso and suggests adjacent zzso cooperate in forming the binding zzso zzso experiments indicate that binding of zzso zzso tightening of the zzso domain of zzso This increase in zzso rigidity may play an important role in initiating the zzso stage of the zzso signaling zzso
