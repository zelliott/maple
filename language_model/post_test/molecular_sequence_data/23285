Selective zzso of protein zzso zzso is gaining importance as an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of a wide range of human zzso However, as extensively documented for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients, clinical resistance caused by zzso in the targeted zzso has been zzso Here, we look at how structural and zzso insights from zzso zzso have been exploited to identify second-generation drugs that override acquired target zzso These insights have created a rationale for the development of either zzso protein zzso zzso or cocktails of selective zzso as zzso drugs that combine increased therapeutic potency with a reduced risk of the emergence of molecular zzso
