zzso proteins zzso represent a major class of plant zzso zzso zzso and are components of cell walls and plasma zzso zzso are thought to play roles in cell zzso development, and zzso zzso Using a synthetic DNA zzso based upon an zzso acid sequence motif common to zzso from zzso rose, and carrot zzso zzso we have isolated and zzso the first zzso gene from a partial zzso tomato zzso library packaged in zzso zzso zzso The deduced 215 zzso acid protein contains zzso Ala, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and consists of two zzso zzso repeats and 16 zzso zzso repeats, consistent with known zzso zzso acid compositions and zzso zzso of the zzso sequence to a reverse transcribed zzso product and tomato zzso confirmed the zzso gene is expressed and contains one large intervening zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in tomato indicates this zzso gene is strongly expressed in stem and zzso moderately expressed in root and green fruit, and zzso expressed in leaves and red fruit as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also express this zzso however, this expression is not regulated by zzso More significantly, a zzso of zzso gene expression is observed in tomato zzso ranging from high levels of expression in young zzso to low levels of expression in old zzso zzso serves to zzso expression in young and old zzso Heat shock also affects zzso gene expression in stems by zzso zzso zzso zzso
