This paper reports the first spontaneous isolation of two DNA zzso zzso in the unique long zzso component of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso strain zzso zzso one zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso DNA sequences centered around zzso and the other zzso with a zzso zzso DNA zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso open reading frames zzso The zzso zzso is stable with the rare isolation of a wild type zzso zzso zzso presumably generated by the zzso of the duplicated sequences during zzso zzso Because of the zzso zzso duplication, zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso is present as one complete and one partial zzso Although zzso in the zzso zzso involved sequences from the zzso ORF, the virus produces an intact zzso gene zzso Both zzso show normal growth characteristics when compared with the parental zzso DNA zzso in these zzso suggest a link between replication and zzso in zzso
