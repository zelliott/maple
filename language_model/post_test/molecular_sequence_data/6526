In this paper we report a zzso zzso immune zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of all genes zzso zzso peptides during the immune response of zzso When challenged with bacteria, flies carrying this zzso show a lower survival rate than zzso zzso We also report that, in contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso remains zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso These results point to the existence of two different pathways leading to the expression of two types of target zzso zzso either the zzso peptides or the zzso zzso zzso
