The proteins zzso and zzso zzso to constitute the zzso factor zzso which is known to respond to treatment with zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso elements zzso zzso zzso zzso elements zzso are very similar to zzso and zzso proteins are similar in structure to zzso and zzso Thus, the two main signal zzso pathways have closely related nuclear zzso which could possibly overlap and/or zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso encodes both zzso and an zzso of the zzso zzso response by alternative zzso In this report we show that zzso zzso are able to block the zzso zzso zzso by zzso The mechanism by which this repression is obtained does not require zzso between zzso and the zzso and/or zzso zzso In contrast, we show that both zzso and zzso proteins zzso are able to bind zzso and therefore compete with zzso for this zzso zzso of the zzso domain in zzso does not affect the zzso zzso We also show that zzso does not affect the zzso function of zzso on zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso by the other members of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso is also zzso by zzso
