The functional roles of the zzso acid zzso of the zzso site in bovine zzso c zzso zzso were investigated by utilizing hybrid quantum mechanics zzso mechanics zzso zzso The energy levels of the molecular zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso unexpectedly increased, as compared with those found previously with a simplified model system lacking the zzso Met zzso zzso zzso This zzso of zzso energies stemmed from the formation of the zzso zzso which are generated by zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of the S and O atoms of the zzso zzso To clarify the roles of the zzso Met zzso the zzso reorganization energies of the zzso site were zzso with the Met zzso assigned to either the zzso or zzso zzso The reorganization energy slightly increased when the Met zzso was excluded from the zzso zzso The existing experimental data and the present structural modeling study also suggested that the zzso Met zzso moderately increased the zzso potential of the zzso zzso Thus, the role of the Met may be to regulate the electron transfer rate through the fine zzso of the electronic structure of the zzso zzso created by two zzso zzso coordinated to the zzso zzso This regulation would provide the optimum zzso zzso energy of the zzso site, and thereby facilitate the subsequent cooperative zzso such as the zzso pump and the zzso activity, of zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso in respiratory zzso
