zzso zzso coli zzso is a major cause of zzso illness in children less than 5 years of age in low- and middle-income nations, whereas it is an emerging enteric pathogen in zzso zzso Despite being an important cause of zzso little is known about the zzso composition of zzso To address this, we zzso the zzso of five zzso zzso obtained from children in zzso with zzso These five zzso represent distinct and globally dominant zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso analyses utilizing a zzso zzso alignment method demonstrated that zzso zzso strains share approximately zzso million bases of zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso confirmed the diverse history of the zzso zzso and provides a finer resolution of the zzso coli relationships than zzso sequence zzso No identified zzso regions were zzso exclusively in all zzso zzso however, we identified more zzso content zzso among zzso zzso than among zzso zzso coli zzso suggesting that zzso zzso share a zzso zzso Comparisons of known zzso and of zzso and colonization factor genes across all zzso zzso zzso not only identified zzso but also indicated that some zzso are restricted to the zzso zzso Overall, the generation of these five zzso zzso in addition to the two previously generated zzso zzso highlights the zzso diversity of zzso These studies increase our understanding of zzso evolution, as well as provide insight into zzso factors and zzso zzso which may be targets for vaccine zzso
