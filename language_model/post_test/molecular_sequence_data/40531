Depending on the molecular properties of the proteins of interest zzso the rate of success in displaying proteins on zzso particles is zzso zzso of zzso zzso structure in the zzso occasionally results in low level display on viral zzso Here we assessed the influence of different leader peptides on the display of a premature zzso folding zzso zzso repeat protein zzso via the minor coat protein zzso These peptides include the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso and zzso pathways were capable of displaying the protein on the viral zzso whereas the zzso zzso failed to do zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso efficiently directed zzso through its zzso without fusing with zzso Furthermore, the soluble form of zzso was detected in zzso coli zzso
