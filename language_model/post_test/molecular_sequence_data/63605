We introduce a new method for designating the location of zzso in folded protein structures based on the zzso convex zzso zzso of a point set of atomic zzso The zzso can be calculated with an efficient and zzso zzso 

We show that zzso zzso class contains information complementary to widely studied measures such as zzso accessibility zzso zzso depth zzso and to the distance of zzso from the zzso of the chain, the zzso exposure zzso zzso is more zzso for related structures across folds and zzso better with changes in zzso stability of zzso than the other zzso Further, we assess the predictability of these measures using three types of zzso zzso decision trees zzso zzso zzso and Learning zzso Systems zzso showing that zzso is more easily predicted than the other zzso As an zzso application of predicted zzso class (in combination with other zzso we show that zzso is potentially helpful in improving prediction of zzso contact numbers zzso
