zzso tuberculosis is the infectious agent giving rise to human zzso The entire zzso of zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso open reading zzso has been zzso The huge amount of information released from this project has facilitated zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso was applied to zzso derived from zzso tuberculosis culture zzso cell wall, and zzso resulting in the resolution of zzso zzso and 395 spots, respectively, in zzso zzso By zzso and zzso 38 culture zzso proteins were identified and zzso of which 12 were identified for the first zzso In the same manner, 23 cell wall proteins and 19 zzso proteins were identified and zzso with 9 and 10, respectively, being novel zzso One of the novel proteins was not predicted in the zzso project, and for four of the identified proteins alternative start zzso were zzso Fourteen of the culture zzso proteins were proposed to possess signal zzso Seven of these proteins were zzso and the zzso sequences obtained confirmed the zzso The data presented here are an important complement to the genetic information, and the established zzso PAGE maps (also available at: zzso provide a basis for comparative studies of protein zzso
