Current cardiovascular therapies are limited by the loss of zzso zzso and zzso The goal of this study was to develop a zzso hybrid zzso that combined the unique properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have interconnected zzso structures, but are hampered by a lack of surface zzso to control cellular zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso could zzso onto the surface of zzso zzso and zzso them with the characteristic properties of native zzso The zzso which comprised zzso zzso tails attached to functional zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso sites coupled to either zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso and zzso were successfully zzso and mixed in a zzso zzso ratio to obtain zzso zzso was reacted with pure NO to develop zzso which was then zzso onto zzso zzso to generate a hybrid zzso zzso Uniform coating of zzso PA zzso on zzso was confirmed by transmission electron zzso zzso NO release from zzso was zzso zzso and zzso showed significantly increased zzso of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso also showed significantly increased proliferation of zzso and reduced smooth muscle cell zzso zzso also displayed significantly reduced zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso and a collagen zzso These results indicate that this hybrid zzso has great potential application in cardiovascular zzso
