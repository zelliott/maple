zzso of zzso mice with zzso provokes symptoms similar to those seen in the disease zzso zzso To zzso the structural requirements for T cell recognition of zzso and to identify zzso features which might provide targets for zzso a panel of T cell zzso was generated after zzso of mice with the zzso zzso of the zzso alpha zzso The zzso genes expressed by these zzso were zzso zzso beta 6 was zzso zzso but other V beta genes were also zzso A zzso zzso zzso was present in all zzso regions, regardless of the V zzso The zzso alpha repertoire was somewhat skewed with three V alpha families accounting for zzso of the zzso The zzso of multiple T cell zzso V beta genes may contribute to the inability to inhibit zzso by elimination of V beta zzso T zzso
