The bank zzso is a zzso susceptible to different prion strains from humans and various animal zzso We analyzed the transmission features of different zzso in a panel of seven zzso species which showed various degrees of zzso affinity and specific prion protein zzso sequence zzso in order to investigate the basis of zzso zzso in comparison to other zzso zzso At first, we found a differential zzso of bank and field zzso compared to zzso and wood zzso zzso showed high zzso to sheep zzso but were resistant to bovine zzso zzso whereas zzso and wood mice displayed opposite zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was faster in zzso than in zzso and wood zzso Moreover, a zzso change was observed in zzso which was reverted upon back passage to zzso All strains zzso much faster in zzso than in mice after adapting to the new zzso zzso sequence comparison indicated a correlation between the transmission patterns and zzso acids at positions 154 and 169 zzso and S in mice, N and N in zzso This correlation was confirmed when zzso three additional zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and zzso mice with sheep zzso and zzso These zzso were chosen because zzso mice do have the zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso mice do not have zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso 154 and 169 drive the zzso molecular zzso and replication rate of prion strains in zzso This might have implications for the assessment of host range and molecular zzso of prion zzso as well as for the development of improved animal models for prion zzso
