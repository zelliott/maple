zzso New Zealand frogs of the zzso zzso are from a zzso lineage of extant zzso that release defensive zzso onto their skin when zzso Here, we characterize the gross anatomy and microscopic structure of the skin of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso light and transmission electron zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess zzso zzso zzso zzso as type I and II, based on their frequency and zzso traits, whereas the zzso zzso zzso lacks type I zzso This is the first report of differential zzso in zzso of the same zzso This zzso could be interpreted as an adaptation to different zzso or ecological needs of these zzso However, species within this ancient zzso share similar general zzso zzso with other zzso zzso a zzso unit containing storage zzso zzso by zzso zzso Type I zzso are zzso large and contain a homogeneous mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Type II zzso are round and contain larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of varying zzso Exposure to zzso causes the contraction of zzso cells, resulting in bulk discharge of type I zzso through the zzso duct onto the skin zzso zzso release of zzso from zzso zzso may be indicative of their functional zzso in zzso or zzso zzso Mass zzso techniques were used to de zzso sequence peptides present in the skin zzso of zzso zzso A total of 30 previously zzso peptides from zzso species were fully or partially zzso These peptides exhibited no similarity to any known zzso
