The members of the mechanistically diverse zzso zzso catalyze different overall reactions by using a common zzso strategy and structural zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso abstraction of a zzso adjacent to a zzso group zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transfer zzso by an zzso that also zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The realization that a member of the zzso zzso could catalyze a zzso transfer reaction, albeit poorly, led to a search for other zzso which might catalyze a zzso transfer as their zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso from zzso zzso proteins of previously unknown function, were discovered to be zzso zzso although they also catalyze the zzso of other zzso The values of zzso for zzso for both proteins are approximately zzso zzso zzso The zzso context and the zzso specificity of both zzso and zzso suggest roles in the metabolism of the zzso zzso of which zzso is a zzso zzso possessing zzso zzso activity have been identified in at least two other zzso
