A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso showing extensive zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso strain zzso was grouped in the zzso zzso most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Con zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities were found to the type strains of the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso All these species were grouped into a zzso cluster and showed very low sequence similarities zzso zzso to the type species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso system of strain zzso consists predominantly of zzso zzso The polar zzso profile exhibited the major compounds zzso zzso and zzso In addition, minor compounds of an unidentified zzso and an zzso were zzso No zzso were found in strain zzso which was consistent with the zzso profiles of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but in contrast to zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso acid of the zzso was zzso acid and the zzso pattern contained predominantly zzso and zzso The major fatty zzso which were zzso : 0, zzso : 0 and zzso : 0, supported the grouping of strain zzso in the family zzso The strain showed zzso similarities of 48 % zzso 47 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 31 % zzso 36 zzso to zzso zzso zzso and 29 % zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that strain zzso is a representative of a novel species, which can be differentiated from its closest relatives by zzso and zzso zzso Because of the low sequence similarity of strain zzso to zzso zzso which was shared by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their unique zzso patterns, we propose that strain zzso represents a novel species in a novel zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition we propose the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Con zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso
