zzso resistance genes in tomato zzso resistance to the zzso leaf pathogen zzso zzso Both the zzso resistance gene zzso and the related zzso gene zzso resistance to strains of zzso zzso that zzso the zzso protein and originate from the wild tomato species zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso are zzso and we have isolated and zzso the complete zzso cluster of zzso zzso zzso This zzso cluster harbors five full-length zzso zzso including zzso of the most zzso zzso of the zzso cluster and three central zzso zzso Two zzso genes zzso and zzso have an identical coding zzso whereas zzso differs at its 3' zzso From a detailed comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso and zzso genes from the zzso cluster are ancestral to the first zzso gene and that the three zzso genes were generated by subsequent zzso and zzso unequal zzso zzso Thus, the zzso cluster has undergone substantial zzso in the central region, but not at the zzso Using transient transformation zzso we show that all three zzso genes zzso zzso zzso but that zzso is likely the main zzso of zzso recognition in zzso
