zzso factor zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso whose members require the zzso of at least one internal zzso bond to attain an active zzso zzso also requires association with tissue factor zzso to attain full zzso zzso Without this, zzso has very low activity toward zzso and zzso zzso zzso of beta strands has been suggested to play a part in the zzso of zzso and their positioning is possibly important for the active zzso of zzso To scrutinize this hypothesis, we have designed zzso zzso which prevent beta strand movement and lock zzso in the alleged active zzso The zzso zzso alone or combined with the zzso zzso was introduced to alter the first of two zzso motifs in beta strand B2 and thereby prevent zzso Along the same line, zzso has a new zzso which would keep beta strand B2 in the registration of active zzso The zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso were indistinguishable from or lower than those of zzso zzso and none of the zzso displayed an altered exposure of the zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso Moreover, the affinities of zzso and native zzso for zzso increased to a similar extent upon incorporation of an active site zzso and the zzso activities were equally zzso by zzso In conclusion, we found no evidence that the zzso were in a more active state than native zzso Thus, the proposed beta strand zzso if part of the regulatory mechanism governing zzso activity, apparently does not suffice for the transformation of zzso into an zzso active zzso Our data raise the possibility that the structural differences between zzso zzso zzso and active zzso resemble those between zzso and zzso
