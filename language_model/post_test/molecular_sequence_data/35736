Type IV zzso zzso is a 70,000 zzso neutral zzso that specifically zzso type IV collagen in addition to degrading zzso collagen zzso It is zzso in a zzso zzso form that is converted zzso in the zzso space to a 62,000 zzso active zzso The primary structure, zzso properties as well as gene structure, demonstrate that type IV zzso is closely related with the other well characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the structure of type IV zzso differs from the others in that it is larger and contains three internal repeats that resemble the type II zzso of zzso Also, initial characterization of the promoter region of the gene indicates that its regulation differs from the other zzso zzso Type IV zzso is presumably required for the normal turnover of basement zzso zzso activity is linked with the invasive potential of tumor cells and the zzso is believed to play a major role in the penetration of basement zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity and zzso levels as well as zzso of a variety of tumor cells and zzso suggest that zzso for the zzso may have value in the follow-up of zzso zzso
