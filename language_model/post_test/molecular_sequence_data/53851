We have characterized the zzso sequences of the zzso heat shock protein zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from various zzso zzso of the zzso analysis revealed the presence of several genetically distinct species in the zzso zzso and eight distinct zzso within the species zzso zzso Some of the latter may represent cryptic zzso The zzso tree constructed from these sequences is in agreement with our previous results based on the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso The zzso species formed two major zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed the first major group, while zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight zzso of zzso zzso formed the second major zzso zzso variations were also observed between zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso The zzso gene provides another useful locus for zzso analysis of the zzso zzso
