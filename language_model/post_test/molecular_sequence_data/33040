Human zzso I zzso the initial and zzso step in the zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, this zzso has been shown to play a major role in the zzso development of bone and cartilage as well as in zzso processes such as systemic zzso zzso zzso or zzso Here, we report for the first time the identification and characterization of the zzso gene promoter region and important zzso factors involved in its zzso Members of the zzso protein 1 zzso and specificity protein 1 zzso family of zzso factors are necessary for the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso which was proven by zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and short interference zzso zzso A zzso zzso and 3' deletion of the predicted zzso promoter region, which lacks a zzso and/or zzso box, revealed that a zzso core promoter element is able to drive the zzso on a zzso zzso A binding site for zzso factors of the zzso family, which is essential for full promoter activity, was identified by zzso zzso located 730 zzso zzso of the translation initiation zzso The ability of this site to bind members of the zzso family was further verified by zzso mobility shift zzso A promoter element containing this binding site was able to drive the zzso to about zzso above control in zzso zzso zzso Our findings provide a first insight into the regulation of the zzso gene and may contribute to understanding the processes taking place during zzso zzso formation and zzso in health and zzso
