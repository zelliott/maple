zzso are widespread in the environment as a result of biological and industrial zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to the corresponding zzso and are often associated with zzso which catalyze the conversion of zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso have potential as zzso in zzso and zzso applications, and several successful examples demonstrate the zzso In this work a real-time zzso zzso was designed for the detection of zzso zzso zzso genes from environmental zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also designed for amplification and sequencing of the zzso zzso or highly zzso zzso zzso genes were detected from zzso of numerous zzso from geographically diverse sites, as were numerous novel zzso The genes were also detected from zzso of zzso not previously reported to zzso zzso zzso The results provide further evidence that many bacteria have acquired the genes via horizontal gene zzso The real-time zzso zzso should prove useful in searching for zzso zzso that could have novel zzso zzso and therefore potential in industrial zzso
