zzso elements zzso are zzso zzso zzso structures that specifically bind zzso iron regulatory proteins zzso zzso interactions mediate the coordinate zzso regulation of key proteins in iron zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso Depending on whether the zzso is located in the zzso or zzso region zzso binding of zzso will inhibit zzso translation or degradation, zzso Here we describe a new zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso b zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds in zzso to zzso and insect zzso with a high affinity equal to that of human zzso H chain zzso Under conditions of iron zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells shifts to a zzso zzso Moreover, translation of a human growth hormone zzso with the zzso zzso in its zzso is zzso in zzso zzso L zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso both in insect and zzso zzso This constitutes the first identification of a functional zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso represents the second example, after zzso zzso zzso of an zzso of the zzso acid cycle whose zzso possesses all necessary features for zzso regulation by cellular iron zzso
