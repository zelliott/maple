The sequences of the zzso DNA zzso segment containing the two zzso regions were determined for six species belonging to the zzso zzso species group and compared to the corresponding segments of zzso species which had been studied zzso We found remarkable differences in the evolutionary rates of the two zzso zzso The zzso I region, which lies between the zzso and the zzso zzso was found to be highly zzso in terms of both size (30 zzso and zzso sequence among the species zzso In contrast, the sequences of the zzso II region, which lies between the zzso and the zzso zzso showed considerable zzso The size of the zzso II region ranged from 0 to 88 zzso and accurate alignment was possible only among sequences from geographical strains or very closely related species in the zzso species zzso The observed differences in conservation of the two zzso zzso regions are discussed in light of functional constraints on zzso zzso
