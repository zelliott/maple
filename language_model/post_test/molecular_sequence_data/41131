zzso zzso zzso is composed of an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso was detected with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a bacterial zzso zzso zzso BY zzso have been demonstrated in the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance, stress response, and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed mainly in the growth phase and early stages of zzso body zzso When cultured in zzso medium at high temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced maximum cell density as compared to the wild zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso cells formed zzso bodies and spores about 24 h later than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso yellow zzso during zzso Also, zzso zzso showed a decrease in zzso production when compared with the zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso may play multiple roles in zzso zzso zzso
