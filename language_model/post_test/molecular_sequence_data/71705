The zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso in 25 zzso each from 22 specific zzso zzso dogs zzso infected with zzso zzso by tick exposure and from five zzso control zzso Using zzso specific for a zzso region of the human and canine zzso zzso and canine zzso zzso we isolated and partially zzso canine zzso A sequence of 1775 bases was obtained and zzso specific for canine zzso zzso constructed to investigate the expression of zzso in dog zzso in response to infection with zzso zzso In 12 out of 22 dogs infected with zzso zzso acute zzso occurred within zzso days after infection whereas the other 10 dogs showed no or only mild clinical signs despite persistent infection up to Day zzso The numbers of zzso zzso zzso in dogs with acute zzso were significantly higher than in dogs without zzso while zzso dogs showed only negligible zzso zzso Dogs with acute zzso also had higher numbers of zzso zzso as well as higher scores in zzso evaluations than infected dogs without zzso Our results show that the expression of zzso zzso is related to the number of zzso zzso zzso and the severity of inflammation as assessed by zzso These results zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso as part of the zzso immune response to zzso infection and a possible role for NO in the zzso of canine zzso zzso
