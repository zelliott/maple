Loss of zzso occurring on various zzso has been described in the majority of human zzso The targets of frequent or consistent zzso deletions are believed to be tumor zzso zzso We examined 72 zzso tumors zzso zzso cell zzso and 26 zzso for loss of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these tumor zzso genes in the zzso deletions was directly zzso by performing zzso chain reaction at zzso sites within the zzso Loss of zzso occurred in zzso of zzso cases at zzso in zzso of zzso cases at zzso in zzso at zzso in zzso at zzso and in zzso at zzso zzso % of tumors zzso at all zzso zzso zzso lost zzso of at least one zzso A high percentage of fully zzso tumors zzso also lost zzso at more than one zzso There were no significant differences among zzso types in the prevalence of loss of zzso at any zzso There were correlations of losses involving zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso deletions including these tumor zzso genes are important in the formation and/or progression of most zzso zzso zzso zzso deletions involving zzso may not occur independently of deletions involving other tumor zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of multiple zzso deletions involving specific tumor zzso genes may be important in most zzso zzso or tumor zzso
