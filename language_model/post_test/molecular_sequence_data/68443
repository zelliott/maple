zzso zzso are often found in zzso regions where they zzso defined positioning of zzso response zzso relative to the zzso zzso Here, we address how this affects zzso element zzso We used zzso DNA segments containing one zzso response element zzso and rat liver core zzso to zzso zzso in zzso The zzso in these zzso were held in identical zzso settings but different zzso zzso This was achieved by placing the zzso within or at the flank of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that a zzso in free DNA has a zzso higher affinity for zzso than the zzso zzso when positioned 40 zzso from the zzso zzso A zzso zzso positioned 40 zzso from the zzso zzso on the other hand, binds zzso zzso better as compared to an identical zzso positioned 20 zzso from the zzso and zzso better than a zzso positioned at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by a zzso AT segment next to a zzso zzso positioned 20 zzso from the zzso restores zzso affinity to the same level as when the zzso is placed 40 zzso from the zzso The effect on zzso affinity either by different positioning within the zzso zzso sequence or by introducing the zzso zzso is seen only in a zzso zzso We conclude that a zzso positioned zzso can zzso the affinity of a zzso factor for its target response zzso
