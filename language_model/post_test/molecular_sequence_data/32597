A new virus was isolated from tomato plants from the zzso region in Spain which showed symptoms of zzso zzso very distinct zzso almost zzso symptoms on leaves of infected zzso The virus particles are zzso with a diameter of approximately 28 zzso The viral zzso consists of two zzso molecules of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contains one open reading frame zzso zzso a predicted zzso of zzso zzso that shows zzso regions with motifs typical for a zzso a zzso a zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two, partially overlapping zzso potentially zzso proteins of 20 and zzso zzso These viral zzso are zzso by three proteins with estimated sizes of 35, 26 and 23 zzso zzso protein sequencing mapped these coat proteins to zzso on zzso zzso analyses of zzso and derived zzso acid sequences showed that the virus is related to but distinct from viruses belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso This new virus, for which the name tomato zzso virus is proposed, most likely represents a member of a new plant virus zzso
