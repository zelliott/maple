zzso targeting to the zzso zzso in zzso and to the cell membrane in zzso is zzso by the signal recognition particle zzso and its zzso zzso Both contain zzso zzso zzso in the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso These zzso are involved in the regulation of protein zzso Most studies so far have zzso on the zzso machinery of zzso and bacteria, leaving the zzso system of zzso less well zzso 

We report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso A resolution and of the zzso zzso which is inactive in zzso zzso This is the first structure of an zzso component from an zzso and allows for a detailed comparison with related structures from zzso coli and zzso zzso In particular, differences in the zzso consensus regions for zzso binding and the zzso zzso are observed, which provide information about the regulation of the zzso These interactions allow us to propose a common zzso mechanism for the zzso zzso 

The overall structure of zzso is well zzso between bacteria and zzso which indicates strong similarities in the regulation of the zzso zzso Surprisingly, structure comparisons identified a zzso zzso protein as the closest zzso A zzso model for the zzso interaction is zzso
