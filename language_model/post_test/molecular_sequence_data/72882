To identify binding zzso between zzso II zzso and its type 2 zzso zzso two different zzso zzso zzso were prepared by replacing either the first or the last zzso acid in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors with zzso revealed that the two zzso zzso label the zzso part of the zzso within the first 182 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso complex with zzso zzso produced a zzso of 80 zzso zzso of this zzso product decreased its apparent molecular mass to zzso zzso and further zzso of this zzso product with zzso zzso decreased its molecular mass to zzso zzso zzso the labeling site of zzso within zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso complex with zzso zzso produced two major zzso fragments of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso produced two major fragments of zzso zzso and zzso zzso defining the labeling site of zzso within zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso tail of the zzso zzso interacts with the zzso end of zzso whereas the inner half of the third zzso domain of zzso zzso interacts with the zzso end of zzso
