In zzso besides the zzso zzso carrier protein zzso involved in the zzso and transfer of common fatty zzso there are at least three specialized zzso carrier proteins zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso which is required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which transfers zzso acid to a sugar backbone during zzso A zzso Whereas the zzso sequences zzso the three specialized zzso are known, only the zzso acid sequence of the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso In this study, using reverse zzso the genes for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Previously, it had been shown that zzso and zzso can be zzso in zzso coli using the zzso zzso expression zzso Using the same system, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso together with the specialized zzso zzso were zzso and zzso All the known zzso of zzso can be zzso in zzso during expression in zzso coli with radioactive zzso added to the growth medium due to their modification with a zzso prosthetic zzso The availability of all functionally different zzso should help to unravel how different fatty acids are targeted towards different zzso pathways in one zzso
