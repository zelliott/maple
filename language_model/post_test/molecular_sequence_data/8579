We demonstrate that in zzso zzso the zzso zzso replacement zzso is zzso by two zzso zzso and zzso We have isolated zzso clones for zzso and zzso and zzso clones for zzso The genes zzso exactly the same protein but are widely divergent in their untranslated regions zzso Both genes are expressed in zzso and adults; they are expressed in the zzso as well as in zzso zzso of the zzso However, only one of them, zzso shows strong zzso zzso The 3' zzso of the zzso gene is relatively short zzso 250 zzso zzso zzso transcripts can be processed at several zzso sites, the longest with a 3' zzso of more than 1500 zzso The 3' processing sites, zzso used in the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso We have also isolated the zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso They are quite similar to the zzso zzso genes in their expression zzso However, in contrast to their zzso counterparts, which are highly zzso in their zzso regions, the zzso genes display only limited sequence similarity in these zzso
