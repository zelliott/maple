The factor VIII zzso binding regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a human zzso inhibitor zzso have previously been reported to be contained within zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the binding regions of these two zzso was based on their zzso with four synthetic zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso peptides spanning the entire zzso region of the zzso heavy chain have now been evaluated for the ability to inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso in an zzso zzso The smallest zzso tested that inhibited zzso binding to zzso consisted of zzso zzso Those peptides that were able to inhibit zzso binding in the zzso zzso were also able to neutralize the zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso The zzso zzso activity of two human zzso inhibitor zzso was also partially neutralized by peptides from this zzso zzso of the pattern of peptides zzso with the three zzso indicates that the binding regions of these zzso are in very close proximity to each other, but are not zzso Their respective binding regions are contained within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that this 20 zzso acid segment of the zzso region of the heavy chain of zzso may be functionally important in the expression of zzso zzso zzso
