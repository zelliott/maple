zzso zzso zzso zzso carries the structural genes for the three anthrax toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the toxin genes by zzso zzso is enhanced during growth under elevated levels of zzso This CO2 effect is observed only in the presence of another zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of anthrax toxin zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso does not appear to differ in cells grown in zzso CO2 compared with cells grown in zzso Using a new efficient method for gene replacement in zzso zzso we constructed an zzso zzso in which the zzso sequence on zzso is replaced with an omega zzso zzso zzso of all three toxin genes is decreased in the absence of zzso The zzso gene possesses two apparent zzso start sites, zzso and zzso only transcripts with zzso ends mapping to zzso are decreased in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter region indicates that the 111 zzso region upstream of the zzso site is sufficient for zzso zzso of this zzso The zzso and zzso genes each have one apparent start site for zzso zzso with zzso ends mapping to these sites are not detected in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in zzso Moreover, the zzso response to all three toxin proteins is decreased significantly in zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso gene product also regulates toxin gene expression during zzso
