We have obtained zzso against highly zzso zzso virus structural protein zzso a major DNA binding protein present in the viral core zzso The zzso has been used to monitor the course of the zzso of this zzso The protein can first be detected in extracts of infected cells at 4 zzso zzso zzso Its synthesis increases significantly at 5 zzso zzso and is maintained at about the same level up to 11 zzso The requirement of viral DNA replication for zzso synthesis indicates that it is a viral late zzso This protein is zzso in the form of a zzso zzso which is then processed to a zzso zzso The zzso of the precursor is about 2 zzso Comparing the zzso zzso acid sequence of this zzso protein with those derived from the published DNA sequence of the zzso viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moss (1984) zzso zzso 51, zzso it is found that zzso maps to the zzso L zzso of the viral zzso The zzso site at which processing takes place lies between zzso acids 32 zzso and 33 zzso from the zzso end of the zzso
