zzso cells at the base of small zzso zzso zzso zzso which contribute to innate immunity and shape composition of enteric zzso Efforts to establish a relationship between zzso zzso and disease have been hampered by a lack of sensitive zzso to zzso zzso zzso Here we report on a highly sensitive sandwich zzso zzso zzso zzso for the mouse zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in varied sources, including zzso contents zzso from stomach to zzso colon and zzso zzso One pair of zzso zzso zzso selected from 10 rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso detection and specificity in the sandwich zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso levels increased gradually from zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso small zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso small zzso and the zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was reduced significantly in feces of zzso zzso mice, a model of inflammatory zzso disease zzso when compared with zzso zzso This zzso sandwich zzso enables accurate zzso of zzso zzso as zzso of zzso cell function and enteric integrity in diverse disease states such as zzso infectious disease, graft versus host disease, and obesity in association with zzso of the zzso zzso
