We investigated the zzso properties of a zzso zzso zzso named as zzso B, which is zzso by zzso zzso and probably is the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Testing the activity on zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso B requires at least three zzso acids zzso to the zzso bond for zzso zzso On such zzso zzso B was clearly specific for positively charged zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso position and was rather zzso in the zzso Interestingly however, it preferred zzso at zzso in the zzso zzso which contained zzso acids also zzso to the zzso bond, and was zzso with the highest zzso zzso The pH profile of activity, similarly to other zzso has a wide peak with high values between pH zzso and zzso The activity was slightly increased by zzso and zzso zzso it was not sensitive for zzso zzso zzso but it was inhibited by zzso features shared by many zzso At the same time, zzso inhibited the activity only partially even either after long incubation or in excess amount, and zzso was zzso (both are unusual among zzso The zzso inhibited activity could be restored with the addition of zzso zzso and zzso up to zzso of its original value, while zzso was zzso We propose that both the zzso zzso of zzso B activity and its resistance to zzso zzso might be caused by an zzso in position 191 where most of the zzso contain zzso
