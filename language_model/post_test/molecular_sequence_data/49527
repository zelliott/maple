While studying zzso a zzso zzso zzso we identified an approximately 36 zzso zzso which was abundantly expressed in all five strains of primary normal human prostate zzso zzso cells but significantly reduced or lost in seven prostate cancer cell zzso The approximately 36 zzso protein was subsequently identified as zzso II by zzso approach and confirmed by Western zzso using an zzso zzso zzso Conventional and zzso zzso together with Western zzso also revealed reduced or lost expression of zzso I in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that in zzso cells, zzso II was distributed both in the zzso and underneath the plasma zzso but not on the cell zzso zzso cancer cells showed reduced levels as well as altered expression patterns of zzso zzso Since zzso play important roles in maintaining zzso zzso and regulating the zzso and cell zzso we hypothesized that the reduced or lost expression of zzso zzso might promote certain aggressive zzso of prostate cancer zzso In subsequent experiments, we indeed observed that restoration of zzso II expression inhibited the migration of the zzso prostate cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation or zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso II, and, zzso zzso I, may be zzso zzso of prostate cancer cell migration and their reduced or lost expression may contribute to prostate cancer development and zzso
