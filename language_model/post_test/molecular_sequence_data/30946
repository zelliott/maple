We have isolated and characterized mouse zzso clones representing the entire coding region of zzso zzso zzso analysis of different stages during development has revealed differential control in the expression of zzso zzso in the different zzso zzso The zzso sequence extends zzso base pairs and contains the zzso zzso acid mouse zzso zzso chain, flanked by 90 base pairs zzso and 312 base pairs 3' untranslated zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence was used to zzso the three known structural zzso a zzso zzso head of 81 zzso a zzso domain of 330 zzso arising from three zzso and a zzso zzso domain of 55 zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons with other species revealed high sequence conservation of mouse zzso to zzso zzso human zzso and chicken zzso zzso Computer sequence analysis also revealed zzso of significant zzso between different alpha zzso regions of zzso and the DNA zzso zzso domain of several zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, zzso structural similarity was observed between the basic domain of the DNA binding region of the nuclear zzso products zzso and its related zzso zzso zzso and the zzso DNA binding protein zzso with part of the zzso half region of zzso zzso of zzso When the zzso zzso zzso of all these proteins were compared to zzso at least two different regions of similarity in the zzso zzso were found reaching up to zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Further analysis revealed several zzso of significant similarity zzso between all zzso of the rod domain of zzso and the zzso zzso 210 zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso
