This study analyzed 28 zzso strains belonging to the section zzso that were isolated from clinical samples in zzso All zzso zzso slowly and were unable to grow at 48 degrees zzso zzso analysis based on sequencing of partial sequences of the zzso and zzso A genes was used to zzso the 28 strains into six different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso testing showed zzso patterns and grouped the strains together by zzso Most zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso of zzso B zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso and zzso zzso showed high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were susceptible to all the zzso zzso In conclusion, a number of different species whose zzso features resemble those of zzso zzso could succeed in producing invasive infections in the susceptible zzso In addition, some of them showed high zzso for most of the zzso available for the treatment of patients infected with these zzso The epidemiology and clinical relevance of these species should therefore be zzso
