Monitoring of loss of zzso in human tumors has suggested that the zzso region may contain another tumor zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso The zzso sequencing of a zzso region bounded by the zzso and zzso genes and containing a zzso region has identified two new genes in the zzso region of zzso zzso One of them, zzso is closely related to mouse zzso a gene isolated as being zzso regulated by serum and growth factors and exhibiting a high expression in growth arrested mouse zzso The other, zzso belongs to the Ras zzso in which it defines a new zzso Its expression appears to be strictly limited to the central nervous zzso zzso and zzso genes are likely candidates to be involved in zzso zzso Although no zzso was observed in a small set of zzso and zzso zzso of these new genes should now be searched in other tumors with frequent zzso losses on zzso 22 not associated with zzso zzso
