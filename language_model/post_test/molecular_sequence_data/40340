To survive, bacteria must be able to adapt to environmental zzso Small regulatory zzso have been implicated as zzso in a variety of zzso pathways allowing dynamic gene zzso The zzso binding protein zzso zzso this process in many cases, helping zzso base pair with their target zzso and initiate gene zzso Although zzso has been identified as a critical component in many zzso the manner by which zzso controls these interactions is not zzso 

To test the requirement of zzso in these zzso complexes, the zzso system was used as a zzso zzso is induced in response to zzso stress and down regulates the translation of zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso characterization of this system previously used a minimal construct of the zzso zzso which inadvertently removed a critical element within the leader sequence of this zzso that zzso thermodynamics and zzso for the interaction with zzso 

zzso we report zzso kinetic and structural mapping studies during zzso and zzso complex formation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso using both the zzso and zzso surfaces and stimulates association zzso between the zzso and zzso but remains bound to zzso forming a zzso zzso The upstream zzso binding element within zzso is similar to zzso elements recently identified in other zzso regulated by zzso This work leads to a kinetic model for the dynamics of these complexes and the regulation of gene expression by bacterial zzso
