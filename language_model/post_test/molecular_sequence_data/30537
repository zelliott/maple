zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso protein that has been suggested to participate in the visual process as a carrier for visual zzso A zzso gene composed of the human zzso promoter fused to the bacterial reporter gene zzso zzso zzso was used to generate transgenic zzso Analysis of six transgenic families revealed that the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso was expressed primarily in the zzso and, to a lesser extent, in the zzso zzso These results establish that a zzso zzso from the zzso end of the human zzso gene is sufficient to direct zzso expression to a visual subdivision of the central nervous zzso
