zzso zzso zzso greatly influenced the distribution and pattern of zzso in the Northern zzso Here we examine how such zzso in South East Asia may have affected the demographic and evolutionary history of a zzso plant complex associated with zzso zzso We analyzed zzso and nuclear zzso DNA zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequence variation within the zzso zzso complex zzso which comprises zzso and zzso plants distributed throughout zzso In total, 368 individuals from 47 populations across the geographical range of the complex were zzso We show that the relatively widespread zzso form of zzso expanded its range southward in the zzso possibly during the most recent or previous glacial period when conditions became zzso and forests retreated in southern zzso In marked contrast, zzso and other zzso members of the complex failed to expand their ranges at these times or have since undergone range zzso in contrast to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and gene flow between zzso occurred frequently during the evolutionary history of the complex, causing considerable sharing of zzso and ITS zzso Nevertheless, zzso within zzso levels could be largely distinguished according to zzso and/or ITS zzso
