The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso cell extracts require both protein and 3' truncated zzso species of which direct their zzso sequence zzso Computer analysis for searching possible base pairing between zzso zzso and their corresponding 3' truncated zzso suggested a unified model for zzso recognition zzso in which a zzso zzso sequence in the target zzso 1 zzso upstream of their zzso site, base pairs with the zzso terminal 4 zzso sequence of their corresponding 3' truncated zzso This model was supported by experiments with several zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso in the target 4 zzso zzso In this model, the zzso zzso and their corresponding 3' truncated zzso form a complex resembling a zzso processed zzso precursor containing a 3' zzso suggesting that the protein component of zzso 65 is identical to zzso 3' processing zzso zzso zzso Actually, 3' zzso zzso from pig liver zzso the target zzso at the expected sites only in the presence of their corresponding 3' truncated zzso These results show that the 3' zzso can be converted to 4 zzso specific zzso zzso using the 3' truncated zzso
