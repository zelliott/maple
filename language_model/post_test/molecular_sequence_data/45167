We present a novel algorithm, zzso for identifying zzso factor zzso binding site zzso The method is deterministic and depends on an indexing technique to zzso the search zzso On common zzso zzso zzso performs competitively with other zzso We also present results on a challenging group of eight sets of human genes known to be responsive to a diverse group of zzso In every case, zzso finds the zzso motif among the top scoring putative zzso We compared zzso against other motif zzso on a larger human group of 21 gene sets and found that zzso performs better than other zzso We analyzed the remaining high scoring motifs and show that many zzso to other zzso that are known to zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The significant and frequent presence of zzso zzso factor binding sites explains in part the difficulty of human motif zzso zzso is a very fast algorithm, suitable for application to large numbers of interesting gene zzso
