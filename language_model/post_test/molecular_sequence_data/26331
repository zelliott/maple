The bag cell zzso of zzso are capable of generating an zzso which, in zzso triggers zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels in isolated bag cell zzso has been shown to initiate repetitive zzso similar to that seen during an zzso and to decrease outward currents measured under zzso We have now examined the effects of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso on zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso currents in these zzso Previous work has shown that zzso lowers zzso zzso levels in intact clusters of bag cell zzso We have found that zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, whereas zzso like zzso lowers zzso zzso zzso We used whole cell patch clamp technique to determine the effects of the peptides on the delayed zzso zzso currents in isolated bag cell zzso As one would predict from their effects on zzso zzso levels, zzso decreased the zzso of the delayed zzso currents whereas both zzso and zzso increased the zzso of these zzso In contrast, no consistent effects of these peptides on the transient zzso zzso current zzso were seen in these zzso Our results suggest that these three zzso peptides may contribute to changes in second zzso and zzso currents during a bag cell zzso
