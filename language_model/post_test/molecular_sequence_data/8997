zzso zzso is an zzso pathogen that hijacks iron from the human iron transport zzso zzso zzso by expressing zzso outer membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to other zzso outer membrane zzso zzso is thought to consist of a zzso with an zzso plug zzso Previous reports by our laboratories show that the sequence zzso in the plug domain is highly zzso among various bacterial species that express zzso and plays a crucial role in iron zzso for zzso We zzso that this highly zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso rich in hard oxygen donor groups, binds with zzso through the transport process across the outer membrane through the zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso supports the paradigm that the zzso iron must always remain zzso and controlled throughout the transport zzso In order to test this hypothesis here we describe the ability of both the zzso zzso zzso and three small peptides that zzso the sequence zzso of the zzso to bind zzso This is the first report of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although CD and zzso zzso suggest that a non-native structure is observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso plug binds zzso zzso with a conditional log zzso zzso 7 at pH zzso with no evidence of binding at pH zzso A zzso zzso plug with zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso shows no evidence of zzso binding under our experimental set zzso Interestingly, in zzso modeling with the zzso plug also predicts a flexible loop structure for the zzso sequence under native conditions which once again supports the zzso binding zzso These in zzso observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso plug binds zzso during the outer membrane transport process in zzso
