Human zzso zzso DNA repeats zzso have variable zzso sequence but conservative short zzso which may have important functions, are also zzso In our previous reports we have described human nuclear zzso protein interacting with zzso and evidence was presented that the protein recognizes sequence motif zzso which is zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso III promoter of zzso and in the zzso zzso replication origin of zzso In this study it was found that zzso synthetic zzso containing indicated conservative sequences of zzso actually have zzso binding site for zzso nuclear zzso The data suggest that zzso human cells contain nuclear zzso protein which recognizes the conservative sequence motif of zzso - zzso
