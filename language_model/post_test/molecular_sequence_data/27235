zzso replicating sequences zzso in zzso zzso have been extensively characterized as both origins of DNA replication and as zzso zzso It has been zzso shown that the origin and the zzso activities of zzso are zzso but not entirely interchangeable and that they are modulated by position effects and zzso zzso It remains unclear how these two quite divergent functions of zzso zzso This perspective focuses on recent advances, which have shown that slight differences in zzso can zzso their affinity for origin recognition complex and their activity as zzso or zzso
