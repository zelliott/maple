We propose fuzzy zzso as a method to analyze molecular dynamics zzso zzso especially of proteins and zzso A fuzzy cluster analysis locates classes of similar three-dimensional zzso explored during a molecular dynamics zzso The method can be readily applied to results from both equilibrium and zzso simulations, with zzso on either global or local structural zzso The potential of this technique is illustrated by results from fuzzy cluster analyses of zzso from MD simulations of various fragments of human zzso hormone zzso For large zzso it is more efficient to analyze the zzso of zzso distances between zzso zzso the zzso We found that the results of the zzso analysis were zzso in terms of the optimal number of clusters of zzso for the majority of the zzso zzso The zzso closest to the cluster center can be chosen as being representative of the class of structures making up the zzso and can be further zzso for example, in terms of its secondary zzso The CPU time used by the cluster analysis was negligible compared to the MD simulation zzso
