By differential screening of a zzso library, we have cloned a gene expressed specifically during the zzso stage of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso to zzso reveal that the transcript is zzso expressed during the late zzso zzso stage, disappears rapidly during the cellular zzso stage and is not detected at any other point in the zzso life zzso On the basis of its temporally restricted expression and its zzso zzso map position at zzso we have designated this gene zzso gene 25A zzso zzso encodes a novel protein of 23 zzso
