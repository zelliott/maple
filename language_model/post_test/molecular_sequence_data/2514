The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso coli contains zzso zzso acid zzso and is predicted to have a short zzso zzso zzso on the inner surface of the zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso segments in zzso zzso and a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso tail on the inner surface of the zzso To assess the importance of the zzso zzso the properties of several zzso zzso were zzso The zzso were constructed by zzso zzso such that stop zzso were placed at specified positions, and the altered zzso genes were expressed at a relatively low rate from zzso zzso zzso truncated at position 407 or 401 retains full activity, and a normal complement of molecules is present in the zzso as judged by zzso zzso Thus, it is apparent that the zzso tail plays no direct role in membrane zzso of the zzso its stability, or in the mechanism of zzso zzso In marked contrast, when zzso are made at zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso acid zzso from the zzso zzso of putative zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso is no longer found in the zzso zzso however, when each of the zzso zzso genes is expressed at a high rate by means of the zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso & Richardson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 82, zzso all of the truncated zzso are present in the zzso as indicated by zzso incorporation zzso however, zzso truncated at zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is defective with respect to zzso zzso Finally, zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso or zzso truncated at zzso 401 is stable, whereas zzso truncated at or prior to zzso zzso is zzso at a significant zzso The results are consistent with the notion that zzso zzso in putative zzso zzso are important for protection against zzso degradation and suggest that this region of the zzso may be necessary for proper zzso
