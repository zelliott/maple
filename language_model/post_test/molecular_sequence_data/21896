To investigate the genetic environment of the zzso gene zzso in an zzso zzso isolated in 2007 in a German zzso 

zzso zzso testing was performed and resistance genes were characterized by zzso amplification and zzso zzso of zzso resistance was tested by broth mating zzso and transformation of zzso The genetic background of zzso was zzso by primer zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strain was performed by repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso genes zzso and intrinsic zzso but without the zzso sequence zzso often located zzso Transfer of zzso resistance by zzso and transformation zzso zzso of isolated zzso DNA with zzso zzso was not zzso zzso cloning of whole zzso DNA and sequence analyses revealed that zzso was located between two zzso elements of zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso structure was integrated into a zzso gene zzso a putative zzso zzso major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso gene zzso in this zzso zzso strain was integrated in the zzso on a new zzso structure composed of two copies of zzso sequence zzso The zzso of the genetic environment of zzso likely zzso the rapid dissemination of this gene within many zzso bacterial zzso
