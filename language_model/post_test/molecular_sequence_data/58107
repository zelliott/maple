zzso the most 3' human H chain V region zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso repertoire of the developing human zzso To determine whether zzso contributes to the immune repertoire, we amplified and zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso that were zzso to zzso zzso distinct zzso zzso clones were zzso zzso assignment to C gamma 1 could be made in the majority of zzso and all had undergone extensive zzso zzso in the V region with an average of 14 zzso 2 to 25) zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The overall frequency of zzso zzso was zzso of the total zzso zzso Replacement zzso zzso were targeted to the zzso determining region, and the zzso determining region had higher replacement to silent zzso ratios, consistent with zzso zzso Silent zzso zzso were also significantly more frequent in the zzso determining region compared to the framework zzso Five clones were derived from the same zzso zzso each containing unique and shared zzso All zzso segments used by independently arising clones were unique, and all zzso reading frames were zzso N segments were lacking at either the zzso junction or the zzso junction in 7 of 13 independent zzso zzso zzso were frequently observed, and there was biased usage of zzso and zzso in the zzso The data imply that a high degree of diversity arises from use of this zzso gene in the immune zzso
