Display of zzso libraries on zzso zzso has led to the identification of peptides of the form zzso (where X is a variable zzso that bind to the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso These peptides adopt zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that the zzso is zzso zzso in the absence of zzso due to zzso zzso about the zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso at the turn zzso position produces a stable zzso zzso in solution, although this zzso no longer has activity in an zzso cell proliferation zzso A truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso also forms a highly populated, zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth factor binding protein 1 zzso have a high level of sequence identity with the truncated zzso zzso zzso of 12 zzso yet adopt a zzso zzso in zzso zzso containing all possible zzso zzso acid zzso between the zzso and zzso peptides have been analyzed to assess the degree to which the zzso zzso stabilize the hairpin or zzso zzso All four zzso present in the original sequence are required for maximum population of either the zzso or zzso zzso although some zzso have a more dominant zzso The results demonstrate that, within a given zzso the observed zzso can be dictated by a small subset of the zzso (in this case four out of zzso
