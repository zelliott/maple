A zzso zzso to detect immobilized amplified zzso acids has been zzso This approach provides a rapid zzso suitable for clinical diagnosis, to analyze DNA sequences amplified by the zzso chain zzso The specific DNA sequences are captured on a solid support by the use of a zzso fusion protein consisting of the zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso system is used to detect the immobilized zzso Positive samples can be analyzed by direct zzso zzso Here, we show that this zzso concept can be used for analysis of zzso and zzso and for specific detection of the zzso zzso zzso in clinical zzso
