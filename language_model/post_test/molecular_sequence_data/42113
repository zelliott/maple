Our aim was to examine the hypothesis that vascular zzso cells zzso express only ETA zzso and zzso cells express only zzso zzso and to determine which zzso zzso zzso are expressed in these cell zzso Using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, we were able to detect zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and ETA and zzso zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in cultured zzso has not been previously zzso These results agree with the hypothesis that zzso may be released from vascular zzso cells to act predominantly on ETA receptors on zzso to stimulate contraction of the underlying zzso cells, and that zzso relaxing factor release may be zzso predominantly via the zzso receptors on zzso The role of zzso expression from zzso and zzso is less zzso
