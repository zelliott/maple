We have constructed a human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso sequence against the zzso envelope zzso zzso of zzso T zzso with this zzso results in expression of the therapeutic zzso sequence and subsequent zzso of productive zzso zzso In this report, we examined the effect of zzso suppression on the potential development of virus escape zzso using a zzso zzso line cultured under conditions that over serial passages specifically allowed for generation and amplification of zzso selected for by zzso zzso In the resulting virus zzso we found a significant increase in the number of deletions at the envelope target region zzso compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso were most often greater than 1 zzso in zzso These data demonstrate for the first time that during zzso suppression of zzso zzso develop as a direct result of selective pressure on the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, in clones where deletions were not observed, there was a high rate of zzso transitions in zzso at the zzso target region but not outside this region, which is consistent with those zzso that are predicted as a result of zzso modification of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These clones were not found to be escape zzso as their zzso ability was severely zzso and they did not replicate in the presence of zzso
