zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and multiple reaction monitoring mass zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed on zzso sweat of healthy controls, and the results were compared with those from individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia zzso This is the first large scale study of the sweat zzso First, we performed zzso on pooled zzso samples and pooled control samples for global zzso zzso zzso revealed a high abundance of diverse proteins and peptides in zzso zzso Most of the proteins identified from sweat samples were found to be different than the most abundant proteins from serum, which indicates that zzso sweat is not simply a plasma zzso and may thereby be a source of unique zzso zzso A second independent set of patient and control sweat samples were analyzed by zzso and spectral counting to determine qualitative protein differential zzso between the control and disease zzso zzso zzso of selected zzso initially determined by spectral zzso were verified by zzso zzso zzso proteins showed a differential abundance of approximately zzso or greater between the zzso pooled sample and the control pooled zzso This study demonstrates the utility of zzso and zzso as a viable strategy for the discovery and zzso of potential sweat protein disease zzso
