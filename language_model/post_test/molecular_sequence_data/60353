zzso zzso harbors genetic information for two pairs of zzso zzso Two of the zzso contain zzso while the other two gene groups zzso apparent zzso that carry zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The genes coding for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed only under zzso zzso They are transcribed out of a common zzso zzso A series of deletions made in the zzso region localized a common negative regulatory element for the zzso and zzso promoters as well as two zzso elements that are specific for each of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso partially overlapping the zzso promoter, were also zzso zzso in these repeated zzso sequences led to a weak induction of a reporter gene under the control of the zzso promoters in the presence of zzso This result suggests that the zzso repeats contribute to the negative regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
