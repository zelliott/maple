Of the many inherited zzso peripheral zzso type zzso zzso is caused by dominant point zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report a dominant zzso in zzso that causes zzso in the zzso zzso both sensory and motor zzso are affected, and the dominant zzso is not caused by a loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mice have abnormal zzso junction zzso and impaired transmission, reduced nerve zzso zzso and a loss of zzso peripheral zzso without defects in zzso The zzso zzso zzso retains zzso activity, and a zzso zzso generated by a zzso zzso shows no dominant zzso in zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is caused not by reduction of the zzso zzso activity and zzso in protein zzso but instead by novel zzso roles for the zzso zzso that specifically affect peripheral zzso
