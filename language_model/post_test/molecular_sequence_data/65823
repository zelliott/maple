The active center zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso II are nearly zzso including four protruding zzso the zzso zzso fork 1 and fork zzso Here we present a zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking these zzso zzso and analyze the function of each loop at different stages of the zzso zzso All zzso zzso except fork 1 were required for zzso zzso and efficient zzso zzso de zzso zzso required fork 2, the lid was necessary for primed initial zzso Analysis of templates containing a zzso bubble showed that zzso of upstream DNA drives zzso separation from the zzso During zzso downstream DNA strand separation required template strand binding to an zzso zzso in switch 2, and apparently interaction of an zzso zzso in fork 2 with the zzso zzso
