One zzso oxygen of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be selectively exchanged with zzso using zzso zzso zzso it was not the zzso of zzso but that of zzso which was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso results in a zzso change of the zzso backbone although the zzso of zzso and the corresponding zzso are not involved in internal hydrogen zzso Two zzso in slow exchange, containing a zzso zzso bond in a beta zzso zzso and a trans zzso bond in a beta zzso zzso were analyzed by restrained molecular dynamics in zzso and in zzso as well as using time dependent distance zzso It is impossible to fit all experimental data to a zzso structure of each zzso Interpreting the conflicting zzso local segment flexibility is zzso MD simulations lead to a dynamic model for each structure with evidence of an equilibrium between a beta zzso and beta zzso about the zzso zzso bond in both the zzso and trans zzso zzso zzso relaxation rates in the rotating frame zzso zzso were measured to verify the assumption of this fast beta zzso II equilibrium within each zzso zzso contributions to zzso zzso from zzso motions were found for both zzso Therefore it is possible to distinguish between at least four zzso zzso on different time scales based on zzso data and MD zzso This work shows that zzso is a useful modification of peptides for zzso zzso
