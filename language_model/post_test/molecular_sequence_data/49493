Two novel zzso peptides were zzso from skin zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The partial zzso sequences of these two peptides were determined by automated zzso zzso This allowed the cloning of full-length zzso zzso these two peptides from a zzso library prepared from the zzso zzso The deduced complete zzso acid sequences indicate that both peptides are composed of 77 zzso zzso A zzso search in the zzso revealed that they exhibit zzso sequence identity with zzso a zzso originally isolated from skin zzso of zzso zzso They were thus named as zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso and 2 were due to six zzso acid zzso at positions 6, 11, 23, 24, 62 and zzso zzso and 2 differed from zzso with zzso and seven zzso acid zzso zzso Like zzso zzso and 2 possessed zzso activity on isolated guinea pig zzso Additionally, they zzso contraction of rabbit zzso rings in a zzso manner at zzso zzso
