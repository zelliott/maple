Using both zzso in zzso zzso and molecular techniques, we report the genetic zzso of the gene coding for the alpha 1 zzso of the skeletal slow zzso current zzso zzso gene zzso on human zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and on mouse zzso 1 zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in an zzso zzso we have determined that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso locus is very closely linked to the zzso zzso zzso
