To establish a stable, rapid multiplex zzso zzso combined with PAGE gel zzso for simultaneously detecting zzso and zzso zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and PAGE gel zzso were simultaneously used to analyze zzso and zzso zzso in 117 de zzso zzso patients with normal zzso zzso 

For certain zzso the length of zzso zzso DNA is longer than zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso is longer than zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is longer than zzso zzso zzso zzso will move more slowly during PAGE gel zzso than zzso Therefore the zzso may be zzso A total of 117 zzso patients were analyzed with zzso and PAGE gel zzso and the results were zzso which included 18 zzso patients with zzso 19 zzso patients with zzso 25 zzso patients with zzso and 55 zzso patients with zzso 

Both types of zzso zzso may provide a rapid and handy zzso for simultaneous detection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is relatively sensitive, zzso while PAGE zzso is relatively simple, cheap, and reliable, which may be suitable for primary hospitals and preliminary zzso
