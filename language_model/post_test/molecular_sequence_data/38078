Animals in complex environments must discriminate between salient and zzso sensory zzso zzso zzso uses one pair of zzso zzso called zzso to sense many different zzso yet the animal can distinguish each zzso from the others in discrimination zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for responses to all zzso zzso zzso appears to be a shared signaling component downstream of zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein indicates that zzso can influence odor discrimination and adaptation as well as zzso zzso to one zzso zzso is disrupted by zzso zzso zzso discrimination is also disrupted by zzso zzso probably by overproduction of the shared second zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso signaling pathways are insulated to permit odor zzso
