Human zzso zzso are one of the few cell types that express the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Although in zzso experiments zzso acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of cell zzso we found that zzso was expressed at very low levels in zzso both in zzso and in culture, and had a predominantly zzso distribution, concentrated within the zzso zzso To examine why zzso accumulated in the zzso we prepared zzso between zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, both zzso reached the cell surface but the rate of maturation of the zzso zzso was considerably retarded relative to zzso The zzso zzso domain contains two zzso zzso that resemble the double zzso motif characteristic of many proteins that are resident within the zzso zzso zzso of each zzso individually to zzso had no effect on zzso zzso but when both zzso were zzso the rate of zzso maturation increased to that of zzso Further analysis of zzso function in zzso must, therefore, take into account the low abundance of the zzso relative to zzso and the potential for zzso to accumulate in the zzso zzso
