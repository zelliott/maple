Certain point zzso within the zzso zzso zzso of class I zzso zzso zzso have been associated with zzso transformation in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Breast Cancer zzso zzso 52, zzso An important example is the replacement of a single zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso and in the zzso human zzso zzso It has been suggested that the zzso nature of this zzso substitution may derive from zzso of the zzso zzso ability to take part in direct zzso zzso In the present work, we examined the basis of this phenomenon by studying zzso portions of zzso in fluid zzso zzso An expression system was designed to produce such peptides from the zzso zzso and from an identical region of the transforming zzso in which zzso is replaced by zzso All peptides were zzso containing the appropriate zzso domain plus zzso stretches of zzso acids from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were incorporated into zzso side chains zzso each zzso zzso side chain became zzso Given the presence of natural zzso zzso at positions zzso and 657 within zzso this approach afforded zzso zzso within the motif zzso thought to be important for zzso formation, and nine zzso upstream of this zzso Further peptides were produced, by zzso zzso to confirm spectral assignments and to provide an additional probe location at position 670 (11 zzso downstream of the motif zzso On zzso gels, the zzso peptides migrated as zzso zzso in equilibrium with smaller populations of zzso CD zzso of both zzso and transforming zzso peptides were consistent with the zzso portions being basically zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso zzso were obtained in fluid zzso zzso of zzso zzso from 35 to 65 degrees zzso zzso were consistent with the concept that the zzso acid zzso characterizing the zzso is zzso at neutral zzso zzso spectral components from species rotating rapidly and zzso within the membrane appeared to represent zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso within the zzso domain induced changes in side chain zzso of at least zzso degrees at zzso zzso within the five zzso acid motif thought to be involved in zzso zzso and downstream of this site to zzso zzso There was little evidence of effect at the upstream site zzso at the membrane zzso This result argues that the transforming zzso is associated with significant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso over some four zzso zzso could influence its lateral zzso In addition, temperature effects on spectral zzso zzso suggested that there is greater zzso backbone flexibility for the zzso zzso zzso
