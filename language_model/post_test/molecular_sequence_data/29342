The zzso zzso zzso binding zzso is involved in zzso pathways important for development, cell cycle regulation, and zzso We demonstrate that zzso binding to cellular and viral zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso being two to three orders of magnitude more zzso zzso of free nuclear zzso zzso zzso determined using zzso zzso zzso to the levels required for zzso zzso binding and are considerably lower than those previously zzso Agents capable of increasing zzso levels stimulate zzso binding to its partners in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose that this ability to detect changes in nuclear zzso ratio allows zzso to serve as a zzso sensor for zzso
