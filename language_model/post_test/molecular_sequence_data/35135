The bacterial type IV zzso zzso is the strongest biological motor known to date as its zzso can generate forces well over 100 zzso zzso zzso a zzso provides a good model for zzso investigations because its social zzso gliding zzso is powered by zzso In this study, the interactions among zzso zzso zzso proteins were investigated using zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our genetic analysis suggests that there is an integrated zzso structure that crosses the inner membrane zzso zzso and the outer membrane zzso Moreover, this structure exists in the absence of the zzso zzso A systematic zzso survey provided evidence for direct interactions among IM and zzso proteins exposed to the zzso For example, the IM zzso zzso zzso with its zzso zzso protein zzso In addition, interactions among zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso were investigated by zzso The results indicated similar zzso interactions in the zzso system of this zzso despite significant sequence divergence between zzso proteins in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The observations here support the model of an integrated zzso structure in the absence of a zzso in diverse bacterial zzso
