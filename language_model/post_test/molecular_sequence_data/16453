zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso to functional zzso In order to examine the function of the zzso the structure of zzso zzso zzso from human zzso has been determined and refined by X-ray zzso At zzso A resolution, the zzso zzso zzso from standard bond lengths and angles are zzso A and zzso degrees , zzso The molecular structure was compared with those of rat zzso zzso zzso and corn nitrate zzso The human zzso resembles the rat zzso in overall structure as well as in many side zzso Nevertheless, there is a large zzso shift from the human zzso to the rat zzso or the corn zzso caused by a zzso replacement from zzso to zzso A model of the complex between zzso zzso and the human zzso has been built and compared with that of the zzso domain of the nitrate zzso zzso The interaction between zzso zzso and the human zzso differs from that of the nitrate zzso because of differences in the zzso zzso The structures around 15 zzso sites of the human zzso have been examined for the influence of zzso zzso using the program zzso Five zzso in the zzso domain seem to be related to zzso zzso
