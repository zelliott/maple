Treatment of the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences effectively zzso the synthesis of more complex zzso in the zzso synthetic pathways after zzso resulting in a remarkable increase in zzso zzso with zzso decreases in more complex zzso The treated cells underwent zzso differentiation as judged by zzso changes, adherent ability, and zzso zzso zzso These data provide evidence that the increased zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in regulating cellular differentiation and that the zzso DNA technique proves to be a powerful tool in manipulating zzso synthesis in the zzso
