We show that a vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso controls embryonic zzso of blood cells zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and three zzso zzso are expressed along zzso migration zzso A zzso zzso arrests progression of blood cell zzso zzso in zzso or zzso have no effect, but simultaneous zzso of all three zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso redirected zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso zzso functions independently of pathways governing zzso zzso on zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso guides zzso zzso of blood cells, and we speculate that the ancestral function of zzso pathways was to guide blood cell zzso
