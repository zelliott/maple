The zzso zzso gene zzso and its downstream zzso zzso are thought to play major roles in the development of breast zzso We investigated three common sequence zzso in zzso and zzso for possible associations with the risk of breast cancer and with various zzso features of this zzso A total of zzso cases were available for zzso zzso DNA obtained from female subjects of similar age but without cancer was used to estimate the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a control zzso A single zzso zzso in zzso 2 of zzso was associated with slightly increased breast cancer risk zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and with zzso differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The 16 zzso zzso zzso in zzso 3 of zzso was associated with poor zzso grade zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso independently of other pathological zzso The zzso 31 zzso in zzso was strongly linked to negative zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting this zzso may have functional significance for the zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso These results add to the growing body of evidence that genetic zzso can influence not only the risk of breast cancer but also the disease zzso
