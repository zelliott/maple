zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two of the most zzso species of zzso in North America and have been difficult to distinguish from one another using zzso and molecular zzso In an attempt to better distinguish these two species, partial sequences of the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso II zzso and nuclear large zzso zzso genes were generated for 32 total zzso 12 zzso each for zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with two zzso each of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso five single zzso zzso zzso were present between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reconstruction using the maximum likelihood zzso and maximum zzso zzso methods showed that zzso was the only gene capable of distinguishing zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso all zzso representing the six northeastern North American zzso zzso zzso sequences grouped zzso zzso into a zzso zzso zzso with zzso support zzso values of zzso zzso while zzso zzso was grouped into a zzso zzso with lower zzso support zzso The results illustrate the utility of partial zzso sequences for the identification of field zzso of zzso from northeastern North zzso
