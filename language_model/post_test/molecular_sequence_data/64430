Currently, the field of shotgun zzso relies primarily on the separation of peptides by zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso laser zzso zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso for protein identification as well as zzso For this purpose we zzso describe construction of a zzso zzso along with zzso zzso conditions for using the device to zzso zzso changes in protein expression via the isotope coded affinity tag zzso method that also maximize peak zzso These zzso zzso parameters required a balance be reached between the disparate needs of zzso which requires good peak shape and identification zzso zzso zzso of proteins via zzso collision induced zzso zzso which requires peak capacity be zzso A complex biological sample from a study of zzso zzso toxicity in zzso was chosen for method development because of the high level complexity, but the biological results are not the focus of this zzso
