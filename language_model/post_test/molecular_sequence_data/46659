To study the putative role of human zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso fatty zzso we identified and cloned the zzso zzso human zzso and expressed it in the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso showed that zzso efficiently converts one of the end products of the zzso zzso of zzso acid, 4, zzso to its corresponding zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso within the zzso is required for its transport to the zzso where further zzso zzso In contrast, 4, zzso is not a zzso for zzso zzso another zzso localized in zzso which zzso the formation of zzso zzso of the other products of zzso acid zzso namely zzso and zzso Our results shed new light on the function of zzso in fatty acid metabolism and point to a crucial role of zzso in the zzso of zzso fatty zzso
