Natural zzso and two synthetic derivatives zzso zzso were tested for their ability to prevent hypoxic zzso cell injury of the isolated zzso rat zzso The zzso zzso zzso is known to have zzso and zzso activities, whereas the zzso zzso zzso exerts protective actions without any zzso zzso In isolated zzso rat zzso flow rate was reduced and oxygen supply interrupted for 180 zzso Then the zzso were zzso zzso for 30 zzso zzso and zzso activity as well as zzso concentration was determined in the zzso zzso zzso led to a substantial zzso release from the liver and to a strong zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced zzso and zzso release zzso zzso zzso The zzso significantly increased the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be an essential factor in the final common zzso of cell death induced by hypoxic zzso Even though the administration of the zzso was associated with an enhanced zzso the zzso reduced hypoxic zzso liver zzso
