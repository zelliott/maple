zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso consisting of alpha and beta zzso and catalyze the formation of zzso from zzso The zzso zzso has been characterized in detail, whereas the function and zzso role of the zzso zzso are poorly zzso In this study, I isolated two distinct zzso fragments for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from a rat brain zzso library by 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends using zzso sense zzso based on zzso acid sequences zzso among zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is identical with the corresponding sequence of the previously described zzso zzso whereas that of zzso is zzso shorter by 46 zzso acids and thus does not contain a consensus sequence for zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis demonstrated that both zzso are expressed in various zzso including zzso liver, and zzso Although the functional significance of the zzso region containing the consensus sequence for zzso of zzso remains unclear yet, it is likely that these zzso zzso play some zzso or zzso role in various zzso
