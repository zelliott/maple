zzso zzso from zzso zzso have been characterized for their structural and zzso zzso In the present study, the structure of a novel zzso zzso A, produced in culture by the tomato pathogen zzso zzso was zzso by combined protein chemistry, mass zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso represents zzso zzso is zzso zzso is zzso zzso is zzso acid, zzso is zzso acid and zzso is zzso with the terminal zzso group closing a zzso ring with the zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso This is, in turn, zzso by zzso In zzso solution, zzso A showed a rather compact structure, being derived from an inward orientation of some zzso acid side chains and from the zzso zzso of the zzso due to zzso interactions involving its terminal zzso zzso was significantly more active than the other zzso from zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso and zzso zzso as well as by red-blood-cell zzso zzso in biological activity were zzso ascribed to its weak positive net charge at neutral zzso zzso zzso membrane experiments showed zzso current zzso suggesting that zzso is able to form zzso This ability was strongly influenced by the zzso composition of the membrane and, in particular, by the presence of zzso All of these findings suggest that zzso derivatives could find promising applications, either as zzso compounds for topical use or as zzso zzso zzso
