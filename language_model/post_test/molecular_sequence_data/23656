A small fraction of the total cellular amount of nuclear zzso factor zzso seems to be located at and within zzso zzso factors of the steroid zzso zzso that, like zzso lack a classical zzso leader sequence are nonetheless imported into zzso where they regulate zzso zzso through binding to specific recognition zzso Here, we examined seven candidate sequences from the human zzso zzso with similarity to the consensus zzso binding zzso Two imperfect zzso at coordinate zzso with zzso to the nuclear zzso box A binding sequence are demonstrated to zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso relatives zzso and beta in the context of the cell zzso zzso zzso may thus bind directly to zzso and, perhaps, be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
