In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor 1 alpha proteins zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells zzso to distinct gene zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso alpha gene zzso alpha zzso produces one of the most highly expressed early zzso transcripts in the zzso The functional recycling of zzso alpha zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso is assured by the zzso beta gamma zzso We show here that in zzso zzso zzso contrary to the situation for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso are transcribed from the same genes in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the onset of zzso of the zzso beta and zzso gamma genes from the zzso zzso occurs several hours after that of the zzso zzso alpha S zzso zzso during early zzso development the expression of these three zzso factors is not zzso at the zzso zzso The consequences of this zzso on the efficiency of zzso zzso in the early zzso zzso are zzso
