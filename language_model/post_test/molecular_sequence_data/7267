The zzso zzso most notable of which is zzso are key regulators of the cell cycle, and are highly zzso in zzso We have cloned and zzso three zzso zzso genes zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with zzso zzso acid zzso identity to the human zzso zzso a zzso protein with zzso identity and zzso a zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso have zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso domain, that zzso the zzso zzso family, to give zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The three zzso have zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are sites of zzso in zzso and are important for regulating zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that each zzso is a single copy zzso zzso zzso located the zzso genes to some of the largest of the zzso zzso at greater than 3 zzso Western blots with zzso zzso zzso detected proteins of 32, 43 and 65 zzso in all zzso stages and a zzso protein in zzso forms, zzso the presence of a family of zzso zzso zzso have a remarkably large gene family of zzso zzso for such a primitive zzso The zzso genes may be involved in controlling aspects of the cell cycle which are linked to the differentiation of the zzso during its complex life zzso
