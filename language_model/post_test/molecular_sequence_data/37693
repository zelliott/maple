Several zzso acid bacteria produce so-called zzso zzso that share sequence zzso but differ in activity and target cell zzso The significance of a zzso zzso bridge present in only a few of these zzso was studied by zzso zzso of zzso zzso (which naturally contains the zzso and zzso P (which lacks the zzso Introduction of the zzso bridge into zzso P broadened the target cell specificity of this zzso as illustrated by the fact that the zzso were 10 to 20 times more potent than the zzso toward certain indicator zzso whereas the potency toward other indicator strains remained essentially zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso had the same potency at 20 and 37 degrees C, whereas zzso zzso P was approximately 10 times less potent at 37 degrees C than at 20 degrees zzso zzso effects on target cell specificity and the temperature dependence of potency were observed upon studying the effect of removing the zzso zzso bridge from zzso zzso by zzso zzso These results clearly show that a zzso zzso bridge in zzso zzso contributes to widening of the zzso spectrum as well as to higher potency at elevated zzso Interestingly, the differences between zzso P and zzso zzso in terms of the temperature dependency of their activities correlated well with the optimal temperatures for zzso production and growth of the zzso zzso
