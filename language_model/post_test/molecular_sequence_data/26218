The zzso maturation of zzso zzso zzso significant changes in the translation of a number of maternal zzso that coincide with zzso in their zzso zzso A considerable number of maternal zzso are zzso in mature zzso thereby reducing their zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso does not require specific zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from either zzso protein or zzso zzso or that contain zzso zzso are zzso in mature zzso zzso of a zzso zzso is not required for its zzso zzso zzso is representative of a class of zzso that is zzso activated at maturation and contains the zzso zzso element zzso A deletion zzso zzso transcript that lacks the zzso element is not zzso in mature zzso but is zzso zzso zzso of the zzso element into the zzso region of the zzso protein zzso zzso is sufficient to prevent both its zzso and zzso release in mature zzso These results indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso of maternal zzso during zzso zzso maturation occur by a default zzso in which transcripts lacking a zzso zzso element undergo zzso zzso
