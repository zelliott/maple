Human zzso protein zzso is a novel member of the expanding zzso zzso whose main characteristic is the presence, after the zzso domain, of a zzso extension of 184 zzso with no zzso with any other protein in the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expressed protein and it has been zzso with a zzso of the zzso family, which is zzso activated by zzso in zzso However, no cellular function has yet been assigned to this zzso In the present study we report the zzso organization of the zzso gene which encompasses approximately 36 zzso organized in eight zzso ranging from 96 zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso sizes are much bigger ranging from zzso zzso to 12 zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene revealed that it maps at position zzso a region frequently affected in different human zzso Furthermore, we have identified the putative zzso of zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso that display much closer zzso to the known zzso than the human zzso zzso Indeed, critical zzso for optimal zzso activity are present in both zzso and zzso zzso but absent in the human protein suggesting that zzso might have evolved to carry out a function different from the general zzso zzso typical of zzso
