zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is a zzso that coordinates two zzso in the active site when expressed in zzso coli in a buffer containing zzso zzso we report on the zzso induced copper for zzso exchange in protein zzso zzso thus enabling firm confirmation of the four zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in metal zzso By exchanging zzso with copper the zzso yields for the peptides increased dramatically, thus simplifying detection of the oxidized peptides and analysis of the zzso sites within the oxidized zzso We also found that when copper was added during the zzso process a new metal coordination center was formed at zzso 39, 105, zzso and zzso
