Group A zzso are a leading cause of zzso in humans and zzso zzso between zzso species and humans has been demonstrated zzso Here, the first entire zzso sequence zzso zzso of a chicken zzso strain zzso is zzso A low degree of zzso sequence identity with the zzso group A zzso is evident for all 11 zzso zzso whereas a closer relationship to available zzso sequences from avian species has been zzso According to a novel zzso zzso system, new zzso were proposed and ratified by the zzso zzso Working Group for eight of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso constellation zzso Due to the low percentages of zzso sequence identity, the different zzso segment sizes and the marked sequence differences of zzso zzso an independent evolution without exchange of genetic material between zzso and avian group A zzso strains is zzso
