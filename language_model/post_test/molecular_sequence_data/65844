Tomato is cultivated in the coastal region of zzso in the zzso of zzso during the winter season, to meet the high demand for fresh produce in the domestic zzso In order to identify the zzso agent of a widespread disease associated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves were collected from tomato plants showing symptoms characteristic of the disease in zzso during 2004 and zzso Total zzso acids were isolated from the tomato leaves and used as the template for zzso DNA zzso amplification of zzso circular zzso zzso full unit length zzso DNA zzso were zzso with zzso I and cloned into the zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso sequence was determined as zzso zzso indicative of a zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso sequence for the seven field zzso zzso indicated that they shared zzso zzso zzso The virus from zzso was most closely related to zzso at zzso zzso identity, a zzso zzso species described previously from zzso Based on the guidelines of the zzso the zzso isolate has been designated zzso and is considered an isolate of zzso A satellite DNA zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso and zzso and the DNA sequence was zzso Analysis of the complete zzso sequence of zzso bases indicated that the zzso shared zzso similarity with its closest relatives, which are DNA beta molecules from tomato in zzso This is the first report of a zzso beta associated with the zzso zzso The zzso and associated zzso thus represent a zzso at the zzso East crossroads that quiet uniquely share geographical and genetic hallmarks of zzso
