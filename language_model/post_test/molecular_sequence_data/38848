The zzso reverse zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso open reading frame was zzso and evaluated on zzso distinct zzso acid zzso zzso zzso migrated as a zzso by size exclusion zzso zzso zzso indicate zzso zzso protects template zzso zzso through zzso and primer zzso zzso through zzso zzso to previous data with zzso zzso a zzso pair region of the zzso duplex remained zzso zzso The zzso portion of zzso zzso encodes a functional zzso H domain, although the zzso profile suggests an increased spatial separation between the zzso zzso Despite conservation of zzso important zzso in the zzso H domain, zzso fails to replace zzso in the zzso H zzso center for localized generation of zzso zzso again suggesting this domain may be structurally distinct from its zzso zzso zzso H specificity was investigated using a model system challenging the zzso to select the zzso tract primer from within an zzso hybrid, extend this into zzso DNA, and zzso the primer from nascent zzso zzso zzso zzso each of these three steps but was almost inactive on a zzso tract zzso zzso Our studies provide the first detailed characterization of the zzso activities of a zzso reverse zzso
