Two new bacterial zzso zzso and zzso which have the ability to zzso zzso as their sole source of carbon and energy, were isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 100 zzso of zzso in liquid cultures within 16 zzso Besides zzso both strains also zzso 100 zzso of zzso almost completely within 8 days and zzso zzso and zzso of 100 zzso of zzso within 24 days, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that strains zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These two zzso have never been reported to be involved in zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification with zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso gene in both zzso The partial zzso gene products of both strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso identity to the zzso zzso which are the large zzso of terminal zzso for zzso degradation of zzso zzso In addition, zzso further demonstrated that zzso genes of these strains were located on a zzso This is the first report showing that zzso zzso bacteria harbor the zzso zzso
