zzso A virus causes worldwide zzso and zzso and the investigation of memory T helper zzso cells that help maintain zzso memory following infection is important for vaccine zzso In this study we investigated zzso and zzso gene expression in memory zzso zzso clones established from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice infected with influenza A virus zzso zzso and zzso proteins form zzso membrane receptors that are involved in virus zzso zzso and zzso expression have been well characterized in natural killer zzso and zzso T zzso Despite zzso being potentially an important marker for zzso cells involved in virus infection, however, there has been little investigation of its expression or function in the zzso zzso lineage and no studies have looked at zzso zzso cells or memory zzso We show in this study that zzso zzso zzso cells, but not zzso cells, exhibited full-length zzso and zzso gene expression following zzso with viral zzso For zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso was zzso in a zzso cell zzso Another member of the zzso zzso family, zzso but not zzso or zzso was also zzso expressed in zzso zzso We show here that zzso and zzso may exist as multiple zzso with the potential to distinguish helper zzso zzso
