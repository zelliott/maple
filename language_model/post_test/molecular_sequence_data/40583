Two novel zzso from zzso cone snails zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated as zzso and zzso were identified by zzso cloning and zzso zzso zzso The signal sequence of zzso is identical to that of zzso while its predicted mature zzso zzso shares high sequence similarity with zzso with only one zzso different in their first zzso loop, which contains 10 zzso and is rich in zzso Both zzso and zzso contain four separate zzso in framework 14 zzso zzso zzso was chemically zzso air zzso and the connectivity of its two zzso bonds was determined to be zzso zzso which is the same as found in zzso The synthetic zzso induced a sleeping symptom in mice and was toxic to freshwater goldfish upon intramuscular zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso expression system, zzso of zzso demonstrated to inhibit the rat zzso zzso as well as the mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and then rapidly zzso from the zzso However, this toxin had no zzso effect on zzso channels in mouse superior cervical zzso zzso According to the identical signal sequence to zzso the unique zzso framework and molecular target of zzso we propose that zzso and zzso may represent a novel zzso in the zzso designated as zzso
