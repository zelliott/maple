The zzso peptides from peripheral blood zzso cells of 2 patients with zzso and 1 with chronic zzso leukemia were isolated, identified, and zzso Several were identified as derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso (or human zzso peptides zzso are zzso zzso peptides of 29 to 35 zzso acids in length and are the major constituents of the zzso zzso of human zzso Using peripheral blood cells from zzso containing about zzso of zzso cells, we could identify zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of up to 49 zzso acids in zzso zzso from zzso class II zzso zzso of isolated and synthetic zzso peptides to various zzso zzso using an in zzso zzso zzso based on size exclusion zzso revealed that zzso may bind into the zzso zzso In a zzso competition zzso zzso were able to reduce the proliferation of an zzso zzso line after zzso of stimulating cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso binding of zzso might prevent zzso recognition of zzso class II molecules expressed on different blood precursor cells (all of which are zzso zzso zzso by blocking the zzso zzso groove or, zzso might protect zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso
