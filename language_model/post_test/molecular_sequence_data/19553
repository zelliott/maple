zzso zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to play an important role in zzso invasion, and zzso In this study, we investigated the signal pathways selectively activated by zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells to determine the role of zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso migration and zzso A stable zzso cell clone zzso expressing zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso was established and was then characterized by cell growth, migration, and zzso The expression of zzso was decreased in zzso and cell growth, migration, and invasion were zzso These changes were associated with the decrease in zzso zzso zzso level, but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This phenomenon was confirmed in the zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the dependency of zzso zzso in zzso migration and zzso zzso of cell migration and invasion was revealed in the zzso cells treated with the zzso or zzso but not with zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso active zzso or zzso may restore the zzso of zzso and the zzso of cell migration and invasion in zzso Similar findings were observed in the stable zzso cell clone expressing zzso zzso This study provides new insight into the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso especially in zzso cancer cell invasion, which may have valuable implications for developing new therapies for some zzso zzso
