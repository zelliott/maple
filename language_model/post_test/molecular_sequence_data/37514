To investigate the zzso of the basic core promoter zzso of zzso B virus zzso and clarify the significance of zzso zzso groups in patients with chronic zzso zzso 

A set of specific zzso was zzso according to the zzso DNA sequence of a Chinese zzso The zzso was amplified by zzso method from the serum of 40 patients with chronic zzso infection, and the zzso products of 2 patients were zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was employed to display the deletion zzso and clones with differential length were selected to be zzso zzso comparison was made to find the zzso 

Two or three bands were displayed by PAGE in zzso zzso The results of sequence analysis showed that there are some kinds of zzso in the zzso zzso The substitution always occurs in zzso boxes, especially from T to C on 140 zzso The deletion zzso were detected in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso deletion zzso frequently zzso 

There is a hot deletion region in the zzso The deletion and the substitution in the zzso box may influence the expression of zzso zzso The sequencing results indicate that there are zzso zzso groups in patients with chronic zzso zzso
