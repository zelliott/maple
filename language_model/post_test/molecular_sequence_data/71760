It has been hypothesized that zzso receptors may be activated and attenuated by more than one zzso Here, we explore a zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and provide an explanation to the zzso of why zzso zzso zzso zzso can both activate and zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso By using a soluble zzso zzso zzso as a model for the full-length zzso we were able to zzso compare zzso rates and zzso among the serum zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso bond with a zzso of 120 zzso and a zzso of 16 zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso We found that, of the zzso zzso only zzso can rapidly zzso the soluble zzso at the zzso sites located on a zzso region that zzso the zzso to the body of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is nearly equivalent to that of zzso zzso at zzso with similar rates zzso zzso 30 zzso and affinity zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso was demonstrated since there is no observed zzso at the five other potential zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site generating zzso activated zzso We directly demonstrated that zzso zzso these same sites in full-length zzso zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso The rate of zzso zzso is similar between the extensively zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sites to zzso eliminates zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling and converts zzso into a zzso zzso with full zzso activity for zzso zzso does not zzso the zzso response of zzso or zzso cells to zzso consistent with zzso zzso sites being located to the zzso side of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso sites removes the zzso zzso zzso or zzso thereby providing an effective zzso for zzso zzso in zzso
