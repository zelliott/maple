zzso zzso zzso has zzso actions on zzso but it is not certain if all these events are zzso by a single zzso A single gene for the zzso zzso zzso extensive alternate zzso generating multiple zzso and several of these have been cloned and characterized from the sheep zzso In this study we have investigated the expression in zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso cells of a cloned zzso zzso the first eight zzso of the zzso zzso along with a zzso extension that contributed a hypothetical single zzso zzso This zzso which lacked the conventional seven zzso motif of the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also efficiently expressed on the cell surface and exhibited high affinity and specificity for zzso zzso zzso did not compete for zzso binding indicating that these structures contained all the motifs necessary for specific hormone zzso Following hormone binding and affinity zzso the deduced zzso of the expressed zzso was compatible with zzso zzso The expression of these altered zzso receptors on the cell surface was confirmed by zzso which revealed zzso labeling in a pattern comparable to that shown by cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso incorporation in zzso cells in a zzso zzso By performing zzso we could show that similar altered zzso transcripts were present in both the zzso and zzso Our results reveal for the first time that the seven zzso structure of zzso is not absolutely necessary for cell surface expression and hormone binding provided other zzso motifs are present in the protein structure for membrane zzso Some of these features are typical of growth factor zzso Our investigations also demonstrate that alternate zzso of the zzso zzso gene provides a mechanism for creating zzso diversity and suggest that multiple receptors could be involved in regulation of hormone zzso
