The development of zzso arthritis, a sterile inflammatory zzso that primarily affects zzso positive individuals, has been associated with previous enteric infections caused by various zzso zzso The possibility that a common bacterial zzso triggers the disease was investigated by screening a panel of documented zzso zzso strains as well as 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso specific to the zzso strains was identified and zzso The zzso encodes a number of small peptides that could be related to the development of zzso zzso Within 1 of these is a stretch of 5 consecutive zzso zzso zzso from the DNA sequence and contained within an open reading frame, that is zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso region of the alpha 1 domain of zzso The data indicate that there is a bacterial zzso common to zzso zzso strains that may play a role in triggering zzso zzso The finding that this zzso encodes an zzso shared with zzso suggests that molecular mimicry may play a role in the induction of this zzso
