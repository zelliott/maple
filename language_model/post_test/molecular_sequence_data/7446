zzso oxide produced by zzso zzso oxide zzso in zzso exerts zzso and zzso effects on pancreatic beta cells and is therefore thought to be a potent zzso in the zzso of Type I diabetes zzso Here, using isolated rat pancreatic zzso we show that zzso zzso (20 zzso but not zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso insulin zzso by preventing the induction of zzso regulatory zzso a zzso factor which plays an essential role in zzso zzso oxide zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso also restored an zzso zzso decrease in zzso content in pancreatic beta cells, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso the zzso zzso The present results show the molecular basis of the preventive effect of high-dose zzso on Type I diabetes zzso
