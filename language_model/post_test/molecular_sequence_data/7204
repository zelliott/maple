The zzso are a family of proteins that exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and bind the zzso agent zzso A zzso to varying zzso We have isolated a zzso clone zzso a novel zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene possesses an zzso domain zzso to zzso from diverse zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain was zzso in zzso coli and found to possess zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in lieu of zzso in the highly zzso zzso site suggests that zzso zzso zzso is more closely related to the zzso proteins described recently from natural killer zzso cells, plants, and the 40 zzso zzso from zzso In accordance with the zzso zzso domain, the zzso zzso zzso was relatively insensitive to zzso by zzso since an zzso value of 860 zzso zzso to 19 zzso for human zzso zzso was zzso
