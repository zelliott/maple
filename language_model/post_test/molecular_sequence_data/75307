zzso inhibitor is composed of three distinct protein zzso These protein components stem from independently zzso and zzso processed precursor zzso Only the structure of the protein component responsible for the zzso activity has been established so zzso We now present the complete zzso acid sequence of the precursor of the second protein component derived from cloned zzso The precursor zzso includes both a signal zzso and a zzso sequence and seems to be further processed prior to the assembly of the zzso inhibitor zzso
