In animal cells, zzso has been reported to cause zzso zzso generate zzso oxygen species and increase the level of large zzso zzso Plant viability tests and DNA zzso experiments have shown that zzso minor remains viable after exposure to 50 zzso zzso for periods of at least 6 zzso However, protein metabolism is affected in two major ways: the synthesis of an array of stress zzso which zzso zzso and an increase in the amount of large zzso zzso particularly evident after 2-3 h of stress, indicative of a role for the zzso zzso This outcome is primarily attributed to an increased availability of protein zzso during zzso treatment for three main reasons: an increase in protein zzso content after 1-2 h of zzso moderate increments in the transcript levels of the sequences coding for the zzso zzso components chosen as markers zzso E1 and zzso and the beta zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the observed increase in zzso zzso does not depend on de zzso protein zzso This study is the first report on the involvement of the zzso zzso in response to zzso in zzso In addition, it addresses the simultaneous expression of selected genes zzso the various components of the zzso The results suggest that in plants, unlike in animals, the response to a relatively low level of zzso does not induce zzso cell zzso As a whole, the response to zzso apparently involves a zzso of salvage and zzso zzso including heat shock protein synthesis and the zzso zzso
