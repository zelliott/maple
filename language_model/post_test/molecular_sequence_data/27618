The zzso regulatory zzso light chain zzso also known as zzso plays an important role in the regulation of both smooth muscle and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso zzso zzso activity and thereby regulates the zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized an zzso zzso corresponding to the human vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso from a zzso library derived from zzso artery zzso The translation of the in zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso in a rabbit zzso zzso results in the synthesis of a zzso protein that is zzso with zzso raised against zzso chicken gizzard zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of the putative human smooth muscle zzso shows only three zzso acid differences when compared to chicken gizzard zzso However, comparison with the human cardiac zzso reveals only zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicate that the human smooth muscle zzso zzso is expressed zzso in smooth muscle zzso such as colon and zzso and in some, but not all, zzso cell zzso Previously reported zzso zzso from rat zzso smooth muscle cells in culture is zzso expressed in all muscle and zzso cells, and it was suggested that both smooth muscle and zzso zzso proteins are identical and are probably zzso by the same zzso In contrast, the human smooth muscle zzso zzso that we have characterized from an intact smooth muscle tissue is not expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles and also in a number of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
