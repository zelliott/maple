zzso zzso is a protein of the zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso and plays a crucial role in muscular development for higher zzso However, its biological function in marine zzso remains zzso This study characterizes the full-length sequence of the zzso zzso myostatin gene zzso Furthermore, tissue zzso patterns and putative single zzso zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso zzso sequence showed zzso base pairs zzso consisting of 161 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of 3' zzso and an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso acids and with an zzso zzso site and nine zzso zzso Gene zzso analysis revealed that the zzso has ubiquitous expression among several zzso with higher expression in the zzso and mantle than in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, high levels of zzso were detected zzso zzso in zzso and 9 zzso in the coding zzso Two zzso were zzso and involved zzso acid changes between zzso and zzso Until now, the zzso gene has been mainly related to muscle growth in marine zzso However, the present study suggests a putative biological function not entirely associated to muscle tissue and contributes molecular evidence to the current debate about the function of the zzso gene in marine zzso
