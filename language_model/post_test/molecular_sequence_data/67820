The zzso of zzso zzso zzso extensive zzso editing that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce mature zzso The zzso is a zzso complex that provides zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities required for zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins are essential for zzso integrity and zzso viability and contain zzso motifs corresponding to zinc finger, zzso III, and zzso zzso but to date no functional analysis of these zzso has been zzso We show here that various point zzso to zzso and zzso identify essential zzso and suggest that these proteins do not themselves perform zzso III zzso The zinc finger of zzso but not zzso is essential for zzso integrity and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso III signature motif in zzso prevents integration into zzso which is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes zzso associate with components of the deletion zzso providing additional insights into zzso zzso A new alignment of zzso zzso III sequences from several zzso species implies that zzso and zzso lack zzso activity and reveals that the zzso motif is present in the editing zzso zzso zzso and zzso The data presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso and zzso form zzso zzso with the zzso active editing zzso which is unprecedented among known zzso III zzso
