zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1) is a sea zzso zzso of the zzso basic zzso zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso was initially cloned from zzso zzso where zzso demonstrated restricted expression in precursors of the zzso muscles, the only identified muscle cells in the early zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso embryonic expression is not restricted to the zzso zzso a distinct population of zzso cells also expresses zzso For comparative purposes, we cloned the zzso zzso in the zzso related sea urchin, zzso zzso where we found zzso transcripts in the same population of zzso zzso
