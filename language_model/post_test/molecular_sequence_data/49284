The influenza B virus zzso protein contains 109 zzso acid zzso and it is translated from a zzso zzso in an open reading frame that is zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso contains a zzso region zzso zzso that could act as a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of properties of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso in zzso pH 11, zzso in membrane zzso and zzso zzso indicates zzso protein is the fourth integral membrane protein zzso by influenza B virus in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso protein adopts an zzso orientation in zzso and zzso zzso indicates zzso is expressed at the cell zzso As the zzso protein possesses only a single zzso domain and lacks a zzso signal zzso it is another example of a Type III integral membrane zzso in addition to zzso zzso and zzso proteins of influenza A, B, and C zzso zzso Chemical zzso studies indicate that the zzso protein is zzso most likely a zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the TM domain of the zzso protein with the sequence of the TM domain of the zzso zzso channel zzso protein of influenza A virus is intriguing as zzso protein zzso critical for zzso zzso and channel gating zzso and zzso zzso are found at the same relative position and spacing in the zzso protein zzso and zzso
