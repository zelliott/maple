The expression of each of the zzso coli zzso and zzso genes is activated by the common positive regulator, zzso in response to the medium zzso The promoters for these genes consist of zzso zzso and zzso regions, and upstream zzso zzso In this study, we constructed a functional zzso zzso promoter consisting of the zzso site of zzso and the zzso and zzso regions of zzso which was fused to the zzso gene on a zzso zzso It is known that the zzso and zzso genes are expressed in a different manner in cells with zzso in the zzso zzso In this respect, it was found that the zzso zzso promoter behaves just like zzso promoter with respect to an zzso zzso zzso It was revealed that, in this zzso promoter, the zzso site must be located zzso with respect to the zzso and zzso regions for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter to zzso These results are discussed in relation to the structures and functions of the zzso and zzso zzso the occurrence of a DNA zzso in the promoter regions being zzso which may be an important zzso for the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso
