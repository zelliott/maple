We have compared all available deduced protein sequences of the zzso family of receptors and their zzso Analysis of the aligned sequences of the receptors indicates that there are some differences in the receptors that are specific to zzso In addition, comparison of the zzso zzso receptors suggest that a gene zzso event generated two ancestral zzso the zzso precursor and the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of these precursors generated the four receptors present in zzso Analysis of the sequences for the known zzso of the zzso receptors suggests that the zzso zzso segregate into the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the evolution of the zzso however, it is difficult to ascertain any correlation between the zzso and the zzso zzso Even though zzso is zzso there is significant conservation of the zzso domain within the zzso lineage zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting some function for this domain other than zzso activity, such as zzso zzso interactions that are involved in zzso zzso and/or zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso To date, no zzso for zzso has been identified, and comparison of the zzso zzso of zzso reveals two regions that are not zzso across the zzso zzso These two regions of divergence align with sequences in zzso that have been shown to be zzso to the zzso and to the zzso region, respectively, of bound zzso Further, one of these regions contains an zzso relative to the other members of the zzso zzso family, which might affect the zzso binding site and provide a structural basis for this zzso apparent inability to bind zzso zzso
