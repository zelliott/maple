We have used a group of human zzso zzso modified by zzso zzso zzso zzso and chain breaks zzso to study the zzso of productive interactions with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to explore the basis of species specificity in the zzso complex zzso and zzso to compare active SK complex formation in zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso loop containing the zzso site and the adjacent zzso upstream sequence showed that zzso recognition elements zzso zzso at the zzso site and multiple elements extending upstream to perhaps 13 zzso all maintained in specific zzso register by surrounding pairs of zzso zzso A generally parallel pattern of structural requirements was observed for active zzso complex zzso Changes within the loop downstream of the zzso site were tolerated well by zzso and poorly by zzso The introduction of selected short bovine zzso sequences in human zzso reduced the activity of the resulting SK zzso The requirements for active SK complex formation are different for zzso and zzso
