To identify DNA sequences that are deleted in human lung cancer, zzso zzso zzso was used to construct zzso libraries that are enriched for DNA sequences deleted in the small cell lung zzso cell line zzso The clones of the libraries contained predominantly single copy zzso allowing direct screening of normal and tumor DNA by zzso Southern zzso Of 150 clones tested, three independent clones zzso zzso and zzso were identified that specifically zzso with normal human DNA but not with tumor DNA from the cell line zzso The corresponding DNA sequences are localized on human zzso 5, 8, and zzso The DNA regions identified by zzso and zzso were also found to be deleted in several other lung zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso was deleted in a freshly isolated zzso zzso zzso of a human lung zzso It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the identified clones are derived from independent genetic zzso zzso potential tumor zzso zzso
