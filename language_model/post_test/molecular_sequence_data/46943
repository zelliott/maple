By selectively eliminating zzso zzso the zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in a large variety of cellular regulatory zzso particularly in the control of cell cycle zzso Access of zzso zzso to the inner zzso chamber within the zzso core particle is zzso by the zzso regulatory particle zzso whose zzso composition in budding zzso has been recently zzso In this study, we have investigated the cell cycle defects resulting from conditional zzso of one of these zzso zzso the essential zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso do not prevent the zzso transition but cause a zzso arrest, indicating that the essential zzso function is limiting for zzso zzso zzso appear severely compromised in the zzso zzso of several zzso important zzso zzso Thus, zzso function is required for the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso targeted by zzso the zzso zzso zzso whose zzso is likely to involve a combination of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso complex targets, such as the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso Our results indicate that the zzso degradation zzso of the zzso zzso most likely accounts for the zzso arrest zzso zzso Surprisingly, but consistent with the lack of a zzso arrest zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso exhibits a short zzso regardless of the zzso zzso In striking contrast, zzso turnover is severely impaired by a zzso zzso in zzso zzso another essential zzso zzso While other interpretations are possible, these data strongly argue for the requirement of distinct zzso zzso for efficient zzso of specific cell cycle zzso The potential implications of these data are discussed in the context of possible zzso function in zzso zzso recognition by the zzso zzso regulatory zzso
