The zzso zzso are a zzso of zzso zzso responsible for the metabolism of a wide variety of zzso and zzso zzso The individual zzso exhibit unique zzso specificity and zzso profiles which reflect corresponding differences in primary sequence and zzso zzso In the absence of an experimental structure models for zzso zzso have been generated by their zzso with bacterial zzso of known zzso The rather low sequence identity between target and template proteins renders zzso modeling a challenging zzso However, the zzso recognition properties of several zzso are consistent with recently developed working zzso This review summarizes the major concepts and current approaches of molecular modeling of zzso
