We report here the molecular zzso zzso and zzso of a human zzso of rat zzso which we have termed zzso The zzso contains a single open reading frame, which encodes a zzso protein with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso shows high identity at the zzso acid level with the other zzso zzso zzso and zzso Northern analysis revealed that zzso expresses as a single zzso transcript, mainly in the zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso head group of zzso and zzso zzso with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with it functioning as a putative zzso zzso In keeping with this conclusion, we have shown that zzso zzso recruits to the plasma membrane in a zzso zzso manner and the recruitment is inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These results suggest that zzso can function as an in zzso zzso zzso zzso
