zzso expression of human zzso zzso zzso elements in the W family has previously been associated with zzso multiple sclerosis and zzso Little is know regarding the zzso zzso zzso regulation and functional significance of individual zzso Since viral infections have previously been reported to zzso zzso long terminal repeat regions we examined the zzso expression of zzso elements and following infections by influenza zzso and zzso zzso 1 viruses in human zzso 

Relative levels of transcripts zzso zzso elements and cellular genes were analyzed by zzso zzso An analysis of zzso melting temperatures was used to detect variations in the zzso of zzso in discrete ranges of such melting zzso These zzso were taken as proxy markers for the zzso of transcribed zzso elements in the zzso 

We report zzso expression patterns of zzso elements during zzso zzso zzso elements include those with intact regulatory long terminal repeat regions zzso as well as elements flanked by truncated zzso zzso of zzso elements were zzso by viral infection in the different zzso zzso zzso of these zzso including that zzso zzso was dependent on viral replication and was not induced by zzso zzso zzso deprivation of cells induced similar changes in the expression of zzso elements suggesting that the observed phenomena are, in part, an effect of cellular zzso 

We found that zzso zzso including elements lacking regulatory zzso are expressed in zzso patterns which can be modulated by environmental zzso This brings into light that mechanisms behind the regulation of expression of zzso elements are more complex than previously assumed and suggests biological functions of these zzso
