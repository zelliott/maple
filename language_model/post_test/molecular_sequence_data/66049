The origin and modes of transmission of zzso remain matters of much zzso Previous studies of the group I zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso frequent zzso horizontal transmission of the zzso from apparent zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso distribution of the zzso among zzso and differences between zzso zzso zzso tracts (the first 22 zzso downstream of where the zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso gene in 179 zzso 110 of them containing the zzso zzso and 69 lacking it zzso Our zzso sampling in zzso is especially dense to test hypotheses about vertical and horizontal zzso transmission put forward by zzso and Palmer zzso Multiple acquisitions via horizontal transfer of a group I zzso in the zzso zzso gene during evolution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso likelihood trees of zzso zzso zzso and also of all zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso with known zzso relationships in these zzso The exceptions can be explained by low signal in the zzso and zzso attraction among a few zzso with high zzso substitution zzso Analysis of the 179 zzso tracts reveals 20 types of tracts (11 of them only found in single species, all involving silent zzso The distribution of these tracts on the zzso zzso shows a common ancestral type, characterizing most zzso and some zzso zzso and several zzso tract types arising from gradual back zzso of the zzso zzso zzso clock dating of small zzso and zzso sister zzso suggests that zzso tracts have persisted for 70 zzso in zzso whose zzso sequences evolve comparatively zzso zzso similarity among the 110 zzso ranges from zzso to zzso whereas putative zzso from zzso are highly different, but sampling in zzso is still zzso Together, these results suggest that the zzso zzso entered zzso once, has largely or entirely been transmitted zzso and has been lost numerous times, with zzso tract zzso providing unreliable signal of former zzso zzso
