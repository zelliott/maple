zzso and zzso are two related genes which zzso for proteins that play important roles in negative growth control, including both growth suppression and zzso A strategy was employed to clone new members of the zzso and zzso family of zzso Based on alignment of the deduced zzso acid zzso one zzso clone was found to zzso for the zzso zzso of human zzso originally cloned as an zzso zzso response zzso The zzso and human zzso proteins were observed to be zzso zzso indicating that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression during zzso cell development associated with growth arrest and zzso cell death, upon exposure of zzso cells to a variety of growth arrest and zzso zzso and in a variety of zzso zzso has revealed that zzso expression differs significantly from the expression of the related zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso like zzso and zzso suppressed colony formation of human lung zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso plays similar, but not zzso roles to zzso and zzso in negative control of cell zzso
