zzso zzso where the zzso of two neighboring zzso layers are tightly zzso have been proposed as fundamental structural units of zzso zzso by Eisenberg and zzso The zzso zzso formed by zzso containing the zzso sequence zzso has a distinctive feature that the distance between two zzso zzso layers is comparable to the zzso distance of the individual zzso This structural motif is of great interest in the study of prion disease because the zzso sequence is highly zzso in prion proteins of different zzso In this work, the zzso zzso formed by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso are taken as the model compound to investigate the zzso principles governing the zzso zzso zzso The target zzso adopt the structural motif of class 7 zzso zzso which is formed by stacking of zzso zzso layers with zzso 117 + k forming backbone hydrogen bonds to zzso 120 - zzso zzso of our results in the zzso of zzso prion is briefly zzso
