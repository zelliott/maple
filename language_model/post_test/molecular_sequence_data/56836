zzso is a biologically potent zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso In a previous study we have reported that zzso produces zzso of DNA that has similarities to that zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Sun, zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso In this article we provide evidence using a combination of zzso gel analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso for both distinctions between the two types of zzso and the importance of junctions in both types of zzso For zzso we demonstrate that the locus of zzso is at the center of an zzso and that upon modification of the 3' zzso with zzso this locus is moved less than 1 base pair to the 3' side, and the zzso magnitude is significantly zzso For drug bonding sequences such as zzso or zzso (where * denotes the drug bonding zzso the locus of zzso is found to be between the two zzso and the zzso is focused over a zzso sequence rather than a zzso zzso as is the case for the zzso An important distinction between an zzso intrinsic bend and a zzso bend is the effect of zzso zzso as shown zzso the magnitude of zzso zzso increases with decrease in temperature, for drug-induced zzso of zzso the zzso magnitude increases with increased zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
