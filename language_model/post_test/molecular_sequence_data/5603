zzso a zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso polarization and zzso in zzso cells, but the zzso zzso this control remain zzso Through the use of the complete zzso zzso zzso we have identified two novel zzso targets, zzso and zzso which contain consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso and bind specifically to zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso as cell polarity is established during the cell cycle and during mating in response to zzso zzso deleted for both zzso genes exhibit defects in zzso and zzso polarization similar to those observed in zzso zzso Finally, the interaction of the zzso proteins and zzso is essential, as zzso in the zzso domain of zzso that eliminate zzso binding disrupt zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso and zzso define a novel class of zzso targets that are specifically required for zzso polarization in zzso
