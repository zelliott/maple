The zzso zzso zzso domain is a versatile module adapted for zzso of zzso bond formation in various zzso and biological zzso Its zzso bundle structure juxtaposes a zzso zzso motif with a bound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enabling transfer of electrons from zzso zzso to zzso electron zzso zzso family members contain an additional zzso motif outside the zzso zzso Although the location and context of this zzso zzso differs among family members, it is proposed to perform the same basic function of zzso electron transfer from zzso to the zzso active zzso We have determined by X-ray zzso the structure of zzso an zzso zzso that contains a zzso shuttle zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and compared it to zzso which has a zzso shuttle and does not zzso zzso at an appreciable zzso The zzso shuttle zzso is in a region of the structure that is zzso and thus apparently mobile and zzso This feature may facilitate access of protein zzso to the shuttle zzso To test whether the shuttle zzso region is modular and can zzso on other zzso zzso activity toward new zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso combining shuttle zzso and core elements from zzso and zzso and monitored zzso of zzso by the zzso We found that the zzso shuttle zzso region could indeed zzso zzso zzso activity on the zzso zzso zzso various zzso containing the zzso zzso shuttle zzso were found to function efficiently as zzso Since neither the zzso core nor the zzso motif is therefore incapable of participating in zzso of zzso we conclude that zzso zzso has evolved to repress activity on zzso of this type, perhaps in favor of a different, as yet unknown, zzso
