zzso membrane zzso zzso is a major component of the cell surface of zzso and acts as a potent zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso secondary structure adopts mainly an zzso zzso at pH zzso and that its zzso and zzso unfolding constitute a fully zzso zzso zzso This allows zzso of a zzso temperature of approximately 65 degrees C, a delta zzso at 20 degrees C of approximately zzso zzso and an zzso of the reaction heat of approximately zzso zzso and an zzso of approximately zzso zzso respectively, for the zzso equilibrium of the zzso in zzso We also report that the zzso protein is induced to adopt a molten zzso state at a pH range between pH 4 and pH zzso As a whole, the stability and the specific features of the zzso effect induced by changes in pH are similar in zzso to various other zzso
