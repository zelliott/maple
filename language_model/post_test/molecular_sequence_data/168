To investigate the presence of high-risk human zzso virus zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso in a zzso Mexican zzso 

Cases with a pathological diagnosis of zzso cell zzso of the esophagus were obtained from Department of zzso files, at the National Cancer Institute in Mexico City during the period between 2000 and zzso zzso from each case were reviewed and cases with sufficient zzso tissue were selected for molecular zzso DNA was extracted from zzso tissue samples for zzso chain reaction analysis to detect zzso DNA zzso zzso and clinical data of each patient were retrieved from corresponding clinical zzso 

zzso was detected in 15 zzso of zzso zzso was the most frequently observed zzso followed by zzso zzso was also detected in one zzso Unfortunately, zzso zzso could not be established in three cases due to lack of material for direct sequencing, although universal zzso detected the presence of zzso generic zzso No low-risk zzso zzso were found nor was zzso zzso zzso presence in zzso was not significantly associated with zzso age, alcohol consumption, smoking, zzso location, or zzso zzso All patients belonged to low and very low socioeconomic zzso and were diagnosed at advanced disease zzso Male patients were most commonly affected and the zzso ratio in zzso zzso increased zzso in comparison with zzso cases zzso vs zzso 

High prevalence of high-risk zzso in zzso in Mexico does not support the hypothesis that zzso zzso is more common in areas with higher zzso zzso zzso
