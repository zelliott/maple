There is an intense debate concerning whether selection or demographics has been most important in shaping the sequence variation observed in modern human zzso DNA zzso zzso selection is thought to be important in shaping zzso sequence evolution, but the strength of this selection has been zzso mainly due to the threshold effect of zzso zzso zzso and an observed excess of new zzso zzso in human population zzso We zzso addressed this issue by studying the maternal transmission of random zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice expressing a zzso zzso DNA zzso We report a rapid and strong elimination of zzso changes in zzso zzso the hallmark of zzso zzso There are striking similarities between the zzso patterns in our experimental mouse system and human zzso zzso These data show strong zzso selection against zzso within zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, our study presents the first direct experimental observations of the fate of random zzso zzso in the zzso germ line and demonstrates the importance of zzso selection in shaping zzso sequence zzso
