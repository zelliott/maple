In most cases, zzso coli exists as a harmless zzso zzso but it may on occasion cause zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso is the zzso cause of zzso zzso zzso in the developing world and is responsible for a significant portion of pediatric zzso In this study, we determined the complete zzso sequence of zzso coli zzso a zzso strain of zzso zzso coli, which zzso elicits zzso in human volunteer zzso We performed zzso and zzso comparisons with other zzso coli zzso revealing that the zzso is closely related to that of the zzso zzso strain zzso coli HS and to those of the laboratory strains zzso coli K-12 and zzso Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that there were no zzso zzso factors unique to any zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso plasmids with those from several zzso strains revealed that the plasmids had a mosaic structure but that several zzso were zzso among zzso zzso This study provides a genetic context for the vast amount of experimental and zzso data that have been zzso
