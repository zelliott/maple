The product of the zzso zzso gene zzso is highly zzso to the zzso zzso release factor 1 zzso which has release factor activity in zzso We show, using the zzso system, that in zzso zzso zzso and the product of the zzso gene zzso interact in zzso The ability of zzso zzso zzso with zzso to specifically zzso zzso from a cell zzso was used to confirm this interaction in zzso Although zzso of either the zzso or zzso genes alone did not reduce the efficiency of zzso zzso nonsense suppression, the simultaneous zzso of both the zzso and zzso genes in nonsense zzso zzso strains produced an zzso zzso These data are consistent with zzso and zzso forming a complex with release factor zzso Furthermore, zzso of either zzso or human zzso zzso genes also resulted in zzso only if that strain was also zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a characteristic zzso associated with zzso of both zzso and zzso release zzso We propose that zzso and zzso interact to form a release factor complex in zzso and that zzso which has zzso binding sequence motifs in its zzso domain, provides the zzso zzso activity which is a demonstrated requirement of the zzso translation termination zzso
