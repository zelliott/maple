We have characterized the structure and the function of the zzso protein zzso (formerly called zzso from the zzso virus zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso at 85 degrees C in hot zzso zzso The protein forms a zzso in zzso The zzso solution structure of the protein consists of a zzso zzso fold between zzso 13 and 56 and a zzso zzso region zzso zzso The structure is very similar to that of bacterial zzso proteins despite the low sequence zzso We demonstrated that the protein binds DNA and uses its zzso face for the interaction like bacterial zzso zzso To detect all the binding sites on the zzso zzso linear zzso we designed and performed a global zzso search of targets based on a simplified zzso mobility shift zzso Four targets were recognized by the zzso The strongest binding was observed with the promoter of the gene coding for a zzso structural zzso When zzso in a host zzso in zzso zzso system, the protein zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso from the latter promoter, as well as from the promoter of its own zzso
