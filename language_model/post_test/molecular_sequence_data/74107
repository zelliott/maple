zzso is one of the major heavy metal pollutants found in the aquatic zzso zzso it is important for determining the genes that play a key role in copper metabolism in aquatic zzso This study, thus, aimed to identify a new zzso gene in zzso fish, zzso zzso Using zzso zzso coupled with zzso we cloned zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The gene exhibits high identity at zzso acid levels with the zzso gene of other fish species zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, ten zzso and two zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso fish zzso zzso These zzso zzso are vital for structural integrity, and zzso zzso provide high binding affinity towards zzso As revealed by zzso the gene was zzso in zzso fish that were exposed to copper in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso the identification of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso as a new zzso gene will provide greater insight into the role of this gene in copper zzso
