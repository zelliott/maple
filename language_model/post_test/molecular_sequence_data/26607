The wheat stem zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that feeds exclusively on members of the zzso zzso zzso it has become one of the most important insect zzso of wheat grown in the northern Great Plains region of the USA and zzso zzso are generally ineffective because of the wheat stem zzso extended adult flight period and its zzso zzso stage, during which it feeds within the wheat zzso making it virtually intractable to most zzso management zzso While research towards integrated zzso management strategies based on insect zzso has proved promising, nothing is known about the molecular basis of zzso in this important zzso zzso In this study we identified 28 unique zzso zzso zzso transcripts from an zzso zzso A zzso analysis with the predicted zzso from the honey bee and jewel zzso zzso revealed at least four zzso zzso amongst all three zzso zzso zzso expression levels were zzso using quantitative real-time zzso and one zzso and five zzso zzso were zzso This study provides the basis for future functional analyses to identify zzso active zzso that can be used to help develop zzso zzso management zzso
