These techniques permit the production of bulk quantities of zzso and provide methods for monitoring the zzso of zzso zzso performed in the zzso require low protein zzso sampling is not necessary (with zzso in zzso and the measured zzso signal is indicative of zzso content and is not complicated by the presence of zzso zzso However, zzso using the zzso shaker is a simple, zzso initial zzso adequate for screening for zzso potential, in which multiple experiments can be performed simultaneously and over long periods of zzso These methods may be used to investigate the zzso of zzso proteins and zzso as a means of predicting zzso as well as providing information on the basic zzso principles underlying light chain zzso
