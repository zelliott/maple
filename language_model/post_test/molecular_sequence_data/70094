A DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene with adjacent zzso was used as a probe for the detection of zzso sequences in zzso DNA of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso which zzso with the probe, was isolated and zzso No zzso zzso gene was located on the zzso zzso DNA zzso Two regions could be distinguished in the sequence of the zzso Region 1, which was zzso identical to the sequence upstream of the zzso gene of zzso zzso and region 2, which had no identity with any known zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso within region 1 and a 650 zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso within region 2 were used as DNA zzso on restriction zzso zzso of zzso DNA from various bacterial zzso This zzso experiment showed that the region 2 sequence was specific for zzso zzso A zzso chain reaction zzso with specific zzso within region 2 resulted in the amplification of a 500 zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso DNA zzso This zzso is a useful method for the rapid detection of zzso zzso and appeared useful to discriminate zzso zzso from other zzso species and also from zzso zzso
