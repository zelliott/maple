We have cloned and zzso a DNA zzso that encodes the zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of an open reading frame of zzso zzso which specifies a zzso protein of relative molecular mass zzso zzso The zzso deduced from the zzso gene is in good agreement with that of the zzso isolated from zzso zzso No zzso or zzso sequence was observed within the cloned DNA fragment, but the zzso was expressed in zzso coli by the zzso promoter of zzso The zzso produced in zzso coli has the same zzso and the same zzso activity as that zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the DNA sequence and the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with available DNA and zzso acid sequence data bases revealed that there are no significant sequence zzso
