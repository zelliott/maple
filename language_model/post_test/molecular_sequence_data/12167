The role of zzso in zzso transfer to reduced QB in the reaction center zzso from zzso zzso was studied by zzso replacement of zzso with zzso having different zzso donor properties, zzso the zzso zzso Ala and zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso zzso Compared to native reaction centers, zzso with Ala or zzso at zzso had greatly reduced zzso zzso zzso electron transfer rates, zzso associated with the second electron reduction of QB zzso + zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso at zzso retained fast zzso electron transfer zzso zzso with His or zzso at zzso did not bind the secondary zzso zzso These results show that zzso is larger when a good zzso transfer group, zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso acid zzso occupies the zzso site, supporting the proposal that zzso is a component of a zzso transfer chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 87, zzso The surprising result that zzso is not significantly reduced in zzso with zzso at zzso suggests that a water zzso functionally replaces the missing zzso zzso group in the zzso zzso The importance of zzso in internal zzso transfer reactions within the zzso is zzso
