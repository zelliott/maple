zzso capping zzso zzso transfer from zzso to a zzso zzso zzso end to form the structure zzso A similar reaction involving zzso transfer to the zzso zzso end of DNA or zzso occurs during strand joining by zzso zzso In both cases, zzso transfer occurs through a zzso zzso zzso zzso conservation among capping zzso and zzso zzso in the vicinity of the active site zzso zzso and at five other zzso motifs suggests a common structural basis for zzso zzso zzso studies support this zzso We propose that the cellular and DNA virus capping zzso and zzso zzso constitute a protein zzso evolved from a common ancestral zzso Within this zzso the cellular capping zzso display more extensive similarity to the zzso than they do to the zzso capping zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso zzso viruses have evolved alternative pathways of cap metabolism zzso by structurally unrelated zzso that nonetheless employ a zzso zzso Comparative analysis of these zzso particularly at the structural level, should illuminate the shared reaction mechanism while clarifying the basis for zzso specificity and end zzso The capping zzso merit close attention as potential targets for zzso zzso
