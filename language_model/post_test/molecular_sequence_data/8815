In the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes an essential zzso protein that regulates zzso of many genes in cooperation with different associated zzso With the help of a conditional expression system, we show that zzso depletion has a distinct effect on cell cycle progression by preventing cells from undergoing zzso Genes that normally exhibit a zzso expression pattern, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso remain zzso in the absence of functional zzso In zzso zzso experiments show that zzso in conjunction with an zzso factor, binds to the promoter regions of zzso and zzso at sites shown to be involved in cell cycle zzso However, promoter occupation at these sites is cell cycle independent, and therefore the regulatory system seems to operate on zzso bound zzso zzso A gene fusion that provides zzso with a strong zzso zzso domain causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at inappropriate times of the cell zzso Thus, zzso and a zzso cell zzso zzso partner are directly involved in the coordinated expression of multiple zzso zzso The arrest zzso of zzso cells is consistent with low levels of zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso expression does not suppress the zzso zzso and therefore other essential activities required for the zzso transition must also depend on zzso zzso
