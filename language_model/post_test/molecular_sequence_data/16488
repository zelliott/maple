The winged zzso zzso factor zzso and the zinc finger zzso factor Snail are zzso involved in germ layer formation in zzso Here, we isolated and characterized a zzso of zzso zzso 1) and of snail from a zzso the sea zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso expression starts during late zzso stage in a ring of cells that zzso the zzso margin during early zzso thereby marking the boundary between zzso and zzso zzso zzso by contrast, is expressed in a complementary pattern in the center of zzso cells marking the zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso during zzso In a significant portion of early zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso around the zzso While zzso cells form the zzso cell mass, zzso marks the zzso zzso throughout embryonic and zzso zzso In the primary zzso zzso remains expressed in the zzso The detailed analysis of zzso and snail expression during zzso embryonic and zzso development further suggests that zzso formation results from zzso zzso zzso immigration, and reorganization of the zzso zzso layer, that is, by zzso transitions zzso in combination with extensive zzso zzso snail also zzso zzso at different processes during embryonic development in zzso Our data indicate that the function of snail in zzso is to regulate zzso and cell zzso supporting that the triggering of changes in cell behavior is the ancestral role of snail in zzso
