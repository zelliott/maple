Using a zzso zzso approach, we have identified by protein zzso a putative zzso zzso from among the zzso envelope zzso To confirm this zzso we demonstrate that zzso a zzso zzso identified as zzso by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and their envelope zzso when extracted in the presence of zzso and zzso the native spinach zzso protein binds to zzso lipids in a zzso zzso The binding of the spinach zzso to these zzso occurs at similar zzso zzso as those, which promote the interaction of zzso to zzso in other zzso Among zzso zzso known to be accessible on the zzso face zzso zzso of the outer envelope zzso zzso and probably zzso would be the sole candidates for a putative zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso
