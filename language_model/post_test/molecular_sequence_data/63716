This study presents the first characterization of a zzso zzso zzso identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso myosin, zzso contains a zzso zzso motor domain, a neck domain with 6 zzso zzso a tail domain containing short regions of predicted zzso structure, and, most notably, multiple zzso repeats at the zzso In other proteins such repeats assemble into a zzso structure implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso is localized to the zzso zzso that gird the zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that this zzso shows an unusually tight association with the zzso fraction and can be zzso only by treatment with high pH zzso or the zzso zzso zzso This novel zzso and its zzso which have been identified in several related zzso appear to be unique to the zzso and represent the only zzso known to contain the zzso zzso The function of this zzso in zzso zzso or any of the other zzso zzso remains zzso
