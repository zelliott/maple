The zzso genes are members of the zzso zzso family of zzso which have similar zzso organizations and zzso zzso proteins with similar zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased shortly after the addition of zzso or zzso to cultured human blood zzso zzso The zzso sequence is zzso to that of a zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso which decreases zzso stem cell zzso The zzso extends to the 3' zzso region, which contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso factor zzso zzso zzso site, and zzso zzso which is found in some related genes zzso that zzso the immediate early protein zzso zzso A similar but complementary sequence is present in human zzso zzso Two of the three human genes that zzso to zzso zzso were zzso zzso has zzso zzso recognition elements as found in some other zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso but is likely to be expressed because of the conservation of sections of the gene believed to be important for zzso The zzso zzso of both genes contain the zzso motifs zzso and zzso indicating zzso genes with the potential to respond to growth zzso zzso is the main zzso gene expressed in adult T zzso and may zzso a zzso negative regulator of the size of cell populations (or zzso which are derived ultimately from zzso stem zzso As such, it is a potential zzso
