The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso protein zzso that regulates the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence analysis, it was hypothesized that zzso is related to the zzso zzso protein zzso type 1, with zzso zzso and zzso contributing to the zzso zzso center, and zzso contributing to the zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the functional significance of these zzso acid zzso using a zzso zzso It was found that substitution of each of these zzso had a significant impact on zzso activity toward the protein zzso The activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were decreased more than zzso The activity of zzso zzso was zzso lower than the activity of zzso zzso The decrease in activity of zzso and zzso came about, most zzso as a result of impaired zzso zzso zzso it was found that the zzso zzso bound zzso zzso similarly to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was found to be active with the artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not demonstrate any appreciable activity with zzso Together, these observations strongly suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are important for the zzso of the zzso reaction, contributing to the zzso and zzso centers of zzso In contrast, zzso is not required for zzso The exact role of zzso remains to be established, but indirect evidence suggests that it might be involved in the control of interactions between zzso and the protein zzso zzso zzso
