A knockout strain of zzso zzso zzso lacking the single zzso zzso zzso zzso has been created by targeted gene zzso A central region of the zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated by zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso and used to probe a zzso zzso zzso The gene was zzso and the zzso zzso protein sequence was shown to be similar to those from other zzso The functionality of the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso strain devoid of zzso activity, restoring growth in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was reduced suggesting zzso regulation of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso gene replacement was used to create strains which were zzso for zzso and lack zzso coding zzso zzso studies on these zzso showed that they are greatly reduced in zzso compared with zzso zzso This confirms that the strains carrying an zzso disruption cannot obtain sufficient zzso from the host plant for normal growth and, thus, that zzso zzso may be a suitable target for chemical zzso
