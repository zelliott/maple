zzso the major structural protein of peripheral zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso zzso domain, which contains a single zzso zzso site and two zzso We have previously reported four different zzso of the zzso zzso gene in four families of zzso zzso type 1 zzso In this study we found a new zzso of the zzso zzso gene in a small family of zzso The affected persons had an A - to - G substitution of zzso 245 of the zzso zzso gene in one zzso leading to a zzso substitution for zzso in the zzso zzso An additional zzso in the zzso domain may form a zzso bond and cause an inappropriate change in the zzso structure of the functional zzso of zzso
