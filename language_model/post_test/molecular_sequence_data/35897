We have identified a zzso triplex binding sequence overlapping a zzso zzso early promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to bind this target was zzso to zzso templates and introduced into in zzso zzso systems under conditions favoring specific initiation from this zzso These templates demonstrated significant zzso zzso relative to naked zzso templates and templates mixed with zzso zzso It is suggested that triplex formation along this target interferes with zzso zzso and this mechanism may hold potential to disrupt zzso zzso early zzso in zzso
