Methane is produced by various zzso bacteria present in zzso zzso sludge blanket zzso zzso Methane can be used to predict and improve zzso zzso zzso The zzso population in the zzso can be influenced by the composition of the zzso The aim of this study was to fingerprint and identify the zzso present in three different types of zzso zzso that had been used to treat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This was done using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and DNA sequence zzso The zzso fingerprints obtained from the zzso reference cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared to the zzso profiles of the zzso in the different zzso The positions of the zzso bands that did not zzso well to the bands of the known species were zzso and compared to sequences available on zzso using the zzso search zzso The aligned DNA sequences were used to construct a zzso zzso Based on the data zzso a zzso marker was constructed which was used to provide a quick method to identify the zzso members of the microbial consortium in zzso zzso
