zzso interaction liquid zzso zzso has been found very appropriate for separation of polar compounds and peptides with zzso modifications zzso such as zzso and zzso In this study, a column switching system based on zzso zzso based zzso columns was used for enrichment and separation of peptides and characterization of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso were found to be retained on a zzso zzso even in an zzso buffer due to zzso zzso Thus, a novel approach of using a zzso zzso for introduction of an zzso sample such as a zzso zzso followed by zzso separation of the peptides is zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso column switching system were explored using a zzso digest of zzso and a mixture of six zzso The column switching system was zzso used to enrich and separate a zzso zzso rat liver extract gel zzso where in total 48 peptides corresponding to 14 proteins were zzso zzso zzso were also identified, both in the standard test proteins zzso and six protein mixture zzso and the rat liver extract zzso In all cases, the identified zzso zzso were identified at the end of the zzso at high zzso buffer content in the mobile phase, showing the suitability of the developed method for characterization of zzso peptides in zzso zzso
