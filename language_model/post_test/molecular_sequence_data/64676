The zzso calcium sensor zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed at highest levels in excitable cells, and some of them regulate zzso of G zzso zzso Here we present zzso analysis and genetic functional studies of an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso binds three zzso zzso at zzso with an apparent affinity of 2 zzso and Hill zzso of zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso revealed significant zzso protein zzso changes indicative of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso group is zzso inside a zzso cavity of the zzso protein and becomes zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso and zzso binding by zzso are essential for its zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso deletion zzso zzso showed two distinct zzso zzso sexual development and a growth zzso at high levels of zzso zzso zzso m zzso Analysis of zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso or deficient in zzso binding zzso revealed that zzso binding was essential for both zzso while zzso was less zzso zzso zzso a key regulator for sexual development, suppressed zzso and zzso of zzso suggesting involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso turned on by the zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso sexual development of zzso was also zzso by retinal zzso which controls zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso was not affected by zzso or zzso suggesting that the two zzso zzso are mechanistically zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso perhaps by controlling zzso zzso of zzso
