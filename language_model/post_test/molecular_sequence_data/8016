The molecular characterization of the zzso in zzso A patients is hampered by the large size of the factor VIII gene and the great zzso of zzso In this study, we have performed a protocol involving multiplex zzso chain reaction in which 19 zzso were amplified in four different combinations followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to screen for zzso Southern zzso was used to detect inversion of the factor VIII gene resulting from zzso between copies of the gene A zzso located in zzso 22 of the factor VIII gene and two copies close zzso region of X zzso zzso zzso A patients (21 with severe and 21 with zzso disease) were zzso The inversion of factor VIII occurred in 13 of 21 patients affected by severe zzso zzso One patient showed a large extra band in addition to the three bands observed after Southern zzso with the zzso zzso An abnormal zzso pattern of zzso was detected in zzso and 50% of the patients affected by zzso and severe disease, zzso Sixteen different zzso were zzso Eleven zzso were novel and comprised 9 point zzso and 2 small zzso This study shows that the methodology used is safe and rapid and has potential for detecting almost all of the genetic defects of the studied zzso A zzso
