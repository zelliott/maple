In this work the presence of zzso in an zzso in zzso has been zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as model recipient bacteria in zzso zzso with zzso and mercury to select for resistance zzso As a result, 7 zzso were shown to carry zzso from the zzso group, as seen by zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the isolation of 4 plasmids from zzso zzso and 3 assigned to the recently described zzso zzso To our knowledge this is the first report concerning the detection and isolation of zzso and zzso plasmids in zzso zzso zzso it is shown that, even though the retrieved plasmids are zzso close to previously characterized zzso such as zzso and zzso respectively, they constitute new molecular zzso
