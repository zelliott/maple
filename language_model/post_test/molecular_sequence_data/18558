A zzso zzso zzso 10 gene was previously identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso genes are expressed specifically and zzso in the zzso of the zzso wall and in zzso during zzso zzso The zzso of zzso transcripts was zzso induced by zzso acid zzso and was suppressed by zzso Studies using zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is modulated by an zzso interaction between zzso and zzso The treatment of zzso an zzso zzso caused the zzso to become densely zzso and highly zzso whereas zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso arrested zzso development to a status close to that of zzso The expression of the zzso zzso promoter in transgenic zzso was determined using the zzso zzso reporter gene indicated that the decisive zzso required for zzso specificity is located zzso zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso The zzso transgenic lines exhibited complete male zzso because of the disruption of the zzso and the deformation of zzso The zzso specificity of zzso zzso highlights the importance of the zzso zzso promoter for future zzso and agricultural zzso
