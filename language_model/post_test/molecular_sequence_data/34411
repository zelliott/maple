The zzso transfer of zzso plasmids such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso between bacterial cells requires zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bridge the origin of transfer zzso to a key component of the zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso Here we show that zzso recognizes a zzso zzso site, zzso as a cooperative zzso of zzso The crystal structure of the zzso complex from the zzso zzso shows that binding zzso is zzso by DNA zzso and zzso without any direct contact between zzso zzso DNA recognition is carried out by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind DNA in a staggered zzso We demonstrate that both zzso zzso as well as selective interactions between zzso and the zzso tail of its zzso zzso mediate zzso specificity within the zzso family of zzso The ability of zzso to zzso bind DNA without interaction between zzso leaves the zzso zzso zzso zzso free to make multiple interactions with zzso driving recruitment of the zzso to the zzso zzso
