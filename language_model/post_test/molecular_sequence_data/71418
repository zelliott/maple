The zzso are natural products that contain a variety of functional groups, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso C zzso was the first recognized zzso zzso agent, and has been widely used clinically for zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso is derived from zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A genetically linked zzso zzso gene and zzso resistance genes were identified previously in the zzso producer zzso zzso zzso zzso We set out to identify other genes involved in zzso zzso 

A cluster of 47 genes spanning 55 zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso Fourteen of 22 disruption zzso did not express or zzso zzso Seven gene products probably assemble the zzso intermediate through a zzso of the zzso zzso The gene zzso the first presumed zzso in zzso zzso is not, however, linked within the zzso zzso zzso genes for zzso nucleus formation and zzso were zzso A putative zzso zzso was identified that comprises a novel zzso and export system, which zzso cellular zzso on zzso zzso Two regulatory genes were also zzso 

The overall architecture of the zzso zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso has been zzso zzso manipulation of a putative zzso zzso regulator led to a substantial increase in drug zzso The cloned genes should help zzso the molecular basis for creation of the zzso ring system, as well efforts to engineer the zzso of novel natural zzso
