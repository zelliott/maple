zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso a zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso By the systematic zzso replacement of putative loop and zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we have determined that zzso zzso zzso binding by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Data were substantiated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are in proximity to a zzso charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were systematically zzso with zzso or zzso respectively, and the zzso effects of zzso on zzso binding were reevaluated to determine those zzso zzso close to the zzso binding zzso Most significantly, substitution of zzso in the zzso extreme zzso abolished the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso our data would suggest close association of the extreme zzso with the zzso surfaces of zzso 4 and 3 in the zzso in forming a binding zzso for zzso The zzso of zzso binding appears to result from loss of the zzso binding zzso of zzso induced by zzso when it is coupled to zzso zzso it is proposed that there is mutually exclusive hydrogen bonding of zzso and zzso to zzso
