The zzso zzso mediates protein degradation and is involved in diverse aspects of plant development and zzso including zzso tube zzso and zzso We characterized three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are specifically expressed in late zzso zzso stages and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequences reveal that zzso share high identity with zzso zzso and contain a putative zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso affinity binding zzso revealed that the zzso associate with zzso zzso In addition, the zzso genes can functionally complement the zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso To investigate their biological functions in zzso tube zzso an in zzso approach for green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with zzso truncated zzso zzso significantly retarded zzso tube zzso in both in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso after zzso h zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso tubes harboring zzso zzso and zzso was substantially inhibited within the zzso zzso The zzso of most zzso zzso tubes could zzso only on the zzso surface of self style and showed statistically significant growth arrest as compared with control zzso zzso Lily exhibits typical zzso zzso via an unknown zzso but zzso and zzso may be involved in this complex zzso These results suggest critical roles for zzso in regulating fundamental zzso tube zzso in zzso and in zzso and that the zzso zzso protein zzso plays an important role in zzso tube zzso
