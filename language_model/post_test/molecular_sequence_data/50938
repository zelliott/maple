zzso dynamics simulations have been undertaken for a zzso zzso duplex in solution with and without an zzso zzso zzso between the central zzso base zzso The introduction of this simple zzso affects both the zzso features and dynamic properties of the zzso double zzso Changes are seen in the zzso atomic fluctuations and zzso of zzso sugar and base zzso The backbone zzso is slightly changed on average and more zzso adopt the zzso zzso zzso in the simulation of the complex compared with the simulation of the zzso zzso Both major and minor grooves becomes wider on average with the addition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso base pairs on both sides of the zzso site have undergone an increase in flexibility, with the base pairs, especially at the zzso side, having the zzso hydrogen bonds being zzso
