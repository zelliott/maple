The zzso zzso zzso or zzso unit zzso and zzso zzso unit I) zzso of zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso sequence motif that is very similar to those of the zzso and zzso promoters of enteric bacteria and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso previously designated zzso zzso zzso Mullin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Newton, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1987) at approximately zzso We have used zzso zzso to examine the role of these sequences in the zzso regulation of these periodically expressed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter that removed the zzso zzso at zzso zzso the zzso at zzso zzso or an zzso base pair at zzso zzso in the zzso sequence between the zzso zzso elements completely eliminated zzso zzso zzso at other positions resulted in either a slight decrease zzso 26), no change zzso zzso or an elevated level zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso By contrast, most of these zzso promoter zzso resulted in greatly elevated levels of zzso from the opposing zzso zzso Similar experiments were used to confirm the location of the zzso promoter to a zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso of all or part of the zzso element or point zzso in the sequence drastically reduced the level of zzso transcript and resulted in increased levels of the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso sequences at zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso are required for zzso of these genes in zzso and the zzso element is required for zzso of zzso This analysis also suggested that the zzso sequence and sequences in the zzso promoter are required for the negative zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso and zzso promoters and the zzso element interact in some way to mediate the negative control of these divergent zzso zzso
