zzso zzso is a widespread and extensively studied Mediterranean species of sea zzso from which a large number of zzso zzso such as blood depressing substances zzso zzso have been zzso The first members of this class, zzso and zzso are zzso belonging to the zzso fold family and were initially described for their zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are 43 zzso acid peptides zzso by three zzso bonds that act as zzso affecting zzso zzso and zzso channel gating zzso In addition, zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso The development of a large zzso of zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso and the identification of 13 putative zzso zzso sequences has attracted interest, especially as scientific and diagnostic zzso A comparison of zzso zzso sequences showed that the untranslated regions are more zzso than the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso ratios calculated for all zzso comparisons showed values greater than 1, suggesting mechanisms of accelerated zzso The structures of the zzso zzso were predicted by molecular zzso All toxins possess similar zzso structures that consist of a zzso zzso zzso and an additional small zzso zzso located downstream of the zzso zzso however, the orientation of the zzso zzso appears to differ among the zzso To zzso the spatial expression profile of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries, enriched for zzso zzso were zzso In addition, the proper amplification of zzso or zzso markers ensured the tissue specificity of each zzso zzso randomly selected clones from each library revealed zzso expression of ten zzso zzso while transcripts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to be zzso likely due to zzso in our zzso zzso The calculation of the relative abundance of zzso transcripts in the zzso libraries revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the most represented zzso
