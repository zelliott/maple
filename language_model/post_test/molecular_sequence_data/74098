zzso gap junction channels are important cellular zzso for establishing and maintaining zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of a zzso human zzso 26 zzso by electron zzso revealed a zzso density in the channel pore suggesting that physical zzso of the pore may be one mechanism of closure zzso et zzso 2007, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso However, it remains to be determined what part of the sequence contributes to the zzso Here, we present the projection structure of an zzso deletion of zzso missing zzso acids 2 to 7 zzso zzso in the same two-dimensional crystal zzso A 10 A resolution projection map of zzso revealed that the plug density was dramatically reduced in comparison with that found in full-length zzso zzso The difference map between the deletion and full-length zzso channels strongly suggests that the zzso of zzso contributes to the plug for the physical closure of gap junction zzso
