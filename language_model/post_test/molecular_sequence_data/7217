We show here that infection of zzso zzso with various strains of zzso tuberculosis zzso the rapid in zzso expression of genes zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein 1 alpha and zzso inflammatory protein 2, which recruit zzso to sites of infection, and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Three strains of zzso zzso Erdman and the clinical zzso zzso 22 and zzso 46, induced similar levels of zzso of zzso zzso protein 1 from infected zzso zzso however, the Erdman strain failed to induce levels of zzso of tumor necrosis factor alpha similar to those induced by either zzso 22 or zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso infection model, we also found that while the Erdman strain induced negligible increases in zzso zzso levels in the zzso infection with either zzso 22 or zzso 46 resulted in greater levels of zzso production for all four zzso zzso The growth of these strains in the lungs was, however, equally well contained by acquired host zzso These data allow us to zzso that the zzso response in the lungs probably does not control the protective zzso response and that perhaps other zzso or zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor alpha or zzso 12 may be involved in this zzso
