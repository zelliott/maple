The zzso zzso capsule is an important zzso zzso in group B zzso zzso The previously described inverse relationship between the buoyant density of a zzso and the zzso thickness was used to assess the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in clinical zzso type III zzso Shift from intermediate density zzso of parental zzso to high density zzso zzso shift from intermediate capsule thickness to poor zzso was found to range from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Shift from ID to low density zzso zzso shift to abundant zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Shifts were zzso in all cases, either directly zzso or vice zzso or through intermediate zzso zzso zzso were in some zzso as high as zzso zzso zzso differed more than a zzso between compared zzso zzso in zzso shift between strains were validated using flow zzso zzso zzso of capsule expression by changes in culture conditions was zzso Variation of temperature, zzso and presence of human serum did not affect capsule zzso However, growth at pH below zzso decreased the amount of capsule bound native type III zzso probably through zzso modification rather than genetic zzso zzso an zzso sequence which has been proposed a regulatory function on the zzso capsule zzso was found in multiple copies in the zzso zzso No differences in copy number or location of zzso between the differently zzso zzso were zzso
