The sequence determination of several zzso clones isolated from the Mediterranean zzso zzso zzso identified the existence of zzso repeats, often more than one being clustered in small zzso zzso These repeats have previously been shown to consist of stretches of zzso reiterated zzso zzso and they are found in multiple genes of several zzso Most of the repeats described here are flanked or interrupted by stop zzso in all reading frames and, thus, could not possibly be part of zzso zzso Furthermore, these repeats, of which there are several hundred in the zzso of the zzso can be used effectively for the determination of sequence zzso providing a convenient approach to obtain additional landmarks for the construction of zzso maps of this economically important zzso
