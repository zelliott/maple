From the normal zzso tissue of a zzso cow in late zzso a heat shock protein (90 zzso was zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso column zzso From 70 g of zzso zzso zzso of this heat shock protein were zzso samples had zzso purity and zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso heat shock protein was estimated to be 86 zzso by zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence suggested that the protein had been zzso as a mixture of two zzso The contents of the heat shock protein in zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and cows at zzso and zzso were measured by quantitative zzso analysis using rabbit zzso raised against the zzso heat shock zzso The contents of the heat shock protein were higher in zzso from zzso cows than in those from zzso and zzso zzso The elevated zzso of zzso zzso heat shock protein in zzso tissue suggested that this protein is involved in zzso differentiation and zzso
