We have identified and cloned a human gene zzso that exhibits strong sequence zzso within a putative DNA binding domain to the zzso zzso zzso gene and lesser zzso to the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso or T zzso Unlike zzso which is expressed in neural zzso or zzso which is not expressed in adult animals, zzso is expressed primarily in adult in zzso zzso and zzso as multiple transcripts of between approximately 2 and 4 zzso At least part of this transcript zzso appears to be due to alternative zzso This is the first reported human member of a new family of highly zzso zzso DNA binding zzso the zzso or zzso zzso The human gene has been mapped by zzso cell hybrid mapping and zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso a region frequently altered in zzso zzso
