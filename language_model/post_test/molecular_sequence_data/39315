To study the relationships between single zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes and high zzso 

One hundred and zzso adult patients with high zzso zzso zzso zzso and 137 controls were used to study the relationships between the zzso zzso and zzso genes and high zzso All subjects were free of zzso diseases, other than zzso as well as of other systemic genetic zzso zzso was performed by direct sequencing after zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for zzso zzso The zzso or Fisher test was conducted to investigate the zzso and zzso distribution between the high zzso and control zzso 

The zzso success rate was zzso zzso analysis revealed significant differences between patients and control subjects with respect to one of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a p value of zzso There was no significant relationship between other zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes and high zzso 

Our results indicate that an zzso zzso which is located in the promoter region of the zzso zzso may be worth further investigation to determine its association with development of high zzso
