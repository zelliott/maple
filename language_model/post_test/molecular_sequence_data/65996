To study the zzso status of fragile zzso zzso zzso gene promoter in patients with zzso syndrome zzso and its clinical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso promoter zzso in bone zzso samples from 54 zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso promoter was detected in 26 cases zzso Association was not found between zzso gene zzso and sex, zzso parameters and zzso abnormalities of zzso patients, but found between zzso gene zzso and age of the zzso zzso Although significant difference was not observed in the zzso of zzso gene zzso among patients with zzso zzso anemia with ringed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anemia with ringed zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso with ringed blasts zzso zzso zzso zzso anemia with excess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anemia with excess zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso anemia with excess blasts in zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso it was observed in patients in early stages zzso and zzso zzso zzso advanced stages zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the frequency of zzso gene zzso and different zzso groups zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso might be one of the molecular events involved in the disease progression of zzso
