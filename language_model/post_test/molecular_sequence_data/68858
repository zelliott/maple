We have constructed a series of random zzso deletions of the large zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso extended throughout the zzso gene open reading frame and, in total, 31 different truncated zzso were expressed in zzso coli using the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for their interaction with the small zzso zzso of zzso zzso using a sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso method and for their ability to complement zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were also tested for zzso using zzso zzso The results identified a region of zzso between zzso acids zzso and zzso which was essential for zzso zzso zzso lacking up to 348 zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso and beyond did not interact with zzso and were inactive in zzso zzso Using a zzso which expressed an zzso deleted protein zzso at zzso acid zzso we constructed two defined zzso deletions to give proteins zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso of zzso Neither of these truncated proteins bound zzso and we concluded that a second region between zzso acids zzso and zzso (the zzso is required for interaction with zzso zzso studies indicated that deletion of the first zzso zzso acids from zzso did not affect zzso However, deletions of zzso zzso acids and larger gave proteins which existed as zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
