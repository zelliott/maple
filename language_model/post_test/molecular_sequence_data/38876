zzso a probable zzso of stress activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to be zzso expressed within the zzso zzso ear and lateral line system during the development and differentiation of these zzso zzso expression was very strong in the zzso zzso from its zzso and expression continued in the zzso zzso up until stage zzso after which it abruptly zzso At stage zzso expression occurred specifically in the zzso of the zzso zzso which includes the prospective zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also observed in the lateral line system from stage zzso at which stage the lateral line zzso have begun to migrate from the region of the zzso zzso zzso line expression continued at least until stage zzso at which time zzso was noted in association with the zzso lateral line zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the first ubiquitous lateral line marker that is also expressed in the zzso In the context of previous studies, our data suggest that zzso either plays a role in the differentiation of the zzso of the auditory system or in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso and the lateral line zzso
