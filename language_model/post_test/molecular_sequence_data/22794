To investigate the possible role of accessory zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso III zzso zzso in determining zzso replication zzso we have investigated the role of the zzso zzso This gene encodes both the zzso and gamma zzso of zzso which play a central role in the organization and functioning of HE at the replication zzso We find that a classical, zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a pronounced zzso effect, characterized by an unusual zzso preferential enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso The latter occur predominantly at zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not affect the gamma zzso but produces a zzso zzso carrying a zzso substitution zzso in its zzso domain zzso zzso that is involved in interaction with the Pol III alpha zzso A search for new zzso in the zzso region of the zzso yielded six additional zzso zzso all carrying a specific zzso zzso zzso The new zzso displayed zzso similar to zzso strong enhancement of zzso and zzso and only weak enhancement for zzso The combined findings suggest that the zzso zzso of HE plays an important role in determining the zzso of the zzso zzso specifically in the avoidance of zzso and zzso zzso
