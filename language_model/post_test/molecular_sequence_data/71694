The signal recognition particle zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in promoting zzso zzso of proteins into the zzso zzso Here, we zzso recent progress made in the understanding of two essential zzso zzso the signal recognition function, which ensures the zzso and the zzso arrest function, which increases the efficiency of zzso Our discussion is based on functional data as well as on atomic structure information, both of which also support the notion that zzso is a very ancient particle closely related to zzso Based on the significant increase of knowledge that has been accumulating on the structure of zzso factors and on their interactions with the zzso we speculate about a possible mechanism of the zzso arrest zzso
