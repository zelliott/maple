Old leaves of zzso rice plants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are more resistant to blast fungus zzso zzso than new zzso In contrast, both old and new leaves of the rice zzso triple zzso zzso are susceptible to blast zzso We demonstrate that zzso class 1 zzso proteins are rapidly and strongly induced during zzso zzso infection and following zzso zzso zzso or salicylic acid zzso exposure in the old leaves, but not in the new leaves of the zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso proteins was significantly attenuated in old and new leaves of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso are required for the induction of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were substantially higher in the zzso as compared to the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso also are required for zzso expression of zzso zzso Moreover, the transcript levels of genes known to function in zzso or zzso defense pathways were regulated by leaf age and functional zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate that zzso are required in rice for age-related resistance to zzso zzso and may indirectly increase zzso gene expression by regulating zzso and zzso defense zzso
