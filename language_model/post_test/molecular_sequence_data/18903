We zzso report the identification of an zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso protein 2 zzso which is known to be a diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for zzso cell zzso Among several candidate peptides predicted by the zzso prediction algorithm, zzso zzso zzso was able to effectively induce zzso zzso T zzso zzso The established zzso zzso zzso clone produced zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso cells, as well as to cells in which zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso clone exerted zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso cancer cells, thus suggesting that the zzso zzso is naturally presented on zzso of zzso cancer cells and is recognized by zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso zzso could also induce zzso under zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that the zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that could be useful for zzso zzso against cancer cells with zzso zzso
