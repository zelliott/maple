The zzso zzso zzso zzso originally isolated as a zzso zzso does not grow at 37 degrees zzso zzso tests and DNA sequencing analysis revealed that a zzso in a single gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso and temperature zzso was responsible for its zzso sensitivity and temperature zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of various organisms, but it could not rescue the zzso zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso double zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso zzso (which is zzso in zzso zzso and is essential for zzso zzso by an Ala zzso resulted in the loss of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene has an amber zzso and the disruption of the zzso gene caused zzso and temperature sensitivity similar to that in the zzso zzso zzso production was induced by zzso growth temperature in the zzso These results indicate that the zzso gene encodes a novel zzso zzso that is involved in the mechanisms of formation of rigid cell wall structure and in the zzso production of zzso zzso
