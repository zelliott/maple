While there is compelling evidence that the synaptic zzso protein zzso serves as the major zzso sensor for regulated zzso it is not known how zzso binding zzso membrane zzso Here we report that zzso increases the zzso by approximately 2 orders of zzso between zzso and zzso 1, a component of the synaptic fusion zzso This effect is specific for zzso zzso which can stimulate zzso of synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the interaction was composed of two components with zzso values of zzso and 180 zzso zzso The interaction is zzso by the zzso region of zzso 1 zzso zzso and is regulated by a novel zzso zzso which does not require zzso and is not disrupted by zzso that abolish zzso zzso binding to zzso We propose that this interaction constitutes an essential step in zzso zzso
