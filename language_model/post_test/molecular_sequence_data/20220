zzso zzso inhibit DNA packaging during human zzso zzso zzso Although they have been shown to target zzso and zzso the large and small zzso of the zzso zzso respectively, their mechanism of action is not yet fully zzso 

To better understand zzso DNA maturation and the mechanism of action of zzso zzso we studied the zzso zzso protein by a genetic approach combined with primary structure zzso The zzso sequence analysis of 25 zzso strains and counterparts among zzso allowed identification of 12 zzso zzso We also built a three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso zzso site, including zzso motor motifs 1, II and III, that may facilitate the development of future zzso drugs active against zzso Finally, we identified several putative functional zzso in zzso such as zzso zinc finger zzso DNA cutting sites and portal binding sites, that are probably involved in zzso DNA zzso and zzso
