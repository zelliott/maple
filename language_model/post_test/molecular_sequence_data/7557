zzso zzso is strongly associated with zzso and found in zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains at least eight components and previous evidence suggested that the zzso protein was the zzso component for at least some zzso In this study, zzso patient zzso were used to screen human zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso expression libraries, and two clones from each had plaques specifically zzso with zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso supported the identification of the zzso All of 44 zzso zzso reacted with the zzso but none of 44 control zzso reacted zzso The zzso were zzso and full sequencing of one revealed an open reading frame spanning a zzso zzso zzso the library with the zzso yielded a zzso zzso that continued the open reading zzso The zzso zzso zzso to a single zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells, by Northern zzso zzso zzso directed at a portion of the zzso product reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence was notable for four potential zzso and several charged zzso The protein zzso by the zzso produced in zzso reacted with only one of five of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso 240 zzso is a novel protein that is zzso for all zzso zzso and strongly suggests that a major common zzso is zzso in zzso
