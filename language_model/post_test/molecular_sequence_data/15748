Human zzso are the major viral pathogens of epidemic acute zzso These genetically diverse viruses comprise two major zzso zzso and zzso and approximately 30 zzso zzso recognize human zzso group zzso zzso in a diverse, zzso zzso Recently the crystal structures of the zzso zzso of the zzso Norwalk virus and the zzso zzso have been determined, which allows us to examine the genetic and structural relationships of the zzso zzso of zzso with variable zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that, if zzso are the viral receptors necessary for zzso infection and spread, their binding zzso should be under a selection pressure in the evolution of zzso 

zzso comparison of the zzso zzso of the two zzso has revealed shared features but significant differences in the location, sequence zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, the primary sequences of the zzso zzso are highly zzso among strains within each zzso The roles of critical zzso within the binding sites have been verified by zzso zzso followed by functional analysis of strains with variable zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that the human zzso are an important factor in zzso zzso Each of the two major zzso represents an evolutionary lineage characterized by distinct genetic zzso zzso convergence of strains with the same zzso targets subsequently resulted in acquisition of analogous zzso binding zzso in the two zzso that share an overall structural zzso despite their distinct locations and zzso acid zzso On the other hand, divergent evolution may have contributed to the observed overall differences between and within the two zzso Thus, both divergent and zzso evolution, as well as the zzso human zzso likely contribute to the diversity of zzso The finding of zzso conservation of zzso binding zzso will facilitate the development of rational strategies to control and prevent zzso zzso
