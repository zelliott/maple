A zzso zzso a zzso zzso designated zzso in zzso zzso was zzso zzso of its zzso gene revealed that it was essential for cell zzso In zzso depletion of the zzso protein demonstrated that it was necessary for cell cycle progression at two zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso arrest of zzso cells was dependent upon zzso which mediates checkpoint zzso zzso cells arrested at zzso had condensed zzso but were defective in zzso However, zzso formation and zzso were not restrained during the zzso zzso zzso of zzso specifically rescued the growth zzso of zzso cells at a restrictive zzso zzso encodes a component of the zzso complex zzso which is required for zzso segregation at zzso and zzso is defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso was accumulated in the zzso zzso These results strongly suggested that zzso is a zzso zzso working in conjunction with zzso and mediates the zzso zzso for degradation of zzso zzso holding zzso at the onset of zzso and possibly of zzso zzso at the exit of zzso
