zzso acid bacteria have been identified as typical and zzso significant members of the gut zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso lower zzso We found that also in the guts of the higher termites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (both zzso zzso acid bacteria represent the largest group of zzso zzso bacteria zzso bacteria per zzso zzso of all zzso All zzso were zzso and zzso difficult to zzso but their zzso repetitive zzso consensus sequence zzso fingerprint patterns showed a significant genetic zzso Six different zzso each were identified among the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and representative strains were selected for further zzso By zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strain zzso from zzso zzso was classified as a close relative of zzso zzso whereas strain zzso from zzso zzso and strain zzso from zzso zzso were closely related to zzso zzso All strains consumed oxygen during growth on zzso and zzso oxygen consumption of these and other zzso from both zzso species was due to zzso and zzso zzso activities, but did not result in zzso zzso In order to assess the significance of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was used to compare the fingerprints of zzso zzso genes in the bacterial community of zzso zzso with those of representative zzso The major DNA band from the zzso bacterial community was further separated by zzso zzso zzso and the two resulting bands were zzso Whereas one sequence belonged to a zzso the second sequence was closely related to the sequences of the zzso strains zzso and zzso Apparently, those zzso represent strains of a new zzso species which forms a significant fraction of the complex zzso community of the lower zzso zzso zzso and possibly also of other zzso
