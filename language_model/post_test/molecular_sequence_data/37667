Feeding zzso results established that the soybean zzso zzso inhibitor N zzso zzso zzso substantially zzso growth and development of western corn zzso zzso by attenuating zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Plant zzso 111, zzso zzso zzso was more zzso than the potent and broad specificity zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was separated by mildly zzso zzso into two zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso activities of each were largely zzso Since binding affinity to the target zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Plant zzso 14, zzso zzso the effectiveness of zzso as a zzso inhibitor and an zzso five peptides zzso zzso were isolated from zzso gut extracts by zzso affinity zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of these peptides revealed similarity to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso L zzso are pivotal zzso zzso of zzso larvae, and are targets of plant defensive zzso zzso like zzso
