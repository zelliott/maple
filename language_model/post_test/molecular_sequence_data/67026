zzso of zzso may serve as potent antibiotics that are less prone to resistance development in bacterial zzso To facilitate the search of such compounds, a zzso zzso domain of the membrane integral zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso This zzso domain was characterized by a zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso and an zzso surface zzso resonance binding zzso Both zzso show that the zzso efficiency of the domain is comparable to that of the zzso zzso and it is fully active in the absence of other zzso The isolation of the active zzso domain makes it possible to screen for potential antibiotics targeting zzso
