Pacific zzso tuna, zzso zzso zzso & zzso is one of the most important commercially exploited fish species in the world, and juvenile production techniques have been developed for its culture and stock enhancement in zzso However, recent juvenile production has often failed because of the occurrence of viral nervous necrosis caused by zzso In this study, we examined the genetic zzso of zzso detected in the diseased juveniles to understand the transmission of the disease in a tuna zzso A total of 94 zzso sequences of zzso zzso sequence of the coat protein zzso zzso were obtained from fish samples by zzso zzso chain reaction amplification and 13 zzso were recognized among the zzso The zzso zzso in the viral populations from the diseased juveniles were related to the zzso from which the juveniles zzso suggesting that vertical transmission had occurred in the zzso The statistical zzso network of viral zzso suggests that the zzso zzso among the samples were accumulated in a recent population zzso
