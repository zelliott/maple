zzso zzso is instrumental to identifying genes with defined zzso zzso In this paper, we show that mice zzso for either zzso or zzso two zzso zzso with distinct zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso suggesting that these two zzso play essential roles in zzso Interestingly, although zzso zzso or zzso alone did not have obvious zzso in zzso development, together, they exhibited a compound effect on zzso development, blocking the development from zzso and zzso zzso to zzso stage of T zzso zzso and zzso zzso were mapped to zzso regions zzso and zzso respectively, where we could not identify any known gene that was implicated in a similar zzso Thus, zzso and zzso represent two novel zzso that define a genetic trait controlling zzso zzso
