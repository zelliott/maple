zzso catalyze the release of zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is known to increase markedly after cells reach the stationary zzso In this study, zzso activity zzso made on single batch cultures indicated that specific zzso activity was subject to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a positive effect in expression during exponential growth and a negative effect during stationary zzso zzso exhibited the opposite effect during both growth zzso the induction to stationary phase decreased twofold in the zzso zzso but the effect of zzso was not clearly zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso These formed small colonies in comparison with the zzso parent strain when zzso on zzso zzso or LB supplemented with zzso They did not grow in minimal media or under zzso but did grow zzso on LB and LB zzso at a lower rate than did zzso The zzso activity level in these zzso increased three to four fold during stationary growth in LB zzso and during zzso zzso of zzso during the exponential growth of zzso on LB zzso provoked a decrease in zzso activity during the stationary phase, confirming its negative effect on zzso expression during stationary zzso
