We investigate zzso dictionary oriented approaches to DNA sequence zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso The preponderance of short repeating patterns is an important phenomenon in biological zzso Here, we propose zzso methods to compress DNA sequences that exploit the different repetition structures inherent in such zzso zzso analysis is performed based on the relationship between the zzso and important pattern matching data structures, such as the zzso tree and zzso zzso We discuss how the proposed approach can be incorporated in the zzso zzso zzso
