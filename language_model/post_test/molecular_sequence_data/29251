This study zzso whether the zzso relationships between zzso from different organisms could assist in zzso the functional relationships among these zzso from zzso distinct zzso zzso trees and zzso positions were compared to determine the relationships among these zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid sequences indicates high zzso among plant zzso with some features that distinguish zzso from zzso zzso Among zzso the plant zzso group zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences indicates a higher degree of zzso within the group of zzso zzso than within zzso zzso zzso Tree zzso are similar and reflect the zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso number and position in the zzso zzso genes are highly zzso in zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso have seven zzso and genes zzso zzso zzso have eight zzso except the zzso zzso zzso which has zzso In zzso zzso genes the number and position of zzso are highly zzso among plant species, but not among zzso zzso The link between the zzso relationships and zzso functions remains zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso region of these genes played a pivotal role in the evolution of function of these zzso Nevertheless, the system of zzso is highly structured and it is critical to understand the zzso differences between the zzso in response to different stresses in order to compare their functions and evolutionary zzso
