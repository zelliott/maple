We have investigated the molecular basis for binding and zzso presentation of an zzso zzso cell zzso of zzso whale zzso a zzso zzso zzso structure in the native zzso A series of peptides with three different zzso at each position were evaluated for binding to the class II zzso zzso zzso and for zzso of two T cell clones with distinct fine zzso to determine the role of each zzso The assignment of zzso binding and zzso binding zzso is consistent with a zzso bound as a twisted zzso with 130 degrees twist similar to that of the influenza zzso zzso zzso in the groove of zzso This twist gives the zzso zzso with a zzso similar to an zzso without its being a zzso Two zzso peptides were discovered to be zzso but by different molecular mechanisms, one involving gain of a favorable zzso and one involving loss of an zzso zzso zzso of both peptides with zzso had enormously higher affinity for the zzso but zzso affinity for the zzso zzso was not increased, such that the zzso zzso acted as a partial zzso and inhibited the response to the zzso zzso Moreover, the magnitude of response was elevated in a way that could not be zzso by the zzso zzso even at higher zzso These results suggest a zzso dwell time requirement for optimal signal zzso that may help explain the mechanism of partial zzso
