zzso maturation is a prerequisite for successful zzso Growing evidence suggests that not only the zzso but also the surrounding zzso zzso has to undergo zzso zzso In the zzso two-dimensional zzso analysis demonstrated an zzso shift of the zzso zzso zzso of about zzso pH units during the maturation zzso These findings were zzso by zzso studies that indicated the synthesis of zzso zzso in the zzso cells and an increased occurrence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso after zzso zzso In order to provide structural data on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were released from zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso F and studied by mass zzso before and after zzso and treatment with zzso Our results verified the presence of zzso zzso compounds as well as zzso zzso as major neutral species, whereas zzso zzso and zzso species constituted the dominant zzso zzso sugar zzso The major zzso zzso of zzso animals, however, represented zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in part, zzso repeating units as well as additional zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso more than one zzso zzso were not zzso In contrast to the literature data on zzso zzso zzso of zzso animals, our data thus reveal a lower degree in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
