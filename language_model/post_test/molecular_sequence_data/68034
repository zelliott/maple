The low-energy zzso zzso reactions of a series of zzso peptides have been investigated by tandem mass zzso It is known that zzso zzso peptides undergo facile fragmentation yielding redundant sequence zzso The present work has shown that this fortunate circumstance seems likely to be the exception rather than the zzso The presence of additional basic zzso at positions other than the zzso zzso the zzso The most important such complication discovered in the present work involves wholesale transfer of one or two zzso from the zzso end of a zzso b zzso to the side chain of a zzso zzso located near the zzso resulting in mass shifts of the products of subsequent second-stage zzso Other examples of the participation of the flexible zzso side chain are suggested but could not be confirmed to the same zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso fragmentation has been explored via investigations of zzso and zzso basic peptides bearing one charge for every three or four zzso acid zzso Such species yielded almost no sequence information under low-energy collision conditions, due to the zzso of the zzso zzso on highly basic sites rather than on the zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso activated zzso of zzso from the basic sites, where they are originally located upon formation, to the backbone is a necessary condition for structurally useful fragmentation to zzso It was not possible, on the basis of the present work, to deduce zzso zzso and zzso schemes which would permit structural interpretations of such zzso zzso for unknown zzso
