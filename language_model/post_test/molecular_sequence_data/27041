The zzso zzso gene zzso is highly zzso from zzso to human, implicating a critical zzso zzso Studies in cultured zzso cells have identified several potential functions, but many have not been directly verified in zzso Here, we zzso the studies on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso named a zzso w zzso d zzso zzso which shares zzso zzso acid identity with the human zzso and zzso zzso These studies confirmed that zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso and provided strong evidence of a role for zzso in regulating cell differentiation and zzso via regulation of growth factor zzso zzso The latter function is mainly zzso by control of zzso This review provides a historical account of the discovery and subsequent analyses of the zzso zzso We will also discuss the possible molecular function of the zzso protein that zzso the zzso zzso
