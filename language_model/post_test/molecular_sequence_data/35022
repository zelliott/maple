zzso contain active substances with highly specific zzso effects and are increasingly being used as sources of novel zzso research and treatment tools for human zzso Experimental zzso of individual toxin activities is a severe zzso step in the discovery process, and zzso tools which allow function to be predicted from sequence information are zzso zzso are typically members of large zzso families of structurally similar proteins that can have different biological activities, and minor sequence divergence can have significant zzso Thus, existing zzso tools tend to have low zzso We investigated a zzso model based on zzso attributes that can easily be calculated from zzso zzso using over 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also clustered proteins by sequence profiles, and carried out zzso tests for four major activities on a selection of isolated novel zzso or crude zzso known to contain zzso The majority of detected activities were consistent with predictions, in contrast to poor performance of a number of tested existing zzso zzso Our results provide a framework for comparison of active sites among different functional zzso of toxins that will allow a more targeted approach for identification of potential drug leads in the zzso
