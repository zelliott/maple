zzso are born in a relatively zzso state and develop during a period of intensive maturation in the zzso zzso During this period, the young zzso lacks a competent immune system, but manages to survive despite the potential of exposure to environmental zzso zzso immune transfer via the milk is one zzso strategy to compensate the zzso but there also may be innate immune mechanisms in zzso In this study, zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso integral molecular components of pathogen recognition, were identified and zzso for the first time in a zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso were highly zzso The zzso zzso binding zzso and the zzso interaction site of zzso were zzso in all zzso The zzso zzso domain had zzso identity within zzso and zzso with zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso resulted in the induction of a zzso pattern of zzso and zzso zzso and coincided with increased production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns of expression of zzso and zzso were observed in zzso zzso young early in development, suggesting that early maturation of the innate immune system in these animals may have developed as an immune survival strategy to protect the zzso zzso from exposure to microbial zzso
