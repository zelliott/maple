zzso zzso are an important class of small zzso zzso that are highly zzso in plants and zzso Many zzso are known to mediate a myriad of cell zzso including proliferation and zzso via the regulation of some zzso and signaling factors, which are closely related to muscle development and zzso In this study, small zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso were zzso In addition, we obtained the goat muscle zzso by using zzso zzso technology and analyzed these zzso characteristics by combining it with the zzso zzso Based on zzso sequencing and zzso analysis, zzso zzso and 5 goat zzso zzso were identified, zzso of which exceeded 100 in the expression zzso The results of real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction from 8 randomly selected zzso showed that the 8 zzso were expressed in goat muscle, and the expression patterns were consistent with the zzso sequencing zzso The identification and characterization of zzso in goat muscle provide important information on the role of zzso regulation in muscle growth and zzso These data will help to facilitate studies on the regulatory roles played by zzso during goat growth and zzso
