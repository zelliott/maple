We have zzso three zzso zzso and zzso proteins from rat zzso These three zzso bind to zzso in a zzso manner and have been termed 35 zzso 35 zzso and 35 gamma based on their relative charge as determined by zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso is achieved by zzso zzso exchange, and gel zzso zzso zzso was produced against the zzso consensus zzso zzso which was derived from the sequence of several zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso of each zzso zzso by zzso sequence zzso places them in this protein zzso zzso against each zzso zzso were raised and zzso by zzso zzso Each zzso is zzso for the respective zzso zzso zzso zzso defines 35 zzso 35 zzso and 35 gamma as zzso III, IV, and zzso zzso zzso by zzso analysis using these zzso zzso demonstrate a markedly different tissue expression pattern for each zzso zzso Furthermore, the levels of 35 zzso 35 zzso and 35 gamma are zzso regulated in maturing rat zzso and zzso Each zzso has been localized by indirect zzso within specific cell zzso These results support the concept that mediation of the zzso calcium signal can occur via multiple pathways through several related yet independent zzso zzso
