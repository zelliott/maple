The zzso zzso constant zzso domain is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are promising scaffolds for construction of libraries containing diverse zzso that could also zzso some zzso zzso We have shown previously that an isolated human zzso domain is relatively unstable to zzso induced zzso but its stability can be improved by engineering an additional zzso bond zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Walsh, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have hypothesized that the stability of this engineered zzso domain could be further increased by removing zzso zzso To test our hypothesis, we removed the seven zzso zzso that are in a random zzso as suggested by our analysis of the isolated zzso crystal structure and zzso zzso The resulting shortened engineered zzso zzso was highly zzso zzso and remarkably stable, with a melting temperature zzso of zzso zzso which is about 10 and 30 zzso higher than those of the original stabilized zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more resistant to zzso zzso than zzso A newly identified zzso zzso that recognizes a zzso zzso bound to zzso significantly better zzso higher zzso than to zzso and slightly better than to zzso zzso bound to a zzso soluble human zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso more strongly than zzso These data suggest that zzso the zzso N zzso significantly increases stability without zzso its zzso and that our approach for increasing stability and decreasing size by removing zzso regions may also apply to other zzso
