zzso zzso zzso carries zzso mercury resistance genes on the zzso which are arranged in two zzso transcribed zzso zzso of the genes is zzso regulated by the zzso zzso which binds in the zzso region between the two zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli using a zzso zzso zzso expression system, and zzso was zzso to around zzso zzso by ammonium zzso zzso gel zzso and affinity zzso zzso zzso showed that the native zzso is a zzso with a molecular mass of 31 zzso Two DNA binding sites were identified in the zzso zzso promoter region by zzso zzso No evidence for zzso in the binding of zzso to the adjacent operator sequences was observed in gel mobility shift zzso The zzso zzso zzso for binding of zzso were: binding site I, zzso zzso zzso zzso binding site II, zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the complete zzso region 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso complex was zzso zzso and zzso zzso for binding site I and binding site II, zzso The zzso value for binding of zzso to zzso again determined by mobility shift zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso
