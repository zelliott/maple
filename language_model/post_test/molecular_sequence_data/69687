The zzso zzso factor 1 zzso recognizes specific DNA sequences by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso HD zzso properties with both specific and zzso DNA sequences were zzso zzso HD exists as a zzso in solution and as a zzso binds zzso At 75 zzso zzso its relative binding affinity with a specific DNA sequence is about 50 fold higher than with a zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso concentration reduces the apparent binding affinity both to specific and zzso DNA zzso However, zzso binding is more sensitive than specific binding to the increase of salt zzso When zzso reactions are performed at temperature and salt concentration close to the zzso environment, zzso HD binds the specific sequence with an affinity at least 1000 fold higher respect to the zzso zzso
