zzso from a patient with chronic zzso C virus zzso infection were immortalized with zzso and zzso by limiting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a commercial zzso II generation zzso which incorporates zzso derived from the zzso zzso and zzso regions, were repeatedly cloned in the presence of zzso cells and growth zzso Of 23 initially zzso cultures, only one cloned line, designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas no reaction with zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso regions were zzso Human zzso zzso zzso was shown to recognize the native zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso with a core zzso construct by zzso The fine specificity of this zzso was evaluated using synthetic zzso covering the entire zzso zzso zzso A weak but consistent zzso was observed by zzso using a zzso encompassing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso Such weak zzso is indicative for zzso zzso and, in zzso with this zzso we found that longer peptides from the region containing zzso zzso were more efficiently recognized and effectively inhibited binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Several overlapping zzso fragments from the zzso region were selected from a random zzso library consisting of zzso I fragments of zzso core zzso Best zzso zzso were identified within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in agreement with the results obtained using synthetic zzso Comparative experiments on the fine specificity of zzso from zzso patients with zzso zzso invariably showed recognition of peptides zzso and zzso as well as zzso fragments spanning from zzso 1 to 73, suggesting that zzso zzso identifies a major B cell zzso within the zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso
