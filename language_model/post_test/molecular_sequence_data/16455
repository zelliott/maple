zzso zzso zzso is a universal building block for the ubiquitous zzso that are essential to all zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso which is unique to many zzso bacteria, have recently been explored as targets for zzso zzso Several crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso the fifth of seven zzso involved in the zzso zzso for synthesis of zzso have been zzso however, the composition of metal zzso in the active site and the presence of a zzso cavity along the zzso zzso symmetry axis has varied between the reported zzso Here, the structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined to zzso A resolution in the absence of zzso The presence of a zinc zzso in the zzso zzso zzso coordinated by two zzso side zzso an zzso acid side chain and an ambiguous fourth zzso was confirmed by zinc anomalous zzso Based on analysis of anomalous zzso data and typical zzso bond zzso it was concluded that an zzso sodium zzso was zzso A from the zinc zzso A zzso cavity was observed along the zzso zzso symmetry zzso filled by a well defined zzso electron density that could be modeled as zzso zzso zzso a downstream product of zzso suggesting a possible feedback mechanism for zzso zzso The high-resolution data clarified the zzso mode compared with previously reported zzso Multiple sequence alignment indicated that the zzso critical to the formation of the zzso cavity and for zzso the zzso group of zzso are present in the majority of zzso zzso zzso supporting the idea of a specialized biological function related to zzso binding in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso
