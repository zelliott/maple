A zzso that directly zzso zzso zzso from the zzso was discovered in quail and named zzso hormone zzso The presence and functional roles of zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso that possess a common zzso zzso zzso zzso L or zzso motif have also been demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso synthesis and release by acting on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso via its zzso zzso zzso It is becoming increasingly clear that zzso is an important zzso zzso controlling zzso but the detailed signaling zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on target cells is still zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso of zzso cell signaling and its possible interaction with zzso signaling using a mouse zzso cell line, zzso First, we demonstrated the expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso We then examined the zzso effects of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell signaling zzso We showed that zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso signaling by using a zzso reporter system and measuring zzso levels, indicating that zzso function as an inhibitor of zzso zzso We further showed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and this effect was zzso by the zzso of the protein zzso A zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso gene transcriptions and also zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicate that zzso function as zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso gene transcriptions by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
