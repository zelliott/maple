Chemical zzso methods for the assembly of functional proteins continue to advance our basic understanding of protein structure and zzso In this work, we report on our progress towards the full synthesis of zzso zzso utilizing our newly developed zzso zzso zzso assisted zzso The zzso zzso was assembled from three fragments wherein the two zzso peptides were zzso efficiently using the zzso zzso strategy following zzso The zzso assisted zzso step was efficient and provided the zzso product in good zzso Following this step, native chemical zzso was used to fully assemble the zzso zzso zzso Although the removal of the auxiliary in small peptides was straightforward, in the case of zzso zzso this step was inefficient thus zzso the completion of the zzso
