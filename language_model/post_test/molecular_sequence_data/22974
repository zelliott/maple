The prediction of protein zzso is a crucial task for functional zzso zzso structure prediction and structural zzso In this paper, we present the zzso protein domain prediction approach, which is based on the application of secondary structure element alignment zzso and zzso alignment zzso in combination with zzso pattern zzso zzso allows rapid screening for potential domain regions while zzso provides us with the necessary specificity for selecting significant zzso The combination with zzso patterns allows finding domain regions without solved structural templates if sequence family definitions zzso 

A preliminary version of zzso was ranked among the top-performing domain prediction servers in the zzso 6 and zzso 4 zzso zzso of the final version shows further improvement over these results together with a significant zzso 

The server is available at zzso
