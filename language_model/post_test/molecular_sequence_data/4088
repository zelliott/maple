A zzso zzso zzso predicted to zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso acids was isolated during a study aimed at identifying transcripts specifically expressed in the inner zzso This inner zzso zzso zzso shares weak zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located at the interface between the zzso surface of the inner ear sensory zzso and their zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is detected at two attachment zones of the zzso zzso a permanent one along the top of the spiral zzso and a transient one on the surface of the developing greater zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is present on the zzso surface of zzso cells, where they contact the zzso zzso and zzso The identification of the zzso zzso in the corresponding gene zzso in one zzso Palestinian family affected by zzso zzso deafness zzso assigns an essential function to zzso We propose that zzso ensures the attachment of the inner ear zzso gels to the zzso surface of the underlying zzso zzso
