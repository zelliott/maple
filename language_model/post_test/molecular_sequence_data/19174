A low abatement efficiency for the zzso fraction of zzso emissions and a high footprint are often pointed out as the major drawbacks of conventional zzso for odor zzso In this work, two conventional zzso (a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso membrane zzso zzso were comparatively evaluated in terms of odor abatement potential and pressure drop zzso at empty bed residence times zzso ranging from 4 to zzso during the treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at trace level zzso zzso High removal efficiencies zzso regardless of the air zzso were recorded in the zzso at zzso although the high zzso across the packed bed limited its cost-effective operation to zzso A complete zzso zzso and zzso removal was recorded in the zzso at zzso and zzso lower than zzso zzso whereas slightly lower zzso were observed for zzso zzso The zzso completely removed zzso and zzso at all zzso tested, but exhibited an unstable zzso removal performance as a result of biomass zzso and a low zzso abatement zzso Thus, a zzso zzso procedure was required to ensure a steady abatement zzso Finally, a high bacterial diversity was observed in the three zzso in spite of the low carbon source spectrum present in the air zzso
