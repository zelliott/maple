During our search for zzso regulators that control the zzso regulated expression of the zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso a zzso zzso displays precise zzso expression in the adult zzso zzso (also known as zzso nuclear zzso zzso has been known to regulate gene expression through altering the stability of zzso zzso We show here that in the developing brain zzso proteins are expressed in a zzso defined manner, and zzso and zzso zzso bind to an zzso zzso zzso DNA element of the rat zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso sequence acts as a zzso DNA element and is involved in regulating the zzso expression of the zzso gene in primary zzso zzso The zzso zzso elements are present at approximately zzso zzso zzso of the zzso human, and mouse zzso zzso zzso proteins are shown here to provide direct interaction between these upstream zzso DNA sequences and the zzso region of the zzso zzso Double zzso demonstrated that in the developing brain zzso proteins are expressed by zzso neural zzso and by zzso zzso zzso brain regions, which will not express the zzso gene in the adult, suggesting a zzso role for zzso proteins during zzso zzso Their zzso distribution and interactions with zzso DNA suggest that in the developing brain they can be involved in complex nuclear regulatory mechanisms controlling the zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso
