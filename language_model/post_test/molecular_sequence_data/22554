Protection against zzso with zzso zzso bacteria, such as zzso an zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso is mainly achieved by zzso specific for the zzso the zzso part of the zzso the major bacterial surface zzso The use of chemically defined zzso encompassing zzso mimicking the protective zzso carried by the zzso thus expected to induce an efficient zzso zzso response, has been considered an alternative to zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify such functional zzso mimics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using protective zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso designed to analyze the contribution of each sugar zzso of the zzso zzso repeating unit of the zzso we demonstrated that the zzso exhibited an zzso zzso zzso We also showed that zzso the zzso sequence improved zzso zzso From these zzso data, selected synthetic zzso were assessed for their potential to mimic the zzso by analyzing their zzso in mice when coupled to zzso zzso via single point zzso Our results demonstrated that induction of an efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso response was dependent on the length of the zzso zzso A zzso representing three biological repeating units was identified as a potential candidate for further development of a chemically defined zzso vaccine against zzso zzso zzso zzso
