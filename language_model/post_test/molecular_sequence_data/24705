zzso editing is a means by which immature bone zzso B cells can become zzso zzso of heavy zzso and/or light zzso chain genes are induced by encounter with zzso to change the specificity from self to zzso We have developed zzso transgenic mice zzso whose zzso code for the H chain of zzso that bind zzso B cells that express the transgenic H chain associate mainly with four of the 93 functional zzso genes of the zzso Numerous zzso zzso that might inhibit DNA binding by the zzso domain distinguish these L chain zzso zzso but engaging these zzso editors often requires multiple zzso Among the edited B cells is a subset of zzso cells that express multiple zzso One consequence of zzso is partial zzso these zzso B cells may contribute to zzso
