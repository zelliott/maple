The zzso of the dental zzso zzso with a carbonated zzso mineral generates one of the most remarkable examples of a zzso zzso zzso Recent advances in the molecular biology of zzso gene products have now revealed the primary structures of the principal proteins involved in this zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but details of their secondary, zzso and zzso structures, their interactions with other zzso and or cell surface zzso and their functional role in dental zzso zzso zzso are still largely zzso This paper reviews our current knowledge of these zzso the probable molecular structure of the zzso zzso and the functional role of these zzso zzso zzso Recent studies on the major structural role played by the zzso proteins are discussed, and some new data on synthetic zzso zzso are zzso
