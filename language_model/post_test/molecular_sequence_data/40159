The zzso zzso domain, a zzso module involved in zzso cell zzso recognizes zzso zzso zzso which are also present in the sequence of the surface protein zzso of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with host zzso zzso enables the zzso to actively recruit host zzso in order to spread into neighboring zzso Based on the crystal structure of zzso zzso in complex with a zzso zzso zzso we have generated a range of assembled peptides presenting the zzso zzso fragments that make up its zzso binding site for zzso zzso Some of these peptides were found to inhibit the interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso One of them was further characterized at the level of individual zzso acid zzso this yielded information on the contribution of individual positions of the peptides to the interaction with the zzso and identified sites for future structure zzso
