The zzso zzso zzso zzso system of zzso zzso has been investigated with the aim of understanding more fully zzso interaction and the kinetic characteristics of electron transfer between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso I, zzso II and zzso zzso able to function as electron zzso for zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso II was determined by automatic zzso zzso It revealed a striking similarity to that of zzso zzso The protein consists of 64 zzso and its zzso acid sequence is in agreement with a molecular mass of zzso Da as measured by zzso zzso zzso II contains five zzso zzso of which the first four zzso zzso zzso and zzso are likely zzso for the single zzso zzso A zzso zzso complex between zzso and zzso I or zzso II was obtained by using a water soluble zzso This complex exhibited a zzso of one zzso for one zzso zzso and is dependent on the zzso zzso The zzso rate zzso for electron transfer between zzso and zzso determined zzso using zzso zzso are 7 zzso 107 zzso for zzso I and 2 zzso 107 zzso for zzso II and zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso for zzso I and zzso II measured both by the zzso and the zzso method have been found to be 3 zzso and 5 zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso of zzso II and surface analysis of zzso I, zzso II and zzso suggest that a zzso complex is likely to be formed between zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso cluster of zzso All of these studies are indicative of the involvement of zzso interactions between the two zzso zzso
