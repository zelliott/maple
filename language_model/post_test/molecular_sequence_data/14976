The integral membrane protein zzso zzso metal tolerance protein 1 zzso has been suggested to play an important role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso protein is accumulated to high levels at the zzso membrane in shoot tissue of zzso zzso zzso is likely to act in the transport of zzso into the zzso enhancing both zzso zzso and zzso By specifically expressing zzso in zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso localized at the zzso zzso can drive the enhanced shoot zzso of zzso by initiating a systemic zzso zzso zzso The systematic response includes increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both shoot and root zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso membrane also leads to increased resistance to zzso in zzso zzso probably through enhanced zzso zzso in the zzso Such evidence leads to the conclusion that the high levels of zzso at the zzso membrane in shoot tissue of the zzso zzso zzso zzso play a role in both zzso tolerance and enhanced zzso zzso and zzso via the zzso of a systemic zzso zzso zzso
