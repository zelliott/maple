zzso visual zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso C zzso that promotes light adaptation and fast zzso most likely via zzso of zzso no zzso D zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To reveal the critical zzso that zzso zzso we used several zzso analyses and identified protein zzso 2A zzso as a zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso star zzso is zzso with zzso and an elevated zzso of zzso by zzso was observed in three zzso zzso To explore whether zzso zzso regulates zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso in zzso we performed zzso zzso We discovered that zzso was zzso because zzso zzso displayed abnormal light adaptation and slow zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was rescued by the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso failed to modify the severe zzso of zzso indicating that zzso does not zzso zzso (no zzso potential zzso zzso Together, our results strongly indicate that zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso and a reduction of zzso can compensate for a partial loss of function in zzso restoring the fast zzso zzso in zzso We thus propose that the fast zzso of the visual response is modulated in part by the zzso of zzso
