An examination of zzso known zzso and 237 other zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso were significantly different from other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were less zzso than other zzso zzso although their mature zzso sequences were highly zzso The zzso content of zzso was higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but lower than zzso The zzso in zzso formed more hydrogen bonds and base pairs than in other zzso zzso had higher negative adjusted minimal folding free energies than other zzso except zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso index zzso was a sufficient criterion to distinguish zzso from all coding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso was zzso significantly higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our findings should facilitate the prediction and identification of new zzso using zzso and experimental zzso
