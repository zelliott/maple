Previous studies have shown that the zzso DNA binding protein of zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso the translation of the zzso of the zzso replication protein zzso II zzso We have characterized zzso zzso in the zzso and in its zzso Using a gene zzso zzso fusion, we have defined a zzso region in the gene II zzso sequence that is required in zzso for repression by the gene V zzso We have shown that in zzso the binding affinity of the gene V protein is at least zzso higher to an zzso carrying this sequence than to an zzso lacking zzso We propose that this sequence constitutes the gene II zzso zzso
