zzso and gene expression analysis are largely dependent of the availability of efficient zzso reverse zzso zzso However, the intrinsic zzso of DNA synthesis zzso by zzso zzso is zzso zzso error rates are in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso being the most faithful zzso zzso zzso group O zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is able to zzso zzso at temperatures as high as 70 zzso At 37 zzso its error rate has been estimated at zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso forward zzso zzso However, at higher temperatures zzso 50 and 55 zzso the accuracy of zzso zzso is increased by approximately two- to zzso At 55 zzso the zzso zzso error rate zzso zzso zzso was similar to that shown by the zzso zzso Technologies zzso La Jolla, CA, zzso zzso a commercially available zzso zzso zzso virus zzso At higher temperatures, the increased accuracy of the zzso zzso results from a lower base substitution error rate, although it shows a higher tendency to introduce zzso zzso studies carried out with model zzso suggest minor differences in zzso discrimination, although, at higher temperatures, zzso zzso showed a reduced ability to extend zzso zzso
