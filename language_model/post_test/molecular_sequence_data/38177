A family of negative regulators of zzso signaling zzso referred to as zzso of zzso signaling zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso has been recently zzso In order to find additional members of this family, we have used a consensus zzso acid sequence contained in the zzso central zzso domain to search DNA zzso We isolated zzso coding for the human zzso of zzso referred to as zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso expression in various zzso such as heart, muscle, zzso and zzso and in all myeloma cell lines zzso The gene was assigned to human zzso bands zzso and zzso by in zzso zzso zzso is structurally related to other members of the zzso family and therefore could act as a negative regulator of signal zzso
