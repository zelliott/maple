Disease response genes zzso diverge under zzso positive selection as a result of a molecular arms race between hosts and zzso Most of these studies were conducted in animals, and few defense genes have been shown to evolve zzso in zzso To test for adaptation in the molecules zzso disease resistance in the zzso we first combined information from the expression pattern of zzso zzso genes and from divergence to the full zzso of rice to identify candidate zzso We then used evolutionary analyses of zzso gene sets from several grass species, to determine whether the zzso show signals of positive selection and the zzso zzso We found 140 divergent genes zzso under zzso stress in zzso zzso by evaluating the relative abundance of expressed sequence tags in different libraries and comparing them with rice zzso For 10 of these zzso we found sets of zzso including sequences from rice and three other zzso six genes showed a pattern of substitution that was consistent with positive zzso Three of these zzso a zzso a zzso and a barley zzso zzso are known zzso zzso The other three genes with evidence of positive selection were a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso box zzso factor, an zzso translation initiation factor, and a gene of unknown function but with evidence of expression during zzso zzso zzso using different zzso and zzso zzso consistently identified five positively selected zzso in the zzso a member of a cluster of genes and a large gene zzso We mapped the positively selected zzso onto the structure of the zzso and zzso and found that all sites are on the surface of these proteins and several are close to zzso determined active zzso zzso new positively selected plant disease resistance genes and the critical zzso acid sites provides a basis for functional studies that may increase our understanding of their underlying molecular mechanisms of zzso Additionally, it may lead to the identification of individuals having variation at functionally important sites, as well as eventually using this information in the rational design and engineering of proteins involved in plant disease zzso
