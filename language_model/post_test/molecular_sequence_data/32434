During animal development, zzso factor activities are modulated by several means, including zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a dynamic zzso zzso such that zzso is zzso by default, but is nuclear when zzso with another zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations raise the question of whether zzso with zzso simply zzso zzso nuclear zzso or, zzso if zzso is also necessary for zzso zzso To address this question, we analyzed the nuclear transport signals in zzso including a divergent nuclear export signal zzso and two nuclear zzso signals zzso We show that, although these signals are weak compared to zzso signals, they balance each other in zzso We also provide evidence that zzso contains an zzso mask that contributes to its zzso zzso With these signals zzso we generated forms of zzso that are nuclear localized in the absence of zzso Surprisingly, although these zzso forms are functional, they do not zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is required for zzso activity, not simply for inducing its nuclear zzso
