zzso of the yellow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found unique in terms of molecular zzso Its principal toxic component zzso 1 zzso zzso was zzso and its full zzso acid sequence zzso zzso was established by protein chemistry and mass zzso zzso zzso 1 represents a novel class of zzso toxin with modular zzso It consists of two different yet zzso zzso zzso each containing a putative inhibitor zzso knot zzso characteristic of the widespread single domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing provided precursor protein zzso structures of three zzso 1 zzso zzso that differ by single zzso zzso The toxin possesses potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In both fly and zzso zzso zzso it causes stable and irreversible zzso of muscle fibers leading to zzso This effect appears to be zzso and is inhibited by high zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso cell zzso as zzso by zzso zzso and zzso artificial zzso in a manner reminiscent of other zzso peptides by causing numerous defects of variable zzso and leading to zzso zzso The newly discovered class of modular zzso enhances our knowledge of the toxin zzso
