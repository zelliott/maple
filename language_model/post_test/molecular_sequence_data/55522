zzso zzso is associated with a spectrum of clinical conditions, suggesting high degrees of genetic zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to a battery of comparative zzso analyses to determine their level of zzso For each measure, the degree of difference among the zzso zzso strains was the highest observed among 23 zzso bacterial species for which at least eight zzso are zzso Genome sizes ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso contents ranged from zzso to zzso and the core zzso consisting of only zzso zzso makes up only zzso of each zzso zzso on average and accounts for only zzso of the species zzso zzso zzso using both distributed gene possession data and core gene zzso data, each identified two major sets of zzso each of which is composed of two zzso Each of the four groups has its own characteristic zzso size, zzso ratio, and greatly expanded core gene content, making the zzso diversity of each group within the range for other bacterial zzso To test whether these 4 groups corresponded to genetically isolated zzso we zzso the zzso of each distributed gene that was present in at least two strains and absent in at least two zzso this analysis identified frequent zzso zzso within groups but not between groups or zzso zzso zzso appears to include four zzso zzso of organisms with distinct gene pools and zzso properties, which may zzso distinct ecological zzso zzso it may be appropriate to treat these four groups as separate zzso
