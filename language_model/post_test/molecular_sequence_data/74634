zzso family B DNA zzso bind tightly to zzso zzso and stall replication on encountering the zzso zzso This article describes an X-ray crystal structure, at zzso A resolution, of zzso zzso zzso in complex with a DNA zzso containing zzso in the zzso zzso The DNA backbone is distorted to position the zzso deeply within a pocket, located in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso arises from a combination of hydrogen bonds between the protein backbone and zzso with the pocket shaped to prevent the stable binding of the four standard DNA zzso Strong interactions are seen with the two zzso that flank the zzso and the structure gives clues concerning the zzso of zzso binding to the halting of zzso The importance of key zzso zzso identified by the analysis of the structure and their conservation between zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso a zzso zzso that no longer zzso zzso is also reported, explaining the zzso zzso by the zzso exclusion of zzso from the zzso
