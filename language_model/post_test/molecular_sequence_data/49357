We report the first sensory zzso observed in the zzso domain, a green zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso a freshwater zzso The gene zzso the membrane zzso protein of 261 zzso zzso zzso and a smaller gene zzso a soluble protein of 125 zzso zzso zzso are under the same promoter in a single zzso The zzso expressed zzso in zzso coli zzso bound zzso retinal to form a pink zzso zzso max zzso zzso with a zzso reaction cycle of 110 zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 degrees zzso zzso with the 14 zzso protein increased the rate of the zzso indicating physical interaction with the zzso zzso which we confirmed in zzso by affinity enrichment zzso and zzso zzso The zzso lacks the zzso donor zzso zzso in zzso C zzso in known zzso zzso pumps and did not exhibit zzso zzso ejection zzso We detected retinal binding to the protein in zzso zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso retinal of reduced zzso from the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso in its natural environment, and suggest that the soluble 14 zzso protein zzso a signal from the zzso zzso unlike the zzso sensory zzso which transmit signals by zzso zzso interactions with zzso zzso the zzso sensory zzso may signal through a soluble zzso zzso analogous to higher animal visual zzso
