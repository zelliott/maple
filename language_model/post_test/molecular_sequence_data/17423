The open reading frame of the zzso segment zzso the zzso protein of four turkey zzso field zzso was analyzed for sequence zzso The turkey zzso we present here have a zzso zzso acid identity to turkey NC zzso The zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence similarity was zzso or zzso and zzso respectively, when compared to the chicken zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences from chickens and zzso with that of a duck isolate revealed a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on both zzso and zzso acid zzso resulted in three major groups among the avian zzso these groups were clearly separated by zzso The results of this study provide further evidence, based on the deduced zzso zzso that turkey zzso form a zzso separate group relative to chicken and duck zzso In addition, as a result of the limited sequence identity with their avian counterparts, turkey zzso could potentially be considered a separate virus species within zzso 2 of the zzso zzso
