The zzso structure surrounding a zzso integration site in a transgenic zzso plant, which shows deregulation of a zzso promoter, was zzso We have already demonstrated that zzso integration in this zzso zzso had occurred close to a zzso attachment region zzso A major question regarding the observed promoter zzso was whether the zzso had integrated into the zzso or at the border of the zzso and whether other regulatory elements are located within this zzso zzso While small zzso were shown to occur during zzso integration in agreement with other reports, we find indications of the presence of a zzso zzso apparent landmark for zzso zzso the integration zzso zzso zzso to both plant and animal nuclear zzso supported by zzso zzso reveal that the zzso is definitely located at the border of a strong zzso which is in agreement with current models on the structure of integration zzso These results, together with a zzso regulated zzso zzso effect of the zzso on gene expression in transgenic tobacco plants, indicate that the zzso zzso the right border of a zzso domain with genes predominantly active in zzso
