zzso regulation of development is a common strategy for insects in the temperate zone to adapt to the seasonally changing zzso Although the zzso clock is generally thought to be involved, the underlying time measurement mechanism is still zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso clock gene period zzso plays an essential role in the zzso regulation of zzso development in the cricket zzso zzso zzso development of this cricket depends on zzso being accelerated by long days and slowed down by short zzso We examined the role of per in the zzso zzso response as well as zzso rhythm generation using parental zzso interference zzso per zzso levels in zzso heads showed a rhythmic expression with the pattern dependent on zzso and zzso significantly suppressed the per zzso level with no significant zzso in the early zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso treated with per zzso showed adult emergence patterns neither of intact zzso nor of zzso zzso zzso kept under long days or under short days but similar to those kept under constant dark zzso Most per zzso adults showed zzso or zzso zzso locomotor zzso These results suggest that the zzso time measurement requires the normal zzso clock that is controlled by the per zzso
