The complete zzso sequence and genetic organization of a new zzso island zzso isolated from the zzso avian zzso zzso coli strain zzso is zzso This zzso island is inserted at the zzso locus and contains putative mobile genetic elements such as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct zzso zzso shows a mosaic structure of five zzso Some of these zzso are present in other zzso coli strains and in other zzso bacterial zzso The gene cluster zzso to zzso of module 1 encodes proteins associated with carbohydrates zzso such as a major zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a putative zzso regulator of the zzso family zzso The zzso to zzso cluster was found in zzso of the tested zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso When present, the zzso to zzso cluster is strongly associated with the zzso locus zzso zzso of the zzso region affects the zzso of seven zzso decreases the growth rate of the strain in minimal medium containing zzso or zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso coli zzso for zzso
