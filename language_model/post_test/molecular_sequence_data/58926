We have developed a system for the quantitative assessment of the efficiency of zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso truncated derivatives of a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso amounts of zzso derivatives were incubated with a fourfold zzso excess of zzso human low density zzso and zzso formation was assessed by zzso analysis of Western zzso Although zzso formation was observed with each zzso zzso both the rate and extent of particle formation were greatly lower on removal of zzso IV type zzso Additional substantial decreases in these parameters were observed on removal of zzso IV type 8, thereby suggesting a major role for these two zzso in zzso zzso We directly demonstrated that the zzso sites zzso within zzso IV types zzso are zzso in the context of the zzso particle and are consequently unavailable for interaction with zzso Using zzso zzso we also demonstrated that the previously described zzso in zzso IV type 10 is not required for zzso zzso zzso formation using a zzso form of zzso that lacks this zzso is comparable in efficiency to that of zzso zzso and can be inhibited to a similar extent by zzso zzso In zzso the results of our study indicate that zzso zzso IV types 7 and 8 are required for zzso efficiency of zzso formation, likely by virtue of their ability to mediate zzso zzso interactions with zzso that zzso zzso bond zzso
