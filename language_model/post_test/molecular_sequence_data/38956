Whereas the zzso significance of zzso fatty acid zzso is generally zzso its molecular nature is poorly zzso Here, we describe zzso regulation of a novel mouse gene family zzso components implicated in the synthesis of very long chain fatty zzso The zzso gene appears to be zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso show a restricted expression zzso Their translation products are all integral membrane proteins with five putative zzso zzso By zzso the zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso could rescue normal zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso lacking the ability to zzso zzso acid zzso Similarly, zzso reverted the zzso of the zzso zzso that has reduced levels of fatty acids in the zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso zzso levels were markedly decreased in the brains of zzso mouse zzso known to have very low fatty acid chain zzso zzso zzso the dramatic induction of zzso expression during brown fat recruitment coincided with elevated zzso zzso Our results strongly zzso this new zzso gene family in zzso synthesis of very long chain fatty acids and zzso
