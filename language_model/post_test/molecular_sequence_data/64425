Cloning DNA typically involves the joining of target zzso with zzso zzso by zzso zzso A commonly used zzso for this reaction is zzso T4 DNA zzso which requires zzso as the energy source to catalyze the otherwise zzso formation of a zzso zzso Using in zzso selection, we have isolated a DNA sequence that zzso the zzso of DNA in the absence of protein zzso We have used the action of two zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso to create a zzso system that zzso joins zzso via the formation of a zzso zzso The zzso process is conducted in separate reaction vessels wherein the products of zzso zzso are zzso before their use as zzso for zzso zzso The final zzso step of the zzso sequence of reactions mimics the final step of the T4 DNA zzso zzso The initial rate constant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was found to be 1 zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions, the zzso zzso promotes DNA zzso at least zzso faster than that generated by a simple DNA zzso The zzso zzso has also been reconfigured to generate a zzso construct that joins separate DNA zzso of defined zzso However, the sequence requirements of the zzso and that of the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso limit the range of sequences that can be zzso
