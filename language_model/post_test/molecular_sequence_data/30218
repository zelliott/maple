Various methods have been developed recently for predicting zzso zzso in a protein by analyzing its zzso flexibility or secondary zzso The predicted results by these methods were compared directly to the observed structure of the proteins to determine how accurate they zzso zzso and correlation of the predicted zzso versus the observed zzso accessibility and the predicted chain flexibility versus actual mobility were zzso Three separate methods of zzso analysis had correlation zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, while a published method for chain flexibility analysis had a zzso correlation zzso Similarly, agreement between the observed and the predicted secondary structures by two methods was also zzso The limitations of these techniques were clearly zzso
