Four zzso bacterial strains belonging to the globally distributed marine RCA zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso class zzso were obtained from coastal seawater zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso dilution culture zzso with seawater from the German zzso Sea zzso North zzso reflecting the high abundance of RCA bacteria in this zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from diluted seawater zzso of the Yellow Sea, South zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparison, zzso zzso zzso is the closest described relative of the RCA zzso with zzso sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are small zzso rods requiring sodium zzso zzso growth of zzso occurs at 25 zzso and within a very narrow pH range zzso zzso optimum pH zzso The DNA zzso base content of zzso is zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso is zzso zzso and the dominant fatty acids zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The polar zzso pattern indicated the presence of zzso two unidentified zzso and two unidentified zzso On marine zzso zzso forms zzso transparent to light zzso small zzso zzso zzso convex zzso zzso zzso zzso all genes for the production of zzso a zzso zzso Genes zzso the zzso reaction zzso of zzso a zzso were identified in all RCA zzso No visible pigmentation was observed for any of the strains under laboratory conditions, but zzso analysis revealed weak production of zzso a by zzso zzso zzso and zzso features of strain zzso suggest that it represents a novel species of a new zzso within the zzso for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso described previously by zzso et zzso zzso J 5 zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
