We constructed a zzso zzso DNA library in zzso zzso and have isolated and determined the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned gene was derived from a zzso tumor and had no zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso beta gene in total zzso zzso The zzso zzso beta gene is 5 zzso in size and consists of five zzso and four zzso The zzso untranslated region of the zzso is zzso except for a single zzso by zzso 1, 2, and zzso The zzso regions are zzso by zzso 4 and 5 while the 3' untranslated region is entirely contained in zzso zzso zzso extension analysis using an zzso zzso primer was used to map the zzso end of the zzso Two zzso start sites are present in the zzso zzso beta gene which appear to be positioned by two zzso sequences located 40 zzso zzso In all, zzso of transcripts initiate at the downstream zzso zzso from both start sites is affected by zzso status in both zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Finally, sequences zzso with putative zzso elements and zzso zzso elements are present in the zzso region and may be important in regulating negative and positive effects on zzso beta gene zzso
