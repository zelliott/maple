zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso is an alternative zzso zzso in certain zzso zzso environments such as zzso oil reservoirs and zzso zzso zzso In these zzso the dominant zzso zzso were generally related to zzso organisms of the zzso zzso Here we isolated two representative zzso zzso and zzso from the oil zzso and oil production water in the zzso oil field in the People's Republic of zzso The type strain, zzso was zzso and stained Gram zzso The cells were straight to slightly curved rods zzso zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso zzso in zzso but some of them possessed a zzso shape connecting with the rods at the zzso zzso zzso grew with zzso but zzso is zzso zzso growth of strain zzso occurred in the presence of zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and a temperature of zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso (by zzso liquid zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (both with a sequence similarity of zzso Based on these zzso and zzso zzso a novel species was proposed and named zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
