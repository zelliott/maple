To study genetic diversity and occurrence of zzso zzso a total of zzso samples from 11 avian orders including 53 zzso and 113 species of feral and captive birds were examined using zzso gene based zzso zzso Three types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and unknown zzso zzso zzso were identified among 68 zzso positive samples zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso sequence variations in the zzso region of zzso zzso all 64 detected zzso zzso strains were grouped into 4 genetic zzso zzso I, II, III and IV were detected from zzso zzso zzso and zzso samples zzso A single strain of unknown zzso zzso was found zzso intermediate between zzso species infecting avian and zzso zzso Among zzso 28 out of 81 tested species including 10 species previously zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso was detected among zzso sick and zzso dead birds as well zzso clinically normal zzso zzso it was observed that though various genetically diverse zzso may cause avian zzso only a few zzso zzso strains are highly prevalent and frequently associated with zzso zzso
