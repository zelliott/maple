The gene zzso the zzso zzso III DNA zzso zzso which recognizes the sequence zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso zzso DNA sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene to a 334 zzso open reading frame zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a second zzso of 313 zzso zzso which is referred to as zzso Both proteins are zzso in the zzso coli coupled in zzso zzso system; they are apparently expressed from separate zzso zzso zzso The zzso half of the previously characterized zzso which zzso zzso in one of the DNA strands with its zzso recognition sequence zzso is found to have zzso sequence identity and a further zzso sequence similarity with zzso Among the zzso zzso acids is the zzso zzso sequence zzso With one exception, analysis of the zzso coding for the zzso zzso in all known zzso sequences shows the presence of an inherent DNA zzso zzso zzso recognition site of zzso A low level of expression of zzso in zzso coli prevents the zzso of its sequence recognition zzso zzso analysis of zzso shows that it is closely related to the group of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which all have a modified zzso at the second position of the recognition zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences are about 50% identical with zzso a considerable degree of sequence identity is found in the so-called variable region which is believed to be responsible for sequence recognition zzso zzso is probably the counterpart to the zzso coli zzso in zzso zzso
