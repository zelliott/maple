The zzso locus encodes a zzso that zzso the terminal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso important in zzso medicine, zzso and pathogen zzso Critical zzso changes in zzso not only abolish zzso formation but also another zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the only blood group system for which the responsible locus remains zzso Since known zzso zzso do not explain the zzso zzso zzso we set out to zzso the genetic basis of zzso Despite marked differences zzso zzso zzso in zzso transcript levels in blood, zzso experiments showed no difference between zzso promoter zzso Investigation of zzso zzso in cultured human bone zzso cells revealed novel transcripts containing only the zzso zzso 1 and a sequence (here termed zzso zzso from zzso zzso These zzso transcripts include zzso tails and 3 zzso sites, one of which was zzso among zzso 200 donors and opens a short reading frame in zzso zzso We exploited these data to devise the first zzso zzso to predict zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with both transcript levels and zzso expression on red zzso Thus, zzso zzso partially explains the well-known zzso variation in zzso zzso Future investigations need to focus on regulatory mechanisms underlying zzso zzso
