zzso zzso are key zzso maintenance zzso that function in DNA zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to nearly every other identified zzso family member, the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes three zzso and zzso D zzso zzso zzso at its C zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso acid binding with roles in targeting zzso proteins to particular DNA zzso however, only zzso proteins with single zzso zzso have been examined to zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso can be zzso removed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso consistent with each forming a structural zzso Using this observation as a guide, we produced a panel of zzso zzso zzso lacking combinations of its zzso zzso to investigate their zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain is shown to be critical for high affinity DNA binding and for efficient unwinding of DNA in some zzso In contrast, the more zzso zzso zzso zzso the DNA binding affinity and zzso zzso zzso rate of the zzso and play more complex roles in zzso DNA zzso Our results indicate that the multiple zzso zzso zzso have evolved to zzso DNA binding and regulatory functions in the zzso
