We report expression and zzso zzso for a gene cluster in zzso zzso designated zzso that has been shown to zzso an zzso zzso transport zzso zzso of zzso initiated zzso zzso upstream from the zzso translation start zzso and the resulting zzso region contained a putative zzso zzso of the zzso genes appeared to be controlled by zzso zzso interacting at the zzso since zzso a putative zzso was located within this large upstream region, zzso zzso zzso was zzso upon addition of zzso or vitamin zzso and zzso deletions in the zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso failed to grow in LB zzso and growth was restored through the addition of zzso but not other zzso This growth zzso appeared to be due to the zzso of zzso present in zzso and zzso zzso also failed to grow in minimal medium containing the zzso agent zzso unless the medium was supplemented with additional or excess zzso In zzso experiments, zzso was high in zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso whereas zzso cells in which zzso expression was zzso showed reduced zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso was reduced relative to that of the wild type, and presumably, this residual zzso transport occurred via an alternate zzso zzso zzso that is not specific to zzso In zzso the alternate zzso appeared to mediate zzso transport into zzso cells, as low zzso expression was detected in zzso and zzso zzso formed zzso zzso on zzso
