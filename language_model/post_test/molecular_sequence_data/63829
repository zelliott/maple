zzso zzso zzso zzso an autonomous zzso zzso that zzso the zzso is unusual in that alternative zzso is involved in the structural gene zzso The expression strategy for zzso zzso genes has yet not been zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso larvae infected with zzso revealed two transcripts for the zzso zzso one of zzso zzso and the other of zzso zzso The two transcripts were shown to begin at a common zzso consensus zzso zzso located in the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso transcript was produced by zzso out the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso zzso the zzso sequence of zzso gene zzso zzso which encompasses the region from the zzso of the viral zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was cloned and fused to a zzso reporter zzso The zzso reporter zzso showed that this sequence possessed promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso promoter deletion analysis showed that the promoter exhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we found that the promoter activity of the zzso zzso in zzso cells could be enhanced significantly by zzso of the zzso protein zzso and that the zzso binding element, zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity activated by zzso zzso
