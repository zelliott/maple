We investigated the in zzso folding of an oxidized zzso zzso human zzso zzso using zzso as a reducing agent at zzso and high pH zzso zzso zzso were detected and characterized by means of zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso The folding zzso and yield depended on the protein and zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso analyses indicated a sequential formation of zzso with one, two, and three zzso zzso The zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that an zzso zzso bond formed first among zzso zzso and zzso Various non-native zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso (between B7 and zzso and zzso zzso bonds were observed in the zzso with two zzso zzso The zzso with three zzso bonds had mainly the non-native zzso and zzso zzso At a zzso ratio of zzso all zzso with the non-native zzso bonds were converted to properly folded zzso via zzso bond zzso which was the zzso zzso zzso via the formation of zzso zzso bonds of early zzso was the major cause of yield zzso At a higher zzso ratio, some zzso and folded zzso were reduced to proteins with zzso zzso which caused unfolding and even more yield loss than what resulted from zzso of the early zzso zzso protein zzso while keeping an optimal zzso ratio, can improve folding yield zzso
