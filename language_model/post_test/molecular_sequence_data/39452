The mature F protein of all known zzso of human respiratory zzso virus zzso contains zzso absolutely zzso zzso zzso zzso that are highly zzso among the F proteins of other zzso as well as the zzso To explore the contribution of the zzso in the zzso domain to the fusion activity of zzso F zzso each zzso was changed to zzso zzso of zzso 37, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished or greatly reduced cell surface expression suggesting these zzso are critical for proper protein folding and transport to the cell zzso As expected, the fusion activity of these zzso was greatly reduced or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 422 had little to no effect upon cell surface expression or fusion activity at 32 degrees C, 37 degrees C, or zzso degrees zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso either abolished or reduced cell surface expression by zzso zzso None of the zzso displayed a temperature sensitive zzso
