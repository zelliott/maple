Chinese zzso heat shock protein zzso gene zzso mouse zzso and human zzso are structurally related zzso with the first two zzso about zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as a probe, we isolated a novel zzso zzso from a mouse zzso zzso library, which was highly zzso to human zzso However, the predicted zzso acid zzso sequence of zzso was longer zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso and comparable to those of zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the expression of zzso transcripts was ubiquitous in various mouse zzso and most abundant in the zzso and zzso While induction of zzso transcripts was observed in mouse zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso on temperature shift from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C zzso heat zzso or from 32 degrees C to 39 degrees C, zzso transcripts were not induced under either zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso of mouse zzso of zzso but that it belongs to the zzso family instead of zzso family, and that it plays a role under zzso zzso
