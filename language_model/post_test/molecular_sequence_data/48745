A zzso survey was conducted in six provinces in southern Iraq to determine the point prevalence of zzso disease virus zzso in different chicken populations followed by sequencing the zzso gene for zzso analysis and zzso zzso A total of 109 samples from zzso flocks were analyzed zzso 52 dust and 30 zzso samples from commercial broiler farms and 27 zzso from local layer chickens purchased in the town zzso The overall prevalence of zzso was zzso with no significant differences between provinces zzso zzso zzso or sample types zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso in Karbala and zzso to zzso in zzso The percentages of positive samples were zzso zzso and zzso in broiler dust, broiler zzso and layer zzso zzso The overall mean zzso zzso zzso zzso viral copy number per zzso of dust or zzso as determined by quantitative zzso was zzso zzso zzso with no significant differences between provinces zzso zzso zzso or sample types zzso zzso zzso In positive samples only, the overall mean was zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene from samples that showed high levels of zzso target in zzso testing was zzso Nine samples were zzso These sequences were compared with zzso sequences of zzso of different zzso All the Iraqi zzso had a short zzso gene of 897 base pairs because of the deletion of 123 zzso relative to the reference strain zzso The Iraqi zzso sequences also contained zzso zzso resulting in differences in the zzso acid zzso All of the nine Iraqi zzso genes zzso two repeats of zzso zzso The published negative association between zzso repeat number and zzso zzso suggests that the Iraqi zzso are likely to be highly zzso but this needs to be confirmed by in zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is common in zzso commercial and village chickens in southern Iraq, that there is limited zzso gene sequence variation, that all zzso samples had a short zzso with two zzso repeats, and that this is consistent with a high level of zzso
