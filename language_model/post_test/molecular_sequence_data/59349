The zzso zzso sodium channel zzso controls sodium zzso in the zzso zzso Its activity is under the control of zzso The genes zzso zzso have been identified and revealed an zzso structure of the protein composed of three zzso alpha beta gamma zzso The role of zzso in the zzso of hypertension has been demonstrated by complete linkage of the gene zzso the beta and gamma zzso to an zzso form of zzso zzso Analysis of these genes from patients affected by a sever hypertension zzso zzso identified zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso causing channel hyperactivity, consistent with increased sodium zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso form of zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of genes zzso zzso zzso in patients affected by zzso identified different types of zzso causing loss of function or a decrease in zzso channel zzso These studies demonstrated the critical role of zzso channel in the maintenance salt and zzso fluid balance, and regulation of blood zzso
