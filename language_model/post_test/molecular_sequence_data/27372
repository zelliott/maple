Evolution of zzso organisms from zzso ancestors is commonly thought to represent zzso expansion into new ecological zzso possibly only once per zzso For zzso this evolutionary expansion occurred in the zzso zzso and all living and extinct zzso zzso have been placed within 1 zzso the zzso zzso The subsequent radiation of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso resulted in highly diverse zzso which suffered mass extinction at the end of the zzso leaving an impoverished zzso dominated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The few zzso species radiated to form diverse zzso once again in the zzso There have, however, long been doubts regarding the zzso origin of zzso zzso We present surprising but conclusive genetic evidence that the Recent zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the same biological species as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso evidence that this ecologically flexible species actively grows within the zzso surface waters, thus occupying both zzso and zzso zzso Such a lifestyle zzso had not been recognized as adapted by zzso zzso are endowed with great ecological advantage, enabling rapid zzso of the zzso zzso domain from the zzso We argue that the existence of such forms must be considered in resolving zzso zzso
