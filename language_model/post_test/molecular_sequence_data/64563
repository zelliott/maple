zzso zzso zzso could be viable scaffolds for the synthesis of zzso This research demonstrates that a zzso zzso zzso could actually be taken up by the cell, the zzso chain zzso by cellular zzso and the zzso product released by the cells to the culture zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was chemically zzso and introduced in mouse zzso cells to prime zzso zzso zzso of the primer by zzso cells resulted in the zzso of the terminal zzso zzso to afford an zzso with the same zzso structure as zzso zzso The presence of many zzso atoms did not have any adverse effects to the zzso Moreover, the number of zzso atoms did not pose a zzso barrier and instead, their presence possibly increased the zzso of the primer and enhanced membrane zzso This strategy of using a zzso primer and cells can pave the way for an easier way of preparing zzso via an zzso approach that eliminates the use of large amounts of organic zzso
