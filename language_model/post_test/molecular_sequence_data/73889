The human zzso contains a large variety of sequences related to the mouse zzso tumor virus zzso We have investigated the range of expression of human zzso zzso sequences zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso in 60 breast zzso 8 zzso breast zzso and 9 zzso This was monitored using zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso toward zzso zzso of zzso pol sequences and internal zzso The degree of expression of five zzso groups varied between individuals and between zzso On average, all zzso groups were less expressed in breast zzso than in zzso The zzso signals of some zzso zzso were strongly zzso indicating a zzso mechanism and a concerted regulation of their zzso The zzso product from one breast cancer zzso zzso which gave an exceptionally high expression with probe zzso with a 20 times stronger signal than the rest of the zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso transcript sequences were homogeneous in BC zzso The most zzso clone derived from the cancer was used as a probe in Southern zzso The same restriction fragments were detected in human breast zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso and breast cancer cell lines, except for one of the breast zzso and one of the zzso breast zzso which gave different zzso zzso A comparison of zzso expression in normal and zzso breast tissue from the same individual would have been more precise than our comparison of samples from different zzso zzso this limitation in mind, with a single exception, human zzso sequences were not more actively expressed in zzso than in zzso breast zzso Nevertheless, an interesting diversity in their zzso especially between individuals, was zzso
