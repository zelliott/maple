The zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso and cell zzso zzso interacts with the zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso at specific zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso and promotes zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso leads to the deregulation of the cell cycle during zzso zzso Although how zzso occurs on zzso has been studied zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso remains unclear due to a lack of information on the structural arrangement of zzso and zzso Here, we have determined and refined to zzso resolution the crystal structure of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso 6 zzso of the zzso from zzso The crystal structure reveals that zzso contains seven zzso zzso The number of the repeats is different from that predicted from the primary zzso zzso also possesses an unusual curved structure with two zzso regions at the zzso and zzso regions separated by one basic region, suggesting that it has at least two functional zzso The zzso structure of zzso together with the previous zzso studies, indicates that the zzso and zzso binding surfaces of zzso are located at the zzso and zzso regions, respectively, and face the same side of zzso These observations suggest that zzso brings zzso and zzso together through zzso and zzso interactions and determines the relative positioning of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Our findings provide zzso insight into zzso zzso of zzso caused by zzso
