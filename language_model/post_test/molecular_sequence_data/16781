The zzso cluster region protein zzso is a large soluble zzso zzso protein best known because of its involvement in chronic zzso leukemia zzso A zzso zzso between its gene and that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a major zzso role in that zzso Thus most attention has been paid to the role of the protein in zzso zzso However, zzso is also expressed in other cell types including zzso zzso is generally considered to be a zzso protein but in addition to its zzso and zzso exchange and zzso zzso it contains potentially zzso zzso zzso and C2 zzso as well as a zzso C zzso zzso an interaction with a zzso protein at zzso junctions of zzso zzso We have examined the ability of zzso to interact with other zzso zzso proteins and found specific binding to both the zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso The former is important in the organization of several zzso functions and the latter in zzso trafficking in the zzso zzso Hence these findings extend the interactions and likely signaling impact of zzso in zzso from the zzso to at least these two membrane zzso
