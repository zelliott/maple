A single gene zzso zzso virus that derived its M gene from the attenuated influenza zzso zzso zzso zzso donor virus and the remaining genes from the zzso zzso wild type zzso virus zzso zzso CA zzso was previously shown to be attenuated in mice, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso of this zzso virus could result directly from an altered function of the zzso M gene product of the zzso zzso CA virus, which differs from the M gene of the zzso zzso zzso virus at only one zzso acid or, indirectly from a gene constellation effect in which zzso results from an inefficient interaction between the products of the M gene of the zzso zzso virus and other genes of the zzso zzso Several lines of evidence from the present study are consistent with our interpretation that the zzso zzso of the zzso CA zzso results from a gene constellation zzso First, the zzso CA zzso and an zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso M gene were each restricted in replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of mice compared with the zzso zzso zzso Second, an zzso CA zzso containing the M gene from the zzso zzso CA donor virus in a background of other genes derived from the zzso zzso zzso virus was not attenuated in the respiratory tract of zzso These data suggest that the change in the zzso acid sequence of the M gene product from the zzso zzso zzso to CA virus is not responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso CA zzso In addition, evidence of the genetic instability of the zzso CA zzso is zzso specifically, an zzso zzso that results in loss of the zzso zzso The implications of these findings for the zzso zzso of the live attenuated zzso viruses derived from the zzso zzso CA donor virus are zzso
