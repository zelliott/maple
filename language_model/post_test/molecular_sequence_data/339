zzso is a widespread sexual system in zzso characterized by plants carrying both male and bisexual zzso zzso is characterized by the presence of both male and female flowers on the same zzso In cucumber, these sexual forms are controlled by the identity of the zzso at the M zzso In melon, we recently showed that the transition from zzso to zzso result from a zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso To isolate the zzso gene in cucumber we used a candidate gene approach in combination with zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated zzso of zzso a close zzso of zzso with the M zzso zzso analysis of zzso in cucumber zzso identified four zzso zzso three in zzso and one in zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso is due to a loss of zzso zzso activity, we expressed the four zzso in zzso coli and zzso their activity in zzso Like in melon, the zzso from the zzso lines showed reduced to no zzso activity and the zzso from the zzso line was zzso zzso with this, the zzso leading zzso were clustered in the active site of the zzso Based on this, we concluded that active zzso zzso leads to the development of female flowers in zzso lines, whereas a reduction of zzso activity yields zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso like zzso in melon, is expressed specifically in zzso zzso of buds determined to develop zzso Following zzso zzso zzso communication is likely responsible for the zzso of stamina zzso In both melon and cucumber, flower zzso seems to be the ancestral situation, as the majority of zzso species are zzso Thus, the zzso gene of zzso likely have controlled the zzso development before zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that have zzso over 40 My zzso The isolation of the genes for zzso in zzso species provides a molecular basis for understanding how sexual systems arise and are maintained within and between zzso
