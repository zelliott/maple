zzso import signals have been shown to function in many steps of zzso protein zzso Previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso precursor zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contains an extended, functionally redundant zzso import signal at its zzso zzso However, the full significance of this functionally redundant targeting sequence has not been zzso We now report that the extended zzso signal acts to maintain the precursor in an zzso zzso prior to import, in addition to its previously characterized roles in zzso targeting and zzso We found that this extended signal is required for the efficient zzso zzso import of zzso both in zzso and in zzso To determine whether the zzso signal directly influences precursor zzso fusion proteins that contain zzso and zzso forms of the zzso import signal attached to the model passenger protein zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso that reduced the import signal to a minimal functional unit decreased both the zzso of precursor folding and the efficiency of zzso zzso To confirm that the reduced zzso import associated with this truncated signal was due to a zzso in its ability to maintain zzso in a loosely folded zzso we introduced structurally zzso zzso zzso into the zzso passenger to block precursor folding independently of the import zzso We found that the truncated signal imported this zzso form of zzso as efficiently as the intact targeting zzso indicating that the primary zzso associated with the minimal signal is an inability to maintain the precursor in a loosely folded zzso Our results suggest that the loss of this zzso zzso function leads to defects in the early stages of the import zzso
