There are three common zzso zzso B, and zzso at the human zzso blood group zzso We compared zzso sequences of these zzso and relatively large numbers of zzso differences were found among zzso These differences zzso to the divergence time of at least a few million years, which is unusually large for a human zzso divergence under neutral zzso We constructed zzso networks of human and nonhuman zzso zzso zzso and at least three independent appearances of B zzso from the ancestral A form were zzso These results suggest that some kind of balancing selection may have been operating at the zzso zzso We also constructed zzso trees of zzso and their zzso related zzso zzso and the divergence time between these two families was estimated to be roughly 400 zzso
