The zzso of the zzso apparatus depends on the concerted action of the nuclear and zzso genetic zzso Numerous nuclear and zzso zzso of zzso deficient in zzso activity have been isolated and zzso While several of these zzso alter the genes of components of the zzso complexes, a large number of the zzso affect the expression of zzso genes involved in zzso Most of these zzso are nuclear and only affect the expression of a single zzso zzso The zzso examined appear to act principally at zzso steps such as zzso stability, zzso processing, zzso and zzso and zzso Directed zzso DNA surgery through zzso transformation has provided a powerful tool for identifying important zzso elements involved in zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso genes consisting of zzso regulatory regions fused to reporter genes into the zzso zzso has led to the identification of target sites of the zzso functions affected in some of the zzso zzso studies have identified a set of zzso proteins that interact with the zzso regions of zzso zzso The binding activity of some of these factors appears to be modulated by light and by the growth zzso
