The alpha zzso of the rat brain sodium channel is zzso by zzso protein zzso in zzso and in zzso at multiple sites which yield seven zzso zzso zzso zzso and 7 are derived from zzso sites between zzso zzso and zzso in a single large zzso zzso from the zzso segment connecting zzso zzso I and II of the alpha zzso zzso zzso Gordon, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present work, zzso were prepared against a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso which contain one additional potential zzso site at zzso in a different predicted zzso zzso of this same zzso zzso zzso recognizes native and zzso sodium channels specifically and zzso zzso zzso fragments of low molecular mass that contain a new site zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso derived from intact alpha zzso with those derived from the zzso zzso fragments isolated by zzso with zzso indicates that the two previously unidentified zzso 5 and 6 derived from the intact alpha zzso arise from zzso of the site containing zzso These results identify a new zzso zzso site and show that the major zzso zzso sites of the rat brain sodium channel, which are zzso both in zzso and in intact zzso are all located in a cluster between zzso zzso and 687 in the zzso segment between zzso I and zzso
