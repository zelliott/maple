zzso and maintenance of a zzso of the zzso zzso 434 require that the 434 zzso both activate zzso from the zzso promoter and repress zzso from the divergent zzso zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that the 434 zzso activates initiation of zzso zzso by occupying a binding site adjacent to the zzso promoter and directly zzso zzso zzso The overlapping architecture of the zzso and zzso promoters suggests that an zzso zzso bound at zzso may repress zzso zzso zzso zzso part of the zzso effect of the 434 zzso may be relief of interference between zzso zzso binding to the zzso promoter and to the zzso zzso zzso with this proposal, we show that the zzso cannot activate zzso zzso if zzso zzso binds at zzso prior to addition of the 434 zzso However, unlike the findings with the related zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso promoter complexes at zzso and at zzso apparently are mutually zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso requires the presence of an open complex at zzso Taken together, these results indicate that establishment of an open complex at zzso directly prevents formation of an zzso zzso zzso
