zzso zzso T zzso zzso are key zzso of immunity to zzso pathogens and zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso in the form of zzso class I complexes zzso presented on the target cell surface is zzso by T cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigate the biological effects of a zzso substitution in the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso that enhances zzso binding by approximately 50% without altering zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso forms of zzso zzso exhibit enhanced recognition by zzso without loss of zzso These zzso zzso induce greater zzso zzso chain zzso in zzso zzso leading to substantial increases in zzso production, proliferation and zzso of zzso T zzso This effect provides a fundamental new mechanism with which to enhance cellular immunity to specific T cell zzso
