The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso and is an important target for drugs and zzso zzso zzso zzso with various zzso combinations zzso differential selectivity for zzso zzso We investigated the zzso selectivity of zzso zzso by comparing two zzso proteins zzso as structural surrogates with distinct pharmacological profiles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of low zzso and high zzso sensitivities and zzso zzso zzso zzso of high zzso zzso mimicking zzso and insect zzso zzso zzso The structural basis of zzso selectivity was examined here by zzso zzso Two zzso zzso in the zzso surprisingly modified two distinct and distant zzso interface sites: loop F zzso of the complementary or zzso zzso and loop C zzso of the principal or zzso zzso whereas three zzso zzso zzso only zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso labeled zzso at only one position at the interface between loop C zzso and loop E zzso These findings were used to establish structural models of the two zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso and zzso are nestled in similar bound zzso zzso for the zzso the zzso have two bound zzso that are zzso relative to each other, whereas zzso appear buried in only one zzso zzso as seen for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso selectivity is based on two disparate bound zzso of zzso zzso thereby establishing an zzso concept for zzso versus zzso selectivity between insect and zzso zzso
