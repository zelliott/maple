zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is an extremely zzso and zzso zzso zzso which retains its structure and reaches zzso activity at 100 degrees zzso The structural stability of this protein was investigated by zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso studies to molecular zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso unfolds with an zzso zzso zzso zzso In the molecular model, a cluster of zzso zzso was shown at the interface between the zzso of zzso and suggested this cluster as a structural feature stabilizing the zzso zzso zzso At 25 degrees C, zzso is less resistant to zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso from pig heart zzso which was chosen as a zzso counterpart in the zzso analysis since it shares with zzso the two-state unfolding zzso zzso in the case of zzso zzso zzso stability does not correlate with the stability against chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso at 25 degrees C and melting profiles recorded in the presence of zzso zzso showed that the delta G degrees zzso at 25 degrees C of zzso exceeds that of zzso by roughly 15 zzso the zzso delta zzso related to the number of binding sites for the zzso zzso exposed in unfolded and folded states, is higher for zzso than for zzso and delta zzso is lower for the zzso zzso than for the zzso one by 8 zzso These results are indicative of a less zzso core for zzso than zzso In agreement with this, the molecular model predicts that some charged side chains are buried in zzso and interact to form an zzso zzso
