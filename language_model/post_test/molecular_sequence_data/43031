We isolated and characterized a sequence coding for zzso protein 70 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso protection zzso led us to conclude that an zzso zzso strictly zzso in zzso cells during heat zzso is zzso active during zzso By quantitative northern and western zzso analysis, we showed that both zzso zzso and zzso protein levels increased in zzso from stage II to stage VI under zzso zzso Furthermore, by in zzso zzso to the nascent transcripts of zzso zzso zzso we provided evidence for a clear-cut relationship between this increase in zzso zzso and zzso activity during the zzso stage of zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso genes are actively transcribed throughout zzso zzso proteins localized in the zzso of young zzso are progressively transferred to the nucleus in the course of zzso and zzso accumulated in the zzso of some stage VI zzso
