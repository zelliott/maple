zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso DNA is especially susceptible to zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso are thought to play roles in zzso zzso This study examines the ability of zzso zzso and zzso to unwind and zzso to bind zzso zzso containing zzso The results demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso unwind zzso zzso containing zzso and that zzso binds with higher affinity to zzso zzso with zzso but shows no preference for zzso zzso DNA with zzso We speculate that zzso zzso with zzso may have a greater tendency to form zzso DNA structures than zzso DNA lacking zzso
