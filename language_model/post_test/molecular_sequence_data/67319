The zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso is predicted to zzso an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso genes are transcribed as an zzso zzso with the in zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso protein exhibited zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso reporter fusion strains revealed that the expression of zzso is subjected to finely tuned zzso control, but enhanced expression occurs only in severely zzso stressed zzso zzso extension analysis zzso the zzso responsive zzso promoter, and zzso zzso was employed to assess functionally important sequences required for promoter activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity were zzso A deletion analysis of the zzso regulatory region showed that a zzso zzso DNA segment positioned 180 zzso upstream of the zzso sequence is critical for the activity and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso is subjected to genetic control at a zzso Upon the onset of growth of cells of the zzso zzso zzso strain in zzso medium zzso M zzso we observed gross zzso zzso of cells that were then reversed to a zzso zzso again when the cells had adjusted to the zzso zzso The products of the zzso gene cluster were not critical for zzso zzso zzso but the deletion of this zzso yielded a zzso zzso zzso impaired in growth in a defined minimal medium and at high zzso
