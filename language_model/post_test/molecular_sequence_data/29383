We demonstrated previously that zzso zzso E zzso binds to type V collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso 9, zzso In this study, we investigated the structure and binding of zzso zzso Eleven zzso were isolated from zzso by gel zzso zzso and zzso high performance liquid zzso after zzso with zzso zzso Separately, seven zzso were custom zzso using the zzso reaction of zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso zzso in conjunction with high performance liquid zzso and mass zzso This library of 18 zzso was used as a source of model molecules to clarify the structural requirements for binding to type V zzso zzso was analyzed by a zzso based on surface zzso zzso The results indicated that to bind to type V collagen the zzso must have the following zzso zzso 1) zzso or larger in size; 2) a continuous sequence of three zzso zzso 3) a zzso unit, zzso unit or zzso unit at the reducing zzso 4) a zzso unit at the zzso zzso It is likely that these characteristic zzso sequences play key roles in cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso
