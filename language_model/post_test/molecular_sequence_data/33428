zzso are the most abundant biological entities and can control microbial communities, but their identity in zzso and freshwater Antarctic zzso is zzso The genetic structure of an Antarctic lake viral community revealed unexpected genetic richness distributed across the highest number of viral families that have been found to date in aquatic viral zzso In contrast to other known aquatic zzso which are dominated by zzso zzso this Antarctic virus zzso had a large proportion of sequences related to zzso zzso including zzso and zzso DNA zzso viruses not previously identified in aquatic zzso We also observed that the transition from an zzso lake in spring to an zzso lake in summer led to a change from a zzso to a zzso zzso zzso possibly reflecting a seasonal shift in host zzso
