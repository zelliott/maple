The human zzso protein gene has been cloned and mapped to the zzso region of zzso 13 and zzso zzso in the mouse and human zzso zzso The gene consists of 7 zzso and 6 zzso The mature protein has 10 zzso and 5 tandem zzso bridges 4 of which are contained within zzso 3, 5, 6, and zzso One bridge is shared by zzso 3 and zzso The signal zzso and the first 3 zzso acids of the mature protein were coded for by an extreme zzso zzso zzso extension analyses revealed the zzso initiation site to be located 32 zzso downstream from a consensus zzso zzso The promoter sequence contained a number of putative promoter elements including an zzso site, three zzso sites, the zzso zzso elements zzso B and zzso and the zzso enhancers zzso and zzso
