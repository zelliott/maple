zzso zzso zzso zzso is a hormone zzso by the zzso zzso from the zzso that stimulates zzso insulin zzso Here, we present the molecular characterization of the human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso clones for the zzso zzso were isolated from a human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso They zzso two different forms of the zzso which differed by a zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence was zzso identical to that of the rat zzso zzso When expressed in Chinese zzso lung zzso both forms of the zzso displayed zzso binding for zzso zzso and 600 zzso zzso binding was displaced by zzso zzso by 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However zzso and zzso at 1 zzso displaced binding by approximately 70 and approximately zzso at 10 zzso zzso binding to both forms of the zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso zzso levels zzso values of zzso zzso but no zzso of zzso calcium zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso were zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation by up to zzso when present at a concentration of 10 zzso Finally, the physical and genetic zzso zzso of the zzso gene was determined to be on zzso close to the zzso zzso These data will help study the physiology and zzso of the human zzso zzso
