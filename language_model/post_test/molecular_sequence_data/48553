zzso 1 zzso is a zzso factor of the zzso zzso protein family and is essential for many zzso zzso zzso proteins all contain two zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso In zzso the zzso region also contains the zzso zzso 3 zzso domain zzso which interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso have been implicated in zzso of DNA binding potentially through an zzso interaction with or close to the zzso Here we investigate the zzso as a candidate zzso interaction zzso Competitive zzso hybrid experiments indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso from zzso can interact with apparently low zzso consistent with no detection of an zzso interaction in the same zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance studies show that the interaction is specific, whereas substitution of the zzso with peptides of the same zzso acid composition but different sequence is not zzso We solved the crystal structure of a similar but higher affinity complex between the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso interaction domain from the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and used these coordinates to generate a zzso model of the zzso interaction that indicates poorer zzso for the weak zzso zzso The zzso interaction in zzso may provide protection against zzso minimize zzso DNA zzso and facilitate zzso exchange within the zzso
