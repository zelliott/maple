The zzso and La zzso which were originally identified by zzso from zzso patients, consist of zzso complexes zzso in which the protein components carry most of the zzso zzso In human cells, zzso zzso consist of one of four small zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with several zzso zzso zzso and La zzso 35, zzso and possibly other, yet unidentified zzso zzso data have been published on the association of the protein zzso with zzso zzso zzso 58, 75, zzso but recently in zzso evidence has been obtained that zzso zzso is able to interact with zzso zzso directly zzso The zzso significance of this interaction remains to be zzso In addition to its association with zzso zzso La is (in most cases zzso associated with all other zzso zzso III zzso The zzso zzso are the only known cellular zzso zzso bound by zzso While the zzso zzso were found to reside mainly in the zzso the other La zzso are mainly zzso In this review recent progress made on the zzso zzso and transport of zzso zzso components and of assembled zzso zzso will be zzso
