We previously reported the set up of an automated test for screening the zzso of zzso proteins expressed as inclusion bodies in zzso zzso The screen used 96 zzso buffers and was validated with 24 zzso zzso of which remained soluble in at least one zzso In the present paper, we have analyzed in more detail these experimental data to see if the zzso process can be driven by general zzso zzso we found that proteins with an zzso zzso point zzso zzso in buffers the average pH of which was alkaline and zzso In addition, the number of zzso buffers wherein a protein remained soluble increased with the difference between its zzso and the average pH of the buffers in which it zzso A trend analysis of the other variables zzso strength, detergents, zzso was also zzso On the basis of this analysis, we devised and validated a new zzso screen made of a single buffer for zzso proteins and a single buffer for alkaline zzso
