zzso zzso were tested as a means of increasing both the sensitivity and the selectivity of zzso and zzso inhibitor detection after zzso zzso Out of six zzso applied to cellulose zzso zzso N zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be suitable for zzso and zzso zzso was suitable for zzso A procedure to detect zzso and zzso zzso and to discriminate between them, was zzso After zzso slab gels were first incubated with the zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso or human zzso zzso at 37 degrees C, and then covered with the respective zzso membrane and incubated at room temperature while being observed under zzso zzso Dark blue inhibitor bands on a zzso background were obtained with zzso and zzso whereas zzso resulted in dark inhibitor bands on a fluorescent green zzso The zzso overlay membrane zzso zzso zzso was used after zzso gel zzso focusing with carrier zzso and immobilized pH zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso
