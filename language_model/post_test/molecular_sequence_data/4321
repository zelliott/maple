The zzso zzso U2, zzso and zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso using a combination of zzso and zzso sequencing methods and were compared to other zzso zzso The lengths of zzso zzso and zzso U2 zzso are similar to those of their higher plant zzso zzso zzso zzso is shorter zzso zzso than its counterpart from higher plants zzso zzso and contains stem IV and loop D which are zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of other zzso organisms studied to zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso and U2 zzso identical to those described for zzso and zzso systems, are structurally feasible in the zzso zzso In addition, based on comparative analyses of the predicted zzso zzso duplex from various species, an evolutionary zzso third putative zzso interaction was zzso Interestingly, it can also be formed with the recently discovered zzso and zzso zzso This is a strong support in favor of the possible biological significance of this third putative zzso Based on comparative analysis, an extension of the earlier described zzso interaction patterns is also zzso
