Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso of several zzso that produce zzso compounds with the zzso acid zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso as a probe indicated the presence of an zzso gene in the zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso was cloned from an zzso zzso zzso DNA library and zzso zzso of the gene together with its zzso regions were zzso to reveal the presence of a zzso zzso open reading frame coding for a protein of zzso zzso acids with 190 zzso molecular zzso The presence of a short zzso zzso zzso near the zzso of the zzso gene was predicted that contains the zzso zzso and AG zzso at its zzso and zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso showed high zzso with zzso zzso zzso along the whole zzso On the other hand, slight zzso was detected only around the zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso of zzso was observed throughout the culture period by Northern zzso zzso To identify the function of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso its coding region was introduced into the zzso expression zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso The constructed expression zzso was introduced into zzso zzso The zzso produced significant amounts of zzso acid, the structure of which was identified by zzso zzso This result zzso demonstrated that the zzso gene codes for zzso of zzso zzso
