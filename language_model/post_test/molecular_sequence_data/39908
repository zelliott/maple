We have previously shown that zzso expression of zzso zzso from zzso immediate early promoter critically depends on the zzso zzso bias of the gag zzso Here, we demonstrate that adaptation of the green fluorescent protein zzso reporter gene to zzso zzso bias is sufficient to turn this zzso zzso into a zzso message following the rules of late zzso gene zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly decreased in zzso cells strictly zzso with reduced zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso major zzso zzso the zzso zzso were stabilized in the nucleus and efficiently exported to the zzso following fusion of the 3' zzso element zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso was specifically inhibited by zzso B suggesting export via the zzso zzso used by late zzso zzso In conclusion, this zzso reporter system may provide a new platform for developing sensitive Rev screening zzso
