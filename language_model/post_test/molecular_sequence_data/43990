The active forms of all of the zzso zzso zzso are inhibited by a family of specific zzso the tissue zzso of zzso zzso zzso represents a major level of control of zzso zzso A detailed knowledge of the mechanisms controlling zzso gene expression is therefore zzso We have isolated a zzso clone of the human zzso zzso A 3 zzso zzso zzso has been zzso this zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, a zzso zzso zzso 1 and part of zzso zzso Computer analysis reveals 10 consensus sequences for zzso six for zzso protein 1 zzso six for zzso zzso A3 zzso 12 for zzso and five zzso zzso The region zzso with a zzso zzso promoter zzso has been zzso and zzso zzso zzso protection identifies six zzso start points, making zzso 1 up to 48 zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reporter zzso into primary human zzso tissue zzso shows that a zzso zzso zzso that zzso to a zzso zzso promoter zzso contains a functional zzso zzso of zzso to zzso are zzso with serum or zzso zzso to a similar extent to the zzso zzso zzso These results and further mapping with zzso deletion zzso from the zzso region have demonstrated that an zzso site at zzso is essential for zzso expression of the zzso Point zzso within this region have further confirmed the role of this site, along with a more minor role for a zzso zzso site, in zzso zzso zzso from the 3' end also zzso a region across the zzso zzso 1 boundary and especially zzso to zzso in zzso zzso The zzso region contains a putative binding site for the zzso factor zzso protein 1 zzso zzso analysis shows that protein binds specifically to this region, but competition studies suggest that it is unlikely to be zzso
