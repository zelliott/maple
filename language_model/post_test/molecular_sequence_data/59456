The zzso zzso a novel protein was constructed from the cellular zzso isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this novel protein contained 65 zzso acid zzso with 8 zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis showed that it was structurally related to zzso rather than zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso may contain zzso which was not noticed zzso
