The gene zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein in zzso coli zzso zzso The analyzed zzso sequence of the cloned gene proved to be identical to those reported on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso showing a molecular weight of approximately 210 zzso as estimated by gel zzso The zzso values of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and homocysteine zzso were determined to be zzso 10, and 45 zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso produced a high level of protein zzso zzso of protein per gram of wet zzso and revealed certain zzso when characterized at temperatures above 40 degrees zzso It also showed a high capacity for the synthesis of zzso zzso stability, and high kinetic similarity to human zzso indicating a high zzso and pharmacological zzso
