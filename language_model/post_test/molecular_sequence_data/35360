zzso zzso is a major zzso disease threatening millions of people in zzso Though overall prevalence was greatly reduced during the second half of the past century, continued persistence in some areas and cases of zzso in others remain major zzso As many regions in China are approaching disease zzso obtaining quantitative data on zzso zzso zzso is increasingly zzso This study examines the distribution of zzso in eastern China, taking advantage of the fact that the single intermediate host serves as a major transmission zzso zzso zzso and high-resolution ecological data are combined to construct a zzso model capable of zzso the probability that zzso occurs in a target area zzso explicit zzso zzso zzso show that intermediate host genetic parameters are correlated with the distribution of endemic disease areas, and that five explanatory zzso minimum temperature, annual zzso genetic distance, and zzso zzso between endemic and zzso zzso Model predictions are correlated with human infection rates observed at the county zzso zzso of the model indicates that the highest risks of disease occur in the zzso and zzso lake regions, as expected, as well as in some zzso areas of the zzso zzso High risk areas are zzso suggesting the complex zzso interplay of zzso and zzso lakes with the zzso River may be important for maintaining zzso in eastern zzso zzso demonstrate the value of genetic parameters for risk zzso and particularly for reducing model prediction zzso The findings have important consequences both for understanding the zzso of the current distribution of zzso zzso infections, and for designing future zzso surveillance and control zzso The results also highlight how genetic information on zzso that constitute bottlenecks to disease transmission can be of value for risk zzso
