The product of the zzso (also called zzso or zzso gene is a basic domain, zzso zzso zzso factor required for the development of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso gene disruption and zzso by either zzso zzso or a zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso regulatory elements of the zzso gene become juxtaposed to the body of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we show that an inappropriately expressed zzso zzso driven by zzso regulatory zzso can cause aggressive zzso zzso in collaboration with a zzso zzso zzso thus zzso the situation seen in a subset of human zzso zzso Moreover, we show that inappropriately expressed zzso can interfere with the development of other zzso derived from zzso Lastly, we show that an zzso construct lacking the zzso zzso domain collaborates with zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso domain is zzso for zzso and supporting the hypothesis that the zzso gene product exerts its zzso action through a zzso zzso
