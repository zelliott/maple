zzso acute regulatory protein zzso transfers cholesterol over the inner zzso zzso In zzso zzso controls this zzso step of zzso but its expression and regulation has not been well explored in zzso The present work investigates zzso zzso expression in the head kidney of the zzso zzso zzso zzso under different zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso number zzso which has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and displays high sequence identity with zzso of other fish and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found to be expressed exclusively in head zzso and zzso In fish under acute stress zzso with a zzso plasma cortisol levels peaked within 1 zzso were still high after 6 zzso and decreased after 16 zzso although no increases in head kidney zzso expression were observed at any time zzso Fish under chronic zzso stress showed cortisol levels zzso higher than controls and zzso zzso levels increased zzso zzso zzso injection increased head kidney zzso zzso levels after 6 zzso reached a maximum at 12 zzso and decreased until 72 zzso When the head kidney cells were incubated in zzso and treated with zzso or zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso expression as expected, but zzso induced a reduction in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso expression in zzso head zzso is highly regulated by different zzso
