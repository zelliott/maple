zzso of zzso requires the structural precursor zzso zzso to target the plasma membrane through its zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso the interaction between membrane signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and MA zzso the exposure of zzso and promotes membrane zzso Here we studied zzso of the naturally zzso zzso infectious anemia virus zzso MA and its interaction with zzso primarily using solution zzso zzso The measured zzso residual zzso zzso agrees with the atomic coordinates from the zzso MA crystal zzso The zzso zzso results show a dominant population of zzso zzso MA at a concentration of 63 zzso and 20 degrees C, along with a small zzso and a broad distribution of other zzso The zzso equilibrium model and the zzso packing of the zzso were further established by the zzso zzso spin relaxation rates and chemical zzso zzso of MA to zzso was detected by chemical shift mapping zzso with an apparent zzso of 182 zzso 56 zzso a value similar to that reported for zzso zzso The zzso binding site includes the zzso region between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and spin relaxation zzso reveal a zzso of zzso change and zzso zzso respectively, between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso We zzso that zzso zzso in the initial zzso formation of zzso MA, but more importantly, the concentration effect is dominant in shifting the equilibrium toward zzso in line with the zzso switch mechanism proposed for zzso zzso zzso
