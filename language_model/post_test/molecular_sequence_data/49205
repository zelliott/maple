The surface of zzso zzso zzso the first structure recognized by the host immune system, is covered by zzso We report that this outer cell wall layer contains two zzso zzso and zzso which are found as highly zzso zzso The zzso gene was previously zzso and zzso zzso do not display a zzso layer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Paris, zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned and zzso zzso was highly zzso to zzso and different from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso layer similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso is not required for zzso zzso The surface of zzso zzso is zzso in contrast, an zzso layer is present at the surface of the zzso of the zzso zzso double zzso These data show that zzso plays a role in the structure of the zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso are more sensitive to killing by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso or the zzso structure is involved in the resistance to host zzso
