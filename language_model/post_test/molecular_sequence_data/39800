It has been reported that both normal zzso and zzso zzso express zzso a nuclear hormone zzso the expression being more abundant in zzso zzso and that this is the basis for the reported zzso effects of the zzso zzso in animal zzso However, the mechanisms for the zzso to zzso have remained zzso 

To investigate this further, zzso zzso was used to assess zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso and zzso to study its protein zzso in 46 human zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso Cell proliferation of the zzso zzso cell line was assessed by zzso after 48 h zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment alone, or zzso in combination with the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and protein was found to be expressed in normal zzso and was zzso expressed in zzso zzso but were increased specifically in zzso zzso zzso However, very little zzso was observed with zzso with only occasional cell zzso zzso and no difference was zzso between controls and zzso zzso at zzso M and zzso M zzso inhibited cell proliferation zzso M zzso zzso zzso and zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Control zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso while lower zzso showed no significant zzso Following withdrawal of zzso zzso M, the cells fully recovered at a further 48 zzso while lower doses showed a zzso of zzso zzso was of similar potency to zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not show a significant reversal of the zzso effect of zzso and indeed suppressed proliferation on its zzso 

Our data suggest that the zzso action of zzso is probably not via zzso
