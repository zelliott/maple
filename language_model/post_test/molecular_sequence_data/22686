zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso found in a number of zzso complexes from zzso zzso zzso and zzso We previously identified zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso and showed that they associate with zzso to form at least two distinct zzso zzso There are two different zzso zzso in zzso named zzso and zzso zzso functions within the zzso version of the zzso complex zzso To gain insight into zzso function, we sought to identify novel components of the complex containing this zzso zzso zzso two A zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso revealed that, in addition to zzso and zzso host cell factor zzso and a novel zzso domain zzso named zzso zzso component 1), zzso with this zzso zzso experiments confirmed that these proteins associate with zzso and zzso but not with zzso components such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso has an apparent molecular mass of 700 zzso and contains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as stable zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel zzso zzso complex that is distinct from previously zzso zzso complexes from zzso and zzso zzso
