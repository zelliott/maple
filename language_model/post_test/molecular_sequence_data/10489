Early protein synthesis is thought to have involved a reduced zzso acid zzso What is the minimum number of zzso acids that would have been needed to zzso complex protein folds similar to those found in nature today? Here we show that a small zzso zzso the zzso domain, can be largely zzso by a five letter zzso acid alphabet but not by a three letter zzso Furthermore, despite the dramatic changes in zzso the folding rates of the reduced alphabet proteins are very close to that of the naturally occurring zzso zzso This finding suggests that despite the vast size of the search space, the rapid folding of biological sequences to their native states is not the result of extensive evolutionary zzso Instead, the results support the idea that the interactions which stabilize the native state induce a funnel shape to the free energy landscape sufficient to guide the folding zzso chain to the proper zzso
