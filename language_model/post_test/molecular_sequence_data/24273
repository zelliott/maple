zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the class II zzso zzso which are defined by their in zzso usage of zzso and zzso zzso as zzso All type II zzso zzso contain at their C zzso a zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that Homo sapiens zzso zzso zzso zzso has dual cellular zzso present in the zzso and in the zzso A distinct nuclear zzso signal sequence was identified by expressing zzso fluorescent protein fusion proteins in zzso zzso The nuclear zzso signal was mapped to a stretch of 11 zzso acids zzso located within zzso domain of the zzso In the zzso and the nucleus zzso associates with zzso complexes that are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that in the nucleus zzso is enriched at distinct zzso zzso known as nuclear zzso which contain zzso processing factors and are functionally connected to zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with enlargement and zzso up of the nuclear zzso The results suggest that zzso of zzso is zzso linked to zzso zzso and supports the importance of zzso for nuclear zzso
