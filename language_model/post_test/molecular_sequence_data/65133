The binding of Factor IX to zzso during blood zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain found on vitamin zzso blood zzso and regulatory zzso zzso zzso IX zzso are directed at the zzso zzso domain and interfere with Factor zzso zzso One such zzso zzso recognizes the zzso form of the zzso domain of Factor zzso We prepared the fully zzso zzso domain of Factor IX by solid phase zzso synthesis and zzso Factor zzso in complex with zzso fragments of the zzso zzso The overall structure of the zzso domain in the Factor zzso complex at zzso A is similar to the structure of the Factor IX zzso domain in the presence of calcium zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The complex structure shows that the zzso determining region zzso of the zzso zzso form a zzso pocket to accommodate the zzso patch of the zzso domain consisting of zzso zzso and zzso Polar interactions also play an important role in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the calcium coordination network of the Factor IX zzso domain is different than in zzso domain structures of other vitamin zzso zzso We conclude that this zzso is directed at the membrane binding site in the omega loop of Factor IX and blocks Factor IX function by zzso its interaction with zzso
