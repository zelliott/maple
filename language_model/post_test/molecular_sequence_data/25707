zzso A, which is a hybrid zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso cores, effectively breaks DNA strands upon zzso with visible light of long zzso The preferential cutting sites of visible light induced DNA zzso with zzso A are on the zzso of zzso bases such as in zzso and zzso zzso The observed zzso cutting specificity is remarkably similar to that of zzso (or zzso induced DNA breakage with zzso A, suggesting the presence of the same zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso of zzso A is zzso identical with the reaction product zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the present results, a reasonable mechanism for the visible light induced DNA zzso of zzso A has been zzso
