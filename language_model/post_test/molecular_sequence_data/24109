Native zzso gel zzso is a powerful approach for visualizing zzso folding states and folding zzso zzso has a zzso capacity and is therefore widely used in zzso investigations of zzso structure and zzso However, the effectiveness of zzso as a zzso for zzso has not been systematically zzso In a zzso zzso zzso the zzso core of the zzso group I zzso zzso zzso a zzso collapse characterized by a bulk transition zzso or zzso of approximately 3 zzso consistent with extensive independent zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso collapse has a much smaller apparent zzso equal to zzso zzso because in this buffer the zzso zzso a different, large zzso folding transition at low zzso zzso Analysis of structural neighbors using a short-lived, zzso zzso indicates that the global zzso structure eventually zzso in the two buffer systems, as the zzso zzso concentration approaches approximately 1 zzso zzso The weak capacity of zzso to stabilize zzso folding may reflect relatively zzso interactions between the bulky zzso zzso and zzso or partial coordination of zzso functional groups by zzso Under some conditions, zzso is a poor zzso for zzso and its use merits careful evaluation in zzso folding zzso
