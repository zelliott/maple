We have identified the zzso of a novel viral satellite in deep sequence analysis of zzso zzso from zzso The zzso was 1,060 bases in zzso and zzso two open reading zzso Neither frame was related to any known plant virus zzso But translation of the longer frame showed a protein sequence similar to those of other plant virus zzso Other than in zzso they shared in this gene zzso members of that group were extensively zzso The reading frame in this gene from the novel satellite could be zzso coupled to an adjacent reading frame in the zzso register, through overlapping zzso zzso These overlapping zzso zzso zzso were adjacent to a sequence that could be folded into a zzso zzso Field surveys with zzso zzso specific for the novel satellite revealed its presence in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
