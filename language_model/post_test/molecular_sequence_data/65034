By comparison with zzso plant species, relatively little work has been reported on the zzso zzso zzso gene family from zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that barley contains at least eight zzso zzso The promoters of six of these genes were zzso for the presence of regulatory elements potentially associated with expression zzso In particular, the zzso elements zzso in zzso expression of genes in zzso was identified in all zzso promoters zzso For two members of the family zzso and zzso promoter zzso to zzso and green fluorescent protein reporter genes were constructed, transformed into rice, and the expression profiles zzso The inclusion of an zzso derived from zzso enhanced gene expression approximately zzso but did not appear to affect the specificity of zzso The zzso and zzso promoters showed minor differences in expression patterns but, in general, expression was observed at high levels in zzso cells zzso zzso and stele of the zzso zzso throughout secondary roots, and at a relatively low level in leaf zzso Under zzso zzso expression was induced by up to zzso These observations are consistent with a primary role for the zzso genes in the zzso of zzso by root hairs from soil solution and further current understanding of the mechanisms zzso The promoters also have application for providing a new resource for cereal zzso zzso suited for driving the expression of foreign genes associated with zzso zzso
