In zzso coli K-12 the expression of many genes is controlled by the zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso systems zzso and zzso Here, the zzso gene is shown to be the first gene of a zzso zzso zzso that encodes proteins predicted to be components of an zzso zzso the zzso transcript start and zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso genes are transcribed from an zzso class II promoter and showed that the zzso site is zzso at zzso In the presence of nitrate or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence of the zzso promoter region zzso revealed the presence of four zzso sequences similar to zzso binding sites zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso The latter zzso are arranged as a zzso zzso zzso which is required for recognition by zzso zzso zzso protected the zzso region in zzso I zzso and zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso impaired zzso repression, whereas zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not affect the response to zzso The zzso protein also protected the zzso region, but in contrast to zzso the zzso footprint extended further upstream to zzso the zzso zzso The extended zzso footprint was consistent with the presence of multiple zzso complexes in gel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is located within the zzso binding site, or zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso or zzso impaired zzso zzso Thus, although the region of the zzso promoter containing the zzso and zzso zzso was recognized by zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso did not affect zzso repression in zzso
