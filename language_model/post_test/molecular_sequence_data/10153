The zzso coli zzso zzso locus zzso has been genetically mapped to the zzso linkage group on zzso zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to obtain candidate genes for this zzso we isolated 5 zzso containing the alpha zzso genes zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso placed all these clones in band zzso of zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso resulted in the characterization of an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso in zzso that is zzso identical to the human zzso zzso a second ORF, zzso zzso in zzso zzso identical to the human zzso zzso and a third zzso sequence thought to be a zzso The zzso and zzso zzso therefore seem to be the zzso zzso of the human blood group H and zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the two zzso in zzso being either susceptible or resistant to zzso and colonization by zzso zzso zzso coli zzso revealed two zzso at zzso 307 zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis of these zzso in 34 Swiss zzso families with 221 progeny showed close linkage with the locus controlling resistance and zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso and colonization in the small zzso zzso and with the locus of the blood group inhibitor zzso A high linkage zzso of zzso in Large White pigs makes the zzso zzso a good marker for zzso selection of zzso coli zzso zzso animals in this zzso Whether the zzso or possibly the zzso gene products are involved in the synthesis of zzso structures responsible for bacterial zzso remains to be zzso
