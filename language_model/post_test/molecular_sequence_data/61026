Previous work showed that the DNA zzso zzso agents zzso and zzso were more zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso II poisons that produce zzso breaks by zzso of zzso complexes would, likewise, induce zzso specific to zzso cells, zzso zzso induced by zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso The maximum zzso zzso zzso obtained were 7 zzso zzso after treatment with zzso zzso zzso in log phase and 27 zzso zzso after treatment with 1 zzso zzso in plateau phase, compared with a spontaneous frequency of zzso 1 zzso zzso Base zzso dominated the spectrum of zzso in zzso cells, but were much less prevalent in zzso zzso Both zzso also included small zzso insertions and zzso as well as few large-scale deletions or zzso About zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso and all but one of these were targeted to potential free 3' zzso of zzso complexes, as determined by mapping of zzso sites in DNA treated with zzso II plus zzso in zzso Thus, these insertions may arise from zzso extension of the exposed 3' zzso by a DNA zzso followed by zzso of the zzso as shown previously for zzso zzso in T4 zzso
