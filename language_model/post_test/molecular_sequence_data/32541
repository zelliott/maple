The zzso of the zzso gene resulted in zzso of the two zzso zzso genes in a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso system operates in the zzso We found that the zzso expression in the zzso zzso is greatly induced by heat and/or zzso zzso of a zzso containing and an zzso containing region upstream of the zzso promoter abolished zzso zzso of a zzso reporter gene fused with the zzso zzso Similar sequences to the zzso zzso were also found upstream of the zzso zzso A specific binding of a zzso to the zzso zzso was detected by a gel mobility shift zzso with using cell zzso We propose that the zzso zzso expression is regulated by a putative positive mechanism zzso by these novel elements in addition to the zzso zzso The zzso genes from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso which lack zzso zzso and zzso naturally, were also induced by heat and/or light, indicating that the control mechanism of the unique zzso zzso expression is highly diversified in zzso
