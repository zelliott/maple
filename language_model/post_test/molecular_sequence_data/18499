A zzso zzso zzso by single polar zzso short zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso sample of the Southeastern Pacific zzso Growth was found to occur at zzso zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso The zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell within a zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso and formed a coherent cluster with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso similarity analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso shows high sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids were identified as zzso zzso zzso summed feature 8 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The polar lipids were found to include zzso zzso three zzso and three unknown zzso zzso zzso was found to contain zzso as the zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was determined to be zzso zzso In the light of the zzso zzso zzso features and zzso evidence gathered in this study, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be classified as a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
