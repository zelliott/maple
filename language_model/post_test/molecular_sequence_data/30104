Previous work has shown that a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a stable zzso of zzso and that the zzso are oriented in a parallel zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso is used here to demonstrate that the zzso is continuous for at least 32 of the 33 zzso in the zzso The results also indicate that the zzso is zzso It is therefore unlikely that the zzso model for the structure of zzso zzso is correct, since zzso of zzso zzso in a parallel zzso would lead to an zzso zzso The data are consistent with a zzso zzso
