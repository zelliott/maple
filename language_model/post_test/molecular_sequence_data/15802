Cloning and sequence analysis of a DNA complementary to the zzso expressed in zzso mouse zzso zzso stem cells but disappearing rapidly after treatment with a zzso zzso zzso revealed it to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein of 323 zzso acid zzso zzso analyses of the deduced zzso acid sequence indicated that this protein contains a typical zzso signal zzso consisting of 33 zzso acid zzso and six putative zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso as a whole, bears no significant sequence zzso to any previously described zzso
