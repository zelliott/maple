zzso zzso zzso gene surveys are increasingly zzso to study highly diverse bacterial communities, with special emphasis on utilizing the large number of sequences obtained zzso to hundreds of zzso for species richness zzso However, it is not yet clear how the number of operational zzso units zzso and, zzso species richness estimates determined using shorter fragments at different zzso zzso zzso with the number of zzso assigned using longer, nearly complete zzso zzso gene zzso We constructed a zzso zzso clone library from an undisturbed zzso prairie soil zzso zzso and used it to compare species richness estimates obtained using eight zzso candidate fragments (99 to zzso zzso in zzso and the nearly full-length zzso zzso encompassing the zzso and V2 zzso region and the zzso region zzso using primer pairs zzso and zzso overestimated species zzso fragments encompassing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions zzso using primer pairs zzso zzso and zzso underestimated species zzso and fragments encompassing the zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso using primer pairs zzso zzso and zzso provided estimates comparable to those obtained with the nearly full-length zzso These patterns were observed regardless of the alignment method zzso or the zzso used to gauge comparative levels of species richness zzso of zzso observed, slope of scatter plots of zzso distance values for short and nearly complete fragments, and zzso and zzso species richness zzso Similar results were obtained when analyzing three other zzso derived from soil, adult zzso gut, and zzso zzso in the East Pacific zzso zzso analysis indicated that these observed discrepancies in species richness estimates within various regions could readily be explained by the proportions of zzso zzso and zzso base pairs within an examined zzso
