The zzso of zzso infections depends on zzso factors that mediate survival inside host zzso These zzso factors are generally believed to be specific for zzso species and absent or zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso G zzso mediates survival of zzso within zzso by blocking zzso zzso Here we describe a gene of the zzso species zzso zzso that is zzso identical with zzso of zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When cloned into expression zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso produced an active zzso and performed the same function as its zzso zzso zzso counterpart in zzso zzso In addition, similar levels of zzso transcripts were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, virtually no translation product of zzso zzso could be detected in zzso zzso both after in zzso growth and after zzso zzso This lack of efficient translation was shown to be caused by regulatory elements in the upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso The data reveal dramatically increased zzso efficiency of a zzso gene in a zzso zzso compared with a zzso zzso suggesting that changes in expression levels may zzso evolution of zzso and other zzso genes in zzso
