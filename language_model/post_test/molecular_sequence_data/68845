A refined solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso has been determined using two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso on an zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with distance geometry and simulated zzso zzso Thirty structures of the zzso zzso of the rat zzso were calculated based on zzso distance constraints obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 43 zzso zzso Average atomic root mean square zzso differences between the 24 best structures and their geometric average are zzso A for backbone atoms and zzso A for all heavy zzso Several regions that were not well defined in a previous zzso structure determination of a similar protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Freedman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso are now zzso The refined structure of the zzso zzso zzso is very similar to the crystal structure of zzso zzso in a sequence specific DNA complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Freeman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) Nature zzso zzso in particular with regard to the presence and relative positions of secondary structure zzso The backbone atom zzso difference between the average zzso solution structure and the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The most pronounced differences between the free and zzso states are found within the zzso zzso in the second zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
