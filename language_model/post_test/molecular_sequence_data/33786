In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in cardiovascular and respiratory zzso Several studies have demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso and their receptors in various zzso of zzso fish, including the brain, but little is known about their respiratory and cardiovascular zzso The present study was undertaken to compare the central and peripheral actions of graded doses zzso zzso of trout zzso and trout zzso on zzso and cardiovascular variables in the zzso rainbow zzso Compared with vehicle, only zzso injection of zzso significantly zzso elevated the ventilation frequency and the ventilation zzso but both peptides significantly increased the total ventilation zzso zzso However, the maximum zzso effect of zzso was approximately zzso higher than the effect of zzso at the 100 zzso dose zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso means zzso zzso When injected zzso only zzso produced a significant increase in mean zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso but neither zzso affected heart rate zzso zzso injections of either zzso or zzso were without effect on the zzso zzso zzso was without significant action on zzso and zzso while zzso significantly elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso without changing zzso In conclusion, the selective central zzso actions of zzso administered trout zzso and to a lesser extent zzso suggest that the zzso peptides may be implicated in important zzso functions related to the central control of ventilation in zzso
