zzso zzso containing locked zzso acid zzso zzso to complementary zzso target DNA sequences with an increased affinity compared to zzso DNA zzso As a consequence of the incorporation of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso the melting temperature of the zzso increases zzso thus allowing the successful use of shorter zzso zzso as zzso tools in zzso zzso In this article, we report the use of zzso containing zzso zzso for the development of qualitative fluorescent multiplex zzso for the detection of single zzso zzso zzso in real-time zzso chain reaction using the zzso detection zzso We developed two applications that show the improved specificity of zzso zzso in zzso for zzso zzso The first application is a zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso for two of the most common genetic factors involved in zzso risk, factor V zzso and zzso zzso The second application is a zzso zzso for the specific detection of the zzso zzso in zzso 6 of the zzso zzso responsible for zzso cell zzso Both real-time zzso zzso were evaluated by comparing the performance of our method to that of a reference method and in both cases, we found a zzso zzso This approach will be useful for research and molecular diagnostic laboratories in situations in which the specificity provided by zzso DNA zzso is insufficient to discriminate between two DNA sequences that differ by only one zzso
