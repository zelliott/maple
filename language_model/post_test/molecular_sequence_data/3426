zzso zzso zzso a common group of human zzso diseases, is characterized by zzso night blindness, loss of peripheral vision, and diminished or absent zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso account for zzso of cases of zzso dominant zzso We generated a mouse model of the zzso form of zzso by targeted disruption of the mouse zzso zzso of human zzso In zzso mice, the number of rod zzso decreased progressively over a period of 1 year, whereas that of cone zzso did not change for at least 10 zzso Light and electron microscopic analysis revealed that outer segments of zzso rods and cones were zzso abnormal and became progressively shorter in zzso Before zzso cell death, zzso was zzso in inner segments and cell bodies of zzso zzso Rod zzso zzso of zzso mice were significantly smaller than those of zzso mice over a period of 12 months, whereas those of zzso mice were zzso The decreases in cone zzso zzso were slower and less severe than those in zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is required for normal zzso of zzso outer segments and also may play a role in zzso transport to the outer zzso The zzso of zzso zzso mice resembles the human zzso zzso Thus, these mice provide a useful model for studies of zzso function, disease pathology, and therapeutic zzso
