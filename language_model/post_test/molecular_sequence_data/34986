zzso zzso T cell responses depend on presentation of a stable zzso repertoire by zzso class I zzso I) molecules on the cell zzso The overall quality of zzso I complexes zzso I) is determined by poorly understood mechanisms that generate and load peptides with appropriate consensus motifs onto zzso zzso In this article, we show that both zzso zzso a key component of the zzso loading complex, and the zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso processing zzso are quintessential editors of distinct structural features of the zzso zzso We carried out zzso zzso of zzso mice with cells from zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of T cell responses showed that absence of zzso or zzso independently altered the zzso repertoire by causing loss as well as gain of new zzso zzso Changes in zzso acid sequences of zzso peptides revealed that zzso and zzso respectively, defined the characteristic zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso I zzso Thus, the optimal zzso I repertoire is produced by two distinct zzso editing steps in the zzso zzso
