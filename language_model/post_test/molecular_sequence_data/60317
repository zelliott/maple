Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso hormone that acts through zzso zzso receptors zzso to maintain early zzso Its ability to distinguish zzso and zzso receptors zzso is controlled by 20 zzso zzso zzso that surround zzso loop zzso zzso charged zzso acids between zzso zzso a small loop within the zzso have been zzso to make essential zzso zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso containing zzso charged zzso acids in this small loop had zzso the activity of zzso and zzso the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso capable of binding zzso and zzso These effects might be due to the influence of these zzso on zzso contacts or on hormone zzso During efforts to distinguish these possibilities, we increased and decreased the number of zzso in this loop, zzso we anticipated would distort its zzso zzso with this zzso these changes inhibited zzso formation, zzso assessment of these zzso on hormone zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso overcame the effects of the zzso zzso on zzso combination and enabled preparation of zzso containing six, seven, or nine zzso in their zzso zzso These had zzso the zzso and zzso the zzso activities of zzso zzso containing 8 zzso derived from zzso in the zzso zzso The abilities of zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso combination may permit zzso analysis of other zzso that influence zzso zzso
