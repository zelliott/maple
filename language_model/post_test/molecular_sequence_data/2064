We have determined the organization within the terminal zzso of the major large zzso zzso genetic elements associated with the zzso strain zzso of the chestnut blight pathogen zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso strand contained long open reading zzso Furthermore, only zzso of the same polarity as the zzso strand was zzso in a zzso form, indicating that the zzso strand is the coding or plus zzso The organization of the zzso portion of the plus strand consisted of a zzso zzso zzso leader sequence followed by two overlapping open reading zzso The first, zzso extended zzso zzso while the second, zzso began 68 zzso upstream of the zzso termination zzso and extended at least zzso zzso No open reading frames of significant size were detected within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso translation of synthetic transcripts containing zzso yielded a zzso of Mr 29 zzso The zzso product was also detected in zzso of the zzso strain but was absent in zzso of the zzso virulent zzso It represents the first protein to be identified as a gene product zzso by a zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso
