zzso zzso contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and are enclosed within a lattice formed by the zzso protein zzso Analysis of zzso zzso particles zzso has shown that zzso and zzso assemble into the simplest zzso structures with zzso activity and that zzso but not zzso is essential for zzso zzso To further define the role of zzso and zzso in the synthesis of zzso from viral zzso zzso zzso containing gene 1 zzso and gene 2 zzso of zzso zzso were generated and used to express zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso After zzso the proteins were zzso individually and together for the ability to catalyze the synthesis of zzso in a zzso replication zzso The results showed that zzso was zzso only in zzso containing zzso and zzso thus establishing that both proteins are essential for zzso zzso Even in zzso containing a zzso zzso template, neither zzso nor zzso alone directed zzso zzso zzso of the zzso replication signals in zzso recognized by the zzso of zzso and zzso showed that they were the same as those recognized by the zzso of zzso cores, thus excluding a role for zzso in recognition of the zzso template by the zzso Analysis of zzso interactions indicated that the zzso template binds strongly to zzso in zzso zzso but that the majority of the zzso product neither is packaged nor zzso associates with zzso The results of zzso zzso performed with zzso zzso containing a deletion in its zzso domain suggests that the essential role for zzso in replication is linked to the zzso ability to bind the zzso template for zzso zzso
