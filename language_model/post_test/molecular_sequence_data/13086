The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that zzso resistance to bacterial speck disease in zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we identified a second zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso that physically interacts with zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso specifically zzso zzso and that zzso does not zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso from tomato that is closely related to zzso was unable to zzso zzso and was not zzso by zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in tobacco plants enhanced the hypersensitive response to a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain carrying the zzso gene zzso These findings indicate that zzso is involved in a zzso signaling pathway, probably by acting as a component downstream of zzso in a zzso zzso
