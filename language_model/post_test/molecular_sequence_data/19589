zzso factors are fundamental components of zzso important zzso zzso By contrast to common mechanisms in which zzso factors function directly at zzso the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso often assemble dispersed complexes over broad zzso zzso For example, zzso and zzso occupy five zzso regions over approximately 100 zzso of the zzso locus in the zzso zzso and active states, respectively, in zzso zzso Since it is unknown whether the individual complexes exert zzso distinct or identical functions to regulate zzso zzso in zzso we compared the activity of the zzso and zzso zzso sites of the zzso locus in transgenic zzso The zzso site functioned as an autonomous zzso in the zzso and fetal liver of embryonic day 11 zzso whereas the zzso site lacked such zzso zzso studies demonstrated critical requirements for a zzso motif and a neighboring zzso within the zzso site for zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, whereas this zzso composite motif was sufficient for zzso activity in an zzso precursor cell line, its zzso function in primary human zzso cells required additional regulatory zzso These results identify the first molecular zzso of zzso zzso in vascular zzso composed of a core zzso module active in both zzso and zzso cells and regulatory zzso zzso required in zzso zzso
