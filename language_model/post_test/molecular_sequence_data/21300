zzso zzso zzso zzso play important roles in all zzso of zzso Two members of this zzso zzso and zzso families, were predicted to contain a zzso domain that is zzso zzso such that the zzso zzso is located near the zzso instead of at the zzso These zzso zzso are widespread in virus, zzso bacteria, and zzso We determined the crystal structure of a member of the zzso family from zzso zzso in complex with zzso The structure, which adopts a zzso zzso zzso confirms the circular zzso of zzso zzso A comparative analysis of other related protein structures within the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a similar zzso core and arrangement of zzso zzso including a zzso zzso and an additional zzso zzso More surprisingly, zzso zzso have a zzso zzso binding pocket that is distinct from previously characterized zzso in the family, indicative of novel zzso zzso Further analysis of a structural zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a fatty acid in the zzso zzso pocket, thus providing additional insights into possible function of these novel zzso
