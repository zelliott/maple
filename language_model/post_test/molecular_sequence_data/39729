zzso is a genetically determined cell suicide zzso zzso play a central role in this process and various molecules have been shown to regulate zzso in this zzso In the present study, we zzso identified that protein zzso zzso interacting protein 51 zzso is a novel zzso zzso which may induce zzso in zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of nuclear zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso zzso caused a decrease in zzso membrane potential and release of zzso zzso suggesting that it may be involved in a zzso c zzso zzso zzso We also found that a putative TM domain near the N zzso of zzso is required for its targeting to zzso as evidenced by the finding that deletion of the zzso TM domain prevented the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this deletion significantly influenced the ability of zzso to induce zzso Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that zzso is a zzso protein with zzso function and that the zzso TM domain is required for both the correct targeting of the protein to zzso and its zzso zzso
