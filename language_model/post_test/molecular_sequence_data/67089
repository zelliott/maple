The zzso domain mediates interactions between members of a zzso of zzso zzso factors and is found in more than 60 zzso zinc finger genes in the human zzso including the tumor zzso gene zzso zinc finger 1 zzso zzso pull-down zzso showed that the zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso value of 600 zzso was measured by intrinsic zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure determined by zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso Each zzso consists of five alpha zzso in two zzso connected by the zzso zzso zzso from zzso 3 of each zzso compose the core of the zzso zzso while the zzso loop and zzso 2 pack against zzso 3 and 5 from the opposing zzso Comprehensive sequence analysis is coupled with the first high-resolution structure of a zzso zzso to provide an initial view of the recognition elements that govern zzso for this large family of zzso zzso
