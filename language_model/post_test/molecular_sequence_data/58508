In this paper, we present both in zzso and in zzso evidence for the presence of a novel zzso regulatory element that is required for zzso induction of the human low density zzso zzso zzso gene following depletion of cellular zzso in zzso zzso First, in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human LDL zzso promoter before and after zzso induction in zzso cells revealed protection from zzso to zzso zzso zzso to as zzso zzso Second, transient zzso of zzso cells with promoter zzso reporter zzso containing the zzso site resulted in significant enhancement zzso zzso of reporter gene expression in response to low levels of zzso compared with parallel zzso without the zzso zzso In addition, this response was markedly attenuated on zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Third, by zzso mobility shift zzso the zzso sequence was found to bind zzso from zzso nuclear extracts in a zzso zzso In zzso binding of the zzso zzso paralleled the results obtained for their in zzso zzso On the basis of competition profiles, the zzso factor is different from the known zzso factors binding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein is not specific to zzso cells because nuclear zzso with the same specificity was observed in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso induction of the LDL zzso gene in response to zzso depletion is zzso in part, by an highly zzso novel zzso element through the binding of specific nuclear zzso
