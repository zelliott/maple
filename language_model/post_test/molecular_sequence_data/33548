zzso zzso is the zzso agent and causes most bacterial sexually transmitted infections zzso Its major outer membrane protein zzso is a well-known zzso and zzso and is the dominant zzso So far, investigation of zzso zzso has been focused mainly on molecular zzso zzso In contrast, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the host pressure on this key zzso by analyzing its evolutionary dynamics in zzso zzso from zzso infections, taking into account the zzso secondary structure and the zzso of zzso zzso One-third of the specimens showed a zzso drift from the corresponding zzso where approximately zzso of the zzso had never been zzso zzso acid zzso were zzso more frequent within zzso zzso than in the remaining protein zzso zzso zzso and some zzso were also found within or close to zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the two most ecologically successful zzso E and zzso showed a zzso rate zzso lower than that of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that their efficacy may be the result of a better fitness in dealing with the host immune system rather than of specific zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso exhibited by some genetic zzso involved zzso that are known to play a critical role during the membrane mechanical movements, contributing to a more stable and flexible zzso zzso which suggests some plasticity to deal with environmental zzso Globally, these zzso zzso trends yielded no mosaic structures or important zzso changes, but instead yielded point zzso on specific protein zzso which may enhance zzso zzso zzso and zzso
