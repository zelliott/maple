The role of lateral gene transfer zzso in the evolution of zzso is only beginning to be zzso While most zzso events occur between closely related individuals, zzso and zzso zzso events are not zzso These distant transfer events offer potentially greater fitness advantages and it is for this reason that these zzso zzso zzso events may have significantly impacted the evolution of zzso One mechanism driving distant zzso events is microbial zzso zzso transformative events can occur between any two species provided that the DNA of one enters the habitat of the zzso Two categories of zzso that are well-known for zzso are the zzso and zzso 

We identified potential zzso zzso events into both a zzso class of zzso zzso and a zzso class of zzso zzso We then zzso these zzso genes as originating in zzso and zzso zzso While more than zzso of transfer events into zzso zzso originated in other zzso less than zzso of transfer events into zzso zzso originated in other zzso 

Our results suggest that there is a fundamental difference between zzso in zzso and zzso We zzso that the difference lies in the different zzso of the zzso While DNA degrades rapidly in zzso environments due to zzso zzso zzso environments are adept at preserving zzso Furthermore, most zzso zzso as topographical zzso are natural collectors of cellular zzso Thus zzso would in theory be exposed to a greater diversity and quantity of zzso DNA than zzso
