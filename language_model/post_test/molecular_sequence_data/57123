Two full-length zzso clones zzso zzso zzso a newly recognized form of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from independent libraries constructed with zzso from different zzso The zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids which contains two putative zzso binding zzso and a zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso This sequence is 52 and 57% identical to sequences of the rabbit zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso identical to the sequence of zzso form zzso published recently by zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the new zzso zzso zzso zzso with two species of zzso one of zzso zzso and one of about zzso zzso from liver or zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mouse all express this form of zzso in liver, zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been tentatively characterized following expression in zzso zzso It is inactive with zzso as zzso but highly active with zzso The temperature zzso responses to zzso and zzso and pH optimum of zzso zzso are similar to values reported for zzso zzso zzso comparisons and analysis of rabbit and human zzso DNA indicate that zzso zzso as well as the pulmonary and zzso zzso comprise a single gene family made up of distinct gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso each appearing to contain a single zzso A zzso based on these zzso and following the same zzso used for zzso zzso zzso is zzso
