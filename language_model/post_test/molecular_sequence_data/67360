We have exploited the ability of zzso zzso to engage in highly specific zzso interactions to construct a new class of small proteins that inhibit zzso zzso By screening a library zzso hundreds of thousands of artificial zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso we isolated six zzso or zzso proteins with completely different zzso sequences that inhibited cell surface and total expression of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibited zzso of human T cells by zzso reporter viruses zzso with zzso zzso envelope proteins but had minimal effects on reporter viruses with zzso zzso zzso of two zzso significantly increased their activity and resulted in greater than zzso zzso of zzso reporter virus zzso without zzso expression of zzso the primary zzso zzso or zzso another zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso protein resistant to zzso a zzso zzso zzso and they dramatically inhibited replication of an zzso laboratory strain of zzso in a zzso infection zzso zzso experiments suggested that the active zzso specifically zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso and that some of the zzso zzso with different portions of zzso Thus, we have constructed multiple proteins not found in nature that interfere with zzso expression and inhibit zzso zzso These proteins may be valuable tools to probe the organization of the zzso zzso of zzso and their relationship to its biological activities, and they may serve as starting points to develop new strategies to inhibit zzso zzso
