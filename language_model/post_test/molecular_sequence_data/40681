The zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso broom disease of zzso cacao zzso zzso mechanisms of this zzso fungus are largely zzso An approach to identify putative zzso genes is searching for sequences induced in zzso grown under in zzso zzso Using this approach, genes from zzso zzso induced under limiting nitrogen and light were identified from a zzso library enriched by suppression zzso zzso as potential putative zzso zzso From the 159 identified unique zzso 59 were zzso and classified by gene zzso Two sequences were zzso as zzso zzso zzso and Cell zzso presumably coding for zzso zzso whose zzso from other zzso are zzso of animal or plant zzso zzso gene expression was evaluated by quantitative amplification of reversed transcripts zzso of the putative identified genes coding for the two zzso proteins zzso and zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso grown under contrasting N zzso All genes were validated for differential zzso except for the putative zzso The same eight genes were zzso for expression in susceptible plants zzso with zzso zzso and six were induced during the early zzso stage of the zzso In infected host zzso transcripts of zzso and AS were found more abundant at the zzso phase, while those from zzso zzso zzso and zzso accumulated at the zzso phase, enabling to suggest that zzso transition from zzso to zzso might occur earlier than currently zzso These sequences appeared to be zzso zzso zzso which zzso factors or zzso that enable invasion, colonization or zzso survival, or manipulate host factors to benefit the zzso own survival in the hostile zzso
