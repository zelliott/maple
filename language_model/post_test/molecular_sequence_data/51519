A region of the zzso zzso associated with zzso male zzso zzso in zzso zzso was flanked by two different repeated sequences designated zzso and zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso region and a portion of each zzso repeat was zzso Repeat zzso contained a complete coding copy of the F1 zzso zzso A zzso zzso as well as an open reading frame zzso predicting a protein of 209 zzso zzso The zzso termination zzso of the zzso gene and the zzso initiation zzso of zzso were zzso These reading frames were oriented with their 3' ends zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso contained numerous zzso The longest of these predicted proteins being of zzso 98 and 97 zzso zzso The 3' coding and 3' zzso regions of zzso were derived from an internal region of the higher plant zzso zzso zzso zzso The region of repeat y immediately adjacent to the zzso region contained the 111 zzso coding zzso of the zzso b zzso zzso This segment was oriented with its zzso end zzso to the zzso region, but zzso gene sequences were not fused to an initiation zzso within the unique zzso
