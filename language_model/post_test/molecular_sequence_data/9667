The structure of the zzso zzso zzso that functions in circular zzso zzso has been solved at zzso A resolution and reveals that the protein comprises two zzso The zzso domain contains two zzso sequence motifs that are located in similar positions in the structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the extreme zzso regions of the three zzso containing the active site zzso are very zzso In zzso the arrangement of active site zzso supports a zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence for DNA zzso is zzso in a model that zzso extensive zzso and genetic data, and in which the DNA is wrapped around an zzso in a manner similar to that observed for zzso zzso with zzso
