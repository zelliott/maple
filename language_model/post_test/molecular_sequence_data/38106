zzso zzso chain reaction was used to amplify a partial zzso from rabbit lung zzso that shared zzso protein sequence identity with the mouse zzso X zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends from a rabbit kidney zzso expression library resulted in the isolation of overlapping zzso spanning the complete coding zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of 411 zzso exhibited zzso overall zzso acid identity with human zzso and zzso identity with mouse zzso Based on this protein sequence relationship and a similar degree of conservation exhibited by the mouse and human zzso zzso the zzso appears to zzso the rabbit zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso ends performed on an zzso zzso library from rabbit liver revealed the presence of an alternate zzso which differed at the zzso zzso protection zzso indicated that the alternate zzso was expressed at zzso lower levels in rabbit kidney and zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso with a rabbit zzso expression zzso and a zzso reporter construct containing two copies of the zzso zzso from zzso produced a zzso induction of zzso zzso In contrast, rat zzso was not responsive to this zzso under the same zzso zzso zzso was an zzso zzso of rat zzso but failed to significantly activate rabbit zzso at equivalent zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso profile of rabbit zzso is distinct from rat zzso and more closely resembles that of human zzso The rabbit zzso zzso profile is consistent with the zzso zzso zzso zzso induction profile in zzso
