In the zzso c zzso zzso I zzso gene of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marina, zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found two group II zzso described here as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an open reading frame zzso comprised of three zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zinc finger zzso zzso zzso The secondary structures show both zzso zzso and zzso zzso belong to group zzso albeit the former possesses a group zzso secondary structural character in the zzso region of arm zzso Our zzso analysis zzso from zzso domain sequences of the zzso ORF, comparison of the zzso sites, and the secondary structures of the zzso suggests that zzso zzso likely shares an evolutionary origin with the group II zzso inserted in zzso genes of five zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was suggested to bear a close evolutionary affinity to the group II zzso found in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows a tree zzso in which zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso sequences suggesting that a zzso zzso transfer has taken zzso Finally, we found no zzso in zzso genes from zzso zzso Based on zzso discussion, zzso zzso and zzso zzso have invaded into the zzso gene of an ancestral zzso cell after zzso from zzso zzso
