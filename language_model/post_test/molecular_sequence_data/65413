We recently identified plant zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso from a zzso zzso that are distinct from the animal zzso zzso In this study, we zzso cloned and characterized an zzso from a zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso is 1,441 zzso zzso a zzso protein that includes a signal zzso This zzso is a zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso which exists as a mixture of zzso and zzso linked zzso zzso The plant zzso apparently consist of various zzso structures, depending on the plant species, similar to the animal zzso We compared the zzso properties of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similar to electric zzso zzso both plant zzso zzso zzso (or zzso and zzso (or zzso but not zzso (or zzso and their specificity constant was highest against zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso properties of zzso and zzso zzso although two plant zzso had low zzso turnover numbers compared with electric zzso zzso The two plant zzso activities were not inhibited by excess zzso zzso Thus, similar to some plant zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso properties of both animal zzso and animal zzso On the other hand, both zzso and zzso zzso exhibited low sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso dissimilar to other plant zzso These differences in zzso properties of plant zzso may reflect the zzso evolution of zzso
