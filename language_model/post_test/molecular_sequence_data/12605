zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity in many cells and are thought to act indirectly by inducing channel protein zzso zzso we report the isolation from rabbit of a gene zzso a K channel zzso that is specifically activated by zzso and not by zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso indicates that, in addition to a core region that is highly zzso to Shaker K channels, zzso also contains a zzso region similar to that of zzso zzso channels and a zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis detects gene expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso represents a class of K channels that may be specifically regulated by zzso and could play an important role in zzso the effects of zzso such as zzso oxide, that increase zzso zzso
