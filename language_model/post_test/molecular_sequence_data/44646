An immediately zzso gene by zzso was isolated from rat zzso primed with pregnant zzso serum zzso zzso by using a zzso cloning zzso zzso analysis revealed that the gene is a rat zzso of scavenger zzso class zzso which was recently identified as a specific zzso for high density zzso zzso The structure of rat zzso was determined by zzso sequence analysis of full-length zzso for zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that rat zzso zzso levels were rapidly and strongly increased within 3 h by the injection of zzso In zzso zzso study revealed that zzso zzso was strongly induced in zzso zzso cells of immature rat zzso zzso with 30 zzso of zzso for 6 zzso zzso zzso expression was also observed in zzso zzso of the adult rat zzso These findings indicate that expression of zzso zzso is restricted to and induced in the zzso zzso cell types where cholesterol is used as a zzso for synthesis of steroid zzso Our data strongly suggest that zzso may play a significant role in the zzso zzso by zzso selective zzso of cholesterol from HDL to zzso zzso zzso cells or to corpus zzso
