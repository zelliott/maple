The establishment of reverse zzso methods to manipulate influenza virus zzso has allowed the generation of zzso zzso influenza viruses expressing foreign zzso Strategies for the construction of influenza virus zzso include the zzso of foreign zzso into influenza virus zzso the expression of zzso and the rescue of zzso genes into infectious zzso zzso virus zzso have been obtained which express both zzso and zzso zzso from different zzso These zzso have been shown to mount in zzso animals systemic and local zzso responses, and/or zzso zzso responses against the expressed zzso The available evidence suggests that influenza virus zzso may be attractive candidates for the development of effective vaccines against different zzso
