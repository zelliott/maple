We report the isolation of the mouse zzso zzso the determination of its zzso organization and the characterization of its promoter zzso The mouse zzso gene spans a region of 36 zzso and contains 13 zzso which represent about zzso of the gene zzso Major zzso zzso zzso (I and zzso are generated by alternative zzso of zzso 7 and 8, respectively, whereas minor zzso zzso and zzso are generated using cryptic sites located inside zzso zzso The regulatory elements of the zzso gene are located in a zzso region placed upstream of the first zzso The gene lacks a zzso element and the initiation of zzso is located inside a zzso zzso zzso Two regulatory regions located at zzso and zzso were defined by deletion analysis of the zzso
