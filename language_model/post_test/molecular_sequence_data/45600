zzso analysis was performed on 45 commercial zzso which are used in winemaking because of their superior zzso zzso Genome sizes were estimated by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso Forty strains had zzso sizes consistent with their being zzso while five had a range of zzso zzso sizes that ranged from zzso to zzso times zzso The zzso strains are all zzso zzso based on genetic analysis of zzso and zzso markers and on DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed zzso zzso region of nuclear zzso DNA of four zzso Four of the five zzso strains appeared to be zzso hybrids between zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the fifth a hybrid between two zzso zzso zzso An identification fingerprint was constructed for the commercial zzso strains using 17 molecular zzso These included six published zzso zzso seven new zzso zzso and four published zzso zzso The markers provided zzso identification of the majority of zzso however, several had identical or similar patterns, and likely represent the same strain or zzso derived from zzso The combined use of all 17 zzso zzso allowed us to identify a set of zzso commercial wine zzso strains that appear to be genetically zzso These strains are presumed to have undergone zzso to maintain their zzso a process referred to previously as zzso zzso
