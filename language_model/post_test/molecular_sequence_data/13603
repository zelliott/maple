To better understand the zzso of zzso into cells, we have studied the labeling of cell surface proteins by an zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso cells are treated with the zzso for 2 hours in a medium containing bovine serum zzso zzso almost all of the zzso label is found in one zzso which we identify as zzso zzso grown and treated in a zzso medium do not show this zzso whereas it is plainly seen in cells that are grown in zzso medium but then treated in zzso zzso zzso association of the zzso with cells is much higher in zzso medium than in zzso zzso but the zzso is mostly not zzso in the absence of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso from the medium serves to block overall association of zzso with cells, and zzso zzso is the main cell surface protein binding zzso We discuss the possible role of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in the cell and in the zzso of zzso in zzso
