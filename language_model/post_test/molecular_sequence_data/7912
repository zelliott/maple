zzso are unusual proteins discovered by virtue of their ability to mediate cell wall extension in zzso We identified zzso clones for two cucumber zzso on the basis of zzso sequences of proteins zzso from cucumber zzso The zzso zzso zzso related proteins with signal peptides predicted to direct protein zzso to the cell zzso Northern zzso analysis showed moderate transcript abundance in the growing region of the zzso and no zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso Rice and zzso zzso zzso were identified from collections of anonymous zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso comparisons indicate at least four distinct zzso zzso in rice and at least six in zzso zzso are highly zzso in size and sequence zzso zzso acid sequence identity and zzso similarity between any zzso zzso and zzso trees indicate that this zzso family formed before the evolutionary divergence of zzso and zzso zzso and motif analyses show no similarities to known functional zzso that might account for zzso action on wall zzso A series of highly zzso zzso may function in zzso binding to cellulose or other zzso The high conservation of this zzso family indicates that the mechanism by which zzso promote wall zzso zzso little variation in protein zzso
