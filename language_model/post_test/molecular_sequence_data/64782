Although zzso zzso zzso constitute one of the major zzso groups, their zzso relationships remain largely zzso zzso we attempted to zzso their zzso using the zzso (short zzso repetitive zzso method, in which the sharing of a zzso at zzso zzso is indicative of zzso First, a detailed characterization of the tortoise zzso was conducted using 10 species from eight families of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our analysis of 382 zzso sequences newly isolated in the present study revealed two subgroups, namely zzso I and zzso II, which were distinguishable according to diagnostic zzso in the 3' zzso Furthermore, four zzso and five zzso different zzso types were identified within zzso I and zzso II subgroups, respectively, based on features of zzso located in the middle of the zzso zzso The relative frequency of occurrence of the zzso and the types of zzso in this family were highly variable among different lineages of zzso suggesting active differential zzso in each zzso Further application of the zzso method using the most zzso active types, namely zzso and zzso challenged the established zzso relationships of zzso and its related zzso The data for 11 zzso zzso demonstrated a close relationship between zzso and zzso as well as the presence of the three zzso within zzso Although the zzso method has been used to zzso the zzso of a number of zzso groups, it has never been applied to zzso The present study represents the first application of this method to a zzso analysis of this class of zzso and it provides detailed information on the zzso zzso and zzso This information may be applied to the zzso resolution of relevant turtle zzso
