zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso zzso stimulates cell migration in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is identical to the zzso zzso zzso and maturation factor and, interestingly, to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso compounds as they compete for zzso binding with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso seven zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the first comprehensive high-resolution crystal structure analyses of the zzso form and the eight types of inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso complexes of mouse zzso zzso We zzso the zzso activities of these zzso against the zzso activity of zzso The zzso activities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be significantly higher than those of the four or zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso activities clearly depend on the length of the inhibitor zzso A structural comparison revealed that a zzso hydrogen bond between one end of the inhibitor and a rigid portion of the protein surface in the zzso inhibitor zzso complex is replaced by a direct hydrogen bond in the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Thus, to obtain a new compound with higher zzso activities against zzso water molecules at the inhibitor binding site of zzso should be replaced by a functional group of zzso in order to introduce direct interactions with the protein zzso The present zzso relationship studies will be valuable not only for designing more effective zzso zzso but also for studying general zzso zzso
