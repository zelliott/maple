An efficient method for producing the zzso closure of zzso on complementary templates by the action of zzso was zzso A rational design of linear precursor zzso was zzso and the effect of factors such as zzso concentration and zzso length ratio was zzso The efficiency of zzso was shown to correlate well with the secondary structure of the precursor zzso (as predicted by a simple computer zzso zzso structures bearing free zzso clearly zzso the zzso zzso A novel idea, consisting of the incorporation of zzso insertions in the precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso may render this method universal and highly zzso An original set of zzso was developed to confirm the circular structure of the zzso closed zzso
