A zzso zzso gene zzso mainly derived from sequences associated with the essential genes zzso and zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso of the zzso system in zzso zzso zzso zzso This sequence is not found in four other zzso types from zzso however, two copies are present in the zzso DNA of zzso zzso whose zzso are zzso to those of the zzso zzso We provide evidence to show that one of the two zzso copies is actively zzso and two transcripts which terminate at the same position but differ in their zzso sites were localized using the zzso zzso These transcripts of zzso and 961 zzso respectively, were confirmed to be the major products of this gene in zzso plants by Northern zzso However, smaller transcripts were found to accumulate in plants in which fertility had been zzso Restoration of fertility was induced either by the gene X, or the gene T at high zzso In zzso zzso zzso a transcript with an estimated size of 440 zzso was detected in all zzso zzso An additional zzso signal with an estimated size of approximately zzso zzso is expressed in zzso plants zzso zzso and the intensity of a minor zzso transcript is zzso These latter zzso zzso by the gene zzso occur independently of the growth temperature, but are limited to the zzso they were not observed in zzso The zzso transcripts are edited at seven positions and contain an zzso with a maximum coding capacity of zzso zzso zzso the start zzso derived from the zzso gene zzso Use of the third zzso start zzso would result in the synthesis of a protein of a size very close to that of a previously described zzso zzso which has an apparent molecular weight of 18 zzso The coding sequence that begins at this third zzso start zzso is also present in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the onion, and absent in zzso zzso
