This study reports the first ever development and validation of a zzso method for a zzso in zzso This method was developed for the zzso of total zzso in Sprague zzso rat zzso The procedure involved zzso of plasma samples with zzso acid followed by zzso of plasma proteins using zzso zzso and analysis by zzso The zzso zzso was used as an internal standard zzso The zzso and zzso were zzso using a zzso of zzso and water, both zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso at a flow rate of 250 zzso Positive zzso zzso was zzso at the zzso source and the zzso and zzso were both detected by zzso monitoring zzso Total run time was 15 zzso This method was validated for zzso sensitivity, zzso recovery, zzso and zzso The method was shown to be selective, with a quantitative linear range of zzso zzso using 25 zzso zzso The bias, zzso and zzso percent relative standard zzso at all zzso tested was lower than zzso zzso mean extraction recovery was zzso The zzso was shown to be stable to zzso and for zzso and long-term zzso zzso zzso was stable at 4 degrees C for over 5 zzso This method was successfully applied to a preliminary zzso study of zzso administered zzso in Sprague zzso zzso Overall, this method was shown to be zzso for zzso of zzso in plasma samples for the purpose of further zzso zzso or zzso zzso
