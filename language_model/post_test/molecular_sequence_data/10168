A microbial zzso zzso was developed, and its potential to measure zzso zzso of zzso zzso and some related compounds by zzso was zzso The zzso strain zzso coli zzso zzso zzso carried the regulatory gene zzso from zzso zzso and a zzso fusion of zzso from the same strain with the zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso on two separately introduced zzso In standardized zzso the zzso cells were readily zzso with zzso a typical zzso of the zzso zzso Light zzso after induction periods of more than 15 zzso correlated well with zzso zzso In zzso zzso samples, there was a linear relationship between light output and zzso zzso between 24 and 100 zzso The zzso responded to zzso zzso but not to zzso or aromatic zzso In order to test its zzso for analyzing environmentally relevant samples, the zzso was used to detect the zzso concentration of zzso in heating zzso groundwater zzso By the zzso of zzso light output data to low zzso zzso with a zzso function, a total zzso concentration of about 3 zzso in zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso tended to underestimate the zzso concentration in the groundwater samples by about zzso possibly because of the presence of unknown zzso This was corrected for by zzso the samples with a known amount of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were further verified by comparing them with the results of chemical zzso
