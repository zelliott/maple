To establish a zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso to detect the zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso 

One pair of zzso and three zzso zzso were designed based on zzso gene and its zzso locus zzso of zzso zzso After zzso the zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso was verified by using 6 types of zzso zzso samples with different zzso gene zzso Additionally, 50 laboratory samples and 113 field samples were tested by this zzso 

The established zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso could identify 6 different zzso gene types in zzso zzso The zzso could be detected by zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso and the detail zzso type could be further identified by zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso By using this method, 50 laboratory samples were confirmed as wild type zzso Among 113 field samples, 12 were wild type zzso others were zzso or zzso zzso and the total zzso frequency was zzso 

The new established zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso can be used to detect the zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso
