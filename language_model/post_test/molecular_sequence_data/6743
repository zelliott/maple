zzso zzso and zzso zzso are members of the structurally and functionally zzso family of zzso zzso Both zzso display high specificity for their respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso Closer analysis of their zzso however, reveals that the specificity of zzso zzso is much stricter and less malleable than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso in an attempt to reverse their specificity has met with contrary zzso zzso of a specific zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso generated an zzso that displayed activity toward zzso equal to that of the native zzso toward zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) Science zzso zzso We have constructed a series of zzso in the mobile, active site loop of the zzso coli zzso zzso that incorporate the complementary change, conversion of zzso 81 to zzso to evaluate the role of charge distribution and zzso flexibility within this loop in defining the zzso specificity of these zzso zzso incorporating the change zzso all had reversed zzso displaying much higher activity toward zzso than to the natural zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso were much less active than the native zzso Secondary zzso within the loop of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso had either no or only moderately beneficial effects on the activity of the zzso zzso toward zzso The zzso zzso which can be expected to reduce the overall flexibility of the loop, modestly improved activity toward zzso The possible zzso relevance of the stringent specificity of zzso zzso was zzso In normal strains of zzso coli, zzso metabolism was not affected by expression of the zzso zzso zzso However, when expressed in a strain of zzso coli unable to zzso zzso the zzso zzso restored growth and produced zzso acid as the sole zzso zzso
