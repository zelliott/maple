The T cell surface zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso cellular immunity and serves as the zzso for human zzso zzso In order to identify primary sequences within the zzso zzso that may be involved in the binding of the zzso zzso we zzso various peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso We tested the ability of these peptides to block the binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso human zzso leukemia cells zzso using zzso cell zzso One of these zzso corresponding to zzso zzso acids zzso when zzso with zzso blocked its subsequent binding to zzso cells by zzso A truncated form of this zzso zzso was found to be as efficient as the longer zzso zzso in zzso the binding of zzso to zzso zzso The same zzso did not block the binding of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso which were previously shown to block zzso binding to zzso The peptides were also tested for their ability to block zzso infection of a T cell line in zzso Only zzso zzso zzso and the shorter zzso zzso succeeded in protecting T cells against infection with different zzso zzso All the other peptides examined had no effect on zzso binding to zzso cells and did not block zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso gave modest interference of zzso binding to zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso region zzso zzso in the zzso binding and/or zzso of zzso zzso
