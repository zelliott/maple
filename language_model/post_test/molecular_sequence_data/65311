In this study, a zzso approach was adopted to investigate natural freshwater zzso and zzso samples of zzso colonies and isolated strains of zzso with a high degree of zzso tapering zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and the intervening zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences were used for genetic zzso In addition, a molecular zzso method, zzso gel zzso which allows zzso separation of zzso products, was used to assess zzso diversity in environmental samples and isolated zzso The results showed a high zzso of the zzso among the zzso that was not associated with the zzso zzso This study zzso the importance of choosing a zzso culture zzso especially one with a low zzso zzso for studying typical zzso features of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso methods and zzso analyses confirmed the diversity in zzso colonial structure and zzso features corresponding to genetic diversity within a single zzso zzso analysis of zzso was largely consistent with that obtained from zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and confirmed the high level of divergence between zzso The sequences of zzso and zzso from this study and database sequences showed great zzso and were clearly not zzso The results of this genetic and zzso study of field samples and fresh zzso indicated that the current zzso of these zzso needs to be zzso
