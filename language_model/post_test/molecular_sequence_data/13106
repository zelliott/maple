zzso mouse and human zzso were obtained as zzso zzso from zzso kidney cell clones and used in solid phase, zzso and zzso binding zzso Strong binding occurred with zzso and required zzso A distinct interaction was also observed with zzso but this was only partially blocked by zzso zzso weaker affinities were detected for collagen IV, zzso and the zzso zzso of collagen VI alpha 3 chain, while no or only little binding activity could be detected for several other collagen types, zzso zzso zzso and zzso This weaker binding reactions were also dependent on zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso demonstrated for zzso binding to zzso and zzso high equilibrium zzso zzso zzso to 1 zzso due to a rapid initial zzso of the zzso This is apparently followed by a slower stabilizing zzso The zzso binding site of zzso could be localized to its zzso zzso domain zzso which also possesses a zzso binding site for zzso Several tests demonstrated competition between the two zzso probably due to zzso zzso zzso of zzso to immobilized zzso allowed the formation of zzso complexes with collagen IV, zzso and zzso which, as shown zzso bind independently of the zzso zzso This indicated zzso binding properties for zzso and several alternative routes for its integration into basement zzso and other zzso zzso
