Three zzso zzso have been incorporated into the zzso expression zzso zzso to create a transient expression zzso zzso The zzso was designed to express zzso fusion proteins that can be detected at tenfold lower expression levels than the current zzso fusion protein expression zzso The usefulness of this expression and detection system was demonstrated by expression of bacterial alkaline zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso bacterial alkaline zzso was expressed in zzso coli, zzso on zzso zzso affinity zzso and detection of 500 zzso of zzso protein by Western zzso analysis is zzso
