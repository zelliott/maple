zzso zzso zzso are zzso that participate in the regulation of biological processes such as cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso A number of zzso are able to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso protein zzso zzso and thus are also classified as zzso zzso zzso As an increasing number of zzso are being identified and zzso there is a growing need to understand their biological activities at the molecular zzso There is also significant interest in identifying zzso that could be potential targets for drugs that zzso zzso signaling and immune responses, which have been implicated in a variety of maladies including cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory zzso Here, the zzso zzso and crystal structure at zzso A resolution of human zzso zzso 14, zzso zzso are zzso This structural information should accelerate the study of zzso at the molecular level and may also accelerate the discovery and development of novel therapeutic zzso
