A clone zzso the putative copper zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a sheep liver zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a predicted protein of 68 zzso zzso with 44 and zzso zzso acid identity to the zzso zzso and human zzso copper zzso zzso zzso The characteristic zzso and zzso motifs were zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed an abundant zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso copper content did not affect the level of zzso zzso in the zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in the developing liver revealed low levels of expression in the zzso period, with a steady increase to adult levels occurring during zzso In zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso zzso with the zzso terminal portion of the sheep Wilson's disease protein zzso The extent of this interaction was significantly reduced by the addition of the copper zzso zzso zzso acid to the zzso These results suggest zzso is a functional copper zzso that is able to interact with zzso in a zzso manner to facilitate copper transport into the zzso zzso
