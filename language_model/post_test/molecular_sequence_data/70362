A zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso factor zzso was zzso With this and previously prepared zzso zzso zzso and other zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in the muscles of zzso zzso chicken and zzso zzso zzso mice was compared with that in normal control animals by zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso expression is zzso during normal zzso development of skeletal muscles zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the breast zzso muscle of normal adult chicken and the leg zzso and zzso zzso muscles of normal mice only at a low zzso zzso was not zzso in adult skeletal zzso However, a significant increase of zzso amount, but not of zzso amount, was observed in these muscles of the zzso animals, when the symptom of muscular zzso became zzso In order to zzso zzso in individual muscle zzso serial zzso of the zzso chicken muscle were examined with zzso zzso zzso The zzso stained cells of different size in the zzso muscle, indicating that zzso expression was induced in the zzso muscle cells as well as in the pre-existing zzso We suggest that zzso is involved in zzso or reorganization of zzso in the zzso zzso
