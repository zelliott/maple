zzso zzso zzso have receptors zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and an additional zzso zzso with high zzso to the zzso To find natural zzso for zzso and zzso we searched the zzso zzso database and discovered two distinct regions that, when translated zzso and zzso showed high zzso to zzso Isolation of zzso and determination of the zzso boundaries revealed zzso structures which were similar to known zzso zzso consisting of the first 34 zzso acids after the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and were shown to be fully active at the zzso zzso was, however, approximately zzso less potent at the zzso than zzso zzso and zzso When tested with zzso zzso and zzso showed similar zzso whereas the potency of zzso was moderately zzso zzso To determine whether other zzso have multiple zzso we searched the zzso database of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso and identified zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso from zzso and zzso are more closely related to each other than to known zzso zzso zzso or to zzso and zzso zzso of 39 zzso This is consistent with evolution of two zzso zzso peptides occurring after the evolutionary divergence between zzso and zzso Overall, the zzso system appears more complex in zzso than in zzso providing evidence of continued evolution in zzso zzso The availability of multiple forms of fish zzso and their receptors provide additional tools for zzso zzso zzso zzso
