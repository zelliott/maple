In bone zzso patients, chronic zzso disease is a complication that results from the persistent stimulation of recipient minor zzso zzso zzso T cells contained within the zzso In this study, we developed a mouse model where persistent stimulation of donor T cells by zzso zzso led to zzso T cell zzso Exposure to systemic zzso however, deeply modified T cell function and chronically zzso T cells developed a long-lasting state of zzso or immune adaptation, characterized by their inability to mediate organ immune damages in zzso However, analysis of the gene expression profile of adapted zzso T cells revealed the specific zzso of genes known to promote differentiation and function of zzso zzso cells as well as genes coding for proteins that control T cell activity, such as cell zzso zzso molecules and regulatory zzso zzso blockade of negative zzso abolished T cell adaptation and zzso strong zzso production and severe zzso wasting zzso zzso zzso was also shown to control lethal zzso toxic shock in mice with adapted T cells, as well as the capacity of adapted T cells to reject skin zzso Our results demonstrate that negative zzso is the molecular mechanism used by zzso T cells to adapt their activity in response to persistent zzso zzso The zzso function of zzso T cells that have adapted to chronic zzso presentation can be activated by stimuli strong enough to overcome regulatory signals delivered to the T cells by negative zzso
