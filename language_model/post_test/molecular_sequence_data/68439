The inclusion of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells requires the presence of a centrally located zzso zzso zzso We have conducted a series of in zzso experiments aimed at understanding the structural and functional features associated with this zzso zzso zzso Using hybrid model zzso zzso we show that the zzso element markedly stimulates the use of the 3' zzso site of zzso zzso and replacement analysis identifies the stimulating sequences as a zzso stretch of 9 zzso zzso The zzso element stimulates zzso to the zzso 3' zzso site from various positions within the zzso except when placed beyond zzso zzso downstream from that 3' zzso zzso The action of the zzso is not limited to the zzso zzso site because the zzso element stimulates human zzso zzso and also zzso the use of a 3' zzso site in a zzso sequence in zzso We have explored the mechanism of action of the zzso zzso zzso and found that the zzso element is required for efficient assembly of early zzso complexes, allowing a more efficient interaction of the U2 zzso with branch site zzso In competition experiments, an zzso containing mainly zzso sequences specifically abolished the action of the zzso element, suggesting that factors bind the zzso element to mediate stimulation of zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso we show that zzso proteins interact specifically with the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso sequences lying in the zzso element play a crucial role in specifying zzso site recognition through interactions with factors binding to the 3' zzso zzso
