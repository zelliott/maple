zzso of zzso proteins zzso regulate zzso primarily by zzso zzso zzso However, many zzso also possess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities implicated in both zzso and zzso functions of these zzso Here, we compared the structural features of zzso responsible for its interactions with two known target zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were determined to be necessary and sufficient for binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso identified critical zzso required for zzso and zzso zzso Using these zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso was determined to be zzso dependent on intact binding sites on zzso and zzso Because zzso regulates zzso zzso the effects of zzso on zzso induction of zzso zzso activity were studied using reporter gene zzso zzso of a zzso of zzso encompassing the three zzso zzso (but not full-length zzso greatly enhanced zzso increases in zzso activity, providing a convenient zzso for monitoring zzso effects of zzso on zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso that failed to bind zzso lost the ability to zzso zzso activity, demonstrating a requirement for zzso interactions with zzso Altogether, these findings demonstrate the zzso and diversification of zzso zzso showing that a single zzso can direct its zzso zzso activity toward different zzso and can alter the cellular functions of different protein targets in accordance with differences in the specificity of individual zzso zzso
