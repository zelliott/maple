A zzso library of tobacco mosaic virus zzso tobacco was screened with zzso chain reaction products obtained using a zzso primer corresponding to zzso inhibitor I zzso of tomato and zzso The resulting clones zzso two highly similar, putative tobacco zzso zzso indicating that both genes identified in tobacco are probably zzso The tobacco zzso were approximately 50% identical to zzso potato and tomato zzso and zzso identical to an zzso tomato zzso Northern zzso analyses indicated that healthy tobacco leaf contains only minor amounts of zzso zzso and that the inhibitor genes are induced by zzso infection, zzso treatment, zzso spraying, zzso light zzso and zzso The results indicate that the tobacco zzso genes are zzso expressed with the genes for the basic zzso zzso zzso to zzso genes of tomato and zzso wound induction of the tobacco genes occurs only zzso the zzso zzso leaves do not show any zzso zzso gene zzso
