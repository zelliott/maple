We have investigated the effect of a new zzso zzso identified in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso in a patient with type II zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, either associated with zzso human zzso or zzso resulted in normal zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso or zzso but selectively zzso with zzso maturation and transport to the cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso receptors revealed strong zzso of zzso cell spreading on immobilized zzso focal contact formation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as opposed to normal zzso cell interaction with immobilized zzso focal contact zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso zzso zzso was unable to bind soluble zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but underwent a zzso change following zzso zzso binding as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso the highly zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso is located in a domain structurally important for the exposure of a functional binding site for soluble zzso and zzso that the zzso contact site in zzso is not involved in zzso cell zzso to immobilized zzso while it is essential for zzso interaction with this zzso
