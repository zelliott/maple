zzso zzso including zzso zzso age-related retinal zzso zzso zzso and related diseases affect millions of people around the zzso Currently, there is no effective treatment for most of those zzso We investigated systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for preventing retinal zzso and vascular damage in the Royal College of Surgeons zzso rat model of retinal zzso 

zzso rats were treated with zzso zzso to zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso or control zzso without zzso by subcutaneous administration starting at the onset of zzso zzso or after the degenerative process began daily or every other day and performed for a zzso zzso The retinal cross sections and whole mounts were prepared to determine zzso leaking vessels, and formation of vascular zzso zzso studies evaluated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in treated zzso zzso studies were performed to determine visual zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso prevented decreases in outer nuclear layer zzso thickness and showed a significantly higher number of zzso than control rats treated with zzso or zzso zzso was also effective in protecting retinal zzso from leakage and the formation of abnormal vascular complexes even when the treatment was administered after the degenerative process was zzso Visual acuity measurement showed that rats treated zzso significantly better than those with zzso and zzso zzso controls at zzso and zzso zzso studies showed that zzso cleared slowly from the administration zzso Moreover, zzso zzso had a significantly reduced number of activated zzso in the zzso space, decreased zzso zzso zzso production in the zzso inhibited zzso responses, and reduced zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso Treatment with the control zzso (without a specific zzso zzso or vehicle alone did not inhibit zzso zzso or protect zzso or zzso 

RTL therapy zzso zzso cell survival, protected zzso and increased visual function in the RTL zzso zzso chronic zzso with zzso can be an effective therapeutic alternative in delaying retinal zzso zzso delivery of zzso alone or combined with other drugs could be an attractive option for long-term therapy for retinal degenerative zzso
