zzso growth zzso factor zzso exerts several functions in zzso and pathological zzso among them the induction of zzso cell scattering and zzso Its pivotal role in zzso tumor zzso and zzso is zzso however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso scattering of zzso cells by zzso the expression of zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso transition zzso Snail is required for zzso cell zzso since zzso zzso of Snail expression prevents this zzso zzso zzso of Snail zzso involves zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and requires the activity of early growth response zzso zzso Upon induction by zzso Snail zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso It also binds to the zzso promoter and zzso zzso transcription, thereby establishing a negative regulatory feedback zzso These findings indicate that Snail zzso by zzso is zzso via the zzso signaling zzso and that both Snail and zzso play a critical role in zzso cell zzso migration, and zzso
