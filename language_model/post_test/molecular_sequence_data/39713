zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso classic zzso which has a large, complex zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus contains three zzso of alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso alternative zzso to generate multiple zzso Using quantitative transcript analyses and green fluorescent zzso cell zzso we found that during development zzso alternative zzso is regulated in a zzso but not zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso is predominantly expressed during early zzso zzso while zzso zzso is prevalent at the late zzso and adult zzso All zzso zzso share the same molecular architecture but have different sequences in their zzso and zzso zzso suggesting functional zzso In zzso quantitative cell zzso zzso revealed that all zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso but the zzso zzso by zzso zzso have a higher adhesive activity than those by its alternative, zzso zzso experiments further revealed that the different sequences in the zzso zzso of zzso are responsible for their differential adhesive zzso zzso alternative zzso might provide a novel mechanism to fine-tune its adhesive activity at different zzso stages or to restrict the use of zzso zzso zzso at the adult zzso
