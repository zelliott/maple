A mechanism of mercury zzso has been suggested by a previous study on zzso zzso in zzso clams zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso lagoons and in this study we demonstrate that this event could be partly related to the detoxifying activities of zzso bacteria zzso zzso in clam soft zzso zzso natural clams were collected in six stations during two different periods zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso clams were sterile dissected to isolate zzso These anatomical parts were glass zzso or used for whole, and they were lying on a solid medium containing zzso zzso and incubated at zzso A total of zzso bacterial strains were isolated and were identified by zzso zzso sequencing and analysis, revealing that strains were representative of eight bacterial zzso four of which were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and other four were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso genes were found and their sequences zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso technique shows the presence of zzso zzso and zzso by using different molecular zzso in siphon and zzso zzso zzso inside clam flesh were observed and even a zzso zzso was disclosed by transmission electronic microscope inside clam zzso zzso zzso in cavities of soft tissue have mercury detoxifying zzso This feature was confirmed by the determination of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso
