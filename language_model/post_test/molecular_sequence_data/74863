zzso a group of proteins that assist the folding of other zzso seem to work in a coordinated zzso Two major zzso families are zzso protein families zzso and zzso Here we show for the first time the formation of a stable complex between zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso representatives of these zzso zzso This interaction takes place between the zzso domain of the zzso beta zzso and the zzso binding domain of zzso and may serve to deliver the unfolded zzso from zzso to the zzso binding region of zzso We also show that a similar interaction does not occur between their zzso counterparts zzso and zzso suggesting that in zzso the two types of zzso have evolved to a concerted action that makes the folding task more zzso
