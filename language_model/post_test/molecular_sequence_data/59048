The complete zzso acid sequence of the A chain of zzso zzso I was determined via zzso degradation sequencing of the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso overlapping fragments, zzso acid analysis and zzso The data obtained show a great zzso with the chains of zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso with 111 zzso and 103 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The knowledge of the primary structure of zzso will have a fundamental impact on zzso the biological function of medically applied zzso zzso on a molecular zzso
