zzso is a microbial zzso that can be produced from renewable resources, and is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and its zzso A zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso have been determined at resolutions of zzso A and zzso A, zzso The zzso is comprised of a single domain, which represents a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located at zzso zzso zzso The main chain zzso groups of zzso and zzso form an zzso zzso A zzso is formed on the surface of the zzso to which a single zzso chain can be bound by predominantly zzso interactions with several zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex reveals that zzso is responsible for the recognition of the zzso group adjacent to the zzso zzso It is also revealed that the zzso site includes at least three, and possibly four, zzso for binding zzso units of zzso zzso Thirteen zzso zzso which are exposed to zzso are aligned around the mouth of the zzso forming a putative zzso site for the zzso zzso These zzso may contribute to the sufficient binding affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso without a distinct zzso zzso
