zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso which zzso the synthesis of free zzso from various zzso zzso is zzso by a small zzso family in many zzso The tomato zzso gene family encodes three zzso zzso with identical in zzso zzso zzso To determine the role of each tomato zzso gene in plant growth, we isolated the zzso DNA copies of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene spans approximately zzso zzso and consists of 12 zzso whereas the zzso gene consists of an zzso single open reading frame zzso We have previously shown that zzso levels of zzso zzso were very low in comparison to zzso and zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso gene expression was zzso restricted to a discreet domain within the plant we constructed transgenic plants containing an zzso zzso gene zzso Analysis of transgenic zzso revealed that the zzso promoter directed gene expression within zzso and zzso cells of specific zzso junctions in an zzso pattern and in the shoot zzso zzso Further, zzso the product of zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso decreased expression of the zzso promoter as measured by a decrease in zzso activity after zzso
