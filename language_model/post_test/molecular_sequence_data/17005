zzso and zzso solid-state zzso zzso techniques were used to investigate the membrane zzso orientation, and zzso dynamics of the zzso segment of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at one terminal zzso zzso incorporated at different sites zzso zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso exhibited line shapes characteristic of either zzso group zzso about the zzso bond axis or by additional zzso motion about the zzso and zzso bond zzso The zzso zzso line shapes of all zzso zzso are very similar below 0 degrees C, indicating that all of the zzso are located inside the zzso zzso At higher temperatures, all three labeled zzso zzso undergo rapid zzso about the zzso zzso and zzso bond axes as indicated by zzso zzso simulations and reduced zzso zzso At all of the temperatures zzso the zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso side chain has less motion than zzso or zzso which is attributed to its incorporation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso powder zzso of zzso and zzso zzso indicated no backbone motion, while zzso exhibited slight backbone zzso The zzso zzso zzso values for zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 229 zzso within zzso zzso experimental zzso The zzso zzso value from the mechanically aligned spectrum of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was 220 zzso and is characteristic of a TM zzso that is nearly parallel with the zzso zzso
