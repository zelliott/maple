The zzso trigger factor zzso zzso assists folding of newly zzso zzso and zzso in the assembly of zzso zzso In the present study we showed that multiple distinct zzso zzso are present in zzso of zzso a bacterial zzso known for its ability to grow using zzso zzso Two full-length zzso zzso and at least one truncated zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were identified, the latter being systematically linked to clusters of reductive zzso genes zzso the key zzso in zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso coli strain lacking both zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated that all three zzso zzso were functional in zzso as judged by their ability to partially suppress bacterial growth defects and protein zzso in the absence of both major zzso coli zzso Next, we found that the zzso truncated zzso protein zzso functions as a dedicated zzso for the zzso reductive zzso zzso by zzso and stabilizing it in the zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso specifically interacts with the zzso signal zzso of zzso Taken together, our data define zzso (and more generally the new zzso zzso as a class of zzso zzso involved in the maturation of proteins zzso by the zzso zzso zzso
