The treatment of zzso human zzso cells with the differentiation zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso protein 70 zzso zzso levels between 3 and 6 zzso and zzso protein 27 zzso zzso levels between 12 and 24 zzso as indicated by northern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso also zzso zzso factor zzso binding activity between 3 and 6 zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso gene expression was zzso by the zzso factor DNA response element zzso In addition, the treatment provoked a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso level, consisting of a slight increase between zzso and 3 h followed by a greater increase between 12 and 48 zzso while it caused a single increase between 12 and 48 h in zzso zzso zzso The possible involvement of the zzso protein genes in the zzso differentiation of zzso cells is zzso
