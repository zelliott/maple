zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as high molecular zzso zzso represents an interesting target zzso for cancer zzso which is expressed on human zzso and other tumors such as breast zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso seems to play an important functional role in melanoma as it is involved in tumor cell migration, invasion and zzso In this study, we isolated zzso T helper cells from the blood of a healthy zzso recognizing a zzso from the zzso core protein presented by zzso zzso T cell zzso against the identified zzso could be detected in the blood of healthy donors and melanoma zzso zzso specific T cells from the blood of a patient could be readily expanded by repeated zzso stimulation and recognized zzso and zzso expressing tumor zzso Our findings suggest that vaccination against zzso helper T cell zzso might be a promising approach to fight zzso
