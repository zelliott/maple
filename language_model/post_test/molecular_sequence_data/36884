This paper reports on expression and zzso modifications of the zzso zzso of pol alpha and pol delta from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid treatment of zzso zzso zzso in amounts known to inhibit zzso 1 and 2A resulted in decreased zzso of both pol alpha and pol zzso Computer analysis of pol alpha and pol delta sequences confirmed the presence of consensus motifs for protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells showed nuclear location of both proteins in wild type zzso However, whereas cells transformed with a zzso expressing pol alpha produced a clear increase of the nuclear zzso no increase was zzso in cells transformed with pol zzso This observation suggests the existence of a mechanism limiting the cell concentration of pol delta in the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso pol delta in zzso coli was possible only with zzso containing truncated forms of its zzso indicating a toxic effect of pol delta on zzso coli zzso
