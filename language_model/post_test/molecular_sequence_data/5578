zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso B virus zzso is directed by two overlapping yet separate promoters zzso Yu and zzso zzso Mertz, zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, we reported the identification of a binding site for the nuclear zzso zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso spanning the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso This zzso site consists of an imperfect direct repeat of the consensus zzso sequence zzso separated by one zzso zzso it is a zzso hormone response element zzso We show here that other zzso including chicken zzso upstream promoter zzso factor 1 zzso human zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso as zzso with zzso X receptors zzso can also specifically bind this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso was affected both in zzso zzso cells and in a zzso zzso system by the binding of factors to this zzso zzso Interestingly, whereas some members of the hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or activated synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso other members zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis of both the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso likely regulates its expression and replication in part via this zzso zzso These findings indicate that appropriate zzso to nuclear receptors may be useful in the treatment of zzso zzso
