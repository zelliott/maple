A full-length zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was recovered from an ongoing zzso zzso zzso project of the wheat zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence had a putative signal sequence at the zzso zzso indicating it was a zzso zzso The protein shared zzso with zzso zzso from other insects, zzso plants, and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all stages of development and detected in zzso zzso and fat body zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso analysis and quantitative real-time zzso zzso in male and female wheat zzso and the fat body tissue of adult zzso revealed that zzso was zzso nearly zzso in the female zzso compared to males and nearly zzso in female fat body compared to male fat zzso The wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso most likely has a dual zzso As a zzso zzso zzso it could play a role in zzso zzso seed reserves for feeding larvae and as expressed in fat body could function as an zzso in degradation of zzso and/or in zzso processing of other zzso
