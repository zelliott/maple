Human zzso zzso virus type I zzso causes adult zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions within the outer envelope proteins of other zzso zzso human zzso virus type 1, are highly zzso and, because of the selective pressure of the host immune system, quite zzso zzso in the external envelope protein gene of zzso zzso and human zzso virus type 1 influence cellular zzso and disease zzso By contrast, no zzso viral zzso have been identified in zzso zzso However, all zzso studied thus far have originated from zzso cell lines, peripheral blood zzso cells, or zzso fluid zzso from patients with zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso and, therefore, may not truly reflect zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso external envelope zzso zzso acids zzso zzso an zzso response in zzso of infected individuals, and a zzso in this region zzso acids zzso elicits zzso in rabbits which inhibit zzso formation and infection of target zzso Because of the above, we expected the zzso domain of the zzso zzso gene of zzso to possess disease or zzso zzso selected by the infected zzso immune zzso zzso we zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA directly from in zzso central nervous system, zzso and kidney zzso and a zzso cell line from a patient zzso zzso with both zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso to discern the possibility of zzso and/or zzso zzso In addition, we zzso several zzso zzso from different regions of the world, including zzso New zzso zzso and zzso and compared them to other previously published zzso and related zzso zzso The zzso pair sequence corresponding to zzso acids 178 to 256 in zzso displayed minor zzso variation in clones derived from central nervous system zzso from patient zzso zzso but overall was highly zzso at both the DNA and zzso acid zzso Variation was observed in this region among the other zzso zzso zzso zzso virus type I, and zzso zzso in a pattern that was consistent with their known zzso zzso No consistent zzso changes were zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
