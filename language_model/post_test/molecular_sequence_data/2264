The zzso of the zzso inversion system, zzso mediates zzso zzso between two 26 base pairs zzso zzso repeat sequences zzso and zzso which flank a zzso DNA zzso We have investigated zzso recognition of, and association with, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemical protection studies with linear and zzso DNA zzso demonstrate that zzso initially binds zzso and zzso independently of binding of the other protein components of the inversion system, zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso sites and zzso interference experiments indicate that the critical bases for zzso recognition of its zzso site are within an zzso sequence covering adjacent major and minor grooves of the DNA zzso in each of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The nature of the zzso complexes in these binding studies and the results of gel zzso zzso with zzso zzso suggests that zzso binds the zzso sites as a zzso The implications of the nature of the interactions of zzso with its zzso sites on the mechanism of the zzso reaction and on the novel features of DNA recognition by zzso are zzso
