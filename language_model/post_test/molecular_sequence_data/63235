The zzso of the zzso zzso of highly zzso zzso remains a challenging area of investigation, and zzso involved in cellular replication are important targets for functional studies and drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso for use in DNA zzso The present study focused on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso which exhibit 50 % sequence identity and strong folding zzso We have successfully designed and validated a chemical model in which zzso but not zzso zzso derivatives specifically complement the zzso active zzso zzso chemically constrained zzso derivatives showed up to zzso improved affinity for zzso relative to the zzso activity of linear zzso This study demonstrates that the accurate design of small zzso can uncover functional features of highly zzso zzso
