The zzso virus early zzso factor zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso The gene for the zzso zzso was identified as open reading frame zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence of factor zzso by using zzso magnetic zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was zzso to zzso analysis, and so zzso sequences were obtained for three internal zzso zzso All three peptides matched sequences within zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located within the central region of the zzso virus zzso and are separated by about zzso base zzso zzso corresponding to the 3' ends of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso coli and used to prepare zzso that bound to the larger and smaller zzso respectively, of zzso zzso zzso analysis of proteins from infected cells indicated that both zzso are expressed exclusively in the late phase of infection, just prior to their packaging in virus zzso The two zzso of zzso have no significant local or overall zzso acid sequence zzso to one another, to other entries in biological sequence data bases including bacterial zzso factors, or to recently determined sequences of some zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, has motifs in common with a zzso of established and putative DNA and zzso zzso
