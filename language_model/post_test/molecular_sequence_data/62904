zzso reporter genes have been successfully used in a variety of organisms to examine gene expression in living cells, but are yet to be successfully developed for use in zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso has been used as a reporter of zzso gene zzso but because of high zzso very high levels of zzso zzso are required for zzso in zzso We have developed a zzso reporter for zzso by zzso the zzso bacterial zzso zzso as a single fusion protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We expressed a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso alpha zzso zzso or zzso promoter and zzso untranslated regions zzso and the zzso large zzso zzso 3' zzso We show that zzso is a sensitive reporter of zzso gene zzso and that zzso activity can be measured in zzso using a charge coupled device zzso camera or in zzso using a zzso We further demonstrate that zzso protein zzso as measured by Western zzso analysis, is zzso to zzso as determined both in zzso and in zzso and that zzso is capable of reporting changes in zzso gene expression during a dark to light zzso These data demonstrate the utility of the zzso gene as a versatile and sensitive reporter of zzso gene expression in living zzso
