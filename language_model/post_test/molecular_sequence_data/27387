Numerous studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of zzso zzso virus gene delivery zzso However, prior to zzso it is necessary to convert the zzso DNA zzso into zzso DNA, which zzso the efficiency of these zzso We can entirely circumvent this step through the use of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso packages an zzso repeat zzso that can fold into zzso DNA without the requirement for DNA synthesis or zzso between multiple zzso zzso By using zzso we could increase expression efficiency and reduce immune response caused by zzso zzso zzso it is a promising zzso for gene zzso So far, it has been used in the treatment of zzso diseases, central nervous system diseases, and eye zzso It has also been used in the modifications of stem cells and as zzso for zzso and zzso In this review, we focused on the preparation, expression and location of zzso both in zzso and in zzso We mainly introduced the recent progress of zzso based therapy of zzso B, in order to zzso the potential and prospects of zzso in gene zzso
