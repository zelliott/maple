A genetic system that allows the cloning of a zzso sequence in the zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso genes and their expression as zzso zzso has been zzso Two zzso zzso were created by zzso the zzso genes in a zzso zzso and replacing the coding sequence of two zzso clusters by a zzso The zzso helper genes were zzso in the compatible zzso zzso and expression of zzso by bacteria carrying both plasmids occurred by zzso Two zzso sequences of the influenza zzso were cloned in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to be assembled in zzso One zzso zzso was shown to elicit zzso against the synthetic zzso in zzso zzso The zzso sequence was cloned in both zzso and led in one case to zzso zzso zzso The fused zzso was shown to be recognized by specific zzso and zzso zzso
