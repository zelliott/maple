The site of zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso of approximately 55 zzso has been partially zzso from zzso zzso The zzso can zzso a synthetic zzso derived from PAL and a zzso zzso zzso PAL zzso was associated with a decrease in zzso in agreement with the suggestion that protein zzso is involved in marking PAL zzso for zzso The zzso site in French bean PAL is most likely zzso in the sequence zzso zzso Conservation of the zzso site in PAL from diverse species suggests that zzso of PAL may be a ubiquitous regulatory mechanism in higher zzso
