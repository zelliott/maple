Although the active site zzso in the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso are largely zzso several differences exist between the two zzso In particular, three zzso acids that stabilize the transition state for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not present in the human zzso This raises the question of whether the zzso energy for the zzso zzso step is higher for the human zzso zzso than for the zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that intrinsic zzso changes can be used to monitor the zzso state zzso of human zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso step is zzso in the human zzso zzso Specifically, zzso increases the forward rate constant for zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso of the forward rate zzso for zzso of zzso zzso by the human and zzso zzso zzso indicates that despite differences in their active sites and the zzso requirement of the human zzso the zzso energies for zzso zzso are identical for the two zzso The results of these investigations suggest that differences exist between the active sites of the bacterial and human zzso zzso that could be exploited to design zzso that target the bacterial zzso
