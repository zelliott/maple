We report an zzso structure of the zzso repeat capable of zzso an zzso of the zzso of protein zzso zzso The predicted zzso gene product contains a drastically changed zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso as compared to the earlier described zzso gene considered to be an zzso of the zzso zzso The following peculiarities of molecular divergence of the zzso and zzso genes are zzso damages of the zzso zzso usage of an alternative zzso site instead of a damaged one; conservation of the zinc finger domain in spite of local zzso zzso
