zzso receptors for zzso acid zzso are important to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In many species, these responses are blocked by the zzso zzso zzso although the mechanism of block is not fully zzso In contrast, zzso responses in the rat zzso are extremely resistant to zzso We hypothesized that this difference could be explained by molecular characterization of the receptors underlying the zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of two rat zzso zzso zzso designated r zzso 1 and r zzso 2 after their previously identified human zzso When zzso in zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso responses of the rat zzso zzso resistance is apparently zzso in native zzso receptors by r zzso 2 zzso since zzso r zzso 1 receptors were sensitive to zzso r zzso 2 zzso alone were unable to form functional zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that a single zzso acid zzso in the second zzso region (a zzso in r zzso 2 in place of a zzso in r zzso 1) is the zzso zzso of zzso resistance in the rat zzso This study reveals not only the molecular mechanism underlying zzso blockade of zzso receptors but also the zzso nature of native receptors in the rat zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso
