Most zzso in the central zzso of zzso zzso in plants have been identified and studied at the molecular zzso However, the specificity and role of zzso of zzso which occurs in zzso during zzso zzso remained zzso We have previously cloned from tomato zzso zzso the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso To study the zzso properties of the zzso we developed an zzso in zzso zzso in which a zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli cells is active in the presence of an zzso coli zzso that includes zzso We show that zzso is an authentic zzso zzso Its zzso activity of zzso zzso requires zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is achieved by a zzso zzso reaction acting at specific double zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso adjacent zzso bonds at zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso but is incapable of zzso single zzso bonds at zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso functions in the zzso zzso zzso in parallel with zzso zzso by converting zzso to zzso and zzso into zzso These results establish that in plants zzso zzso to lycopene proceeds via zzso zzso
