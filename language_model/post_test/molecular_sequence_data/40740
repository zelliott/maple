zzso surveillance data are useful for establishing zzso and geographical patterns of circulation and for virus characterization to determine zzso relationships between zzso Almost no information is available on circulating zzso in Georgia and the surrounding zzso To describe zzso circulation in Georgia, determine relationships with previously characterized strains and assess the role of environmental and clinical zzso zzso this study zzso a total of 112 zzso zzso zzso identified during zzso from sewage and human stool zzso zzso were isolated in cell culture using standard methods and typed by partial sequencing of the zzso zzso A total of 20 different zzso zzso zzso were identified over the zzso zzso The most commonly detected zzso included zzso zzso 6 (21 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (11 zzso each; zzso zzso zzso zzso B4 and zzso zzso zzso each; zzso and zzso zzso and zzso (six zzso each; zzso zzso analysis showed that many zzso were represented by more than one genetic zzso The present study showed a very high degree of zzso diversity in Georgia and demonstrated the added value of environmental zzso zzso particularly in settings with limited clinical zzso Several zzso would not have been detected without having both clinical and environmental surveillance in zzso Several zzso detected in Georgia were among those rarely reported in the USA and Europe zzso zzso zzso and zzso As the emergence of new genetic lineages of zzso in a particular area is often associated with large-scale outbreaks, continued monitoring of zzso strains by both environmental and clinical surveillance and genetic characterization should be zzso
