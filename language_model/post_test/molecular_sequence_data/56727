We have developed a specific zzso zzso for zzso using zzso produced against a zzso comprise of the first 20 zzso acid sequence of this cardiac zzso Using this zzso we found that zzso contained the highest amount of zzso zzso zzso which is about zzso higher than zzso zzso zzso With the exception of the lung and zzso all other zzso had negligible zzso The plasma level was zzso zzso and the only molecular form found was the 45 zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of extracts of isolated, zzso zzso zzso revealed that, like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also stored in these zzso However, while zzso is stored predominantly as zzso and zzso during or after release, zzso is stored as the 45 zzso acid form and may be processed prior to storage in the zzso
