Five zzso clones zzso rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library by use of a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the longest zzso indicated that it consisted of 711 base pairs zzso of coding region, 51 zzso of zzso zzso region, and 162 zzso of 3' zzso region excluding the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso contained the sequences of zzso and three zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid composition and molecular weight were in excellent agreement with those obtained with the zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso into zzso zzso having the zzso promoter resulted in a production in zzso coli of a Mr 26,000 zzso in the presence of zzso zzso This protein represented as much as zzso of the bacterial soluble protein and showed the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso mapping indicated that the zzso obtained by the zzso DNA procedures was structurally identical to the liver zzso except for the absence of the zzso blocking zzso Also, the zzso showed kinetic properties indistinguishable from those of the liver zzso
