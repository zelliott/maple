In a panel of wild mice trapped in different geographical regions, the zzso expression of V beta 17 T cell receptors and zzso zzso molecules is zzso By Southern zzso analysis, eight forms of V beta 17 genes have been distinguished that zzso five kinds of V beta 17 zzso zzso of Asia display the highest level of zzso and include all the V beta 17 forms and zzso The V beta 17 T cells of wild origin are deleted in mice expressing zzso and related zzso Wild mice use V beta 17 zzso different than the one of laboratory zzso Together with zzso zzso zzso this accounts for the observed low frequency of zzso deletion cases in natural zzso
