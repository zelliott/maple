The zzso components of the shrimp zzso zzso were identified by zzso with zzso from 10 allergic zzso Six zzso ranging in molecular weight from about 86 to 39 zzso showed zzso activity and were identified as zzso of the zzso The component with a molecular weight of about 39 zzso showed the highest frequency of zzso binding zzso and was considered to be one of its major zzso Two zzso zzso against this 39 zzso component were generated, and their zzso zzso with five different kinds of zzso shrimp, zzso cuttlefish, zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with the 39 zzso component from shrimp only, but zzso zzso zzso also reacted with the 39 zzso component from zzso By extraction with zzso sodium zzso and ethanol zzso a highly zzso shrimp 39 zzso component was zzso In two-dimensional gel zzso six zzso of this zzso 39 zzso zzso with zzso point values from zzso to zzso were zzso No marked difference was observed when the zzso acid composition of this zzso 39 zzso zzso was compared with those of serum zzso from different zzso They all contain a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso There was also a zzso to zzso sequence zzso among three different pairs of zzso fragments of zzso 39 zzso components of shrimp and zzso In conclusion, a 39 zzso major zzso from the shrimp has been identified and characterized in the present zzso According to the suggestions of the International Union of zzso zzso this zzso is designated as Par f zzso
