zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and fetal zzso zzso zzso have identical zzso zzso but different linked zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind only to the zzso zzso zzso and have no zzso zzso However, zzso zzso on zzso zzso or zzso zzso have shown that zzso binds to the zzso with only zzso of the binding activity of zzso In order to study the zzso relationship of zzso and zzso in a zzso system, we undertook the cloning and functional expression of the zzso Based on sequence zzso among zzso sequences for the zzso overlapping partial fragments of zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso zzso using reverse zzso and zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso of the partial zzso fragments zzso a part of the signal zzso followed by a putative zzso zzso acid zzso mature zzso The mature zzso displayed zzso overall sequence zzso with the other zzso zzso and contained one unique seventh zzso site in its zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with a zzso construct zzso an engineered complete signal zzso and the mature zzso zzso preparations from zzso zzso cells bound zzso with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On a zzso basis, zzso zzso with zzso on membrane preparations with only zzso of the zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso both zzso and zzso increased the zzso zzso concentration in a zzso manner, whereas zzso did zzso Furthermore, on a zzso basis, zzso zzso zzso production with only zzso of the zzso stimulating zzso We conclude that the cloned zzso encodes a The differences functional zzso between zzso and zzso activities towards this zzso will be useful in studies of the influence of carbohydrates on zzso zzso binding and zzso
