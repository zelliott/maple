To investigate whether zzso zzso occurs in multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso region zzso we have cloned and zzso the expressed zzso genes from five cases of zzso The sequences were obtained after zzso chain reaction zzso on total zzso isolated from the bone zzso using zzso zzso zzso leader and 3' C zzso or C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced to isolate zzso genes expressed by the zzso plasma zzso In all five cases, the productive zzso gene used the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of multiple independent zzso clones showed no zzso variation with no evidence for ongoing zzso zzso in zzso zzso region zzso We were able to identify possible zzso counterparts of the expressed zzso genes in two zzso zzso of these genes shows that the zzso zzso region genes have zzso zzso characteristic for an zzso zzso In the other three cases, no close zzso could be found with published zzso zzso These findings zzso that, in zzso zzso proliferation takes place in a cell type that has already passed through the phase of zzso zzso
