We studied a 27 zzso acid zzso zzso containing the G beta gamma binding motif zzso found in zzso zzso 2 and several zzso proteins of the G beta zzso The zzso technique was zzso to record zzso current from zzso zzso zzso zzso and to introduce the zzso zzso into the zzso We investigated whether it antagonized the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Compared to the control group, zzso was zzso less effective at zzso zzso current with 500 zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso did not simply zzso the response to zzso because there was no stimulating effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso This appears to be the first report of an interference between this zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso it suggests that at least part of the action of the zzso may be zzso by a beta gamma zzso
