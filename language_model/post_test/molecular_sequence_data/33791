Variation in influenza zzso between locations is commonly observed on large spatial zzso It is unclear whether such variation occurs on smaller spatial scales and whether it is the result of zzso in population demographics or more subtle differences in population structure and zzso Here we show that significant differences in immunity to influenza A viruses among communities in China are not explained by differences in population zzso We randomly selected households from five randomly selected locations near zzso China to answer a questionnaire and provide a blood sample for zzso testing against five recently circulating influenza zzso We find a significant reduction in the frequency of zzso zzso zzso with increasing age, zzso off in older age zzso There are significant differences between locations in age, employment status, vaccination history, household size and housing zzso However, after adjustment, significant variations in the frequency of zzso zzso zzso persists between zzso These results suggest there are characteristics of communities that drive influenza transmission dynamics apart from individual and household level risk factors, and that such factors have effects independent of zzso
