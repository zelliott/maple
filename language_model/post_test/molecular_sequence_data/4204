zzso K, a newly recognized member of the zzso zzso family, may play a dual role by regulating zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso technology, we found that zzso K zzso was dramatically increased in zzso a zzso cell line deficient in zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso showed that a potential zzso site zzso in zzso 1 of the zzso K gene could indeed bind to zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso reporter zzso revealed that the zzso possessed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso K suppressed growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results suggested that zzso K may play a role in regulating the cell cycle or zzso after being targeted for zzso by zzso
