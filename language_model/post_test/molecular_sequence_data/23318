A robust zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso was developed and validated in-house for the specific detection of zzso in zzso The zzso used specifically designed zzso and a probe target within the zzso zzso which is located near the zzso zzso island 2 at zzso zzso It is required for zzso zzso in zzso The zzso correctly identified all 110 zzso strains and 87 zzso strains zzso An internal amplification control, which is zzso with the same zzso as the zzso DNA, was also included in the zzso The detection probabilities were zzso when a zzso cell suspension containing zzso zzso was used as a template in the zzso (5 zzso per zzso and zzso when a suspension of zzso zzso was zzso A zzso sample preparation protocol including a zzso step in zzso zzso water followed by DNA zzso was applied when 110 various food samples zzso zzso minced meat, fish, and raw milk) were investigated for zzso The diagnostic accuracy was shown to be zzso compared to the traditional culture zzso The overall analysis time of the zzso method was approximately 24 zzso in contrast to 4 to 5 days of analysis time for the traditional culture zzso This methodology can contribute to meeting the increasing demand of quality assurance laboratories for standard diagnostic zzso Studies are planned to assess the zzso performance of this diagnostic zzso zzso
