A series of novel zzso peptides constituted of an zzso zzso portion zzso zzso zzso of human pulmonary zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso stretch of various chain lengths as the zzso zzso tail were zzso and evaluated relevant to their ability to improve the surface activity of a zzso zzso mixture composed of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in a zzso surface zzso zzso a human zzso analogue bearing an zzso zzso tail, and its related peptides with longer tails in the zzso zzso mixture, accelerated not only the surface spreading at the zzso interface but also exhibited significantly improved dynamic surface activity, compared to the zzso zzso zzso Their surface activities were almost zzso from those of the synthetic human zzso When zzso into a zzso zzso mixture containing members of the zzso series of zzso zzso the surface activities of the zzso zzso were almost completely zzso whereas replica peptides carrying the zzso portion of native zzso were found to have distinct surface activities depending upon the zzso lengths of zzso The zzso stretch of a zzso analogue could be replaced with zzso of the same chain length without a significant loss of surface zzso zzso of the zzso portion in the zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in a considerable decrease in surface zzso The zzso analogue in the zzso mixture was demonstrated to act as an excellent zzso comparable with zzso a modified bovine zzso preparation that was used for treatment for infant respiratory distress syndrome, based on evaluation of the lung zzso characteristics using premature rabbit zzso
