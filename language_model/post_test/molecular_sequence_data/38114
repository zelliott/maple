zzso center zzso displays widespread zzso zzso involvement at zzso The zzso that control the locomotion of zzso center zzso B cells have not been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that enhances the migration of normal human B cells and is expressed in peripheral zzso zzso Here we have investigated 1) whether zzso stimulates the in zzso locomotion of zzso center zzso B cells and of their presumed normal counterparts zzso zzso zzso center B zzso and 2) whether the same cells express zzso zzso 

B cells were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso was assessed by the filter and collagen invasion zzso All P values were two zzso 

zzso center zzso B zzso showed a statistically significant migratory response to 300 zzso zzso both in the filter and in the collagen zzso zzso zzso for zzso Such response was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso center B cells treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4, but not freshly isolated, migrated statistically significantly faster in the presence than in the absence of zzso zzso zzso in both filter and collagen zzso Freshly isolated zzso center zzso and zzso center B cells expressed zzso zzso 

This study shows that zzso substantially enhances the migration of zzso center zzso B cells but not the migration of freshly zzso zzso center B zzso This difference may be related to the extended survival of zzso center zzso versus zzso center B zzso zzso produced in zzso center zzso zzso zzso may play a role in the local dissemination of tumor zzso
