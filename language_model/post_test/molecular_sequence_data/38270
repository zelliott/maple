zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is exceptionally resistant to heat zzso and zzso zzso Although water soluble the protein binds zzso zzso Its biological role is thought to be to transfer certain lipids between zzso and to facilitate their zzso in the zzso An example of the latter is the removal of the zzso group from zzso zzso by zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso from zzso and presentation of the zzso complex to zzso zzso is a crucial aspect of the function of this zzso The widespread occurrence of the protein class of which zzso is one of the best known members underscores the significance of this zzso The preparation, zzso and chemical and biological properties of a stable zzso blocked zzso of zzso is zzso The zzso protein was susceptible to zzso attack and devoid of a significant population of zzso exchange resistant zzso It zzso formed a zzso zzso However, unlike the complex with the native zzso this was not sufficiently stable to remain intact during size exclusion zzso The zzso protein had a similar CD spectrum as native zzso indicating similar zzso zzso zzso the activities of zzso protein in the zzso A zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso were zzso zzso it had been assumed that the zzso zzso were essential for the protein to maintain a correctly folded zzso to bind zzso zzso and zzso their zzso Some revision of our thoughts on the importance of the zzso zzso in the structure and function of the protein are zzso
