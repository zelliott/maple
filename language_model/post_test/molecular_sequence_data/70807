Previous studies have shown that the human zzso BK zzso zzso contains an zzso response element zzso This isolated element binds its zzso zzso in zzso and can mediate zzso gene expression when linked to a zzso zzso The roles of the zzso and the zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso from the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso have been examined and the effects of the general zzso zzso and large zzso and small zzso on zzso zzso zzso have been zzso A zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso in either the zzso or the zzso sites did not impair zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter, while zzso in both binding motifs almost completely abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of large zzso and small zzso strongly activated zzso zzso zzso When expressed zzso only large zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of large zzso on the activity of the zzso zzso is probably indirect because no physical interaction between the two proteins was detected in a zzso zzso Large zzso zzso the synergistic effect on zzso between this nuclear zzso and the general zzso zzso The findings that the zzso early proteins amplify zzso zzso zzso may have important biological implications in individuals with raised zzso zzso
