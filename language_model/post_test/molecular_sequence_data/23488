zzso zzso is a defining member of a large family of protein zzso found in organisms ranging from bacteria to zzso zzso was discovered as a gene required for mating in zzso zzso 25 years ago, but it was only recently that zzso activity as an zzso protein zzso was zzso However, years of extensive research did generate a large body of knowledge about the cellular roles of zzso in zzso long before its zzso function was zzso In addition to zzso zzso have four additional zzso zzso zzso zzso (for zzso of zzso with distinct cellular zzso zzso knowledge of the zzso of zzso and zzso loss of function zzso has allowed design of a series of cell based screens that yielded the first zzso of zzso protein zzso These zzso zzso amenable to high zzso zzso and coupled with transcript array analysis for evaluation of compound zzso allowed the identification and detailed characterization of a series of zzso zzso entirely bypassing traditional zzso zzso
