Several zzso zzso including zzso A1 and zzso contain zzso transport signals that mediate both their nuclear import and zzso Previously, zzso 1 zzso was identified as a zzso of zzso A1 import, whereas the closely related protein zzso 2 zzso was shown to interact with zzso Here we have investigated the zzso of zzso that consists of zzso (or zzso zzso and two alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso also called zzso and zzso zzso The sequence differences among these proteins could alter either their cargo specificity or their response to zzso and thus their function as import or export zzso Using in zzso binding zzso we show that zzso A1 zzso binds zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso interacts with all three zzso as well as zzso with zzso zzso The zzso A1 and zzso shuttling zzso called zzso and zzso respectively, are sufficient for these zzso Despite small differences in the binding of zzso and zzso A1 to the three zzso in zzso interaction studies performed in the presence and absence of zzso indicate that all three zzso most likely act as import factors for zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, both zzso and zzso peptides compete for the import of zzso zzso A1 and zzso indicating that zzso and zzso A1 import pathways are at least partially zzso zzso zzso shuttling mechanisms for zzso A1 and zzso are zzso
