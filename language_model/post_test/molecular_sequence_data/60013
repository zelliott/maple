zzso zzso zzso zzso show zzso zzso and different regulatory units for expression of these zzso have been zzso The regulation of the zzso zzso zzso genes has been relatively well characterized in terms of zzso zzso but less so with regard to zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in the rat zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso is a dominating zzso in the same zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso in liver is low, but zzso by zzso whereas the pulmonary expression of zzso is not induced by zzso This indicates zzso of different regulating mechanisms in the two zzso A gene construct consisting of the structural gene for zzso coupled to a zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso gene was used to generate transgenic mice in order to further zzso the mechanism behind zzso expression and zzso induction of the zzso zzso Using reverse zzso chain reaction on total zzso extracted from lung and liver zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso of the construct was also observed in zzso from zzso transgenic zzso By zzso zzso of lung sections with zzso zzso we demonstrated expression at the protein level in zzso zzso In conclusion, our results revealed that the region extending to zzso 3 zzso in the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene included sequences that could partly account for the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso induction of zzso zzso by zzso
