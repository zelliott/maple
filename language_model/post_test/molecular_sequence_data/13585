zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is activated in zzso by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and cellular zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso zzso region zzso and zzso in the zzso domain and zzso in the zzso zzso Using novel methodology we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso requires the zzso of any two of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso became zzso in stressed zzso cells and zzso was prevented by the specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso establishing that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso is likely to result from zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain was zzso but activated fully when zzso at zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, full-length zzso zzso was zzso at zzso (and not zzso by zzso zzso suggesting a role for the zzso domain in specifying zzso by zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as active as zzso zzso zzso and this zzso active form may be useful for studying its zzso zzso
