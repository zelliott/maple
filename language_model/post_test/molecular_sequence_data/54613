Avian hard zzso has a zzso texture in which the filaments contain a zzso array of twisted zzso and the zzso has unusually high zzso of zzso zzso and zzso X-ray zzso studies have established that similar filaments exist in the hard zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, the relationship between zzso acid sequence and the zzso texture is explored in a wide variety of avian and zzso hard zzso zzso the molecules contain three distinct zzso a central domain rich in zzso zzso associated with the filament zzso and zzso and zzso zzso associated with the zzso and with zzso via zzso zzso A variety of structural zzso were employed to identify the zzso of the filaments and a common pattern 34 zzso in length was found in all zzso In addition, detailed analyses of the sequences in the two zzso zzso revealed profound differences between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso where the zzso zzso were very similar, and the zzso zzso and zzso where the zzso zzso varied widely in length and zzso in some cases exhibiting a zzso structure, and segments of highly zzso zzso The zzso zzso in both branches varied widely in composition but almost all exhibit a zzso structure characterized by a terminal sequence rich in zzso and zzso zzso A revised model for the molecular organization in avian and zzso hard zzso is presented and similarities and differences in the zzso zzso are zzso
