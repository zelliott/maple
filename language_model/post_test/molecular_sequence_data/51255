The human zzso zzso zzso that define the red blood cell surface zzso of the zzso blood group system exhibit considerable zzso zzso Previous studies have identified gene conversion events involving zzso and zzso that produced zzso hybrid genes which differ in the location of zzso This report presents the molecular analysis of zzso the first example of a reverse zzso hybrid gene that specifies a newly described zzso of the zzso zzso A novel restriction zzso unique to the zzso gene was detected by Southern zzso zzso The structure of the zzso region zzso the entire zzso domain of the zzso protein was zzso zzso sequencing of amplified zzso DNA showed that a silent segment of the zzso gene had been zzso to replace the internal part of zzso III in the zzso zzso thereby resulting in the formation of the zzso zzso with an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be flanked by a direct repeat of the zzso zzso site, whereas the zzso zzso zzso was localized to a zzso zzso This DNA zzso with a minimal transfer of 16 zzso zzso and a single zzso of zzso zzso zzso not only created two zzso hybrid junctions but zzso the expression of a new stretch of zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso Such a segment replacement may have occurred through the directional transfer from one duplex to the other via the mechanism of gene zzso The occurrence of zzso as another hybrid derived from parts of parent genes zzso the role of the zzso zzso in the generation of zzso diversity in the zzso zzso
