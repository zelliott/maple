zzso zzso zzso zzso produce distinct zzso biological effects, but within the confines of the established models of zzso action it is difficult to understand zzso Previous studies have suggested that there might be a relationship between zzso structure and zzso Different zzso zzso may induce zzso changes in the zzso that result in a specific biological zzso To investigate the possibility of zzso zzso changes, we have applied affinity selection of peptides to identify binding surfaces that are exposed on the zzso alpha and beta and on each zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso These peptides are sensitive zzso of zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso known to produce distinct biological effects, induce distinct zzso changes in the zzso providing a strong correlation between zzso zzso and biological zzso Furthermore, the ability of some of the peptides to discriminate between different zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso complexes suggests that the biological effects of zzso zzso and zzso acting through these receptors are likely to be zzso
