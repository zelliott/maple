zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as other zzso As a step toward zzso studies, we have zzso zzso using 60 DNA samples from African-American and 60 samples from zzso zzso All zzso zzso junctions and approximately 370 zzso located zzso of the site of zzso initiation were zzso We observed 15 single zzso zzso zzso including three zzso coding zzso zzso that were present only in DNA from African-American zzso zzso analysis revealed that two of the zzso zzso were tightly zzso zzso zzso were created for all zzso zzso observed, including a zzso zzso construct that included the two linked zzso and those zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly decreased for three of the four zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that decreased levels of zzso protein appeared to be the major mechanism responsible for decreases in activity, although apparent zzso values also varied among the zzso zzso In addition, the most common of the zzso zzso disrupted the portion of zzso involved with zzso and this zzso zzso behaved as a zzso rather than a zzso during gel zzso zzso These observations indicate that common genetic zzso for zzso can result in reductions in levels of both activity and zzso zzso They also raise the possibility of zzso zzso variation in zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso for this phase II zzso zzso
