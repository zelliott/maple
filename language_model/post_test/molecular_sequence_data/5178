Free radical induced zzso of vinyl zzso such as the zzso peptides described here is a facile and rapid reaction used zzso for example, in the zzso of zzso and zzso for the assembly of zzso zzso The technology allows the incorporation of many of the same or different zzso zzso into a single zzso zzso In this study large zzso containing multiple copies of peptides representing zzso and zzso zzso of influenza zzso were zzso The zzso retained zzso after the zzso procedure and the zzso were highly zzso the levels of zzso obtained after a single dose of zzso zzso were at least as great as those achieved only after repeated doses of the equivalent zzso zzso The technology has a wide range of potential applications, not the least significant of which is the construction of designer zzso for third generation vaccine zzso
