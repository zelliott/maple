Identification of broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso may assist vaccine zzso zzso Here we report a novel human zzso zzso zzso designated zzso which zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso s from various primary zzso to zzso zzso on zzso cells and zzso infected cells, as well as to zzso zzso s and zzso fusion intermediate structures containing zzso structure, but did not bind to zzso zzso zzso s and the zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is zzso and zzso the zzso on zzso and the zzso structure on zzso zzso neutralized zzso of the zzso primary zzso from different zzso and all the zzso tested in zzso based on infection of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso by zzso virus, but was less potent in cell zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso changes upon binding leading to exposure of the zzso binding site, enhanced binding of zzso zzso and zzso specific for the membrane zzso external region zzso of zzso zzso or increased zzso zzso The overall modest zzso activity of zzso is likely due to the limited binding of zzso to functional zzso which could be increased by zzso engineering if zzso zzso may represent a new class of zzso targeting zzso zzso overlapping structures on both zzso and zzso Its novel zzso and possibly new zzso of zzso could zzso improved vaccine zzso and candidate zzso
