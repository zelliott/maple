zzso between zzso coli release factors zzso and zzso have been constructed to study the role of the release factors in zzso in particular whether each possesses specific zzso for recognition of the stop zzso and for zzso zzso zzso One hybrid factor showed normal zzso activity but was defective in its ability to facilitate zzso zzso of this protein was toxic to the zzso zzso another hybrid factor showed complete loss of zzso recognition but retained some zzso zzso These two functional activities of the release factors were not zzso in zzso within either the zzso or zzso halves of the primary sequence as previously zzso Evidence from the activities of the hybrid proteins and from earlier studies suggests that a combination of zzso from the beginning and middle of the zzso including a region of very high sequence zzso contribute to the zzso domain, whereas zzso from both the zzso and zzso halves of the zzso are important for the zzso recognition zzso
