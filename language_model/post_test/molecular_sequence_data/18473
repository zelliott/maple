A total of 14 zzso strains were isolated from different zzso zzso zzso with pH ranging from zzso to zzso by using serial dilution zzso plate zzso The strains were Gram negative, rod zzso zzso forming and developed brown to black colored zzso which were zzso smooth, zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso they were positive for zzso tests zzso zzso production, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further, sequence analysis of zzso zzso obtained from these cultures revealed the presence of five different zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these strains were grouped into two distinct zzso These strains were tested for their ability to grow on a media containing four different pesticides such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are commonly used for the zzso Out of 14 strains tested, 13 strains were able to grow on a media containing zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso like zzso and zzso However, five zzso strains were able to grow at higher concentration of zzso zzso without affecting their growth zzso Further, the effect of pesticides on the zzso zzso acid zzso production by zzso strains was also zzso zzso strain was found to produce zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a media supplemented with 1,000 zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Present study reveals that species of zzso are able to grow and survive in the presence of pesticides and no significant effects were observed on the zzso activities of zzso zzso
