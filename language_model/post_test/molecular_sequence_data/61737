zzso zzso is a zzso database of zzso comparative protein structure models for all available protein sequences matched to at least one known protein zzso The models are calculated by zzso an automated modeling pipeline that relies on the zzso package for fold assignment, zzso zzso model building and model assessment zzso zzso uses the zzso zzso database management system for flexible zzso and zzso for viewing the sequences and structures zzso zzso is updated regularly to reflect the growth in protein sequence and structure databases, as well as improvements in the software for calculating the zzso For ease of access, zzso is organized into different data zzso The largest data set contains zzso models for zzso in zzso out of zzso unique protein sequences in the complete zzso database zzso 25, zzso only models based on alignments with significant similarity scores and models assessed to have the correct fold despite insignificant alignments are zzso Another model data set supports target selection and zzso zzso by the New York zzso zzso Research zzso zzso the 53 new structures produced by the consortium allowed us to characterize structurally zzso zzso zzso also contains binding site predictions for small zzso and a set of predicted interactions between pairs of modeled sequences from the same zzso Our other resources associated with zzso include a comprehensive database of multiple protein structure alignments zzso zzso as well as web servers for automated comparative modeling with zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso in protein structures zzso zzso and predicting functional consequences of single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
