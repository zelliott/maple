zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that mediates zzso zzso in zzso zzso We determined the relative potency of zzso and related peptides in the zzso zzso of the zzso dogfish shark and cloned and expressed the zzso zzso zzso from this zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso from 250 zzso 66 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the relative potency of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is growth zzso hormone, and zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso from shark zzso zzso zzso is only zzso identical to the human zzso It maintains a long, zzso zzso zzso with seven zzso zzso and has three zzso sites and eight other zzso implicated in zzso zzso Two zzso acids considered important for zzso binding in zzso are not present in the shark zzso When zzso and the zzso zzso channel were zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso from zzso zzso 2 to zzso zzso 34 zzso The zzso affinity for zzso zzso zzso by the cloned zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a profile mirroring that in the zzso zzso The zzso differs from previously cloned zzso in having a low affinity for zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso was detected by quantitative zzso in shark zzso zzso zzso and zzso These studies characterize a unique G zzso zzso from the shark zzso zzso that is the oldest cloned zzso
