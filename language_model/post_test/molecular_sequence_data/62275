The zzso protein of zzso zzso is a major zzso factor, essential for the recruitment and zzso of host zzso filaments that lead to zzso zzso and zzso spread of bacteria within the infected zzso The expression of zzso is tightly regulated and is strongly induced only when zzso zzso is within the host zzso zzso induction of zzso expression is zzso through a single promoter element that directs the expression of a zzso zzso with a long zzso zzso zzso untranslated region zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso upstream region was found to result in bacterial zzso that were no longer capable of zzso zzso recruitment or zzso spread, thus indicating that this region is important for zzso zzso zzso zzso strains that contained smaller deletions zzso zzso within the zzso upstream region demonstrated a range of zzso expression levels that coincided with the amount of bacterial zzso spread observed within infected zzso A correlation appeared to exist between levels of zzso expression and the ability of zzso zzso to transition from uniform zzso zzso surrounding individual bacteria zzso zzso to directional assembly and the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing deletions that most significantly altered the predicted secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso had the largest reductions in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso synthesis and that a threshold level of zzso synthesis must be achieved to promote the transition from zzso zzso clouds to directional zzso assembly and zzso
