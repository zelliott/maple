zzso organisms can be zzso from zzso differentiated zzso cell or nuclear founders zzso zzso zzso from zzso related zzso founders might a zzso have been expected to be zzso zzso However, zzso zzso animals display zzso zzso caused by defective zzso zzso of gene expression zzso and zzso zzso plants exhibit poorly understood zzso zzso zzso variation zzso Here we show that zzso variation in zzso zzso lineages is associated with zzso zzso in DNA sequence zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso distinctive molecular spectrum of base zzso zzso and deletions that probably results from decreased DNA repair zzso Finally, we show that while zzso base zzso are a likely major genetic cause of the zzso variation of zzso zzso zzso zzso movement is unlikely to contribute substantially to that zzso We conclude that the zzso variation of zzso plants, unlike that of zzso animals, is substantially due to DNA sequence zzso
