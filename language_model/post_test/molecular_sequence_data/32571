A novel 41 zzso zzso displaying high zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alcohol was cloned from suspension cultures of zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The apparent K zzso for zzso alcohol is zzso zzso with a V zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein at 30 degrees C, whereas the K zzso for the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso relationship studies revealed stringent structure zzso Even minor zzso zzso as the zzso zzso or changes in the zzso ring substitution result in activities decreased by zzso zzso and zzso alcohols are not zzso confirming that the aromatic ring itself is zzso and solely the derivatives with a zzso zzso are zzso The zzso shares only similarities under zzso on zzso acid level with other known zzso The designated reaction product, zzso alcohol zzso zzso could be detected in suspension zzso The highest content of up to zzso of the dry mass is concurrent with an increase of the specific zzso activity that reaches its maximum of zzso zzso zzso on day 6 of the culture zzso zzso levels estimated by zzso zzso remain constant until day 6 and recede zzso The corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso differs mainly by one short variable zzso zzso characterization revealed a higher zzso efficiency and a slightly broader zzso plasticity together with a lower sensitivity to the presence of zzso zzso and zzso This is to our knowledge the first report of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
