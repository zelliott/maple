zzso relationships within the large zzso II zzso which includes nearly a third of extant zzso species, have resisted zzso by both molecular and zzso zzso Earlier studies suggest that much of the zzso zzso of this group is due to three factors: zzso a long root that reduces apparent levels of support in the zzso zzso long zzso branches zzso by a series of very short backbone zzso (the zzso rapid zzso zzso and zzso significantly zzso zzso rates of zzso To resolve the zzso II zzso with a particular emphasis on the backbone zzso we assembled a data set of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a sample of 81 zzso selected to capture the deepest zzso in the zzso We then evaluated our zzso hypothesis against potential zzso factors, including those induced by zzso ancient rapid radiation, rate zzso and the zzso zzso paradox zzso While the strong support we zzso for the backbone relationships proved robust to these potential problems, their investigation revealed unexpected zzso impacts of zzso zzso divergent effects of methods for countering the zzso paradox artifact, and gave no support to concerns about the zzso of the zzso model to data sets with zzso zzso rates of zzso This study is among few to investigate these factors with empirical data, and the first to compare the performance of the two primary methods for overcoming the zzso zzso paradox zzso Among the significant zzso results is the near-complete support along the zzso II zzso the demonstrated zzso of zzso as currently zzso and the zzso placement of the enigmatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso
