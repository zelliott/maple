Using stable cell lines containing a series of deletions of the zzso basic protein zzso promoter directing the bacterial zzso zzso gene in a peripheral zzso cell line, we have studied the sequences in the zzso promoter needed for induction by zzso zzso zzso of expression from the zzso promoter by zzso zzso is not a rapid zzso zzso begins after 24 h and reaches a maximum at approximately 72 zzso The results from the stable zzso indicate at least one region that appears to be essential to the induction of zzso directed by the zzso zzso The region that is necessary for induction does not contain a consensus zzso zzso response zzso A specific binding site involved in the induction by zzso zzso was localized to an zzso binding zzso
