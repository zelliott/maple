We have investigated the zzso zzso and zzso functions of isolated segments of zzso zzso We find that zzso has two autonomous zzso zzso One domain, from zzso acid 280 to zzso forms stable zzso and binds DNA zzso The biological significance, if any, of this zzso activity is not zzso A second domain, from zzso acid 80 to zzso does not form stable zzso under stringent conditions but binds DNA both specifically and zzso The specific zzso function of zzso therefore, resides in the highly zzso central region of the protein and does not require stable zzso zzso acids zzso which include both the specific zzso domain and the zzso zzso region, activate a zzso promoter in zzso This finding strongly argues that the zzso activity of zzso segment zzso is zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso function remains to be zzso
