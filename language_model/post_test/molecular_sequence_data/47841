Muscle contraction results from the force generated between the thin filament protein zzso and the thick filament protein myosin, which causes the thick and thin muscle filaments to slide past each zzso There are skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle and zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso diseases in humans have been associated with defects in cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso in the human skeletal muscle zzso gene zzso are associated with two different muscle diseases, zzso zzso with excess of thin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both diseases are characterized by structural abnormalities of the muscle zzso and variable degrees of muscle zzso We have identified 15 different zzso zzso resulting in 14 different zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso in zzso are distributed throughout all six coding zzso and some involve known functional zzso of zzso zzso half of the patients died within their first year, but two female patients have survived into their zzso and have zzso We identified dominant zzso in all but 1 of 14 families, with the zzso zzso being single and zzso The only family showing dominant inheritance comprised a 33-year-old affected mother and her two affected and two unaffected zzso In another family, the clinically unaffected father is a zzso mosaic for the zzso seen in both of his affected zzso We identified zzso zzso in one family in which the two affected siblings had zzso zzso in two different zzso one zzso and the other zzso zzso We also identified de zzso zzso in seven sporadic zzso for which it was possible to zzso parental zzso
