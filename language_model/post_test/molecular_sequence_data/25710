zzso clones to rat liver zzso zzso zzso were used to isolate zzso clones from a zzso zzso rat zzso DNA zzso Fifteen zzso containing the coding region and zzso segment of the zzso zzso gene were identified, spanning 20 zzso of DNA contained in 3 zzso 35 zzso The organization of this single copy gene reveals a general correspondence between zzso and structural zzso of the zzso with the segment responsible for zzso the zzso to the zzso membrane and several segments involved in zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso by discrete zzso
