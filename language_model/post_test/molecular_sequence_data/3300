zzso cell zzso receptors zzso play a critical role in the regulation of natural killer zzso cell activity through their recognition of class I zzso molecules expressed on target zzso zzso recognition provides vital information to zzso cells about whether a target cell should be zzso or zzso zzso the molecular mechanism of this recognition has remained a strong focus of zzso This has resulted in the crystal structures of several members of the zzso family and more recently the zzso of the three zzso structures of zzso and zzso zzso with their respective zzso zzso and zzso A strong structural conservation has been revealed both in the zzso design and in the overall mode of zzso binding to class I zzso Nevertheless, distinct differences in the zzso binding sites allow for high specificity between zzso Furthermore, unexpected similarities with zzso zzso zzso recognition of zzso molecules are also zzso The detailed interactions between zzso and zzso molecules and their functional implications will be reviewed zzso
