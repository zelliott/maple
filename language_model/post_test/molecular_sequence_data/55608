zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso leukemia virus is zzso by the 3' domain of gag and contains a zinc finger surrounded by basic zzso zzso During zzso zzso NC protein is necessary for core formation and the NC zinc finger is required for the packaging of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso has zzso and zzso activities critical for virus zzso since zzso promotes zzso of viral zzso containing the zzso packaging element and zzso of replication primer zzso to the initiation site of reverse zzso zzso zzso To investigate the role of the basic zzso acids zzso the zzso zinc finger, neutral zzso were zzso for the basic zzso acids and the effects of these zzso in zzso on virus assembly and zzso and in zzso on the zzso activity of zzso were zzso Here we report that the substitution of 1 or 2 neutral zzso acids for the basic zzso did not impair the production of mature zzso but that zzso was either moderately or strongly zzso When more than 2 basic zzso were replaced by neutral zzso zzso viruses were poorly infectious because of a severe zzso in zzso zzso zzso packaging and initiation of reverse zzso In zzso zzso peptides with similar zzso were chemically zzso and were found to be either fully or partially active or completely zzso These data indicate that the basic zzso zzso the zinc finger of zzso are required for the production of infectious zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso
