Two zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso have been isolated from the roots of zzso zzso zzso using zzso affinity column zzso followed by gel zzso on a zzso zzso column and fast protein liquid zzso on a zzso column, and their zzso acid sequences have been zzso zzso consists of 84 zzso acid zzso and has a molecular mass of zzso while zzso has an identical sequence with zzso except lack of the zzso zzso zzso is composed of two zzso zzso A and B, with 50% zzso with each zzso Both zzso did not zzso native rabbit zzso but showed about zzso of the zzso activity of wheat germ zzso toward zzso zzso In the presence of beta zzso linked zzso of zzso which inhibit the zzso zzso had an zzso spectrum with zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso attributed to the red shift of the zzso zzso suggesting the location of zzso zzso at or near zzso site of zzso
