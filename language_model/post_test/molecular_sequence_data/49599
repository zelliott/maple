The zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally isolated as a zzso zzso However, the zzso gene is essential for cell viability and zzso zzso is identical to the previously characterized zzso gene zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is essential for protein transport from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso were accumulated beneath the plasma membrane and the zzso shuttling protein zzso remained in the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso exchange factor for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coding for an zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed both the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso growth of newly isolated zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is involved in early steps of the protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso carries a single zzso change in the branch point consensus of the fifth zzso which reduces the abundance of the zzso zzso During zzso II, the zzso membrane was initiated near zzso pole zzso however, subsequent extension of the membrane was arrested before its closure into a zzso We conclude that zzso is responsible for the assembly of the zzso membrane by zzso membrane zzso
