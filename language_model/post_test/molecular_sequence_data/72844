zzso in the transforming growth factor beta type II zzso zzso zzso gene have been detected in several human zzso exhibiting zzso zzso To extend analyses of this zzso we previously investigated the zzso organization of the zzso zzso gene and defined seven zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we further determined the zzso sequences surrounding these seven zzso and designed eight sets of zzso zzso to examine the entire coding region of the zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso we screened zzso DNA sequences from 30 sporadic zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in two of 30 tumors and both displayed zzso zzso One had a deletion in a zzso tract in zzso 3 and the other had a point zzso in the zzso domain located in zzso zzso There were no zzso in zzso 1, 2, 4, 5 and zzso These results further zzso the zzso tract and zzso domain as zzso hotspots in the zzso zzso gene in cells with zzso instability and suggest that zzso zzso gene zzso occur rarely in cells lacking zzso zzso
