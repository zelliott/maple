Novel zzso zzso have been observed in zzso oxide microbial mats of Yellowstone National Park zzso however, no definitive work has identified specific zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso The objectives of the current study were to isolate and characterize an zzso member of the zzso observed in previous zzso zzso gene surveys and to determine the abundance and distribution of close relatives of this zzso in zzso geothermal springs containing high zzso of dissolved zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of the novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso obtained from a zzso zzso geothermal spring in zzso zzso Basin, zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso exhibits only zzso to zzso sequence similarity to other known zzso zzso and less than zzso similarity to known zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with an optimum pH range of zzso to zzso and an optimum temperature range of 65 to 75 degrees zzso zzso zzso grows zzso on zzso or zzso zzso onto zzso exhibiting doubling times between 10 and 11 h under zzso conditions (65 degrees zzso The distribution and relative abundance of zzso zzso zzso gene sequences in 14 zzso geothermal springs containing zzso oxide microbial mats were zzso zzso related zzso zzso zzso gene sequences zzso sequence zzso were consistently observed in zzso oxide mats at temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso confirmed that organisms highly similar to strain zzso comprised up to zzso of the total zzso community at selected zzso The broad distribution of highly related zzso zzso zzso gene sequences in zzso zzso oxide microbial mats is consistent with the observed characteristics and growth zzso of zzso strain zzso and emphasizes the importance of this newly described zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso environments of zzso
