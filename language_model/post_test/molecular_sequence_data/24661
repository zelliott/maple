As the first structural zzso of a modular zzso zzso zzso domain, the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain from the zzso B zzso zzso was solved by a combination of multiple zzso replacement and zzso anomalous zzso and refined to an R factor of zzso to zzso zzso Its overall zzso architecture belongs to the zzso family, with two unusual features unprecedented in this family: a zzso zzso zzso interface and a zzso channel that passes through the entire zzso The active site zzso comprised of zzso zzso and zzso is located in the middle of the zzso channel, suggesting the passage of the zzso through the zzso Modeling indicates that the active site can accommodate and orient the zzso B precursor zzso while at the same time shielding the active site from external water and catalyzing zzso by zzso zzso The geometry and organization of functional groups explain the observed zzso specificity of this TE and offer strategies for engineering zzso zzso zzso of a zzso model of the upstream zzso carrier protein zzso against the TE suggests that the zzso axis of the TE zzso may also be the axis of symmetry that determines the arrangement of zzso in the entire zzso zzso conservation suggests that all zzso from modular zzso zzso have a similar fold, zzso zzso zzso and zzso channel zzso
