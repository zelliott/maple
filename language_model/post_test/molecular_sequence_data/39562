zzso and unfolding simulations of three-dimensional lattice proteins were analyzed using a simplified statistical mechanical model in which their zzso acid sequences and native zzso were incorporated zzso Using this statistical mechanical model, under the assumption that only interactions between zzso acid zzso within a local structure in a native state are considered, the partition function of the system can be calculated for a given native zzso without any adjustable zzso The simulations were carried out for two different native zzso for each of which two zzso zzso acid sequences were zzso The native and non-native contacts between zzso acid zzso occurring in the simulations were examined in detail and compared with the results derived from the theoretical zzso The equilibrium zzso quantities zzso energy, zzso zzso and the probability of each zzso acid zzso being in the native zzso at various temperatures obtained from the simulations and the theoretical model were also examined in order to characterize the folding processes that depend on the native zzso and the zzso acid zzso Finally, the free energy landscapes were discussed based on these zzso
