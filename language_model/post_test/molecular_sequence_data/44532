zzso necrosis factor zzso is initially zzso as an zzso zzso zzso protein that is further zzso at zzso to yield the soluble zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso have been reported to block the zzso processing of zzso thus suggesting that the putative zzso converting zzso zzso is a zzso zzso In this report, we characterize a zzso converting activity zzso that zzso in zzso the human zzso zzso at the zzso processing zzso The zzso steps followed for zzso and the use of a panel of zzso zzso indicate that the zzso responsible for zzso is a membrane zzso zzso which is most likely different from the zzso zzso The failure of zzso to process a zzso precursor zzso emphasizes the importance of zzso zzso at zzso zzso In addition, zzso is not able to cleave the mouse zzso and does not catalyze in zzso the processing of other zzso proteins susceptible to zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso These studies suggest the existence of an zzso specific for zzso within the zzso involved in the zzso of a number of zzso and zzso zzso
