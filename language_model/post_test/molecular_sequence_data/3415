zzso regulates the function of zzso zzso channels such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report a mechanism for zzso of the zzso state and function of the zzso zzso via an zzso scaffolding zzso zzso We found that zzso binds both the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and decreases zzso zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso zzso that disrupt the interactions between zzso zzso and zzso induce zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso function and may play a role in synaptic zzso addiction, learning, and zzso
