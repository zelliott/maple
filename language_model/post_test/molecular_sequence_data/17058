Here we report that zzso effects of the zzso of a zzso can occur simultaneously both upstream and downstream of the zzso zzso We have identified an zzso A particle zzso zzso in zzso 6 of a gene that we have named zzso zzso zzso binding zzso The presence of the zzso is associated with an zzso transcript initiating from a cryptic promoter in the zzso reading out into the adjacent zzso gene zzso The expression of this transcript is highly variable among zzso mice within the zzso strain and so zzso can be classified as a zzso zzso As expected, the presence or absence of the transcript zzso with differential DNA zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso More surprisingly, in mice where the zzso is zzso and presumably zzso active, we find a number of short zzso transcripts which initiate at the normal zzso end of the gene but terminate zzso just zzso of the zzso This is the first report of a zzso having both upstream and downstream effects on zzso at the site of zzso and it suggests that alternative zzso may sometimes be caused by a downstream zzso zzso zzso
