Quality control zzso in laboratories performing molecular zzso class II typing often includes a zzso chain reaction zzso approach for monitoring DNA zzso An zzso primer set was zzso zzso which is specific for zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso consensus sequences with an expected zzso product size of 81 zzso zzso detected zzso DNA from reference cell lines zzso and zzso zzso to 100 zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso Additionally, zzso detected zzso products from routine zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies employing controlled DNA contamination of laboratory surfaces revealed that increasing amounts of wipe test samples zzso to zzso zzso were zzso to the wipe test zzso whereas lower amounts zzso to zzso or zzso a diluted wipe test sample, increased the sensitivity of the test and zzso the zzso zzso this study describes a primer set, zzso which detects both zzso DNA and zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso illustrates the necessity of routine testing for potential zzso factors that may be introduced into the wipe test zzso
