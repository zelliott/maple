We have previously reported the zzso and characterization of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the DNA zzso effect on zzso from an zzso zzso long terminal zzso Here we show that zzso is very similar if not identical to the zzso zzso a zzso nuclear protein first detected by zzso from zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1981) zzso zzso zzso 68, zzso A number of laboratories have shown that the zzso protein complex binds to free zzso DNA zzso In this study, we have examined the binding properties of zzso zzso binds zzso DNA with low zzso zzso to random sequence zzso DNA depends on the length of the duplex and is optimal with zzso of 30 and 32 base zzso the protein complexes formed with these zzso have zzso values of zzso zzso It binds with comparable high affinities to zzso duplex DNA, to duplex DNA ending in hairpin zzso and to zzso in which an internal segment of duplex DNA is flanked by zzso zzso zzso also interacts effectively with circular duplex molecules containing a zzso zzso region zzso or a zzso segment of zzso zzso but only zzso with the corresponding closed circular construct made up entirely of duplex zzso zzso prefers zzso to zzso zzso The binding properties of zzso are consistent with the hypothesis that is recognizes zzso to zzso transitions in zzso A model is presented for the interaction of zzso with its target sequence in the zzso long terminal zzso
