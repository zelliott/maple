We previously identified a novel gene family dispersed in the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso zzso Although many transcripts were identified, no zzso was readily identifiable from sequence zzso 

Here, we zzso structural zzso modeling and zzso methods to identify remote zzso and characterized the gene products as SEA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso A common zzso domain in this family was structurally similar to zzso zzso is primarily a structural domain, known to assist or regulate binding to zzso zzso proteins from three members of this gene family specifically zzso with zzso with high zzso with potential implication in zzso acquisition and immune zzso Similar approach was used to identify a zzso site on the zzso The zzso mode showed zzso zzso inserted into a zzso pocket, with zzso iron zzso coordinated to two zzso zzso zzso zzso properties were confirmed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which showed high affinity zzso (K zzso zzso and zzso zzso attributes of zzso zzso zzso The native proteins were zzso zzso and are localized on adult zzso zzso and zzso major zzso zzso and site for zzso zzso and zzso 

The results suggest potential role, at least in the nucleation step of zzso zzso zzso zzso and as receptors for zzso zzso Survival strategies exploited by zzso including zzso zzso mechanism in zzso are paramount for successful zzso Thus, assessing prospects for application in disease intervention is zzso
