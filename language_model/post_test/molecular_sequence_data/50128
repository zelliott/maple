zzso are essential zzso structures in most zzso that link the intermediate filament network of one cell to its neighbor, thereby forming a strong zzso The molecular components of zzso belong to the zzso zzso the zzso family, and the zzso repeat protein zzso The zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso molecules and comprise the zzso and zzso To date, three human zzso zzso have been zzso namely zzso 1, 2, and 3 that are expressed in a zzso and zzso zzso Here we have identified and zzso at the genetic level, a novel human zzso zzso sharing zzso with zzso 1, 2, 3 and we name this zzso zzso The human zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a precursor protein of zzso zzso zzso The predicted mature protein comprises zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso Da at zzso zzso Human zzso 4 shares zzso identity with human zzso 1, 37% with human zzso 2, and 50% with human zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso organization of the human zzso 4 gene zzso demonstrates that it is composed of 16 zzso spanning approximately 37 zzso of zzso and is situated between zzso and zzso We have demonstrated using zzso on multiple tissue zzso samples that zzso 4 has very specific tissue expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
