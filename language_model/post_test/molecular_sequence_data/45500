zzso zzso zzso of the class of zzso are stabilized by a zzso zzso It is composed of zzso needles zzso which provide the zzso scaffold of these zzso In the center of the zzso there is an zzso filament that consists predominantly of zzso an zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso By differential display of transcripts we identified additional proteins involved in zzso zzso Two genes were isolated from the marine zzso zzso zzso one codes for a zzso and the other for a zzso zzso The zzso forms zzso to which zzso molecules zzso The extent of the zzso zzso formation strongly increased if associated with the zzso By applying a new and mild extraction procedure that avoids hydrogen zzso treatment, native zzso filaments were extracted from zzso of zzso zzso These filaments zzso in addition to zzso the zzso and a few other zzso zzso electron microscopic studies underscored the role of these additional zzso in particular that of zzso in zzso zzso in addition to zzso presumably forms in the zzso canal as well as on the surface of the zzso an organized zzso zzso In the zzso space most of these complexes are arranged zzso around the zzso Taken together, these additional zzso working together with zzso may also be relevant for potential zzso applications of zzso in the formation of surface zzso Finally, we propose a scheme that outlines the zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso through zzso and zzso synthesis and deposition of zzso
