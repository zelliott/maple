High-yield zzso are characterized by erect leaf canopies that zzso photosynthesis and thus favor increased zzso zzso zzso of the leaf blade (called rolled zzso can result in enhanced zzso zzso increase erect duration and promote an overall erect leaf zzso The rice zzso zzso induced through transferred DNA zzso zzso had the zzso zzso The leaves in the wild type demonstrated natural drooping zzso resulting in decreasing leaf zzso zzso zzso during zzso at the 20th day after zzso zzso zzso of the leaves in zzso remained high, even zzso zzso We applied zzso tagging and isolated a zzso gene from rice which, when zzso could induce upward zzso of the leaf zzso This gene encodes for a protein of zzso zzso acids including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso There are at least 18 members of the zzso family in zzso According to zzso zzso the zzso gene in rice could be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso so we called it zzso These results provide a possible opportunity for implementing zzso gene in crop zzso
