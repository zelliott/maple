A recently described zzso cell line can be induced at high temperature to actively rearrange its zzso zzso zzso We used this cell line to determine the fate of zzso breaks generated by zzso zzso After zzso zzso of K zzso had broken zzso signal zzso zzso ends were zzso but zzso to zzso less zzso Both zzso closed zzso and open, blunt, processed coding ends were zzso zzso junctions involving zzso accumulated with similar zzso as zzso signal ends, arguing that coding ends can be resolved quickly and efficiently to coding zzso whereas signal ends remain mostly zzso Signal ends are then joined rapidly when cells are returned to the low zzso These results support the model that broken signal ends and hairpin coding ends are authentic zzso in zzso zzso It appears that hairpin coding ends are rapidly opened, zzso and resolved to coding zzso whereas joining of signal ends is clearly zzso from the joining of coding ends and can be much zzso zzso formation of signal junctions may require cell cycle zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso
