The features of random chemical modification are defined with reference to zzso of bovine zzso which has been performed in a random manner so that all of the zzso groups that participate in functional zzso binding zzso those that are zzso could be zzso Random chemical zzso which has objectives different from those of both specific zzso and extensive chemical zzso has been achieved for bovine zzso with the mild zzso zzso zzso zzso retention of function was demonstrated by a Hill zzso of zzso zzso zzso for the modified zzso After removal of unmodified zzso zzso the mixture of randomly modified zzso alpha or beta chains was subjected to tandem treatment with zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and identified by zzso acid zzso The amount of zzso in the zzso zzso group of a zzso zzso was taken as an estimate of the degree of zzso zzso For bovine zzso two zzso groups of the zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso groups of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be zzso zzso to have incorporated significantly more zzso in the zzso zzso compared to the same site in the zzso zzso Three of these sites were already known zzso sites zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso and two sites between the 2 zzso of bovine zzso zzso and zzso these findings support the conclusions of the random modification zzso Two other zzso sites, zzso and zzso align the sides of the central zzso axis connecting the two well-known major zzso sites of bovine zzso The zzso of these five zzso sites was assessed by improved molecular zzso When viewed through the central zzso zzso the functional zzso sites in the central cavity appear to be zzso related and to connect the two major zzso zzso zzso or zzso that are directed at these regions in the central zzso axis may favor the zzso zzso to provide a lower oxygen affinity by preventing the zzso of the central cavity that normally occurs upon zzso
