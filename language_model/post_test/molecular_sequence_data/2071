zzso with an ordered zzso zzso gene assembly process during precursor zzso B cell zzso we find that most zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso cells derived from zzso zzso combined immune zzso mice actively form zzso zzso of their zzso heavy chain locus but do not rearrange zzso zzso light chain variable region gene zzso However, we have identified several zzso zzso zzso that transcribe the zzso zzso zzso light chain constant region and actively rearrange the zzso variable region gene zzso In one case progression to the stage of zzso light chain gene zzso did not require expression of zzso zzso heavy zzso zzso this progression could not be efficiently induced following expression of zzso heavy chains from an introduced zzso As observed in zzso cell lines from normal mice, attempted V zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso occur by inversion at least as frequently as by zzso The zzso zzso result in retention of both products of the zzso event in the zzso thus allowing their zzso zzso zzso coding sequence joins are zzso and analogous in structure to previously described zzso heavy chain coding zzso In contrast, the recognition signals that flank involved coding segments frequently are joined precisely back-to-back in normal zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore does not significantly impair recognition of, zzso cutting at, or juxtaposition and appropriate zzso of signal zzso Our finding that the zzso zzso prevents formation of correct coding but not signal joins zzso these events zzso
