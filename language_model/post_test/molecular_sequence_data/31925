zzso in the zzso gene zzso are considered as a rare cause of Parkinson's disease zzso Our objective was to examine the frequency of the zzso point zzso among zzso patients of Polish zzso 

zzso of the known zzso point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed either using the zzso zzso zzso platform or by direct sequencing of the zzso zzso 2 and zzso As the two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified, their frequency in a control population of Polish origin was assessed and in zzso analysis performed to investigate the potential impact on protein structure and zzso 

We did not observe the previously reported point zzso in the zzso gene in our 629 zzso zzso however, two novel potentially zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Each zzso was observed in a single patient presenting with a typical zzso sporadic zzso zzso Although neither zzso was observed in control subjects and in zzso protein analysis predicts a damaging effect for zzso and zzso zzso the lack of family history brings into question the true zzso of these rare zzso 

zzso population based studies are needed to determine the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Our findings highlight the possible role of rare zzso contributing to disease risk and may support further screening of the zzso gene in sporadic zzso patients from different zzso
