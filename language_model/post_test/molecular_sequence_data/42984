We analyzed zzso and energies of 469 zzso and 224 AT pairs occurring in 11 zzso 54 zzso and 12 zzso crystal zzso The most frequent hydrogen bond length zzso to the zzso value but zzso of the hydrogen bond lengths are unexpectedly zzso The average zzso pair is rather compressed and opened into the double zzso minor groove while an average AT pair has zzso zzso The extreme base pair geometrical parameters are the zzso buckle zzso degrees and 39 degrees, zzso zzso degrees and 26 degrees, opening zzso degrees and 19 degrees, zzso zzso A and zzso A, stretch zzso A and zzso A, and zzso zzso A and zzso zzso The analyzed set contains complementary bases apparently bound by unusual zzso hydrogen zzso The unusual base pairing zzso are of two zzso In the first case, an extreme value of one zzso is compensated for by other geometrical parameters so that the energy of the resulting geometry is zzso However, there are also examples when the zzso effect is missing and then the base pairing instability is zzso The most extensive base pair zzso occur in zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso whose common feature is a low structure zzso However, very unstable base pairs are also present in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose structures were solved at a relatively high zzso As the zzso probably originate from crystal packing forces and/or data and refinement zzso we recommend to omit these structures from studies of DNA zzso zzso The remaining zzso zzso and zzso whose list and their zzso base pair characteristics are given in the article are suitable for this purpose because they exhibit no prohibitive energy zzso from the zzso hydrogen bonding zzso
