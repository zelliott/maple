zzso zzso zzso zzso from cultured tomato zzso zzso cells is a member of the zzso zzso family showing broad base zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The structure consists of seven zzso and seven zzso belonging to an zzso type zzso zzso of the structure of zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso a microbial zzso belonging to the zzso zzso family, reveals that while the overall folding zzso are similar to each other, major insertions and deletions are found at the zzso zzso The structural comparison, an zzso acid sequence alignment of the zzso zzso zzso and comparison of the zzso pattern of these zzso show that the structure of zzso zzso shown here is the basic framework of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso (including a zzso protein called zzso and the structure of zzso zzso is that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso (including zzso zzso zzso we zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso coincided exactly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso zzso and zzso two zzso water molecules were found at the putative zzso sites of both zzso These facts suggest that plant zzso zzso has a very similar zzso mechanism to that of zzso zzso zzso and almost all the zzso zzso zzso widely distributed in various species share a common zzso zzso A cluster of zzso zzso was found on the zzso face of the zzso zzso zzso and two large zzso pockets zzso These zzso pockets appear to be base binding sites mainly by zzso interactions and are responsible for the base zzso of zzso zzso
