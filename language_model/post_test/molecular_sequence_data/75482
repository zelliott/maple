A mathematical model is presented which explains the zzso observed for the protein coats of zzso bacterial zzso Three viruses zzso zzso and zzso all have zzso zzso with rotation angles of 36 degrees and zzso translations of 16 A zzso I zzso and three other viruses zzso zzso and zzso all have zzso zzso with rotation angles of approximately equal to 67 degrees and translations of approximately 3 A zzso II zzso The coat protein zzso in each group diverge from each other in zzso acid zzso and Type II viruses differ dramatically in DNA zzso Regardless of the differences, both Type I and Type II symmetry can be understood as zzso natural consequences of the zzso of zzso protein zzso In our treatment, an zzso zzso is modeled as consisting of two zzso flexible zzso segments that follow zzso paths around the DNA, one in an inner layer and the other in an outer zzso The mathematical model is a set of zzso equations describing the disposition of the flexible zzso Solutions are described by newly introduced symmetry zzso and other zzso An exhaustive survey over the range of zzso has produced a library of all structures that are zzso feasible within our modeling zzso Solutions which zzso in their rotation angles to Type I and Type II viruses occur over large ranges of the zzso zzso A few solutions with other zzso are also allowed, and viruses with these zzso may exist in zzso One solution to the set of zzso obtained without any recourse to the zzso data, yields a calculated zzso zzso pattern for zzso which compares reasonably with experimental zzso The zzso geometry we have used helps explain the near constant linear mass density of known zzso zzso zzso rigid cylinder, and maximum zzso structure models proposed by others for zzso are zzso with the flexible tube models and with one zzso
