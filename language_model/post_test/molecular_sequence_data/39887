zzso zzso is a zzso flagellate present in marine coastal zzso communities zzso This is one of two zzso four) described extant species in the zzso an enigmatic group of zzso with an unclear zzso zzso zzso have never been zzso are usually encountered in low abundance and have a peculiar combination of zzso characters including a large nucleus with permanently condensed zzso and an internal skeleton composed of zzso zzso zzso the zzso history of the group has been tumultuous and has included a variety of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Today, the zzso is treated as a zzso zzso zzso zzso because no zzso or molecular features have been recognized that definitively relate zzso with any other zzso zzso We conducted zzso analyses of small zzso zzso sequences from two zzso zzso of zzso zzso The closest relatives to the sequences from zzso zzso are environmental sequences from a submarine zzso zzso This newly recognized zzso zzso was most closely related to sequences from described species of zzso and zzso These molecular zzso relationships were consistent with current zzso data from all three zzso leading to a robust placement of zzso within the zzso
