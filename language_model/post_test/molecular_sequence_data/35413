In the model zzso zzso coli, zzso proteins are involved in regulating the division of zzso zzso The zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso causing zzso and zzso zzso also identified zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso shares a low identity with those of other bacteria and its function in zzso zzso remains zzso In this study, we used zzso and genetic approaches to examine the molecular role of zzso The results were shown that an zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso forms zzso cells, while the zzso strain retains the shape of short zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso the short rods when zzso with an intact zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso coli did not affect the growth and cell zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso forms zzso structures in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso at cell poles and pole of new daughter cell in zzso zzso In addition, zzso showed zzso can interact with zzso but not with zzso during zzso stage of zzso zzso Altogether, our results show that zzso plays a key role in maintaining proper cell zzso and its function differs from those of zzso
