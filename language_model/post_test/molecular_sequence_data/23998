zzso zzso are abundant zzso peptides that contribute to host zzso They are characterized by several zzso zzso zzso including six zzso zzso zzso which form three zzso zzso bonds and stabilize the zzso zzso zzso zzso a mouse zzso with potent in zzso zzso activity, has a primary structure distinct from all known zzso in that its zzso backbone uniquely lacks three zzso between zzso and zzso zzso diffusion experiments showed that zzso is zzso in solution, and its three-dimensional solution structure, determined by two-dimensional zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso joined to each other by a series of tight turns and a zzso However, the overall zzso content in zzso is lower than that of other zzso structures, while the shape and orientation of the zzso zzso also differ from those of other zzso zzso These structural characteristics combined with the high overall zzso of zzso may contribute to its broad zzso spectrum and membrane disruptive zzso
