zzso exert critical functions in numerous organisms, including that of cell zzso fluid transport and zzso zzso zzso in this zzso can lead to lethal zzso in humans, including primary zzso zzso An understanding of the zzso formation process would lead to better characterization of defects involved in such zzso In the present study, we identified a gene zzso a novel human zzso zzso for zzso body zzso zzso which shares zzso with a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso a major component of the zzso tail zzso is required for the formation of mother zzso zzso zzso and the generation of primary zzso Here, we show that the zzso gene contains 18 alternatively spliced zzso and encodes five different zzso three long and two short zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso containing zzso Moreover, its expression is correlated with zzso formation during zzso differentiation of human zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso was localized within zzso bodies of zzso cells and within zzso of zzso zzso In light of the several spliced zzso of zzso and the particular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could play distinct roles in zzso and in zzso
