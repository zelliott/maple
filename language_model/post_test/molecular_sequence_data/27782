The zzso gene in zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that zzso regulates the expression of all hut zzso We have zzso this cloned zzso gene in zzso coli to identify zzso zzso hut regions that could specifically bind the zzso Ten restriction fragments, some of which were partially overlapping and spanned the coding portions of the zzso zzso hut region, were labeled and tested for their ability to recognize zzso in a filter binding zzso This procedure identified three binding sites, thus supporting previous indications that there were multiple zzso A zzso zzso restriction zzso contained the operator region for the zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso contained the zzso zzso A zzso zzso segment appeared to contain the third operator, corresponding to a separate and perhaps little used control region for zzso expression zzso The addition of zzso the normal zzso caused zzso of all zzso complexes, whereas zzso capable of specifically inducing expression of the zzso zzso inhibited binding only of zzso to fragments containing that zzso zzso did not affect the action of zzso on the zzso operator complex, indicating that it binds to a site separate from zzso on the zzso DNA zzso and gel zzso analyses were used to locate more precisely the operator for the zzso zzso A roughly zzso portion was identified which contained a zzso region of zzso symmetry located near the zzso initiation site for this zzso
