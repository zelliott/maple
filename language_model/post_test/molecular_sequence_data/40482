zzso zzso zzso play a central role in skin zzso They are tightly controlled by specific zzso including the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso we identify zzso as a selective inhibitor of zzso in the zzso Unlike zzso but similar to zzso zzso possesses only one typical zzso zzso Its zzso was detected to be expressed at low levels in several zzso and was induced during zzso zzso Natural zzso was zzso from human zzso stratum zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso expression in the stratum zzso of human skin at various anatomical zzso and in the skin zzso including zzso zzso and sweat zzso zzso expression was decreased in zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mast cell zzso zzso G, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso was detected only for zzso zzso and zzso with apparent zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of human zzso callus in an ex zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso plays a role in modulating the activity of zzso in human zzso A selective zzso of zzso by zzso might have therapeutic potential when zzso activity is zzso
