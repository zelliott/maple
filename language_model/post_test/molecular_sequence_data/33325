zzso zzso zzso is a zzso whose zzso has gone through at least two rounds of zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Several studies have investigated the changes in zzso structure produced by the relatively recent zzso event, but little is known about the ancient zzso due to the high frequency of gene loss after zzso Our previous study, regarding a region responsible for bacterial leaf zzso reported two zzso zzso regions produced by the recent zzso zzso zzso In this study, we identified the full set of four zzso zzso regions zzso from zzso to zzso zzso derived from both the recent and ancient zzso events, and this supports the zzso structure of the soybean zzso Among the predicted genes on zzso 17 zzso group zzso zzso of them were zzso in a recently duplicated region, while zzso and zzso of duplicated genes were retained in two zzso regions formed by the ancient zzso Furthermore, comparative analysis showed a zzso relationship between soybean and zzso zzso since zzso zzso did not undergo the recent zzso event that soybean zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso regions were highly zzso and their zzso did not exist, revealing different rates of zzso process between the two zzso Our data show that extensive zzso remained in the four zzso regions in zzso even though the soybean zzso experienced dynamic zzso zzso following zzso zzso Moreover, multiple zzso quantitative trait zzso on different soybean zzso actually comprise zzso regions produced by two rounds of zzso zzso
