zzso are largely responsible for the zzso and zzso of tea and wine by their interactions with basic zzso zzso zzso zzso arises from zzso of zzso complexes, which is an important protective mechanism in animals that consume zzso This paper presents zzso studies of the interactions between chemically defined zzso and zzso It is shown that zzso binding is dominated by stacking of zzso rings onto zzso zzso surfaces and is strengthened by multiple cooperative binding of zzso zzso zzso weaken at higher temperatures and are unaffected by pH between pH zzso and zzso zzso of zzso rates for peptides with increasing zzso of zzso demonstrate that peptides become increasingly coated with zzso When the coating is sufficiently extensive to provide cooperative zzso bridges, the zzso zzso and zzso Light scattering zzso and electron zzso indicate that the zzso particles fall into two discrete size classes of zzso 80 and 500 zzso zzso The larger particles are favored at higher temperature and zzso suggesting that the particles are in a zzso state, with the smaller particles being stabilized by charge zzso between zzso and that zzso of the complexes may be a phase separation zzso
