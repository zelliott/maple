It is well known that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso hormone with powerful zzso zzso In the present study we sought to determine the precise regions of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that are required for its efficient zzso to zzso zzso because zzso is the primary candidate second zzso zzso zzso to insulin zzso Recently, we identified an zzso acid within the third zzso loop, zzso that was required for efficient zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso A similar zzso strategy was employed here to examine the first and second zzso zzso and to further define sequences in the third loop required for the efficient zzso of the zzso to its second zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells and examined for zzso binding and zzso zzso Three zzso substitution zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in significantly lower zzso zzso production without reductions in zzso zzso Analysis of the first and second zzso zzso revealed only one zzso contained within the first loop, zzso where a significant reduction in zzso zzso was observed with normal zzso zzso These studies suggest that specific zzso of zzso for zzso zzso are primarily localized to the predicted junction of the fifth zzso zzso and the third zzso zzso We predict that zzso zzso and zzso form part of a zzso face that directly contacts the G zzso
