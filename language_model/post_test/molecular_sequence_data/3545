zzso one of the two major zzso of the putative tumor zzso gene zzso located at zzso is zzso in a variety of human zzso including zzso breast, zzso and zzso cell zzso We have isolated and cloned two human zzso of this zzso zzso and zzso located at zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso share almost zzso zzso at the zzso acid level, with zzso The zzso gene contains five zzso and encodes a 247 zzso acid protein zzso of zzso zzso with a highly zzso Ras association zzso zzso domain at the zzso zzso is zzso expressed in all normal zzso and cancer cell lines zzso zzso which is zzso to the previously described mouse zzso zzso exists in at least two spliced zzso A and zzso zzso A encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso or 47 zzso while transcript B contains an zzso of 265 zzso zzso of zzso zzso Both share a zzso domain, zzso by zzso 3 through zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in most of the normal zzso zzso but they appear to be zzso in several cancer cell zzso However, contrary to zzso gene zzso by zzso of the zzso islands at which the two zzso transcripts initiate is not a common event in human primary zzso zzso and zzso are very similar, at the zzso to the zzso zzso C of zzso zzso which does not seem to be involved in zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso for sequence zzso and zzso zzso However, aberrations in tumors have so far not been zzso The presence of a Ras association domain common to zzso zzso and zzso suggests their possible involvement in zzso signaling zzso
