A zzso zzso was isolated by enrichment from zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso zzso strain zzso could zzso zzso zzso as the sole source of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells of strain zzso were shown to be capable of degrading zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggested that zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid and subsequently to salicylic acid through the angular zzso zzso In contrast to zzso strain zzso could transform zzso through the ring zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso could zzso degrade zzso and zzso in the growing system using CA as a zzso After 40 h of zzso zzso of zzso was transformed, and CA and zzso were completely zzso These results suggested that strain zzso might be useful in the zzso of environments contaminated by these zzso
