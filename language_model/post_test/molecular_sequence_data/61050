The zzso family of zzso has a zzso role in regulating gene expression in response to informational light zzso Little is known, however, of the early steps of zzso signal zzso Here we describe a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has reduced responsiveness to continuous zzso light, but responds normally to other light zzso This zzso implies a specific requirement for zzso in zzso signal zzso The zzso locus maps to the south arm of zzso 4, and is not zzso to zzso zzso identified zzso All five zzso zzso isolated have single zzso zzso that introduce stop zzso in a single zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein with no significant sequence similarity to any proteins of known zzso The zzso protein contains a predicted nuclear zzso signal and is targeted to the nucleus in transient zzso zzso This result supports an emerging view that early steps in zzso signaling may be centered in the zzso The zzso gene defines a new zzso family, which consists of at least four genes in zzso This observation raises the possibility of zzso in the zzso pathway, which could account for the incomplete block of zzso signaling observed in the zzso zzso
