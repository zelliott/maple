zzso of zzso islands spanning promoter regions is associated with control of gene zzso although it is unclear what mechanisms define the boundaries between zzso and zzso regions in the zzso zzso of zzso DNA in zzso also affects the frequency of inherited diseases by zzso them to zzso zzso To gain insight into these issues, we investigated patterns of zzso zzso on almost the entire zzso gene zzso from normal zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso We mapped the boundaries of zzso that flank the zzso and zzso of the zzso island region, and correlated zzso status with transitional zzso at zzso zzso zzso sequence analyses showed that the zzso island of human zzso is juxtaposed with multiple zzso repeats and also includes multiple zzso sites upstream and downstream of the zzso start, which has been suggested to prevent zzso islands from becoming zzso We show that zzso zzso is extensive across the entire gene except for zzso sites in the zzso promoter region, zzso 1, and part of zzso 1; the zzso zzso island is embedded between densely zzso zzso regions containing multiple zzso zzso a sharp boundary separates the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso of the zzso island, but a gradual change in zzso density over zzso zzso is observed in the zzso of the zzso zzso boundaries of the zzso and zzso of the zzso island contain multiple zzso sites in addition to zzso zzso zzso in both strands is symmetrical except at the boundary regions between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso with the absence of transitional zzso at zzso sites in zzso zzso
