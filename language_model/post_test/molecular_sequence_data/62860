zzso animals rely primarily on lipids throughout winter as their primary fuel source, thus it is hypothesized that an increase in genes and proteins relating to zzso transport will increase zzso The cloning and expression of heart type fatty zzso protein zzso from a zzso zzso the little brown bat zzso zzso is zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that transcript levels of zzso were significantly higher during hibernation in brown zzso tissue and skeletal muscle compared with levels in zzso zzso Similarly, zzso probing with rat zzso type zzso found zzso higher levels of zzso transcripts in brown zzso from zzso zzso zzso of A- and zzso protein were zzso in zzso of zzso versus zzso animals by Western zzso zzso was zzso higher in brown zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso whereas zzso was significantly higher in zzso brown zzso heart and skeletal zzso The present work implicates zzso as important elements related to the zzso state in zzso zzso in gene and protein expression along with zzso acid zzso are zzso These likely contribute to zzso the function of zzso at the low body temperatures (near 0 degrees zzso experienced in the zzso zzso
