zzso zzso is an excellent experimental zzso for the study of gene zzso zzso and molecular analyses of zzso and zzso zzso have revealed a complex pattern of regulation involving multiple independent zzso zzso of the zzso gene is regulated by the zzso and zzso genes which zzso positively acting regulatory proteins zzso a major and a minor form of zzso induction zzso The product of the zzso gene mediates omega zzso acid induction of zzso The binding sites for each of these proteins have been zzso through zzso zzso zzso which specifically affect the interaction with the regulatory zzso The global controls of nitrogen zzso repression and carbon zzso repression regulate the expression of many zzso zzso including zzso zzso control is exerted through the positively acting zzso gene product and carbon control is dependent on the zzso gene zzso Each of the characterized regulatory genes encodes a zzso protein which zzso particular sequences in the zzso promoter to activate or repress gene zzso In addition, there is evidence for other genetically zzso zzso including a zzso complex, which interact with the zzso region of the zzso zzso
