zzso of zzso at the zzso level has been problematic, but increasing reports of zzso as an opportunistic human pathogen have generated an interest in finding a more consistent basis for zzso Thus, we are developing a zzso scheme based on zzso gene zzso This first report is based on analysis of complete sequences of nuclear small zzso zzso zzso genes zzso from 18 zzso zzso variation was localized in 12 highly variable zzso Four distinct sequence types were identified based on zzso and distance zzso Three were obtained from single zzso Type zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the fourth sequence type, included 15 zzso classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and included all 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence differences within T4 were zzso whereas differences among sequence types were zzso zzso orders obtained by zzso and distance analyses were inconsistent with the current zzso of T4 strains and provided further evidence of a need to zzso criteria for zzso in this zzso Based on this report and others in preparation, we propose that zzso sequence types provide the consistent zzso basis for zzso that is zzso
