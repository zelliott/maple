We have searched for a minimal interaction motif in zzso protein that supports the zzso into zzso paired zzso zzso zzso of the repeat domain with different zzso yields a zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso zzso zzso which represents the third repeat of zzso plus some zzso zzso This zzso self assembles readily into thin filaments without a paired zzso appearance, but these filaments are highly competent to zzso bona fide zzso from full-length zzso zzso the interactions of zzso with overlapping peptides derived from the full zzso sequence yields a minimal zzso interaction motif of zzso at the beginning of the third internal zzso This motif zzso with the highest predicted zzso potential in zzso CD and zzso transform infrared zzso shows that zzso acquires pronounced beta structure in conditions of self zzso Point zzso in the zzso region by zzso zzso prevent the zzso The data indicate that zzso assembly is initiated by a short zzso containing the minimal interaction motif forming a local beta structure embedded in a largely zzso zzso
