zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify DNA zzso zzso gene fragments from geographically isolated natural virus zzso Natural zzso virus communities were obtained from coastal sites in the Pacific Ocean in British Columbia, Canada, and the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic zzso zzso fingerprints of zzso virus communities were generated using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso efforts recovered 33 sequences from the zzso zzso Of the 33 sequences zzso 25 zzso a zzso zzso acid motif indicating that the sequences were pol gene zzso Furthermore, the 25 pol sequences were related to pol gene fragments from known zzso zzso In addition, similar virus sequences zzso sequence zzso were recovered from British Columbia and zzso zzso from this study demonstrate that zzso with zzso zzso can be used to zzso fingerprint and assess genetic diversity in specific zzso of natural virus communities and that closely related viruses occur in distant geographic zzso zzso is a powerful tool for genetically zzso natural virus communities and may be used to examine how specific components of virus communities respond to experimental zzso
