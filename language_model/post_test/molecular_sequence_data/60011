zzso and zzso melting studies of 28 DNA zzso were zzso These zzso form by zzso folding of 16 base zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso design dictated that the hairpin structures have a six base pair duplex linked by a four base loop and that the first five base pairs in the stem are the same in every zzso Only loop sequence and identity of the duplex base pair closing the loop vary for the set of zzso For these DNA samples, melting studies were carried out to investigate effects of the variables on hairpin zzso zzso of the 28 zzso was zzso from their zzso melting transitions in zzso 115 zzso zzso zzso monitored by ultraviolet zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso zzso revealed the melting temperatures of these molecules range from zzso to zzso degrees C and are concentration independent over strand zzso of zzso to 260 zzso thus, as expected for zzso the melting transitions are apparently zzso Model independent zzso transition zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined from zzso zzso Model dependent transition zzso zzso zzso and zzso were estimated from a zzso zzso zzso analysis of optical melting zzso zzso of these studies reveal a significant sequence dependence to DNA hairpin zzso zzso parameters evaluated by either procedure reveal the transition zzso zzso zzso can differ by as much as 20 zzso depending on zzso Similarly, values of the transition zzso zzso zzso can differ by as much as 60 zzso zzso for different zzso zzso in free energies zzso zzso are as large as 4 zzso for zzso with different zzso Comparisons between the model independent zzso values and the zzso parameters evaluated assuming a two-state model reveal that 10 of the 28 zzso display zzso melting zzso The database of zzso melting free energies obtained for the zzso was employed to extract a set of zzso zzso sequence dependent loop parameters that were able to reproduce the input data within error (with only two zzso Surprisingly, this suggests that the zzso stability of the DNA zzso can in large part be reasonably represented in terms of sums of appropriate zzso loop sequence zzso
