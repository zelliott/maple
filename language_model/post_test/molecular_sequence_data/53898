The zzso apparatus plays a pivotal role in dividing cells to ensure each daughter cell receives a full set of zzso and complement of zzso during zzso A human zzso of the zzso warts tumor zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a dynamic component of the zzso zzso We have identified an interaction of zzso with zzso a regulator of zzso filament zzso zzso is a component of focal zzso however, during zzso a fraction of zzso zzso becomes associated with zzso on the zzso zzso We found that zzso is zzso specifically during zzso most likely by zzso zzso and that the zzso regulates association with zzso Furthermore, zzso of truncated zzso zzso including the zzso portion, zzso with zzso of zzso to zzso apparatus, and the duration of zzso of these injected cells was significantly longer than that of control zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso play a crucial role in controlling zzso progression by forming a regulatory complex on zzso zzso
