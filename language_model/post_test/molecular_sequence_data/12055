zzso is a resident protein of the zzso zzso zzso that associates with nascent protein zzso Among the newly zzso integral membrane proteins known to bind to zzso is zzso chain zzso and zzso release from zzso zzso with proper assembly with major zzso complex zzso class II zzso Although zzso association with several membrane zzso depends on interactions involving zzso zzso we previously reported that a zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso lacking both zzso sites was highly effective in zzso with zzso class II zzso and zzso these zzso through the zzso zzso This could indicate that zzso despite binding to both zzso and class II, is not necessary for the proper interaction of these zzso or that in contrast to most membrane zzso the zzso zzso of zzso are not critical to its interaction with this zzso To examine this issue, we have directly explored the binding of zzso to both zzso zzso zzso lacking the typical sites of zzso or zzso produced in cells treated with zzso to prevent zzso zzso These experiments revealed that either method of eliminating zzso carbohydrates on zzso also inhibited association with zzso A zzso truncated form of zzso zzso that still has zzso carbohydrates showed a decreased affinity for zzso compared with intact zzso however, indicating that zzso binding is not determined solely by the sugar zzso All forms of zzso lacking zzso zzso and showing defective association with zzso also had enhanced rates of zzso zzso Despite this effect on degradation rate, zzso treatment did not inhibit the association of class II with zzso zzso These data support the view that zzso is not an absolute requirement for the proper assembly of class zzso zzso but rather acts primarily to retain zzso in the zzso and to inhibit its zzso These two properties of zzso interaction may help ensure that sufficient intact zzso is available for efficient zzso of the binding sites of newly zzso class II zzso while limiting the ability of excess free zzso to alter the transport properties of the early zzso zzso
