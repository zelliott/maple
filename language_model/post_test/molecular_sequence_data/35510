zzso the transmission history of infectious diseases in the absence of medical or zzso records often relies on the evolutionary analysis of pathogen genetic zzso The precision of evolutionary estimates of epidemic history can be increased by the inclusion of sequences derived from zzso samples that are genetically distinct from contemporary zzso Historical sequences are especially valuable for viral pathogens that circulated for many years before being formally identified, including zzso and the zzso C virus zzso However, surprisingly few zzso zzso sampled before discovery of the virus in 1989 are currently zzso Here, we report and zzso two zzso zzso sequences obtained from infected individuals in 1953, which represent the oldest genetic evidence of zzso zzso The zzso genetic diversity between the two sequences indicates a substantial period of zzso transmission prior to the 1950s, and their inclusion in evolutionary analyses provides new estimates of the common zzso of zzso in the zzso To explore and validate the evolutionary information provided by these zzso we used a new zzso molecular clock method to estimate the date of sampling of the zzso zzso plus the dates of four more contemporary reference zzso Despite the short fragments available, we conclude that the zzso sequences are consistent with a proposed sampling date of 1953, although statistical uncertainty is zzso Our zzso analyses suggest that the bias and low statistical power observed here likely arise from a combination of high evolutionary rate zzso and an zzso zzso zzso We expect that attempts to date other historical viruses under similar circumstances will meet similar zzso
