zzso an abundant cell surface zzso binds to a diverse set of zzso which are involved in a variety of important cellular zzso zzso analysis has been carried out on all the proteins containing zzso bound zzso as a zzso in the zzso Data Bank, to identify common recognition zzso zzso highly specific to zzso belonging to the super family of bulb zzso are found to contain a consensus sequence motif zzso which has been identified to be essential for zzso zzso Analysis of this motif in the crystal structures of bulb zzso has led to the understanding of the contribution of individual zzso in zzso zzso zzso with other zzso binding zzso reveals common hydrogen bonding patterns in all of them, despite differences in zzso overall fold and the zzso at the binding sites of individual zzso A database analysis also suggests that although the zzso of the zzso as at the binding site in bulb zzso can generate zzso binding capability in a few other zzso sequence and disposition of not only the zzso in the zzso but also the zzso in the neighborhood play a crucial role in allowing that property to be zzso
