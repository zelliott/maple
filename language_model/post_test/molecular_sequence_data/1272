zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso requires iron for zzso One mechanism by which it acquires iron is the zzso of zzso and several zzso zzso genes have been identified in zzso zzso These include three distinct outer membrane zzso two zzso systems, and an apparent ABC zzso to transfer zzso across the inner zzso However, little is known about the fate of the zzso after it enters the zzso In this report we show that a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso reading frame zzso zzso is zzso with two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso A zzso zzso grew poorly when zzso was provided as the sole source of iron, and the poor growth was likely due to the failure to use zzso efficiently as a source of iron, rather than to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso fail to use zzso as an iron zzso When the zzso genes were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso growth on zzso was zzso and zzso was required for this zzso zzso characterization indicated that zzso binds zzso with high zzso however, no zzso zzso activity was detected for this zzso zzso may act as a zzso storage zzso and it may also function as a shuttle protein that increases the efficiency of zzso trafficking from the membrane to zzso zzso
