Analysis of gene expression and its zzso regulation requires a reliable access to target zzso However, zzso zzso from zzso tissue are limited because only average data are zzso and zzso expression may not be zzso Here, we describe a new method that combines the microscopic selection of zzso clusters or a few zzso cell profiles from complex zzso by zzso cell picking with a simplified and highly efficient protocol for zzso zzso For positive control and zzso reference, a reliable zzso gene is zzso For this purpose, we designed zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to many commonly used zzso primer pairs that zzso processed zzso this sequence allowed detection of a zzso rat zzso zzso thus eliminating the need for a zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistently expressed in all complex zzso investigated and in 21 specific cell types harvested by zzso cell zzso zzso is suggested as a reliable new rat zzso zzso particularly suitable for analysis of zzso samples such as those obtained by zzso cell picking in complex zzso
