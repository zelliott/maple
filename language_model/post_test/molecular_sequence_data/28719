Genome segments 1 and 2 of human group C zzso zzso strain were zzso and their zzso coding properties zzso This work completed the zzso sequence of a human group C zzso zzso zzso and allowed the full zzso coding assignment of the 11 segments of zzso Gene 1 is zzso zzso in size and contains a single zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids in length with a predicted molecular mass of 125 zzso zzso of the translated sequence with zzso published zzso group A, B and C zzso sequences showed zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso The sequence contains zzso zzso acid motifs including the classic zzso zzso zzso motif zzso indicating that segment 1 encodes the group C zzso zzso zzso Gene 2 is zzso zzso in size and contains a single zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids in length with a calculated molecular mass of 102 zzso Database searches showed highest zzso with zzso the main structural component of the zzso from group A zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human group C and A zzso zzso proteins revealed several characteristics common to zzso acid binding zzso However, these features were not shared with group B zzso zzso
