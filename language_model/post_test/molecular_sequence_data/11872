zzso of the insulin zzso gene can compromise the ability of the zzso to mediate insulin zzso A zzso point zzso that results in the substitution of zzso for zzso 252 in the insulin zzso zzso has now been identified by zzso chain reaction and single stranded zzso zzso analysis in a zzso Japanese woman with type A syndrome and severe insulin zzso The zzso zzso parents zzso mother and normal zzso and her sister (impaired zzso zzso each of whom showed an exaggerated insulin response to an oral zzso load, were zzso for this zzso Her brother showed a normal insulin response and lacked the zzso as did 50 healthy Japanese control zzso The chronic zzso administration of zzso growth factor I zzso improved the patient's zzso and corrected certain zzso abnormalities over a zzso period, even though the binding of zzso zzso to her cultured zzso was decreased by zzso relative to that to cells from healthy zzso Studies of the binding of zzso insulin to the zzso cultured zzso to zzso cells zzso with complementary DNA zzso the zzso insulin zzso and to partially zzso zzso receptors revealed that the zzso zzso decreased both cell surface expression and the affinity for insulin for the zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the type A insulin resistance of the zzso whereas in the zzso state, the zzso results in mild insulin resistance indistinguishable from that observed in zzso diabetes zzso
