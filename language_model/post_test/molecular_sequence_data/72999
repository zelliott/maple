Apple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones zzso two distinct but very similar zzso zzso gene class 1 zzso zzso and zzso were isolated using a zzso amplified with zzso zzso as a zzso A zzso corresponding to the zzso region of zzso was used to isolate a zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso gene class zzso These zzso were used to detect corresponding gene copies in apple zzso DNA zzso together with other putative members of an apple zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso were also used to detect corresponding zzso zzso levels in various zzso of an apple zzso zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso genes appeared to be absent from leaves or floral zzso but they accumulate in tissue samples from zzso parts of the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso accumulate at zzso levels in a wider range of both zzso and zzso zzso
