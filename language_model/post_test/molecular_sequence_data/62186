The zzso protein 2 zzso zzso factors are essential proteins for zzso repression of the zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso In the present study, we have examined the possible zzso regulation of zzso genes themselves in zzso zzso As early as 1 h after zzso treatment, zzso zzso was markedly increased, whereas zzso was zzso but with slower zzso and zzso was not affected at zzso zzso of zzso zzso these zzso zzso of the protein levels corresponded to changes in the transcript levels, thus suggesting that in zzso cells, an inversion of the balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso region zzso of the human zzso gene contains one consensus and one zzso zzso element zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso promoter and the zzso were zzso by zzso in transient zzso zzso zzso of the most zzso (but not of the zzso zzso from reporter zzso zzso the zzso response, although both zzso segments were zzso in zzso protection zzso In zzso binding zzso demonstrated the ability of zzso zzso alpha zzso to bind to this site, and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene showed that zzso occupies this region in response to zzso We conclude that zzso is a primary zzso gene and suggest that zzso proteins may mediate some zzso zzso
