The zzso pathway, a key regulator of the critical zzso to S phase transition of the cell cycle, is universally disrupted in human zzso However, the precise function of the different members of this zzso and their functional interplay are still not well zzso 

We have shown here that the tumor zzso zzso protein positively controls the expression of zzso D1 and zzso in both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the corresponding genes through negative regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso indicated that zzso zzso binds to the zzso D1 and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased the expression levels of these zzso while concurrent zzso of zzso and zzso using specific zzso restored normal expression of both zzso and zzso Besides, we have shown the presence of functional zzso elements in the zzso zzso which contributed to zzso regulation of zzso zzso events in zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso analysis revealed the presence of a large number of genes zzso expressed in a zzso zzso manner, and several of these genes are also members of the zzso and zzso zzso We also present evidence that zzso mediates zzso regulation of several zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso induction of spontaneous as well as zzso zzso 

These findings show that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is also a zzso of zzso and zzso through controlling the expression of two major zzso regulators, zzso and zzso
