zzso is an accessory protein of zzso receptors that enhances surface expression and also affects the zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso necessary for either of these two processes have not yet been zzso Here, we used zzso imaging and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to study surface expression and zzso zzso zzso trafficking was sensitive to the nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso after zzso 15 of the truncated zzso tail of zzso zzso zzso trafficking of the zzso but not its zzso of zzso zzso This construct also failed to permit zzso resonance energy transfer zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors demonstrated a specific interaction between these zzso both in the zzso and the plasma zzso Rather than zzso a specific binding site, the zzso C zzso may restrict access to one or more zzso retention zzso Although zzso of the C zzso zzso zzso trafficking to the plasma zzso the effects of zzso on the zzso properties of zzso receptors zzso zzso of zzso remained zzso These data provide strong evidence that the zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso of gating and trafficking are zzso
