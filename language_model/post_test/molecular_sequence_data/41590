zzso zzso are in high demand for the production of luxury fashion zzso However, their zzso to disease zzso substantial losses and it is hoped to be able to genetically select these animals for disease zzso So far, this has only been enabled by zzso zzso zzso the major zzso complex zzso could provide insight into the ability of an individual to respond to pathogens acting as a selective pressure on the zzso Here, we assessed genetic diversity and a role of selection in shaping the diversity of zzso class I zzso 3 among 42 saltwater zzso from nine river zzso in the Northern zzso zzso We generated 640 sequences using cloning and sequencing methods and identified 43 zzso zzso among zzso zzso analyses clustered these zzso into two major zzso which may suggest two gene zzso We found the number of zzso within an individual varying between one and seven, indicating that there are at least four gene zzso in this zzso zzso detection analyses revealed an elevated ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso zzso per zzso suggesting balancing zzso zzso differentiation analyses revealed that the zzso did not show structuring among the river zzso and there were some shared zzso among zzso This may be a result of possible gene flow and/or similar selection pressures among zzso These findings provide background knowledge to identify potential zzso zzso which could be used for selecting genetically variable individuals for future disease zzso All zzso class I zzso 3 sequences reported in this paper were submitted to the zzso database with following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
