and zzso Although zzso a novel growth hormone releasing zzso zzso mainly in the gastric zzso is reported not only to accelerate food passage and gastrointestinal zzso but also to affect appetite and weight control, regulation of gastric zzso zzso under the conditions of gastric zzso zzso infection is zzso The present study was designed to investigate plasma and gastric zzso levels in Mongolian zzso with H zzso zzso of the gastric zzso 

zzso orally zzso with H zzso were examined after zzso To examine zzso zzso expression in the gastric zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was isolated and a quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction system was zzso 

In zzso showing H zzso zzso zzso zzso group), expression of zzso zzso and total zzso levels were significantly decreased 17 and 23 weeks later zzso Although the number of zzso zzso cells decreased as the stomach weight increased, the gastric contents of total and active zzso in this group were the same as those in zzso zzso zzso activity showed a positive correlation with plasma zzso zzso On the other hand, at 17 weeks, plasma zzso levels were significantly increased in the H zzso group zzso suggesting a zzso increase in zzso of the zzso at this time zzso 

The present experimental study demonstrated that gastric and plasma zzso dynamics are altered in response to H zzso zzso
