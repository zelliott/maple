To delineate zzso regulatory elements of the human zzso zzso several zzso promoter zzso zzso reporter gene zzso were zzso The spectrum of zzso spanning from zzso to zzso was shown to contain several zzso and zzso binding sites, as well as putative zzso zzso and zzso responsive zzso zzso of promoter activity in transient zzso of rat zzso smooth muscle cells, human skin zzso zzso human zzso cells, zzso cells, or mouse zzso cells allowed zzso of several functional zzso within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The results suggest that the basic promoter element resides within the region zzso to zzso and the zzso DNA contains several functional regulatory zzso Also, the regulatory function of three putative zzso binding sites was demonstrated by zzso with a zzso devoid of such zzso These findings attest to the complexity of zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
