zzso maturation and egg zzso in both zzso and zzso are marked by orchestrated zzso zzso of zzso zzso known as cortical zzso It is thought that such zzso of cellular content is critical for zzso cell division during early development, but the mechanism and regulation of the process is poorly zzso Here we report the zzso zzso and zzso cloning of a zzso zzso from zzso of a freshwater fish species zzso carp zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein has been demonstrated to have zzso activity and to be a zzso zzso zzso by zzso activity zzso zzso revealed that the zzso is associated with cortical zzso gradually zzso to the cell surface during zzso zzso and discharged to the egg envelope upon zzso Interestingly, the zzso becomes zzso on zzso zzso upon induction of zzso by zzso and returns to its original state after zzso stage of embryonic development, suggesting that this zzso modification may represent a critical molecular switch for early embryonic zzso
