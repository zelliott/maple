The zzso coli open reading frame zzso encodes a member of a large bacterial protein family of unknown biological zzso The sequences within this family are remotely related to the sequence of zzso zzso zzso an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A gene zzso zzso in zzso coli is already zzso The zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso reveals an overall fold similar to that of zzso zzso zzso a nitrogen metabolism zzso that zzso zzso and zzso to yield zzso zzso and zzso perform related chemical reactions and require zzso and zzso for their zzso The zzso binding of zzso to zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso employing zzso zzso zzso and yielding a zzso constant of 3 zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso contains a zzso that zzso to the binding sites of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Many of the zzso zzso that coordinate the metal zzso and interact with zzso acid and the zzso and zzso groups of zzso are also present in zzso zzso zzso acids that have been associated with zzso binding have no obvious counterparts in zzso consistent with a zzso specificity that is different from that of zzso zzso activity between zzso acid and each of the zzso zzso acid zzso was tested on high performance liquid zzso zzso by following the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was observed only with zzso A zzso zzso acid zzso coupled zzso was used to rule out zzso activity and to determine that zzso exhibits zzso zzso The zzso rate was found to be approximately zzso slower than that reported for authentic zzso
