zzso zzso was identified as a zzso that zzso zzso production and enhances zzso cell zzso In this paper, we report upon the zzso and characterization of human zzso zzso zzso We selected the Hodgkin's disease cell line, zzso as the most strongly zzso cell line based on the results of binding zzso This binding was inhibited by zzso but not by zzso The zzso constant zzso of zzso binding to zzso cells was about zzso zzso with 18,000 binding zzso After zzso mice with zzso cells and zzso a single zzso zzso zzso against zzso was obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso acid zzso zzso cells by wheat germ zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The internal zzso acid sequences of zzso all matched those of human zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso of which was unknown to zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding properties on the cells and the capacity for signal zzso From these results, we conclude that a functional zzso zzso component is zzso
