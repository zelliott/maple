Clinical and zzso studies suggest that there is a differential zzso of different zzso of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso was used to explore the relationship between different zzso The zzso of all studied zzso were highly zzso zzso with respect to both sequence and gene zzso zzso sequences were substantially more zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in all tested zzso and their sequences and gene order were zzso The majority of linear plasmids showed variation both in terms of presence among different zzso and in terms of sequence and gene zzso The data strongly imply that all zzso zzso clinical zzso contain linear plasmids related to each other, but the structure of these zzso may vary substantially from isolate to zzso These zzso include deletions and presumed zzso that are likely to result in unique zzso elements in many zzso There is a strong correlation between complete zzso zzso profiles and other typing methods, which, in turn, also correlate to differences in zzso Because there is substantially less variation in the zzso and circular zzso portions of the zzso the major differences in open reading frame content and zzso diversity among zzso are linear zzso zzso
