Small zzso associate with members of the zzso family to function in gene regulation, zzso control, and creation of silent zzso zzso In this partnership, small zzso act as guides for the bound zzso and other associated zzso zzso base pairing of small zzso to target zzso acid molecules allow specificity for the small zzso zzso One key activity of some zzso protein family members is their small zzso zzso activity called zzso zzso Here we describe a protocol that can be used to probe zzso activity in zzso zzso complexes isolated from mouse zzso
