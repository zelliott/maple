zzso C virus zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a zzso of unknown function, is believed to be a component of a zzso viral replication zzso The zzso for membrane association of zzso however, have not been zzso By double label zzso zzso zzso was found to be associated with the zzso zzso zzso or an zzso modified compartment both when expressed alone or in the context of the entire zzso zzso zzso deletion and green fluorescent protein fusion analyses allowed us to map the membrane anchor to the zzso 30 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso association occurred by a zzso mechanism and resulted in properties of an integral membrane zzso zzso zzso structural studies of a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso membrane anchor, designated zzso demonstrated the presence of an zzso zzso that was found to be highly zzso among 280 zzso zzso of various zzso The zzso properties of this zzso zzso together with the nature and location of its zzso acids suggest a mechanism of membrane zzso via the zzso zzso side, yielding a zzso parallel to the zzso zzso in the zzso leaflet of the zzso zzso These findings have important implications for the structural and functional organization of the zzso replication complex and may define novel targets for zzso zzso
