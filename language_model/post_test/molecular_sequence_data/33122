zzso zzso a novel class of zzso electron transport proteins residing in a large variety of zzso cells, have a number of common structural features including six zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by a zzso expression system using zzso zzso zzso cells could zzso the zzso radical as a zzso electron zzso We found further that a concerted zzso transfer mechanism might be operative in zzso zzso zzso zzso as well upon the electron acceptance from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in a zzso loop was found to have a very important zzso for the binding of zzso and the succeeding electron transfer via zzso interactions based on the analyses of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further, unusual behavior of the zzso zzso in pulse zzso experiments indicated that zzso might also be responsible for the zzso electron transfer to the zzso zzso On the other hand, pulse zzso experiments on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso in the putative zzso radical binding site showed that their electron transfer activities to the zzso radical were very similar to those of the zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso do not have major roles for the zzso events on the zzso zzso
