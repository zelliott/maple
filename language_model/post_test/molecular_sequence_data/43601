zzso zzso from winter pea seeds zzso zzso have been zzso and shown to consist of six zzso zzso zzso I, II, III, zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso acid zzso molecular mass, and zzso zzso the six zzso are closely related to one another and belong to the zzso family of zzso To define the relations among them, molecular mass and zzso acid composition of peptides obtained from zzso with zzso were zzso The sequence and the zzso mechanism of the zzso formation have been partially resolved for four major zzso Two zzso forms zzso zzso zzso in pea seeds are due to expression of two distinct zzso zzso zzso has four zzso acid replacements when its sequence is compared with the sequence of zzso zzso Two others zzso I, zzso result from zzso zzso zzso of nine zzso zzso of forms zzso zzso and zzso zzso
