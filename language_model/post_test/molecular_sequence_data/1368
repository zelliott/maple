The crystal structure of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso of zzso compounds, has been solved by multiple wavelength anomalous zzso using the weak anomalous signal of the two zzso irons (1 zzso zzso zzso and refined at a zzso A resolution zzso zzso R factor zzso The analysis of the structure and its comparison with the structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso highlight significant differences between these zzso The general zzso of the present zzso comprises two zzso zzso (one for each zzso related by a zzso zzso axis and separated by a common zzso zzso motif consisting of five zzso zzso from each zzso zzso the zzso tail is shortened significantly with respect to the known zzso zzso The presence of two zzso binding in a zzso tunnel along the zzso axis is shown here to be a common feature for this class of zzso The active site cavity presents several zzso with respect to the known zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is bound to the side chains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso bound to the metal center, reveals details on a novel mode of binding of zzso zzso and a distinctive hydrogen bond network with the surrounding zzso Among the zzso acid zzso expected to interact with zzso several are different from the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition, regions of largely zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso show different shapes resulting from several substantial backbone and side chain zzso The present structure is the first of zzso zzso that specifically catalyze the zzso of zzso key zzso in the zzso zzso of toxic zzso
