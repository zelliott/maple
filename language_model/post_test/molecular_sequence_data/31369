A chick gene zzso to the zzso zzso gene zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso of additional sequence identity outside of the zzso reveal a close relationship to the mouse gene zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso and zzso zzso transcripts are both present at high levels during early stages of chick and mouse development, with a subsequent decline in abundance to very low levels by the time limb zzso begins to zzso In zzso zzso analysis of chick zzso shows intense expression of zzso zzso by zzso and Hamilton stage 4 zzso zzso zzso and by stage 6 zzso neural zzso with expression decreasing shortly zzso The pattern of zzso zzso expression in these early zzso divides the zzso into an anterior and a zzso zzso At stage 6, considerable signal is observed in the zzso two thirds of the zzso while none is detected in the anterior third which is zzso to become the zzso This pattern is purely regional in nature, and does not follow boundaries defined by known tissue zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to mouse zzso of day zzso or zzso indicate that the zzso zzso transcript has a zzso and spatial distribution very similar to that of zzso in the chick zzso
