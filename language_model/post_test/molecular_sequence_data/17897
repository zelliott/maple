zzso leukemia virus zzso like its closest relatives human zzso leukemia zzso and II, contain a zzso zzso between the zzso gene and the 3' long terminal repeat in its zzso A zzso zzso prepared against a synthetic zzso whose sequence was deduced from highly zzso region of zzso gene of zzso was used to detect the presence of zzso gene product in chronically zzso infected zzso zzso By zzso zzso the zzso gene product was detected maximum after zzso zzso after synchronization in the nucleus of the cells which demonstrated the close interaction of it with viral DNA which is integrated with host cell zzso
