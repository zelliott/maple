The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial diversity associated with the sponge zzso zzso using a molecular strategy and zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

The bacterial diversity associated with South China Sea sponge zzso zzso was assessed using a zzso zzso clone library alongside restriction zzso length zzso and zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso bacterial community consisted of zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were isolated successfully using seawater medium with sponge zzso According to the zzso and zzso analysis based on about zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 of the representative 23 zzso closely matched the zzso zzso while the remaining 12 matched the zzso Twenty zzso have zzso zzso of which 15 are found to possess zzso zzso zzso 

The sponge zzso zzso bacterial community is very abundant including zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso is not zzso zzso seawater medium with sponge extracts is suitable for zzso zzso Most of the isolated zzso zzso zzso have a broad spectrum of zzso zzso 

This study revealed the diversity of the bacterial community and the isolated zzso with zzso zzso associated with sponge zzso zzso
