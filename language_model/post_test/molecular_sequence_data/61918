zzso virus zzso contain zzso sequence and structural elements that participate in viral zzso We previously identified a zzso zzso secondary structure at the upstream end of the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso of the zzso of the coronavirus mouse zzso virus zzso This element, beginning immediately downstream of the zzso gene stop zzso was shown to be essential for virus zzso Other investigators discovered an adjacent downstream zzso in the 3' zzso of the closely related bovine coronavirus zzso This zzso was also shown to be essential for zzso and it has a zzso counterpart in every group 1 and group 2 zzso In zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso are, in part, mutually zzso because of the overlap of the last segment of the zzso and stem 1 of the zzso This led us to zzso that they form a molecular switch, possibly regulating a transition occurring during viral zzso zzso We have now performed an extensive genetic analysis of the two components of this proposed zzso Our results define essential and zzso components of these structures and establish the limits to which essential parts of each element can be zzso prior to loss of zzso Most notably, we have confirmed the zzso of the two putative switch zzso Additionally, we have identified a zzso loop zzso zzso that appears to point to a genetic interaction between the zzso and a distant region of the zzso
