zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts its tumor zzso function by zzso the zzso regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso suppresses their activity and zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso also performs zzso functions by zzso other cellular protein zzso To define these zzso functions of zzso we used the zzso zzso tracking and zzso method to search for its potential zzso zzso in rat brain zzso Our search revealed zzso as a potential zzso zzso and zzso in zzso as the preferential zzso zzso Using peptides derived from zzso and zzso scanning zzso zzso library zzso we defined the optimal zzso zzso sequence recognized by the zzso active site to be zzso where zzso and zzso represent zzso zzso and any zzso zzso Besides zzso cellular proteins containing motifs resembling this sequence are potential zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso sequence bears little resemblance to the zzso tail sequence of zzso indicating that interactions between the zzso active site and the local zzso near the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso play only a minor role in governing specific zzso of zzso by zzso Our results imply that recognition of zzso by zzso is mainly governed by interactions between motifs located zzso from the active site of zzso and zzso zzso separate from the zzso regulatory zzso in zzso Thus, besides assisting in the identification of potential zzso zzso zzso our findings shed new light on how zzso recognizes zzso and other protein zzso
