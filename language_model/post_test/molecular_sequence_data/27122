zzso zzso zzso insert into the zzso of several zzso bacteria in a zzso zzso Here, we showed the application of zzso as single copy zzso integration zzso system for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso into the bacterial zzso was detected at a zzso attachment zzso site located downstream of zzso Furthermore, using a newly constructed zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the sequence between the zzso zzso target zzso sites, and a zzso counter selection marker, an unmarked zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso did not affect bacterial zzso on the tested zzso The zzso and zzso systems also work well in zzso zzso zzso zzso
