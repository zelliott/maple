We have investigated the role of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso the survival response of embryonic zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which normally survive in the presence of zzso zzso factor zzso but not zzso become zzso when zzso with an expression zzso containing zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso embryonic zzso zzso with the same construct does not result in the acquisition of zzso responsiveness by these zzso despite de zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso The failure of zzso to result in an zzso survival response in zzso zzso is not due to absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso and zzso zzso both express zzso zzso and zzso These findings not only provide the first direct experimental demonstration of zzso zzso a zzso response in an appropriate cell type, namely zzso survival of embryonic zzso but indicate that not all zzso are able to respond to a zzso signal zzso zzso
