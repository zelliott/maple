It has been 30 years since it was first proposed that the zzso zzso evolved through several rounds of zzso zzso zzso Despite rapid advances in zzso including sequencing of the complete zzso of several divergent species, this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously and is still a matter of zzso If zzso occurred during zzso evolution, there should be a network of zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we present an investigation of the major zzso complex zzso zzso regions, which we accomplished by characterizing the corresponding region in zzso by identifying nine anchor genes and sequencing both the anchor genes and the regions that flank them (a total of 400 zzso zzso analysis of 31 genes (including the anchor zzso in these regions shows that zzso occurred after the divergence of zzso and zzso but before the zzso zzso The distribution of human and zzso zzso in their respective zzso and the relationship between these zzso support the en bloc zzso zzso Our analysis represents the first step towards demonstrating that the human ancestral zzso has undergone zzso Moreover, reconstruction of the zzso region indicates that one of the duplicated regions retains the ancestral zzso
