Many zzso zzso zzso described in the literature produce changes in zzso sites zzso or in zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso aberrations can provide important insights into novel regulation zzso In this study, we evaluated the effect of patient variations in zzso type 1 zzso zzso 29 and its zzso surrounding area on its zzso zzso Only two of all nonsense, zzso synonymous and zzso variations analyzed in this study clearly altered zzso 29 zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso zzso had the strongest effect, resulting in total zzso zzso This finding prompted us to evaluate the zzso 29 zzso in relation to its ability to bind zzso zzso This was performed by direct analysis of the ability of zzso to bind to zzso and zzso donor sites, by engineering an in zzso zzso system to directly evaluate the functional importance of zzso zzso base pairing with the zzso 29 donor site, and by zzso of zzso zzso zzso molecules to try to rescue zzso 29 inclusion in zzso The results revealed a low dependency on the presence of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso 29 donor site definition may depend on alternative mechanisms of zzso zzso
