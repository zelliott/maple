zzso infected with zzso zzso express zzso zzso structures that allow the infected cells to cling to the zzso zzso of characteristic host zzso At present, the mechanism of zzso is not fully zzso While zzso zzso have been shown to specifically bind to the zzso zzso zzso adherence to suitable target cells can also be blocked by zzso zzso zzso which recognizes a surface zzso expressed by zzso cells and zzso In apparent reconciliation of these findings, it has been reported that the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso Here we report that expression of a zzso zzso clone in zzso cells supports zzso of zzso zzso but does not support increased binding of zzso human zzso
