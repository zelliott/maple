Low levels of expression in zzso coli are often observed when using wild type zzso The addition of an zzso zzso to these same proteins dramatically improves the level of zzso We therefore concluded that zzso regulation and in particular zzso regulation are probably influenced by the presence of the zzso The zzso program was used to analyze the zzso of the zzso zzso and more precisely the area encompassing the zzso region and the initiation zzso zzso We observed that hairpin zzso can be formed and that the stability of these zzso zzso with the level of protein expression in zzso zzso Our recently developed cloning technology by zzso zzso integration allows us to easily and rapidly introduce zzso anywhere within a zzso In our studies, we used this technology to destabilize the predicted hairpin by introducing silent zzso within the first 72 zzso of the coding zzso As a result of the decreased stability of the zzso zzso we could significantly increase the level of expression of wild type proteins and without having to rely on the use of tags in zzso zzso In addition, our studies allow us to predict whether or not a protein will be expressed without additional engineering of its zzso zzso
