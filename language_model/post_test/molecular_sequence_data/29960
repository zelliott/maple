The zzso zzso zzso promoter is positively controlled by the zzso protein and requires a form of zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso Occupancy of the zzso zzso zzso promoter by zzso was examined using in zzso zzso zzso zzso Three binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3) located at zzso zzso and zzso were identified which conform to the zzso consensus sequence zzso An additional zzso binding site was identified at position zzso The zzso located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso overlap and do not appear to bind zzso as independent zzso They may represent a zzso binding site interacting with two zzso zzso zzso is located at zzso and zzso a binding site for integration host factor zzso and is not normally highly occupied by zzso In the absence of zzso zzso showed increased occupancy by zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the three zzso indicates zzso zzso and zzso can compete for binding and that this competition influences the level of expression from the zzso promoter zzso that zzso is a principle sequence of the zzso zzso region required for zzso and zzso that none of the zzso binding sites interacts with zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso open complex formation at the zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso expression from the zzso and zzso promoters in zzso coli, and for the establishment of a zzso zzso in zzso coli from the zzso zzso zzso
