In the zzso zzso zzso positioning of the zzso zzso requires both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a novel cortical protein that is required for the correct position of the zzso zzso and the orientation of the zzso zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso to a single spot at the tip of the growing bud and the mating zzso However, the cortical zzso of zzso does not require zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interacts with other proteins at the zzso To investigate zzso cortical zzso we treated cells with the zzso drug, zzso In both zzso and zzso cells, zzso cortical zzso was completely dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso was also altered by zzso in four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso required for normal polarization and zzso zzso functions and, of these, zzso affected zzso zzso most zzso Like zzso zzso zzso exhibited nuclear positioning defects during zzso and in zzso Furthermore, like zzso the zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis placed zzso in the zzso zzso for nuclear zzso However, analysis of zzso zzso double zzso suggested that zzso retained some function in zzso zzso zzso Unlike the polarization zzso zzso zzso had a normal zzso and zzso zzso in the correct bipolar zzso Furthermore, zzso localized normally in zzso We conclude that zzso function is specific for zzso zzso orientation and that zzso role in nuclear positioning is to coordinate the interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso
