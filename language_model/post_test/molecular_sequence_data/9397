zzso zzso also known as zzso triggers a fatal septic zzso therefore, fast and accurate detection of zzso from a complex milieu is of primary zzso Several zzso affinity zzso have been reported so far but few of them have proved their efficacy in developing zzso sensors capable of selectively detecting zzso from crude biological zzso In this study, we identified 10 different zzso DNA zzso showing specific affinity to zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso range using a zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence and secondary structure analysis of the zzso binding zzso an zzso exhibiting the highest affinity to zzso zzso zzso was selected to construct an zzso zzso on a gold zzso The developed zzso zzso showed excellent sensitivity and specificity in the linear detection range from zzso to 1 zzso of zzso with significantly reduced detection time compared with the traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
