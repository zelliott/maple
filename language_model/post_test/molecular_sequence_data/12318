zzso are zzso bacteria which multiply only inside host cells and need zzso either as reservoirs or as zzso Using the zzso chain reaction and an automated laser fluorescent DNA zzso we amplified and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of all available bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso zzso remained close to the other bacteria of the zzso zzso using this technique, contrary to previous conclusions based on the study of the zzso protein zzso We found that zzso zzso was not included in the zzso group, as is currently zzso but was grouped with the zzso of the spotted fever group zzso All the zzso zzso tested were grouped in the same cluster zzso zzso Indian tick zzso zzso zzso fever zzso Israeli tick zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thai tick zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two recent zzso zzso and Bar 29, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The recently described zzso zzso the agent of the Californian zzso zzso and AB zzso a zzso associated with male killing in the zzso zzso were found in this zzso The sequences of zzso zzso Moroccan zzso tick zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso All the zzso had a unique zzso with bacteria also isolated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eventually zzso for zzso and implicated in zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that a unique zzso started a stable association with zzso ancestors and generated the observed diversity of the currently isolated members of the zzso
