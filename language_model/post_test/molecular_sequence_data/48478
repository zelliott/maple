The zzso zzso of the inner membrane of zzso zzso zzso is the main entry gate for proteins of the zzso and the inner zzso zzso the core component of zzso complex, forms the import pore across the inner zzso However, the interaction between zzso peptides and zzso remains zzso zzso we investigated the interaction of zzso peptides with the zzso space domain of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed that the interaction between zzso and zzso peptides is mainly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding experiments showed that zzso peptides induce a more compact zzso of zzso zzso pull-down experiments and zzso zzso indicated that there is no interaction between zzso and zzso
