During leaf development, the formation of zzso and zzso axes is central to leaf zzso To investigate the genetic basis of zzso and zzso in the zzso we screened for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with defects in leaf zzso We describe here the zzso analysis of three zzso zzso that we have zzso These zzso show varying degrees of zzso including zzso broad leaf zzso and zzso floral zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that these zzso are zzso of the previously isolated zzso zzso zzso ( zzso In addition to the leaf zzso described zzso these zzso display other zzso that were not zzso These include: zzso some zzso leaves with zzso growth underneath the leaf zzso zzso leaf vein branching in the zzso and zzso a leaf zzso with an zzso similar to that on the zzso The zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso ( zzso gene is involved in the control of cell differentiation in zzso As the first step in determining a molecular function for zzso we have identified the zzso gene using zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein that is zzso to the zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso is expressed nearly zzso consistent with the zzso zzso zzso High levels of zzso expression were found in zzso with highly zzso cells, which further suggests a role in cell division and early cell zzso
