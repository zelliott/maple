The zzso software comprises protein sequence alignment tools based on strict statistical thresholds of similarity between protein zzso The method zzso the gap penalty zzso gaps being the result of the alignment and not a governing zzso of the zzso The reliable zzso regions outlined by zzso are particularly relevant for zzso zzso of protein structures, prediction of essential zzso for zzso zzso and zzso design for cloning zzso genes by zzso chain reaction zzso 

The method produces reliable results, as assessed by tests performed on protein families of known structures and of low sequence zzso A reliability score is zzso in relation to a threshold of similarity progressively raised to extend the aligned regions to their zzso zzso up to the significance limit of matching zzso The score obtained at each position is printed below the sequences and allows a zzso reading of each aligned zzso 

zzso may be submitted to a Web server at zzso zzso or sent by e-mail to zzso zzso available by just mailing zzso
