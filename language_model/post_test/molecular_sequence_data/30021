DNA fragments containing the sequence zzso have been used in zzso experiments to assess the effect of zzso which binds to zzso steps, on the structure of the central AT zzso zzso I normally cuts zzso much better than zzso in the presence of the drug this preference is retained but zzso at zzso is zzso Changes in zzso by zzso zzso have also been zzso zzso renders alternate zzso zzso to zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso structural changes in regions surrounding its binding site and that these can be zzso zzso over several turns of the DNA zzso
