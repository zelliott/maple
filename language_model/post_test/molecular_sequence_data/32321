Marine zzso zzso and marine zzso zzso are zzso dominant zzso in the open oceans and contributors to the global carbon zzso zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso Sea on zzso strain zzso zzso has been grown in zzso to high zzso in the laboratory and zzso and concentrated retaining zzso Genome sequencing and zzso of zzso revealed that the linear zzso is zzso zzso with a 237 zzso terminal direct zzso zzso open reading frames zzso were zzso Based on zzso organization and sequence similarity to known protein sequences within zzso zzso shares features with zzso zzso The presence of a putative zzso suggests access to a temperate life zzso zzso of 11 zzso to structural proteins found within the zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso Eight of these identified structural proteins exhibited zzso acid sequence similarity to enteric zzso zzso The remaining three zzso proteins did not resemble any known zzso sequences in zzso as of August zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso has a single zzso a novel zzso structure protruding from the opposing end of the zzso from the tail of the zzso The tail zzso displayed an apparent zzso rather than zzso zzso An 18 A resolution zzso reconstruction of the zzso revealed a zzso zzso but with an unusual pattern of surface zzso This zzso system should allow detailed investigation of the physiology and zzso of zzso propagation in marine zzso zzso
