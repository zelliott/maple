Analysis of a region of zzso DNA lying between zzso and zzso in the gene cluster for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso detected an zzso zzso zzso zzso acids similar in sequence to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso carrier protein zzso components of zzso A zzso Multiple sequence alignments of the deduced zzso protein with zzso A zzso from various sources located the BC and zzso components in the zzso and zzso regions, respectively, of the deduced zzso The organization and zzso acid sequence of the deduced zzso most closely resembled those in other zzso bacteria broadly classified as zzso zzso the zzso designated zzso severely reduced but did not eliminate zzso zzso The disruption had no effect on growth or zzso of the zzso zzso that the product of zzso is not essential for fatty acid zzso It is concluded that zzso supplies zzso A for zzso of the zzso intermediate that is eventually processed to form the zzso zzso zzso
