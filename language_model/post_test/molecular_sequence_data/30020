By screening a tomato zzso library with a tomato zzso zzso probe, we detected a zzso zzso locus whose coding region was determined by primer extension zzso zzso and direct zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso from tomato zzso zzso Tomato zzso zzso is 216 zzso long, contains all the four zzso highly zzso sequence blocks zzso A to zzso has at its zzso end a cap not zzso with zzso zzso and can be folded into a peculiar secondary structure with two zzso at its zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso gene was faithfully expressed in transgenic tobacco zzso In the zzso zzso region both zzso zzso zzso signals zzso zzso sequence and the upstream sequence element zzso were present, but were positioned closer to each other and also to the cap site in the zzso gene than in the genes for the plant zzso zzso studied so zzso The 3' zzso region of the tomato zzso gene lacked the consensus sequence of the putative termination signal established for the plant zzso zzso genes and contained a zzso tract zzso followed by four zzso repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso flanked by slightly altered forms zzso to zzso of zzso and most probably generated by zzso zzso Our results are in line with the conjecture that the zzso zzso the tomato zzso gene has different structural requirements for zzso activity than the zzso zzso plant zzso U2 and zzso zzso
