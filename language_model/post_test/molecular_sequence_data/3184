zzso multiple zzso gene zzso family members zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso zzso in humans as well as in zzso In the present study, we identified a novel zzso zzso protein with a type II zzso zzso and demonstrated its zzso zzso The truncated soluble form of this new zzso designated zzso transferred zzso zzso through an zzso not only to zzso zzso that represent growing HS chains zzso zzso II zzso but also to zzso a synthetic zzso for zzso zzso I that determines and zzso HS zzso The results suggest that zzso is the zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of the zzso zzso Based on the findings of the present study and those of a recent study where a fly zzso deficient in the zzso gene identical to zzso affected HS zzso zzso zzso it is suggested that zzso with the revealed zzso activities is critically involved in HS formation in zzso These results suggest the essential roles of zzso its human zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso if present, in the respective zzso
