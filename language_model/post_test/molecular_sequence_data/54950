Two outbreaks of zzso virus zzso (a zzso infection in zzso which occurred in zzso and zzso districts of Assam, a northeastern part of India, were zzso The disease was diagnosed by standard zzso and molecular zzso The entire zzso region of zzso gene of two zzso were cloned and zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso acid sequences showed that the zzso identified in these outbreaks were closely related to each other and both were closer to zzso zzso isolate from north zzso The present study revealed that the precise characterization of the zzso region zzso zzso might provide evidence for the genetic variation and movement of circulating zzso strains in zzso
