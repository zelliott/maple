zzso f 2, a 268 zzso acid major zzso from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated nine linear zzso binding zzso It is not known whether any of these linear zzso are also zzso zzso zzso we constructed deletion zzso of zzso f 2 devoid of one or more zzso and the zzso binding of these proteins with zzso from patients with zzso was compared with the full-length zzso f 2 expressed in zzso coli and zzso The zzso expressed protein reacted zzso with zzso but strongly with zzso of zzso zzso compared to zzso coli expressed zzso f zzso zzso zzso binding only was seen when the zzso or zzso was deleted, while depletion of both ends negated all zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso bound significantly to the zzso f 2 zzso zzso indicating that the major zzso zzso is located at the zzso end of zzso f zzso
