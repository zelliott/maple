zzso zzso in tobacco was modified by introducing two subsequent zzso activities targeted to different cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was used to zzso a transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso line expressing three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso and zzso as their main zzso The targeting sequences of these zzso indicate that they are probably localized in the zzso whereas the sequence information of the zzso zzso indicates targeting to the zzso zzso Despite the different location of the zzso the introduced zzso zzso proved to be functional in the transgenic plants as it zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso Some further modifications of the zzso were also zzso resulting in the additional zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
