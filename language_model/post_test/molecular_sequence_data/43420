zzso zzso clones of two strains of zzso encephalitis zzso virus, zzso European zzso zzso strain zzso and the closely related but more virulent strain zzso were zzso The zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso inserted into the bacterial zzso zzso under the control of zzso promoter zzso The zzso of zzso virus strain zzso was successfully zzso both as a full-length zzso and as two partial zzso In the case of strain zzso the zzso is represented by two zzso clones corresponding to the zzso and zzso halves of the zzso zzso infectious zzso can be produced from the full-length zzso clone or from the partial clones zzso in zzso to form full-length zzso templates prior to zzso zzso The biological properties of the zzso progeny zzso including zzso zzso were indistinguishable from the corresponding parent virus zzso Thus, the described infectious zzso clones represent a useful and reliable experimental system for the specific zzso of zzso zzso
