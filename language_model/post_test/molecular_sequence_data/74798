zzso zzso play important roles in zzso supply for sink tissue zzso In this study, a new zzso zzso gene zzso was identified from rice zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein shows typical features of sugar zzso and shares zzso identity with the rice zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with a K zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane in zzso zzso zzso analysis exhibited that zzso is expressed in all tested zzso In developing seeds, zzso expression level is high at the early and middle grain filling stages and gradually declines zzso Further analysis detected its expression in both maternal and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso is predominantly expressed in the vascular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue and zzso of young seeds, in zzso cells of source leaf zzso and in zzso and the zzso vein of zzso In addition, zzso expression is zzso by salt stress and zzso The zzso role of zzso for seed development and its roles in other sink and source zzso are zzso
