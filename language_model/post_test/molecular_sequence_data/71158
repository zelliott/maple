zzso zzso zzso zzso express human zzso zzso Lewis X and Lewis zzso The synthesis of Lewis Y involves the actions of alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of genes zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso from various zzso zzso zzso We constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated the loss of Lewis Y production in these zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene contains a zzso sequence zzso zzso and zzso zzso which provides a possibility of frequent shifting into and out of coding frame by a zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso gene displays two major zzso consisting of either a single full-length open reading frame zzso as in the strain zzso or truncated zzso (as in the strain zzso In zzso expression of zzso zzso genes demonstrated that both types of the gene have the potential to produce the full-length zzso The production of the full-length protein by the zzso zzso gene could be attributed to zzso zzso as a perfect translation zzso cassette resembling that of the zzso coli zzso gene is zzso zzso of the strain zzso revealed that its zzso gene has a zzso zzso at the DNA level, which cannot be compensated by translation zzso accounting for its Lewis Y off zzso In another strain, zzso the zzso gene is apparently turned off because of the loss of its zzso Based on these data, we proposed a model for the variable expression of Lewis Y by zzso zzso in which regulation at the level of replication zzso zzso zzso and translation of the zzso gene may all be zzso
