zzso are abundant proteins presumed to determine physical characteristics of the plant cell zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso from a tomato zzso zzso zzso root hair zzso zzso The deduced sequence of the zzso zzso defined a novel type of zzso proteins in zzso zzso of zzso distribution indicated that expression of the zzso gene was initiated in the root hair differentiation zone of the tomato zzso Cloning of the corresponding promoter and fusion to the zzso zzso reporter gene allowed detailed examination of zzso expression in transgenic tomato zzso Evidence is presented for a direct correlation between zzso expression and cellular tip zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso of the tomato zzso Both hair formation and zzso expression was zzso by the plant hormone zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso expression was performed in transgenic tomato, potato zzso zzso tobacco zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso dimension, zzso zzso was absent from the root cap and zzso cells at the root tip in all species zzso It was induced at the zzso end of the differentiation zone and remained high zzso to the zzso zzso In the zzso dimension, zzso expression was root hair specific in the zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso was exclusively zzso in the zzso root zzso expression correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso This is zzso evidence for a role of zzso in root hair tip growth zzso
