zzso a protein whose general zzso and zzso expression pattern in the zzso zzso is described in the companion paper, is expressed in zzso zzso in developing zzso Here, we show that these zzso comprise narrow zzso bands of zzso cells at the boundaries of limb zzso At most zzso expression of zzso precedes the first zzso signs of zzso The most zzso cells in a band zzso the boundary zzso zzso arise in a stereotyped order and, within a band, expression occurs in an ordered zzso zzso zzso has a molecular weight of about 97 zzso and appears to be zzso and peripherally associated with the inner leaflet of the cell zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso two overlapping zzso clones zzso this protein were isolated from an embryonic zzso zzso expression zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences indicate that the zzso protein does not contain either a signal sequence or a zzso zzso By sequence comparison, zzso appears to be a zzso one of a family of zzso that have protein zzso zzso Its expression pattern within the limb and the zzso is associated with areas undergoing zzso zzso movements, or rapid cell zzso It may stabilize cells under mechanical stress or participate in some other way in these zzso zzso
