zzso in DNA repair have been linked to cognitive decline with age and neurodegenerative disease, yet the mechanisms that protect zzso from zzso stress remain largely zzso We sought to characterize the roles of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso response to DNA zzso breaks zzso We found that zzso was rapidly recruited to zzso in zzso zzso where it showed a synergistic relationship with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment to breaks was zzso zzso however, zzso also zzso zzso zzso and activity and stabilized zzso at zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso also bound the zzso class I zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso its zzso activity, which was necessary for zzso repair through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that mimic a zzso zzso state rendered zzso more susceptible to DNA damage, whereas pharmacological zzso zzso that promoted zzso zzso also reduced DNA damage in two mouse models of zzso We propose that zzso is an zzso zzso of the zzso response and that zzso zzso offers an important therapeutic avenue in zzso
