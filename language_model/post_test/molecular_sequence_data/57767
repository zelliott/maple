Human zzso virus zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso sequences in both cell lines and blood obtained directly from zzso patients were amplified by zzso chain reaction and zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and the individually labeled cells were analyzed by flow zzso After flow zzso analysis, zzso cell populations were zzso resolved into zzso and zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso showed that the cellular zzso was preserved and zzso zzso of amplified product DNA was zzso zzso of zzso probe was not zzso Analysis of zzso DNA and viral zzso zzso in cells in the blood of zzso patients showed that the zzso zzso persists in a large zzso of zzso infected zzso With the use of this technique it is now possible to detect zzso DNA or zzso zzso zzso rapidly and zzso in a minor zzso of cells in suspension at zzso resolution and to sort those cells for further zzso
