Five putative zzso zzso C zzso genes were identified in three species of zzso zzso Using zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso gene fragments zzso zzso acid sequences zzso to zzso of zzso and other organisms were zzso one sequence from zzso zzso one from zzso zzso and three from zzso zzso The molecular cloning and sequencing of a putative zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso showed that it zzso a zzso containing X and Y zzso the two zzso regions found in all known zzso The hypothetical gene product of zzso was of delta type in its primary structural zzso The identification of three zzso genes in zzso zzso shows that multiple zzso zzso also occur in microbial zzso
