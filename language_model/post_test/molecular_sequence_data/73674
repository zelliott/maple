A zzso zzso a novel protein has been previously isolated from two independent zzso melanoma cell cultures and zzso The protein from human melanoma cell lines and tumors is called melanoma zzso activity zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso and the protein from primary bovine zzso and zzso zzso is called zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the gene regulation and function of zzso the mouse gene locus was isolated and zzso zzso expression was determined by in zzso zzso to mouse zzso zzso was limited to zzso zzso and was initiated with the advent of zzso remaining abundant throughout zzso The mouse gene was isolated and zzso from a zzso library and zzso directly from an additional strain, zzso The mouse zzso gene is zzso zzso and consists of four zzso The promoter sequence of the gene contains many potential regulatory zzso including 8 basic zzso zzso zzso and an zzso domain, both motifs shown to be present in the zzso zzso of the type II zzso zzso Other potential zzso motifs include binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso and zzso The zzso called zzso was localized to the end of an arm of zzso 7 at the same site as the transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso 1) and the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 1) zzso Potential mouse zzso that mapped to the same region of zzso 7 were zzso Two of the potential zzso with skeletal zzso were zzso pudgy zzso and extra toes with spotting zzso however, no zzso were found in the coding zzso To determine whether zzso is associated with tumors of cartilage, zzso from a variety of zzso zzso and cell lines were zzso zzso was detected in a zzso zzso the zzso rat zzso and a zzso cell line derived from it, but not in other zzso or tumors of zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso protein localized in cartilage zzso These results show that the normal expression of zzso is limited to zzso however, zzso it is expressed both in melanoma and zzso The restricted expression of zzso may provide an opportunity to monitor cartilage zzso activity as well as the tumor activity of melanoma and zzso
