A zzso zzso zzso zzso marine bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from tropical seawater near zzso an island in the Federated States of zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso revealed a clear affiliation with the zzso zzso Based on zzso analysis, strain zzso showed the closest zzso relationship to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew in the presence of zzso sea zzso and the optimal salt concentration was zzso The temperature and pH zzso for growth were 35 zzso and pH zzso The major cellular fatty acids zzso of strain zzso were zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso and zzso and the only zzso zzso was zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso an unidentified zzso two unidentified zzso and two unidentified zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The combined zzso zzso and zzso data showed that strain zzso could be distinguished from the only member of the zzso zzso with a zzso published zzso Thus, strain zzso should be assigned to a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
