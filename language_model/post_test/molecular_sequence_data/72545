zzso selection and zzso zzso were performed on zzso mapping to a region 3 zzso zzso to zzso Analysis of resulting fragments indicated the presence of two zinc finger zzso and one of these was used to isolate a partial zzso zzso from a zzso zzso The second transcript contained additional sequence of the zzso end of the zzso extending the sequence to zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is a classical zzso zinc finger with 19 highly zzso zinc finger motifs at the zzso and a zzso associated box at the zzso of the zzso This gene encodes a zzso transcript that is highly expressed in zzso and expressed at a moderate to low level in all other zzso zzso This zinc finger gene maps to a region approximately 200 zzso zzso to the zzso marker zzso and approximately 300 zzso zzso to zzso
