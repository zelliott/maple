zzso zzso is an zzso agent of zzso fever and zzso fever in human zzso As the currently available methods for identifying the zzso bacteria are not zzso we attempted to establish them by zzso using newly designed zzso for the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso We then determined the prevalence of zzso zzso in two species of feral rats that inhabit an urban region in Japan, because information on the prevalence of the bacteria in feral rats is zzso The use of zzso with newly designed zzso showed that an extremely high proportion of zzso zzso zzso the bacteria zzso zzso whereas the prevalence was only zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso isolated from oral zzso of feral rats showed at least two different types of bacteria among zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso
