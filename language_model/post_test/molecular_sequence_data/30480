In zzso zzso of a zzso pools of DNA molecules are made containing a mixture of zzso at a specific zzso In cases where genetic methods allow screens or selections for altered function, a background of nonsense zzso can complicate genetic analysis of the resulting zzso zzso are proposed for elimination of those molecules containing stop zzso at the target zzso from the pool, and for identifying positions to which these methods may be zzso Application of these methods should ensure that all changes are zzso zzso thereby simplifying genetic zzso
