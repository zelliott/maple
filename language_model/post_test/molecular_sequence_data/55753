zzso package two zzso zzso zzso zzso within a gag zzso zzso In mature zzso zzso the two zzso strands are thought to associate primarily through direct zzso zzso although the structural basis for this stable association is zzso We now report that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encompassing the zzso end of the gag gene zzso spontaneously under high zzso strength conditions in the absence of any protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso is dramatically and specifically stabilized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso occurs at 80 degrees C in 100 zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso but at significantly lower temperatures in the presence of either smaller or larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 degrees zzso 100 zzso zzso 55 degrees zzso 100 zzso zzso 30 degrees zzso zzso analyses of the 3' end of the zzso zzso reveal that an zzso zzso zzso as short as 94 zzso zzso can zzso spontaneously, but a further zzso deletion of the zzso zzso zzso from positions 817 through zzso eliminates zzso These experimental results support a model in which zzso zzso zzso by forming an zzso quadruple zzso stabilized by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to the well-known zzso of zzso zzso We speculate that this structure may also mediate the association of zzso zzso zzso in zzso revealing how zzso itself can achieve the zzso required for subsequent genetic zzso
