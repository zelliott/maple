We have been interested in understanding more about the sequences that constitute the zzso late zzso Our approach has been to target specific deletions to the viral zzso region by zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso with defined deletions were then inserted into a zzso expression zzso containing the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso were introduced into mouse zzso zzso cells by zzso and promoter activities were assessed by zzso of both zzso zzso and cat zzso zzso In this report, we present the results of experiments designed to map promoter elements which affect late zzso in the absence of early viral proteins and viral DNA zzso Using this approach, we mapped two major zzso elements (a positive and a negative one) which affect zzso in our transient expression zzso The first, positive, element coincided with the zzso A element, which is known to be important for early zzso and viral DNA zzso zzso of this element reduced late zzso by 50- to zzso The second element was a negative one; removal of 89 base pairs that included two zzso zzso sites just to the early side of the zzso repeat structure within the replication origin resulted in a zzso to zzso increase in late promoter zzso The implications of these findings for late promoter function and regulation are zzso
