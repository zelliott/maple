Natural zzso zzso zzso are zzso molecules complementary to other zzso zzso They are capable of regulating the expression of target genes at different levels zzso zzso stability, translation, zzso Such a property makes them ideal for interventions in zzso zzso The present study reviewed plant zzso aspects, including features, availability and zzso conservation and distribution, coding capacity, zzso pair zzso and zzso Besides, an in zzso identification of zzso pairs was zzso using zzso libraries of soybean infected or not with zzso zzso zzso showed that around 1/3 of the zzso predicted zzso (by zzso zzso detected had zzso mapped in both sequences of each zzso The same 1/3 of the zzso foreseen zzso showed zzso anchored in both sequences of the related zzso For those zzso mapped in zzso pairs, a zzso expression was assigned as zzso zzso or zzso based on the statistical analysis zzso zzso zzso As a result, the infected treatment promoted the expression of zzso zzso pairs zzso zzso exclusively from that library zzso pairs had zzso only found in the mock zzso To understand the regulation of these zzso pairs could be a key aspect in the zzso plant zzso
