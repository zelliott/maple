After the completion of a draft human zzso zzso the International Human Genome zzso zzso has proceeded to finish and zzso each of the 24 zzso zzso the human zzso Here we describe the sequencing and analysis of human zzso 3, one of the largest human zzso zzso 3 comprises just four zzso one of which currently represents the longest zzso stretch of finished DNA sequence known so zzso The zzso is remarkable in having the lowest rate of zzso zzso in the zzso It also includes a zzso zzso gene cluster as well as numerous zzso involved in multiple human zzso such as the gene zzso zzso which contains the most common zzso fragile site in the zzso zzso Using zzso sequence from zzso and zzso macaque, we were able to characterize the zzso defining a large zzso inversion that occurred some time after the split of zzso from zzso and propose an evolutionary history of the zzso
