zzso zzso is a highly abundant zzso zzso in zzso cells whose function in zzso regulation has only recently been zzso Despite its highly zzso sequence throughout zzso all attempts to discover zzso zzso zzso in zzso species have failed so zzso Here we report on a combined experimental and zzso survey that succeeded in discovering zzso zzso in most of the major zzso zzso and in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite major efforts, no candidates were found in any of the many available zzso zzso zzso The additional sequence data confirm the evolutionary conservation and hence functional importance of the previously described 3' and zzso zzso zzso and provide evidence for a third, structurally zzso zzso
