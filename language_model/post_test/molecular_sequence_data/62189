The zzso zzso zzso causes malaria zzso the most prevailing zzso disease worldwide, with zzso million infections and zzso million zzso The emergence of strains resistant to drugs used for prophylaxis and treatment and no vaccine available makes the structural analysis of potential drug targets zzso For that reason, we analyzed the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and in complex with its inhibitor zzso The structures have been analyzed to zzso and zzso A, zzso zzso shares several structural features with the zzso zzso and is therefore closely related to this class, even though alignments with its members display low sequence identities in the range of zzso Upon zzso zzso the overall structure and the zzso site zzso remain almost unchanged with the exception of the flexible C zzso The detailed comparison of the zzso zzso with the human host zzso zzso reveals that, although the overall structure is zzso the shape of the zzso binding pocket zzso differs zzso In the human zzso it is zzso from one side by the large zzso whereas in zzso the zzso is truncated and the space to recognize and bind zzso zzso is zzso This structural feature can be exploited to support the design of specific and zzso zzso
