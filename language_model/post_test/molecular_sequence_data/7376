The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and was found to be highly zzso to previously analyzed zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso was zzso by heat shock as well as by exposure to ethanol and hydrogen zzso There were two transcripts representing the zzso zzso one containing the zzso and zzso genes and the second containing only the zzso zzso zzso extension analysis indicated that zzso started from the same site in zzso cells and in zzso zzso The upstream regulatory region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not contain the highly zzso zzso repeat sequence previously found in the zzso zzso of this zzso as well as in many other zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region of several zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso indicates the existence of a putative promoter sequence different from the known consensus promoter sequences recognized by the zzso coli zzso or heat shock zzso zzso This promoter may constitute the heat shock promoter of these zzso zzso
