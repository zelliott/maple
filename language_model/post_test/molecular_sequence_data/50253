Recently, we have shown that the zzso formed in the reaction between the zzso complex zzso and one zzso zzso was stable but became zzso as soon as the zzso zzso was paired with its complementary strand zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88, zzso zzso To zzso this finding we have now studied large DNA fragments containing several zzso The stability of the zzso within zzso DNA is demonstrated by zzso zzso and by replication mapping zzso Several approaches are used to prove the zzso of the zzso within zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments reveal that an unmodified zzso DNA when mixed with zzso DNA modified by the zzso complex behaves as a zzso DNA modified by the zzso zzso After zzso DNA is modified by the zzso complex, zzso and zzso zzso are progressively formed during subsequent incubation as revealed by zzso mapping experiments and gel zzso under zzso zzso Finally, replication mapping experiments show that the zzso of the zzso within a zzso DNA depends upon the nature of the zzso zzso zzso All these results support the proposal that the DNA double zzso acts as a catalyst in the reaction between DNA, zzso and zzso
