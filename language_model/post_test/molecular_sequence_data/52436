We have examined the functional importance of binding sites for zzso family members zzso zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, and zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso of the E site in the zzso promoter diminishes zzso in zzso to 59% of zzso and zzso from the zzso promoter in zzso is inhibited to an average of zzso of zzso by competition with E site zzso zzso E site binding proteins from zzso cells zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Although five zzso family proteins are known which bind the E site, zzso zzso of zzso complexes resolved by zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso is the only E site binding protein zzso in early B cell zzso more mature B cells contain zzso and zzso We also show by zzso that zzso activates the zzso promoter in zzso
