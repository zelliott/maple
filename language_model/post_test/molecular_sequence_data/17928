Nerve growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso that acts via specific receptors to promote the survival and growth of zzso To delineate the zzso zzso responsible for zzso biological activity, we zzso small peptides corresponding to three regions in zzso that are zzso and highly zzso Several peptides from mouse zzso region zzso inhibited the zzso effect of zzso on sensory zzso in zzso zzso was zzso and could be overcome by increasing the concentration of zzso Moreover, zzso actions were specific for zzso events in that they failed to block the zzso activity of zzso zzso factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In spite of the zzso of zzso activity, peptides did not affect the binding of zzso zzso These studies define one region of zzso that may be required for zzso zzso
