zzso zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso zzso to its corresponding alcohol, zzso zzso and changes the pharmacological properties of this cancer zzso zzso The zzso zzso associated with zzso reduces the zzso zzso zzso group and does not metabolize the zzso ring of zzso Reports comparing zzso and zzso toxicity have resulted in various conclusions depending on the cells zzso zzso in toxicity could be due to variations in several zzso involved in zzso zzso In this report, the effects of zzso expression on zzso metabolism and cell toxicity were determined by cloning and expressing a human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity increased zzso in the zzso cells and was associated with a zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso protection occurred at 30 zzso zzso where zzso of the zzso zzso was converted to zzso within 2 zzso The reduced toxicity was specific for zzso Other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso were equally toxic to both the zzso zzso cells and the control cells under the conditions zzso Our results suggest that high levels of zzso in tumor cells could contribute to drug zzso The results also suggest that reduction of zzso to zzso protects against zzso toxicity by altering interaction of the drug at one or more of the many target zzso
