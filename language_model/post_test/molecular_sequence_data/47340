The zzso zzso is a zzso cell zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso cells of the nervous zzso So far, only protein zzso have been reported to interact with the zzso zzso of the two zzso of the zzso zzso We report here the identification of the first zzso zzso zzso for the large zzso of the zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The interaction is dependent on the presence of zzso We have also localized the zzso site in the zzso domain specific to the large zzso zzso zzso to a putative basic zzso zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to this region bound to zzso in a zzso manner with a zzso ratio of zzso zzso approximately 7 zzso We suggest that the observed interaction may play a role in the regulation of the zzso zzso cell zzso and the zzso zzso signal zzso events during zzso formation and zzso
