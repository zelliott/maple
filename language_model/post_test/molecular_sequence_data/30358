We describe two cell lines with different deletions of the zzso gene in a patient with bilateral zzso This patient has transmitted the zzso less frequent in his zzso to two affected zzso We zzso zzso and zzso the junction fragments of the two deletions and found that they share one zzso but extend into opposite zzso An zzso of 4 zzso of unknown origin is present between the zzso in one of the zzso The second deletion shows a more complex zzso including an inversion at the zzso zzso Short regions of zzso were found at the zzso and zzso the zzso These results support the notion that bilateral zzso may not only be due to a zzso zzso but also to a zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso
