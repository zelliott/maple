We obtained zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso by creating random zzso in zzso Of 12 zzso two were functional when expressed in zzso zzso zzso but, upon sequencing, only one of them zzso produced an actual zzso zzso In zzso the first 69 zzso acids of zzso were replaced by the corresponding 50 zzso acids of zzso C1 zzso the same zzso as does zzso zzso affinity for all sugar zzso was systematically increased by a factor of zzso but the zzso was diminished by a factor of zzso In contrast, the zzso affinity for zzso was zzso The surface expression of C1 was one seventh that of zzso which explains part of the reduced zzso and implies a significant reduction in turnover zzso zzso truncated zzso of zzso zzso showed that deleting zzso acids 2-14 does not affect zzso activity, but that the zzso zzso is important for normal levels of zzso zzso The main result of a kinetic analysis of the systematic increase in apparent affinity for zzso together with the intact Na apparent zzso suggests enhanced access to the sugar binding site in zzso
