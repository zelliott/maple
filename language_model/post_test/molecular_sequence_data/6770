zzso and zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso The zzso DNA contains one zzso and encodes a zzso acid basic zzso with a zzso acid zzso signal zzso followed by a zzso acid zzso domain, linked by a hinge region to the main domain of the zzso The sequence of the zzso is identical to the zzso sequence deduced from the zzso zzso A probe derived from this gene identified a zzso transcript present in high amount in roots, moderate in floral zzso and low in stems and zzso The synthesis of these transcripts is regulated during development and is induced in roots by wounding and zzso This type of zzso is zzso by two sequences in zzso zzso as shown either by Southern zzso or by zzso amplification and sequencing using the zzso chain zzso These genes are zzso to one sequence found in the zzso zzso zzso
