A key component of the zzso zzso II zzso apparatus, zzso is a zzso complex containing the zzso zzso protein zzso and at least seven tightly associated factors zzso Although the functions of most zzso zzso are unknown, it is clear that zzso are not necessary for zzso activity but that one or more are required for regulated transcription, and so behave as zzso The presence of multiple zzso indicates that there is an intricate assembly process and that zzso may be responsible for other zzso We have described the properties of the zzso zzso which can interact directly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the largest zzso zzso binds directly to zzso and links other zzso to the zzso Here we describe the zzso expression and partial characterization of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso contains several copies of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso shares extended sequence similarity with an zzso zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso factor that is though to regulate zzso We have expressed zzso zzso and begun to characterize its interaction with other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is unable to bind zzso directly or to interact strongly with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso is only able to recognize and interact with a zzso complex containing zzso delta zzso 110 and zzso These findings suggest the formation of zzso may require an ordered assembly of the zzso some of which bind directly to zzso and others that are zzso to the complex as a result of specific zzso zzso
