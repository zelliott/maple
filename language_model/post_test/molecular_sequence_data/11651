zzso is zzso expressed zinc finger DNA binding zzso It can act as a zzso zzso or zzso and, when binding at the zzso element, as a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sites for zzso have been reported in a wide variety of promoters and they exhibit substantial diversity in their zzso To better understand how zzso interacts with DNA and to be able to predict the presence of zzso sites in a more comprehensive fashion, we have selected zzso binding sites from a random pool of zzso The sites display considerable zzso but contain a zzso zzso core flanked by variable regions, generating the consensus zzso where the upper case letters represent the preferred zzso This high degree of flexibility in DNA recognition can be predicted by modeling the interaction of the four zzso zinc fingers with DNA and a detailed model for this interaction is presented and zzso
