The gene zzso a major surface protein zzso of zzso zzso a zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso gene has a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 65 zzso which had a typical zzso signal sequence (19 zzso zzso zzso showed a high level of zzso with major sheath protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso the closest relative of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene exists in a single copy and Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso transcript is zzso Another zzso located downstream of zzso was in the same orientation and zzso a putative zzso in which the first zzso zzso zzso acids were zzso The zzso region of this protein is also a part on the zzso zzso zzso zzso
