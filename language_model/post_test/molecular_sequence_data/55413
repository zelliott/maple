Brazil nuts are an important export market in its main producing countries, including Brazil, Bolivia, and zzso zzso 30,000 tons of Brazil nuts are harvested each zzso However, substantial nut contamination by zzso section zzso occurs with subsequent production of zzso In our study, zzso section zzso were isolated from Brazil nuts zzso zzso and identified by zzso and molecular zzso We obtained zzso zzso from nut samples, zzso positive for zzso zzso Eighty-one zzso were selected for molecular zzso zzso genetic distances among zzso and zzso relationships were zzso The following zzso species were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, molecular profiles indicated a high level of zzso variation within zzso and zzso gene sequences associated with high genetic divergence from zzso zzso Among the 81 zzso analyzed by molecular means, three of them were zzso distinct from all other zzso representing the six species of section zzso A putative novel species was identified based on molecular zzso
