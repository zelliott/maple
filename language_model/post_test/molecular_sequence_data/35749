zzso in the environment can often adapt to use zzso chemicals as novel growth and energy zzso Specialized zzso systems and zzso pathways for the degradation of man-made compounds such as zzso and zzso have been found in zzso isolated from geographically separated areas of the zzso The genetic characterization of an increasing number of zzso pathways for degradation of zzso aromatic compounds in different bacteria has made it possible to compare the similarities in genetic organization and in sequence which exist between genes and proteins of these specialized zzso routes and more common zzso These data suggest that discrete zzso containing clusters of genes have been combined in different ways in the various zzso zzso zzso information further suggests divergence of zzso genes coding for specialized zzso in the degradation of zzso zzso An important question will be to find whether these specialized zzso evolved from more common zzso only after the introduction of zzso chemicals into the zzso Evidence is presented that a range of genetic mechanisms, such as gene transfer, zzso zzso and genetic zzso and zzso can accelerate the evolution of zzso pathways in zzso However, there is virtually no information concerning the rates at which these mechanisms are operating in bacteria living in nature and the response of such rates to the presence of potential zzso zzso zzso data on the genetic processes in the natural environment and on the effect of environmental parameters on the rate of evolution are zzso
