The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a fusion of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso This single copy gene is both zzso and zzso It is expressed in all life stages of the zzso and its transcript abundance is unaffected by heat zzso zzso analysis shows that expression of zzso is regulated by an upstream promoter and a downstream zzso The downstream element is required for zzso promoter activity in zzso and in cells of the zzso zzso including the zzso tip cells, sheath cells, zzso cells, and cells of the zzso The zzso activity of the downstream regulator is zzso to a stress gene promoter such that zzso expression of the zzso occurs in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso does not occur in all life zzso but is initiated late in the second or early in the third zzso stage, when differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso fusion protein from zzso containing the downstream zzso regulator causes abnormalities of the zzso and embryonic zzso zzso abnormalities include arrested development and general zzso These abnormalities may be related to the zzso of zzso in the zzso
