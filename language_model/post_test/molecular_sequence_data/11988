Brain tissue zzso was amplified using zzso chain reaction zzso with eight overlapping sets of zzso that span the zzso coding sequence for the human zzso insulin zzso Only the A zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso No difference was found in the predicted zzso acid sequence of brain derived insulin zzso zzso compared with the zzso from human zzso A silent zzso was detected at zzso position zzso zzso acid zzso confirming that zzso corresponding to both zzso of the human brain zzso was zzso Our findings indicate that the unique zzso properties of brain insulin receptors do not stem from differences in primary structure, but rather are due to zzso differences in zzso zzso
