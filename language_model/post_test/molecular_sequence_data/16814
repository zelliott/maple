In order to obtain the zzso human zzso efficiently by zzso single column zzso a gene zzso human zzso was zzso and cloned into zzso coli expression zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was transferred into zzso coli zzso cells and the target protein was zzso as a fusion to the zzso of a zzso affinity zzso After the zzso fusion protein was zzso by zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso was induced by zzso and the zzso was released from the zzso zzso zzso The activity of the zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso was detected using the human zzso zzso cells zzso Twenty-two milligrams of zzso with the purity over zzso was obtained by single column zzso from 1 liter of induced zzso The preliminary biological zzso indicated that the zzso which has an extra Met at its zzso compared with the native human zzso had the similar activity of stimulating zzso zzso with the standard zzso in the zzso zzso A new efficient production procedure of the active zzso human zzso was zzso
