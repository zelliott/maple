Toward studying the zzso zzso and roles in the zzso of the dominant surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso rough colony zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 were zzso cultured in zzso and their zzso composition zzso Two of the rough zzso zzso zzso and zzso were devoid of zzso or any more zzso structures and thus were similar to those described zzso Two others, zzso and zzso each contained two novel zzso devoid of any of the zzso zzso that zzso zzso activity on the zzso The application of gas zzso fast atom zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso I established the structure zzso zzso zzso II represented a minor variation of this zzso zzso zzso These newly discovered zzso are identical to the fatty zzso alcohol zzso component of the zzso of the zzso zzso complex, and thus the zzso and zzso zzso represent a form of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Separately, we report that these rough zzso of zzso zzso differ genetically from the smooth, virulent form by major deletions of portions of the genes responsible for zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jacobs, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolation of different sets of spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso defective in the capacity to zzso zzso provides the means to explore their zzso and roles in opportunistic zzso
