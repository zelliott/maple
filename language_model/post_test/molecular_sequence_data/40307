zzso between the structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso account for the selective action of zzso Even minor variations in the structure of zzso of different bacterial species may lead to zzso zzso interactions of the drugs with their zzso Although zzso structures of antibiotics bound to the zzso zzso center or the exit tunnel of zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso large zzso zzso have been reported, it remains unclear whether the interactions of antibiotics with these zzso accurately reflect those with the zzso of zzso zzso Here we report X-ray crystal structures of the zzso coli zzso in complexes with clinically important antibiotics of four major classes, including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso at resolutions of zzso zzso zzso zzso modes of three of these antibiotics show important variations compared to the previously determined zzso zzso and structural evidence also indicates that interactions of zzso with the zzso coli zzso more closely resembles drug binding to zzso of bacterial zzso The present data further argue that the identity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso explain in part the spectrum and selectivity of zzso zzso
