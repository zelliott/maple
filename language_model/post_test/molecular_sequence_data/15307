Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the zzso of zzso plaques in the zzso This zzso primarily contains zzso zzso a zzso to zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso precursor zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the most abundant zzso zzso found in zzso has a much greater propensity to zzso into zzso than the other peptides and is believed to be more zzso zzso human zzso peptides zzso into stable but zzso zzso zzso We determined their structure to approximately zzso resolution by using zzso and the zzso zzso reconstruction zzso This structure reveals 2 zzso winding around a hollow zzso Previous zzso zzso models for zzso fit well in the zzso density map and reveal that the juxtaposed zzso are joined via the N zzso of the zzso from 1 zzso connecting to the loop region of the zzso in the opposite zzso This model of mature zzso zzso is markedly different from previous zzso models of zzso zzso In our model, the C zzso of zzso forms the inside wall of the hollow core, which is supported by partial zzso zzso
