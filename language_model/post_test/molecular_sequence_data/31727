Fifty-five bacterial zzso were obtained from zzso zzso of woody and shrub zzso growing in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the food zzso soybean and common zzso Based on partial zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, the majority of the zzso were identified as zzso bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Seven zzso were zzso bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso showed that each strain was genetically zzso According to zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso were further classified into six different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and putative new zzso zzso The strains from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso on their host zzso The other strains did not form zzso on their original zzso Nine zzso bacterial strains representing seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to colonize zzso of zzso zzso and common bean on zzso with symbiotic zzso Four zzso zzso and two zzso strains had identical zzso gene sequences with symbiotic zzso zzso suggesting horizontal gene zzso Most symbiotic and zzso zzso bacteria showed plant zzso properties in zzso which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the zzso
