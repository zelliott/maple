The DNA of the Antarctic zzso zzso zzso was found to contain a highly repeated sequence identifiable upon restriction with zzso zzso The zzso unit - denominated zzso (about zzso zzso - was zzso Southern zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso pattern, indicating that the repeated elements are zzso arranged in the zzso and therefore represent a sequence of satellite zzso zzso analysis of five different clones revealed the presence of various zzso some of which showed a high degree of zzso In each zzso regions zzso to the zzso zzso box were zzso A region zzso to the zzso zzso sequence of zzso was also found in one of the zzso These observations suggest a relationship of the zzso family to the zzso area in zzso zzso
