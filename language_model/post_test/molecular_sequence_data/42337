The requirement of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso cells is fulfilled through specific zzso transport zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein which zzso zzso from the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the very rapid transport of most of the zzso used in zzso zzso During the past five years there have been advances on several zzso zzso and zzso clones for zzso zzso zzso and human zzso have been isolated and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso strains deficient in zzso transport and expression in zzso coli of a zzso protein involving zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso have been zzso zzso in contrast to other members of the family of zzso involved in energy zzso was demonstrated to have a zzso which zzso the import of the precursor protein into zzso Six zzso segments appear to be a structural feature shared between zzso and other zzso zzso carriers, and zzso directed zzso studies zzso zzso relationships to zzso These recent advances on zzso will be assessed in light of a more global interpretation of transport mechanism across the inner zzso zzso
