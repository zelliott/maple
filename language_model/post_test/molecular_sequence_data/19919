The zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the industrial zzso of zzso It is found in zzso environments in zzso and is important in the zzso cycling of metals and zzso Its zzso contains a cluster of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and act, that are predicted to zzso the alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso and an zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso act, cloned and expressed in zzso coli, produces zzso zzso zzso zzso principally of chain length zzso according to gas zzso and mass zzso zzso The zzso have biological activity as shown by in zzso studies using the reporter strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that the four genes are expressed as a single transcript, demonstrating that they constitute an zzso According to zzso zzso results, act is expressed more highly when zzso zzso is grown in medium containing iron than when it is grown in medium containing zzso Since zzso are important zzso signaling molecules used by many bacteria to monitor their population density in zzso control of gene zzso this result suggests that zzso zzso has two zzso systems, one based on Act, as described zzso and the other based on a zzso zzso system, reported zzso The latter system was shown to be zzso in zzso zzso grown in sulfur zzso suggesting that the two zzso systems respond to different environmental signals that may be related to their abilities to colonize and use different solid zzso and zzso zzso
