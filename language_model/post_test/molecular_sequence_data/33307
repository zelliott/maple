A strategy to control the devastating late blight disease is providing potato zzso with genes that are effective in resistance to a broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso Thus far, most late blight resistance zzso genes that were zzso in potato were quickly zzso In contrast, the zzso gene originating from zzso zzso has performed as an exclusive zzso R gene for many zzso Recently, the zzso zzso family zzso was identified to contain zzso Monitoring the genetic diversity of the zzso family in a large set of zzso of zzso zzso and related species resulted in 16 zzso zzso in three distinct zzso Class I and class II but not class III zzso zzso induce cell death when zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Class I is highly diverse and is represented in all analyzed zzso zzso zzso except two Mexican zzso zzso zzso and these were found virulent on zzso zzso In its zzso domain, zzso contains a W motif that is essential for triggering zzso cell death and is under positive zzso This study shows that profiling the variation of zzso within a zzso zzso population is instrumental for predicting the effectiveness of zzso resistance in zzso
