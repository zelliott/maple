The Grand River zzso Canada) is impacted by wastewater treatment plants zzso that release zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso microbial communities help transform this zzso into more oxidized compounds zzso zzso or zzso although the spatial distribution and relative abundance of freshwater zzso zzso zzso zzso are not well zzso This study investigated freshwater N cycling within the Grand River, focusing on zzso and water zzso both inside and outside a zzso zzso zzso The diversity, relative zzso and zzso activity of zzso were investigated by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso quantitative real-time zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso zzso targeting both zzso zzso and functional zzso together with activity zzso The analysis of bacterial zzso zzso gene fingerprints showed that the zzso zzso strongly affected zzso bacterial patterns in the water column but not those associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and activity data demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso were zzso and metabolically dominant in samples taken from outside the zzso zzso whereas zzso bacteria zzso dominated zzso within the zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso rate zzso supported the dominance of zzso activity in downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were detected primarily in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns were completely distinct from zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates the importance of combined molecular and zzso studies for zzso molecular signatures of wastewater zzso from zzso zzso zzso
