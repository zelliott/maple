zzso hormones zzso play a pivotal role in many zzso functions in zzso including zzso Their effects are zzso by zzso hormone receptors zzso which are members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso In this study, full-length zzso sequences of zzso from yellow zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and their zzso tissue expression profiles were zzso In zzso zzso the validated zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso and 1848 zzso in zzso zzso peptides of 401 and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso In addition, a zzso spliced zzso (named zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso was zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso peptides of zzso 409 and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso zzso grouped into two separate clusters with other zzso counterparts and two zzso sequences grouped zzso suggesting that the two zzso derived from zzso genes that might arise during a zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were detected in various zzso zzso The zzso levels of both zzso and zzso from zzso zzso were the highest in brain, followed by liver, and lowest in heart, zzso muscle, zzso and zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest zzso levels in brain and lowest in zzso Identification and zzso tissue expression of zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso provide an initial step towards understanding their biological roles in the two fish zzso
