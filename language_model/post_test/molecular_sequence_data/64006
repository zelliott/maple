The zzso movement protein zzso is essential for zzso spread of tobacco mosaic virus in zzso We used zzso zzso and zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso to obtain highly zzso zzso zzso which migrated as a single band in native zzso zzso zzso suggested that the protein was zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso protein contained significant zzso secondary zzso zzso of the zzso generated a zzso core that was a mixture of primarily zzso and some zzso We propose that zzso zzso are stabilized by zzso interactions in the C zzso as well as zzso interactions between putative zzso zzso coiled zzso
