The high affinity zzso for zzso zzso contains three zzso called zzso zzso beta and zzso A biological and zzso binding analysis based on zzso different zzso mouse zzso zzso proteins was used to define the function of each of the 149 zzso By this genetic analysis, 44 zzso were assigned important functions, 21 of which were zzso The remaining 23 zzso consisted of 19 zzso from three separate regions, that were important for zzso alpha zzso three zzso from two separate regions, that were important for zzso beta zzso and a single zzso important for zzso gamma zzso We built a model zzso structure based on the zzso human zzso zzso crystal zzso The roles of the 21 zzso presumed to be important for structure were consistent with the zzso Despite zzso in the primary zzso the zzso specific for each zzso zzso interaction were clustered and located to three disparate regions of the zzso zzso zzso The relative spatial locations of these three surfaces are different from the two zzso binding sites known for the structurally related human growth hormone and the significance of this observation is zzso
