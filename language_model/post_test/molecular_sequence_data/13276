Lambda zzso clone containing a gene cluster coding for the translation zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso was identified in a zzso library for the zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso probe amplified by two zzso zzso for zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso factor 1 alpha zzso The gene coding for zzso factor zzso was also found zzso upstream from the zzso of the zzso factor 1 alpha by zzso analysis using a DNA zzso specific for zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso are very similar in sequence and in length and appear to be more closely related to each other than to the zzso zzso
