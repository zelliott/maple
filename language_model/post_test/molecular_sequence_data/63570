zzso structures surrounding the zzso zzso class A zzso zzso gene were characterized in several zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains isolated from the United States, Colombia, and zzso The zzso zzso genes were associated in all cases with zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso isolate from the United States, the zzso zzso zzso gene was located on a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was 10 zzso in size, was zzso by two zzso imperfect zzso repeat zzso and zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been identified in all zzso However, two zzso of this zzso were zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the United States and Greece, respectively, and differed by a zzso zzso located just upstream of the zzso zzso zzso compared to the sequence of zzso which was found in the Colombian zzso In all zzso tested, zzso was flanked by a zzso target site duplication, the signature of a recent zzso event, and was inserted in different open reading frames located on plasmids that varied in size and zzso zzso is likely at the origin of zzso zzso zzso zzso to plasmids and its further zzso into zzso plasmids identified in zzso related zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
