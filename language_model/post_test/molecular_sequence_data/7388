zzso modified LDL zzso obtained by mild iron zzso or prolonged storage at 4 degrees C, has been shown to induce the expression of zzso stimulating factor zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso To examine whether other cell types also respond to zzso we investigated its effect on the expression of zzso zzso in mouse zzso and human zzso smooth muscle zzso Both zzso and human zzso smooth muscle cells showed increased levels of zzso zzso in response to 10 to 200 zzso zzso in a zzso zzso This allowed us to use mouse zzso as a model to study the mechanism involved in zzso increase in zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso showed that zzso gene zzso was activated by zzso In the present study, we identified specific elements that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso containing sequential deletions in the zzso region of the zzso gene linked to a reporter zzso zzso zzso gene were zzso into mouse zzso The human zzso promoter region extending upstream from the zzso start site to zzso zzso showed maximum induction of zzso activity by zzso zzso of zzso activity was drastically reduced, with a deletion zzso lacking the promoter region zzso to zzso A functional nuclear factor zzso B binding site present in this critical region was required for zzso induction of zzso activity since an internal deletion construct lacking this element showed significant loss of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
