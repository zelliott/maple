zzso zzso and zzso constitute a family of proteins that may function as molecular scaffolds in the zzso density zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso and Homer, thus potentially bridging the zzso zzso complex and the zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso 23, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso 23, zzso zzso contains multiple zzso for zzso interaction including zzso repeats, an zzso domain, a zzso domain, a sterile alpha motif domain, and a zzso zzso By characterizing zzso zzso clones and zzso products, we found that there are four sites for alternative zzso in zzso and another four sites in zzso some of which result in deletion of specific zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, the expression of the zzso zzso is zzso regulated in different regions of rat brain during zzso zzso analysis of zzso proteins in rat brain using five different zzso zzso reveals marked zzso in size zzso zzso and differential zzso zzso zzso zzso is concentrated at zzso synaptic sites in adult brain, and the zzso zzso of zzso is seen in developing rat brains as early as zzso day zzso These results suggest that alternative zzso in the zzso family may be a mechanism that regulates the molecular structure of zzso and the spectrum of zzso proteins in the zzso of adult and developing zzso
