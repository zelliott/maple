zzso substitution zzso was conducted to investigate the importance of the zzso repeats zzso at the origin of DNA replication zzso of zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso with engineered zzso on either arm or both arms of the zzso were not impaired in protein synthesis and yielded infectious progeny viruses with restored or new zzso Thus, a zzso zzso at the zzso was not essential for initiation of DNA zzso but one was generated inevitably at zzso Among the 26 viruses recovered, 16 showed evidence of template strand zzso from zzso zzso DNA to zzso strand DNA, during zzso of the zzso Here I propose a novel zzso zzso model for zzso DNA zzso In this model, the zzso zzso protein complex zzso zzso and nicks the zzso sequence to initiate zzso DNA zzso All four strands of the zzso zzso repeats exist in a zzso zzso and the zzso viral zzso and a zzso strand are available as templates, zzso during initiation or termination of DNA zzso Inherent in this model is a zzso zzso or zzso repeat zzso mechanism that can restore mutilated zzso sequences to a zzso at the zzso of circular zzso or at the zzso of zzso linear zzso zzso the melted state of the zzso repeats increases the rate of zzso or illegitimate zzso incorporation into the zzso Thus, this zzso model provides insight into the mechanisms of DNA zzso gene zzso and illegitimate zzso at the zzso of zzso and it may be zzso to the replication of other circular DNA zzso
