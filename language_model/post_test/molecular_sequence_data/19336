Two moderately zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from a sample taken from the zzso interface of the zzso Deep in the Red zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that these organisms represent a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso of the new zzso formed zzso colonies and were zzso by means of a single polar zzso zzso zzso and zzso grew zzso at zzso degrees C, in 5 % zzso and at pH zzso The organisms were zzso but reduced nitrate to nitrogen under zzso zzso Acid was produced from only a few zzso zzso 9 was the major respiratory zzso The major fatty acids of strains zzso and zzso were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso summed feature 3 zzso : zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents were zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso analyses and zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that strains zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
