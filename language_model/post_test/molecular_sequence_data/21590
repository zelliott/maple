zzso stages of the zzso zzso zzso the pathogen causing zzso zzso were separated and zzso by an improved method of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of late zzso zzso precursor zzso and mature spores were zzso by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso zzso spots were recovered from gels and zzso by mass zzso The most abundant differential protein spot was identified by database search to be a hypothetical spore wall zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso is localized to the zzso of mature spores and renamed it as spore wall protein 5 zzso Further spore zzso zzso indicated that zzso can protect spores from zzso zzso by cultured insect zzso This spore wall protein may function both for structural integrity and in modulating host cell zzso
