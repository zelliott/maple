The temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains of zzso X or Y, converting them into zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso of zzso possesses zzso zzso activity which results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso during the zzso of the zzso to the cell zzso When used in Southern zzso a zzso gene 9 zzso zzso zzso DNA probe zzso with restriction zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequencing and analysis of zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso acid sequence zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso High conservation of key zzso was suggestive of similar secondary and zzso zzso protein structure and a similar function of the zzso zzso in this zzso In addition, an zzso acid sequence motif zzso was identified between zzso zzso and 184 which was also found to exist in various zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso promoter produced a 67 zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of heat-treated zzso extracts containing the zzso protein by incubation with whole zzso zzso Y cells demonstrated that zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso therefore encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited specific and preferential activity for zzso zzso zzso zzso X or Y zzso zzso of which resulted in the release of zzso fragments, consistent with zzso in size, as detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso
