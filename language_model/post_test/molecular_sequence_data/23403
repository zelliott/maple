The zzso functions of zzso zzso are based on the formation of distinctive zzso zzso zzso insights into the zzso relationships of the zzso zzso have been obtained through the resolution of several of their structures in complex with regulators and downstream zzso In this review, we use these complexes to compare the binding and zzso sites of the zzso zzso Although the properties that characterize these sites are diverse, some fundamental zzso principles that govern their zzso interactions have zzso zzso all of the interacting partners of the zzso zzso irrespective of their function, bind to a common set of zzso zzso acids that are clustered on the surface of the switch zzso This zzso region and its specific structural characteristics exemplify the convergence of the zzso zzso on a consensus binding zzso
