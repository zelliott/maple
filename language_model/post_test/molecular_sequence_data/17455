zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso affected individuals to breast and zzso cancer zzso In an attempt to systematically analyze a broader spectrum of genetic changes ranging from frequent zzso deletions and zzso to zzso acid replacements and protein zzso we isolated and characterized full size zzso zzso from a representative group of zzso zzso Our analysis represents the first comprehensive sequence comparison of zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso The comparison revealed an unusually high proportion of zzso in zzso zzso The major force driving evolutionary changes in zzso zzso sequences was zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that structural instability of this locus may be intrinsic in zzso Analysis of the zzso ratio in coding portions of the gene revealed the presence of both zzso and rapidly evolving regions in the zzso zzso Previously, a rapidly evolving region with evidence of positive evolutionary selection in human and zzso had been identified only in zzso zzso Here, we show that most of the internal zzso sequence is variable between primates and evolved under positive zzso In contrast, the terminal regions of zzso which zzso the zzso finger and zzso zzso experienced negative selection, which left them almost identical between the compared zzso Distribution of the reported zzso zzso but not zzso and nonsense zzso is positively correlated with zzso protein zzso Finally, on the basis of protein sequence zzso we identified zzso changes that are likely to compromise zzso zzso
