zzso zzso encodes a predicted zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which are major components of the nuclear pore complex zzso Unlike its zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso Animals with strong zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso in the zzso of the gene died as larvae with small discs, zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression appeared zzso regulated in zzso of zzso zzso larvae, and adults, suggesting that new zzso synthesis is required when assembly of new zzso is required, as in zzso or growing zzso Two additional zzso zzso also associated with different zzso zzso in the zzso were viable but had strong zzso sterile zzso including failure to maintain zzso stem cells and failure to progress into zzso stages of zzso zzso zzso viability correlated with orientation of the zzso zzso in the different zzso zzso analysis by zzso suggested a mechanism for zzso zzso an zzso promoter internal to the zzso 3' end able to drive sufficient expression of the zzso transcript for viability but not for zzso
