The identification of zzso factors in zzso zzso has been severely hampered by the lack of a method for in zzso random zzso zzso This study reports the use of zzso to generate random insertions of a gene zzso zzso resistance into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso using the zzso resistance gene as probe showed that zzso of zzso is zzso This was confirmed following zzso sequence analysis of the junction between the zzso and zzso zzso The presence of a 9 zzso zzso of the target sequence showed that random integration of the zzso was due to a bona fide zzso zzso zzso
