zzso resistance zzso plasmids belonging to the zzso zzso family are widely distributed among zzso and other zzso zzso from agricultural sources and have, at least once, also been identified in a drug-resistant zzso zzso isolate zzso from zzso Here, we present the complete zzso sequences of the zzso reference zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated in 1971 from the fish pathogen zzso zzso and of the cryptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso coli zzso zzso which was obtained through zzso transfer in zzso Using comparative sequence analysis of zzso and zzso with recent members of the zzso zzso family, we show that both plasmids provide novel insights into the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso family and the minimal machinery necessary for stable zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that recent members of the zzso zzso family evolved from a common zzso similar in composition to zzso through zzso integration of zzso acquired resistance gene zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons predict type IV zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso on the shared zzso zzso to be closely related to a group of zzso zzso zzso which use zzso transfer for horizontal propagation but zzso integrate into the host zzso during zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene cluster found on zzso which in zzso coli is involved in the formation of zzso cell zzso suggests persistence as an early zzso zzso resistance mechanism in the evolution of zzso resistance zzso
