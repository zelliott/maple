The role of zzso zzso zzso in rose flower zzso zzso was zzso A zzso library from zzso petals of rose ( Rosa zzso hybrid zzso zzso prepared in zzso zzso Express zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso probe, and seven putative positive zzso zzso clones were zzso Except for differences in zzso the sequences of these clones were zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso long, coded for an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids that contained the 11 zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso and zzso zzso binding sites, all of which are characteristic of all zzso zzso The transcripts prepared in zzso from the full-length clone when translated in rabbit zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso that zzso with a zzso zzso from a zzso fraction isolated from zzso zzso and both were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that in zzso zzso is specifically expressed in rose zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso increased dramatically as the flower matured to zzso and also correlated positively with zzso zzso The results of zzso Southern blots zzso with zzso are consistent with a pattern expected from a zzso zzso
