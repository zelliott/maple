zzso vascular events are becoming a formidable obstacle to the improvement of long-term prognosis of systemic lupus zzso zzso and the zzso findings lack for zzso zzso is a strategic approach but its applications in this regard are rare and primarily involve zzso acquisition or zzso zzso rather than functional zzso To provide further insight, we investigated the zzso diversity of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso in zzso and the possible role of the identified zzso A5 zzso in zzso The study involved 214 zzso and 183 healthy zzso The two-dimensional zzso gel images showed zzso zzso 25 and zzso zzso 19 protein spots from the zzso of the patients and controls, zzso From these protein spots, 30 zzso expressed proteins were zzso and 16 of these proteins were identified by mass zzso Western zzso confirmed the zzso candidate, zzso from the zzso of the patients zzso zzso but zzso indicated decreased levels of zzso zzso in the patients compared to healthy donors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive correlation was demonstrated between the manifestation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso while searching for correlations between clinical parameters and the two molecular levels of patient zzso The zzso zzso using plasma from zzso patients revealed that elevated zzso could shorten zzso time, activated partial zzso time and prolonged zzso time zzso Our data demonstrated the zzso differences in the zzso between zzso patients and healthy zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso distribution, increased zzso zzso and decreased serum levels of zzso represent a protective response to zzso zzso zzso mostly participate in the common zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
