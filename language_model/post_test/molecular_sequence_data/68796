zzso fall into two structural zzso aromatic and zzso The former are built mainly from zzso units through a zzso process wherein the zzso groups formed after each zzso cycle are left largely zzso Complex zzso are composed of zzso zzso or zzso and the extent of zzso reduction varies from one cycle to the zzso Two themes for zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso are determined by four to six genes zzso zzso or zzso zzso one zzso complex is used for all synthesis zzso Complex zzso are composed of several zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso for the zzso and reduction zzso each domain is used at a unique step in the zzso and the extent of zzso processing depends on the functional zzso operating at that zzso zzso rendering certain zzso zzso have been introduced into genes for complex zzso resulting in the production of novel zzso
