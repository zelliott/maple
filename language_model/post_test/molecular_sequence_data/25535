The production of zzso zzso against the central portion of zzso zzso requires cooperation between T cell and B cell zzso of this zzso We found a motif common to the zzso of the second zzso region of zzso zzso and sequences of some human zzso most of which participate in immune zzso The sequence of zzso of zzso with the highest zzso zzso incorporates this zzso It is suggested that the existence of this sequence motif in the central region of the zzso zzso zzso prevents the production of zzso zzso against the virus in zzso
