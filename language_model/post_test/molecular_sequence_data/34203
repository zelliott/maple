To identify zzso in the paired box 6 zzso gene of 33 zzso with zzso and to reveal the zzso spectrum in the Chinese zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso from 27 newly selected families and six previously analyzed families participated in this zzso The coding regions of zzso in the 27 new families were analyzed using cycle zzso Families that lacked zzso variations based on sequencing zzso new and six previously zzso were further analyzed using multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso 

Fifteen zzso were identified in 16 of the 33 families: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three gross deletions involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The first five zzso were novel and the zzso zzso was present in two zzso zzso variations were observed between families and between different affected patients within the zzso 

The zzso zzso spectrum in Chinese zzso patients is comparable to that reported in other ethnic zzso Further studies of the 17 families with no detected zzso may provide additional information to improve the understanding of the molecular zzso of zzso
