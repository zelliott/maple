Based on zzso sequences obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso their corresponding genes were identified in the published zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes were cloned and individually zzso by zzso of a zzso resistance marker, and then returned to zzso zzso for exchange with their zzso zzso The resulting zzso and zzso zzso strains showed normal growth in brain heart infusion zzso Unlike the zzso zzso the strain lacking zzso did not grow on zzso minimal medium with zzso zzso as the iron source, and grew only poorly in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso strain was unable to produce zzso which are normally zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that contained the whole zzso gene and its putative promoter region largely restored the zzso zzso zzso though zzso restoration could also be achieved with 1 zzso zzso added to the growth zzso The zzso zzso protein acted as an zzso : zzso zzso and zzso the zzso reductive release of iron from the zzso complex of zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein has closest similarity to zzso zzso that form part of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate an essential role of reduced zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These zzso not only provide the electrons for zzso reduction but most probably also affect the rate of zzso zzso
