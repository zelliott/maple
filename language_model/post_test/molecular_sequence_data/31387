The zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso displays sequence similarity to both the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We have examined the possibility of zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso by introducing structural changes which mimic the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso acid in the zzso domain, in a position analogous to the zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso elevated the in zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso Schneider cells zzso A zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso region, also showed a zzso elevated activity relative to a similar zzso with normal zzso zzso Double zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso mimicking the deletions in the zzso zzso did not however result in stimulation of in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also expressed in monkey zzso cells, and similar results were zzso The ability to enhance the zzso zzso activity by a specific structural modification of the zzso domain demonstrates the zzso of this zzso mechanism and strengthens the notion that this domain is intimately involved in signal zzso These results also support the inclusion of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso
