zzso zzso factor family proteins have essential roles during zzso development by either zzso or zzso target zzso For instance, zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso is controlled by a zzso zzso embedded in each zzso whose activity requires zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences in zzso proteins have been shown to be responsible for repressive function as a platform to recruit zzso zzso zzso However, it remains elusive whether requirement for the zzso motif differs among zzso target zzso By examining mice lacking zzso motifs in both zzso and zzso zzso here, we show a full and partial zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso T cells, zzso Thus, whereas zzso zzso completely depends on the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso mechanisms operate to repress zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso proteins zzso different modes to repress expression of different target zzso
