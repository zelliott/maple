The zzso protein zzso zzso pathways control diverse cellular functions in zzso zzso including sexual zzso stress response, and maintenance of cell wall zzso Here we characterized a zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to the zzso zzso that is known to play an important role in mating zzso response and stress response as an zzso protein to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not involved in any of the stress responses or zzso factor production zzso and zzso that are controlled by the zzso and zzso signaling zzso However, zzso was required for mating in both zzso A and zzso D zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was completely defective in zzso fusion and mating zzso zzso Double zzso of the zzso gene blocked increased production of zzso and the zzso zzso of cells deleted of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso protein that zzso regulates zzso responsive zzso signaling via the zzso zzso Regardless of the presence of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso that are known to be required for full zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso protein controls sexual differentiation of zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso but is not required for zzso
