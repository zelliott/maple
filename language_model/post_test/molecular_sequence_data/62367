Two genes involved in protein zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso and the general fusion factor zzso were characterized from two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolated genes showed a high level of conservation with their zzso zzso and zzso counterparts, and zzso zzso zzso was shown to complement zzso zzso zzso The zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in protein trafficking, was studied with zzso treated with the folding inhibitor zzso zzso and with zzso A, which zzso membrane traffic between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The well-known zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso unfolded protein response zzso zzso induced the zzso gene and the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in both of the experiments, and zzso zzso increased in only one experiment under strong zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not show a clear increase during zzso zzso zzso A strongly induced zzso and all of the zzso trafficking genes zzso These results suggest the possibility that the whole zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be induced at the zzso level by stress responses caused by protein zzso in the zzso zzso
