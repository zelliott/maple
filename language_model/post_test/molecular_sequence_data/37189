Current zzso zzso and zzso zzso monitoring methods are based on blood zzso determination, but the optimal sampling times are not clearly zzso An alternative zzso approach has recently been introduced, based on zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso a zzso that is partially inhibited by zzso and zzso However, the zzso method uses large amounts of radioactive zzso raising a number of safety zzso Here we describe an alternative method for zzso activity determination, based on zzso coupled with zzso zzso A zzso zzso is zzso by a protein zzso and further zzso by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The two peptides are separated by using zzso zzso with a detection wavelength of 205 zzso After zzso isolation by zzso zzso zzso activity is derived from the zzso zzso concentration measured during the first 6 zzso of the zzso zzso This technique gives zzso results and good zzso sensitivity with zzso zzso With an average isolation rate of zzso only 7 zzso of blood is required, making the method suitable for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity is stable in blood samples kept for zzso at room temperature and in isolated zzso stored for 48 h at zzso degrees zzso We validated the method by comparing median zzso activity in 10 healthy volunteers zzso zzso and in 10 liver transplant patients zzso zzso zzso The relation between zzso activity and zzso blood zzso was also zzso
