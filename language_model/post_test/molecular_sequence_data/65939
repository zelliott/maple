Experimental zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso T zzso mouse model of zzso heart zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso is a zzso disease, zzso 21 days after zzso H chain zzso zzso zzso and largely resolving zzso In zzso mice, however, zzso is exacerbated and shows a chronic progressive disease zzso We found that this progressive disease course paralleled persistently elevated zzso release from T cells zzso the hearts of zzso mice 30 days after zzso In fact, zzso promoted the recruitment of zzso zzso the major zzso cells in zzso In turn, zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso T cell responses zzso in zzso In zzso injection of zzso but not zzso zzso suppressed zzso T cells, and zzso the progressive disease course in zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell lines, together with zzso zzso T cells protected zzso mice from zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso play a dual role in zzso as a major cellular zzso of zzso inflammation and as zzso of an zzso negative feedback loop zzso disease zzso
