High mobility group 1 zzso protein is an abundant and zzso component of zzso zzso and has been proposed to play a structural role in zzso organization, possibly similar to that of zzso zzso However, a high abundance of zzso had also been reported in the zzso and on the surface of zzso zzso We zzso show that zzso is a nuclear zzso since several different zzso zzso stain the zzso of cultured cells, and zzso zzso is localized in the nucleus zzso The protein is excluded from zzso and is not associated to specific nuclear structures but rather appears to be zzso zzso zzso can bind in zzso to zzso core zzso but is not zzso associated to zzso in live zzso At zzso zzso is detached from condensed zzso contrary to zzso zzso During zzso zzso readily zzso out of zzso after zzso of the nuclear zzso with detergents, whereas zzso zzso remains associated to zzso These properties exclude a shared function for zzso and zzso in differentiated cells, in spite of their similar zzso zzso zzso may be zzso associated only to a very minor population of zzso or may interact zzso with zzso during dynamic processes of zzso zzso
