In the absence of zzso data, the mechanism of nitrogen transfer from zzso in zzso zzso zzso remains under active zzso Surprisingly, the zzso AS from zzso coli zzso appears to lack a zzso zzso zzso necessary for nitrogen transfer if the reaction proceeds by the accepted zzso in other zzso zzso but retains the ability to zzso zzso We propose an alternative mechanism for nitrogen transfer in zzso which zzso the requirement for participation of zzso in this zzso Our hypothesis may also be more generally zzso to other zzso zzso
