The promoter sequences of a zzso zzso protein gene zzso of zzso zzso were identified using promoter deletion and substitution zzso A zzso strategy was used to zzso the zzso in zzso The promoter architecture of zzso is complex and is more similar to that of zzso protein genes in mouse than in zzso zzso Six regions were identified as important for zzso These included two zzso a zzso repeat and a zzso box, that are zzso in most other promoters of zzso zzso zzso protein genes and have also been demonstrated as being required for zzso from the 40 S zzso promoter by zzso zzso I in zzso The zzso repeats located at zzso to zzso and between zzso and zzso were functionally redundant and increased zzso efficiency by zzso to zzso zzso The zzso boxes located at zzso to zzso and at zzso to zzso contributed zzso and zzso to zzso efficiency, zzso An unidentified element between zzso and zzso contributed zzso while a zzso region between zzso and zzso influenced the start point of zzso
