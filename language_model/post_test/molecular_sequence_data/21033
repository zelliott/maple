During human pregnancy, a circulating form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often termed zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso It is proposed that circulating zzso plays an important role in regulating the circulating levels of zzso and/or zzso during zzso We assessed the zzso and maternal profile of global zzso knock out zzso No differences in the zzso profile were observed, with normal zzso period, litter size and zzso zzso However, western zzso analysis of pregnant mouse serum, failed to detect zzso a result which was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso A review of the literature revealed that the presence of zzso in the maternal circulation during pregnancy has been only reported in zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso identified as the zzso site for the release of soluble zzso is restricted to members of the zzso zzso Therefore the absence of zzso from the circulation in mice, and other species during pregnancy, is due to the inability of a zzso to cleave zzso zzso to produce a soluble form of the zzso Given the expression of zzso in areas of the brain associated with zzso modulated maternal behavior, we also investigated whether the zzso global knockout mice had improved maternal zzso Using standard tests to assess maternal behavior, including pup zzso feeding and nurturing, no differences between knock out and wild type zzso were zzso In conclusion, the zzso significance of circulating zzso during human pregnancy cannot be addressed by investigations on zzso
