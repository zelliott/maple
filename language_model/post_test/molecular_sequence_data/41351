zzso is a common disease that affects the zzso tissue supporting the zzso This disease is attributed to multiple risk factors, including diabetes, cigarette smoking, alcohol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a protein involved in the detection of bacterial zzso zzso and has also been associated with zzso This study investigates the single zzso zzso zzso region, zzso of the human zzso zzso gene as well as the zzso region of the zzso gene in subjects with chronic zzso 

Blood samples from zzso healthy subjects and zzso patients were zzso DNA was extracted from the blood and was used to perform restriction digest at the zzso zzso site of zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso site zzso of zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on soluble samples to determine the protein zzso 

The control and patient groups expressed zzso and 38% zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The A zzso frequency of the control group was zzso while the patient blood group was zzso The mean zzso protein levels of the control and patient samples were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso in healthy subjects was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso patients were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso protein expression determined by zzso showed a mean protein level of the control samples at zzso and the patient blood samples at zzso with a p value of zzso study demonstrated that patients suffering from chronic zzso present more commonly with the zzso zzso on the zzso gene and the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 

This study purely investigated the association between zzso and one zzso site on both zzso and zzso zzso with the purpose of expanding knowledge for the future development in diagnostic markers or therapeutic interventions to combat this zzso
