Species with broad ecological zzso with respect to a key focal resource, niche zzso should maintain larger and more connected populations than niche specialists, leading to the prediction that zzso diversity will be lower and more subdivided in specialists relative to their zzso zzso This logic describes the zzso variation hypothesis zzso Some zzso species of zzso zzso use a variety of zzso zzso zzso and have high molecular zzso By contrast, zzso zzso lives in a strict association and synchronized life cycle with its zzso host, the shield bug zzso zzso itself a diet zzso Here, we characterize sequence variation for 20 nuclear zzso to investigate how zzso zzso life history shapes zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso has more than zzso lower zzso than other zzso zzso species, but that local populations are not genetically zzso zzso with its restricted range, we propose that its specialist host association contributes to a smaller effective population size and lower genetic variation than host zzso zzso species with zzso zzso zzso A literature survey of diverse organisms provides broader support for the zzso These findings encourage further testing of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses with comparative population zzso in zzso and other zzso
