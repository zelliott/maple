We have cloned the mouse zzso growth factor II zzso gene as a series of overlapping zzso and zzso zzso and have characterized its six zzso The gene extends over approximately 12 zzso of mouse zzso 7 and is located 18 zzso 3' to the insulin 2 gene and in the same zzso zzso zzso 1-3 zzso distinct zzso untranslated regions and are transcribed by three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso into three zzso zzso sharing common coding and 3' untranslated zzso zzso zzso and zzso each contain a zzso box and appear to direct zzso from single initiation zzso By contrast, zzso 1 has three major zzso start sites distributed over 556 zzso and zzso lacks a zzso region and other typical zzso control zzso zzso 4-6 code for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 6 also contains a zzso 3' untranslated region which ends at a single zzso zzso In addition to six functional zzso zzso we identified two zzso zzso which appear to be zzso retained remnants of an alternative zzso cassette that is active in human zzso Loss of the zzso of this promoter, which directs zzso expression of the zzso gene in some human zzso may explain the disappearance of this growth factor from most zzso zzso in the early zzso zzso
