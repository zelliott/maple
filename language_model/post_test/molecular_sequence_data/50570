zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso react with both zzso and zzso zzso a pattern of zzso defined as the zzso zzso and zzso to involve either a distinctive zzso zzso or a duplicated zzso zzso From zzso characterization of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso we now demonstrate that the zzso zzso with these zzso is solely due to the zzso zzso and not to an zzso zzso Furthermore, isolation and characterization of zzso zzso from cells expressing zzso strongly suggest that zzso reactions are directed against the product of a conventional zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso correlate with its zzso primary structure, which is identical to that of zzso except in the alpha 1 zzso where it is identical to both zzso and zzso The structure, distribution and genetic linkage of zzso indicate it is of recent, Asian origin and is the result of a gene conversion, involving zzso as the donor gene and zzso as the zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso neither zzso to a novel zzso zzso nor a duplicated zzso zzso but to a combination of zzso contributed by linked zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence we previously and erroneously attributed to a distinct zzso zzso is now demonstrated to zzso zzso Isolation of the zzso clone with this sequence from a library made from a cell zzso for the zzso zzso was probably an zzso of zzso
