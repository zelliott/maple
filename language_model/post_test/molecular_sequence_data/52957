The zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein binds specifically to the zzso zzso and is also thought to associate with one or more zzso in the zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is a specific example of a common situation in zzso where a single protein domain can interact with multiple zzso Are these different interactions related zzso To probe this point, zzso display was employed to isolate peptides from a library based solely on their ability to bind zzso protein in zzso zzso protein association is shown to be highly specific and of moderate zzso The zzso zzso peptides compete with the native zzso domain for the zzso suggesting that they bind to the same zzso It was then asked if these peptides could function as zzso zzso in zzso when zzso to a DNA binding zzso Indeed, this is the zzso Furthermore, one of the zzso peptides binds directly to a domain of the zzso zzso a known zzso The fact that zzso peptides are functional zzso zzso argues that zzso binding and zzso binding are intimately related zzso This zzso zzso approach should be generally useful for probing the chemical relationship of different binding interactions or functions of a given native zzso
