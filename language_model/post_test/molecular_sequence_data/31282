The 15 zzso acids which zzso the sequence of the envelope zzso protein in the yellow fever virus zzso zzso precursor have been proposed to function as a signal zzso for the E protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Girard and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To confirm this hypothesis, zzso zzso zzso were constructed in which the sequence of the E zzso or that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were placed immediately downstream of and in frame with the sequence of the putative signal zzso under the control of the late zzso zzso The E protein expressed by the hybrid virus zzso was recognized by two zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso envelope zzso In this zzso the E protein was deleted of its zzso zzso zzso zzso as expected, the protein appeared to be efficiently transported along the zzso zzso and zzso into the cell culture zzso In addition, when the putative signal zzso was fused in frame with zzso zzso zzso the expressed zzso zzso was targeted to the zzso zzso where it underwent zzso
