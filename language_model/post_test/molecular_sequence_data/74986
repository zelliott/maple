We have identified, in zzso virus zzso cells, the product of the gene predicted to code for the zzso analog of the zzso zzso virus major zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso gene has the potential to code for a protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso (a zzso zzso To detect the zzso a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of the putative open reading frame was zzso and used to prepare zzso in zzso The resulting zzso reacted specifically in Western zzso analysis and zzso with a single zzso zzso found in zzso zzso The specific zzso of the zzso with the zzso zzso was inhibited by the addition of synthetic zzso zzso studies with the zzso as probe for the zzso zzso suggested that this zzso is located predominantly within the zzso of infected zzso Analysis of proteins that bind to zzso DNA immobilized on cellulose zzso indicated that 30 to 50% of the zzso zzso is capable of interacting with zzso DNA and that this interaction is overcome with zzso M zzso Thus, we have prepared a specific zzso zzso that identifies a zzso zzso protein whose properties are similar to those of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso
