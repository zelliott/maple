In this study, genes of the zzso commune zzso and zzso zzso zzso are shown to be within a few zzso of each zzso The region between the nearest zzso and zzso genes contains many short direct zzso zzso zzso acid sequences and activity zzso of three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso specificity are presented along with a zzso of zzso activity of many previously reported zzso commune zzso zzso This analysis showed that zzso commune zzso belong to five zzso Several zzso activate both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso a phenomenon previously zzso zzso from mating tests and DNA zzso led to the cloning of zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar in sequence to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and functionally identical to zzso These data begin to zzso the enigmatic zzso patterns previously encountered at the B zzso zzso
