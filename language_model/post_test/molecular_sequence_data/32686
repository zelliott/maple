A screening of soil samples for zzso acid zzso zzso activity led to the isolation and identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso of the zzso zzso the gene sequence was determined and designated zzso An alignment of the deduced primary structure with zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso from zzso zzso contains five of six zzso zzso the zzso type 1 zzso targeting signal that is typical for zzso from zzso origin is zzso The zzso gene was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had a specific activity of 180 U zzso zzso for zzso and was slightly inhibited in the presence of zzso Mainly, basic and zzso zzso acids were oxidized by the strictly zzso zzso After a high cell density zzso zzso zzso zzso U of zzso were obtained from 15 zzso of zzso zzso
