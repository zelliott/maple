zzso and various molecules in zzso are localized at precise locations to perform their respective functions, especially in synaptic zzso Among synaptic zzso zzso domain proteins play major roles in scaffolding and zzso membrane proteins for efficient synaptic zzso In the present study, we isolated zzso a novel protein zzso zzso consisting of three zzso zzso and a zzso region, which is widely expressed in the central nervous zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns demonstrate that zzso is expressed strongly in certain types of zzso zzso zzso cells in layers zzso of the cerebral cortex, projecting zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso The results of zzso zzso and electron zzso revealed that zzso is localized both in zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family that plays important roles in the molecular organization of proteins at zzso zzso was shown to zzso with zzso along the zzso processes of zzso In view of its direct association with zzso zzso may be involved in the formation of zzso scaffolding proteins complex to facilitate synaptic transmission in the zzso
