An zzso site in DNA creates a strong block to DNA zzso and is a zzso base zzso In this study, we present structural and dynamic properties of duplex zzso containing G, C and T opposite a model zzso site studied by one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso We have demonstrated that A opposite the zzso site was positioned within the zzso as if paired with zzso and that the A zzso melted zzso with the surrounding zzso We report here that G opposite the zzso site is also observed to be predominantly zzso in a normal anti zzso at low zzso With increasing temperature, the mobility of the G zzso increases rapidly and apparently is in a zzso zzso well before zzso of the zzso At low temperature, two species are found for T opposite the zzso zzso one, zzso one zzso These species are in slow exchange with one another on a zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The two species then move into fast exchange with increasing temperature and the proportion of the zzso form zzso When C is positioned opposite the zzso site, both the C zzso and the zzso sugar are zzso the zzso collapses, and the adjacent zzso zzso stack over one zzso On the basis of these zzso we propose a model that explains why the zzso site acts to block DNA zzso Further, we suggest an explanation for the observed zzso preference for base selection at zzso zzso
