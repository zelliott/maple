The identification and characterization of truncated forms of goat zzso zzso A and E are zzso The two zzso which have experimental Mr values of 24 183 and 24 227 zzso were detected as minor components in a goat milk sample from an zzso breed of southern Italy, zzso zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso performed by zzso zzso zzso with zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso chains zzso to the zzso sequence of mature zzso zzso A zzso with Mr of 24 183 zzso and E zzso with Mr of 24 227 zzso zzso These components seem to be the product of a differential zzso of zzso zzso during the translation process of the zzso zzso A and zzso
