The presence of an zzso zzso in different zzso species and in the deeper branching species zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that the presence of the zzso zzso is a primitive character of the zzso that was acquired through horizontal gene transfer zzso However, the presence of a bacterial type zzso was reported in two newly identified zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two different scenarios can explain this finding, either the recent replacement of the ancestral zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a newly acquired zzso zzso or a long-term persistence of both F and A type zzso in the zzso which would imply several independent losses of the zzso zzso in the zzso Using zzso with redundant zzso sequencing and Southern zzso zzso we tried to confirm the presence of an zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and determine its zzso zzso zzso experiments appeared to confirm the presence of an zzso zzso in zzso zzso that was similar to the zzso found in zzso However, further experiments revealed that the detection of an zzso was due to a culture zzso For all the zzso and zzso species surveyed, including zzso zzso cultures that were free of contamination only contained an zzso zzso zzso
