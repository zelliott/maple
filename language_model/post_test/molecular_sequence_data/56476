Several groups have shown a relationship between the insulin zzso and zzso G zzso zzso An zzso zzso to a zzso sequence zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was used to investigate this relationship by zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 zzso insulin for 1 h and fixed for zzso zzso zzso zzso stained with zzso were labeled at the cell surface at a much higher density than control zzso zzso zzso of zzso and control cells was followed by PAGE and Western blots of the plasma membrane and zzso zzso with zzso The density of the bands did not change in response to insulin zzso zzso to zzso zzso sequences of the alpha zzso were used for zzso zzso and no difference was noted between zzso and control zzso These results indicated that zzso was detecting a zzso change in the structure of zzso zzso in the plasma membrane in response to zzso This zzso of the zzso zzso was also seen in response to treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also unmasked the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso an zzso of zzso G proteins zzso did not induce an zzso of the zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that some of zzso effects are zzso through zzso proteins in zzso
