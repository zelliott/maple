The specificity of the T zzso repertoire at the level of individual zzso zzso could play a fundamental role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso genetic zzso and zzso core structure of two zzso yet zzso zzso T cell zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso After zzso with two peptides zzso zzso 45 to 64 and 61 to 80, vigorous in zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso were zzso in five different strains of zzso mice zzso indicating that both zzso were recognized in a genetically zzso zzso When zzso with intact zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from the same mouse strains responded to both zzso with the exception of zzso mice, which did not respond to zzso zzso hypersensitivity responses in zzso zzso mice were zzso by zzso only, whereas in zzso mice both peptides were zzso hypersensitivity negative, despite zzso pronounced zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso responses of human zzso in zzso protein zzso healthy subjects and tuberculosis patients revealed significant differences in the zzso to the two zzso All zzso protein zzso healthy and diseased individuals zzso strong responses to zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso In contrast, pronounced responses to zzso were detected only in patients with zzso zzso zzso core structures, composed of 6 or 7 zzso within each zzso have been mapped with peptides of overlapping zzso zzso for both zzso the core sequences recognized by both human and zzso T cells were almost zzso We conclude that despite many similarities between zzso and human T cell zzso recognition, distinct differences in the responsiveness of the infected host could play a role in zzso Furthermore, the genetically zzso nature of the identified zzso is a potentially important attribute for the development of zzso diagnostic zzso and zzso
