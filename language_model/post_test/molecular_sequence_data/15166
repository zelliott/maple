zzso signaling controls a variety of cellular zzso including cell growth, zzso and zzso Upon zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso or 5, is zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains one zzso cluster and the zzso zzso both of which are essential for propagation of the zzso While the zzso zzso motifs are known to directly inhibit zzso the zzso role of the zzso zzso cluster remains to be zzso zzso we reveal that the zzso cluster plays an important role in the zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, we observe that zzso activity on the zzso motif requires a high zzso zzso close to that of the zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso zzso cluster serves as a zzso site for zzso to promote the zzso of the zzso zzso Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanism for the initial events of the zzso zzso
