zzso deformation of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso caused by a prolonged increase in blood pressure zzso in zzso results in an zzso zzso of the vessel wall that is characterized by zzso zzso or zzso and contributes to fixation of the increase in blood zzso The onset of this process is characterized by a unique change in gene expression in the zzso However, thus far, no zzso factor has been identified that specifically mediates zzso gene expression in these zzso zzso the role of a putative zzso the zzso protein zzso was investigated in rat zzso cultured zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed that on exposure to zzso stretch, but not to zzso stress or treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso from focal zzso and accumulates in the zzso Unlike zzso zzso another focal zzso zzso did not zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein abundance suggested that zzso zzso in the nucleus is a prerequisite for zzso gene expression in these zzso Thus, zzso zzso B zzso zzso for example, was zzso whereas that of zzso was zzso after zzso zzso The data are consistent with a role for zzso in zzso mechanical stimuli from the cell membrane to the nucleus in vascular zzso and in controlling the expression of zzso genes that have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso
