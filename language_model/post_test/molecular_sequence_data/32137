zzso diversity of zzso sludge after extended contact with long chain fatty acids zzso was studied using molecular zzso zzso containing high amounts of accumulated zzso were obtained after continuous loading of two zzso with zzso or with zzso These sludge samples were then incubated in batch zzso to allow degradation of the zzso zzso In addition, sludge used as zzso for the zzso was also zzso zzso zzso of the different samples were monitored using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso analysis showed changes in bacterial and zzso communities during zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences of 22 zzso representing the zzso bacteria and zzso were zzso Most bacterial clones zzso clustered within the zzso Two major groups of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso organisms, closely related to zzso and zzso organisms closely related to zzso and zzso zzso by FISH and real-time zzso showed that the relative abundance of zzso increased during degradation of zzso zzso These results provide insight into the importance and dynamics of balanced communities of bacteria and zzso in zzso zzso
