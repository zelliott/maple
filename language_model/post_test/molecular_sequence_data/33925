zzso zzso are widely distributed and common zzso of birds, and the application of molecular techniques has revealed remarkable diversity among their zzso Four zzso zzso zzso avian hosts zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso is split into two zzso based on zzso evidence and zzso support for two divergent sister zzso One zzso zzso zzso contains zzso developing in birds belonging to several different orders, except pigeons and zzso zzso while the other zzso zzso has previously been shown to only zzso dove zzso Here we provide molecular and zzso identification of zzso zzso from several zzso species that are closely related to those found in dove zzso We also document a deeply divergent zzso with two zzso lineages recovered primarily from zzso zzso zzso that is sister to the zzso transmitted dove zzso One of the lineages in this new zzso of zzso belongs to zzso zzso and is distributed in two species of zzso zzso hosts from Hawaii, the Galapagos Islands, the eastern Pacific and throughout the Caribbean zzso zzso zzso are often considered rare in seabirds due in part to the lack or low activity of some zzso zzso zzso zzso biting zzso in marine and coastal zzso however, we show that zzso zzso is prevalent and is very likely zzso among zzso by zzso flies which are abundant on zzso and other zzso This study supports the existence of two sister zzso of avian zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso of avian zzso zzso of zzso zzso from Galapagos zzso minor is given based on zzso of blood stages and segments of the zzso zzso b zzso which can be used for zzso This study shows that zzso flies warrant more attention as zzso of avian zzso zzso particularly in marine and coastal zzso
