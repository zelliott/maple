zzso zzso of zzso syndrome gene zzso carriers to zzso zzso of the gastrointestinal tract as well as to cancer of different organ zzso Although zzso syndrome patients frequently present with zzso of the zzso stomach, small zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso appear to be rare in the sporadic tumor types thus far studied zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso To evaluate whether zzso zzso of zzso contribute to the zzso of yet zzso tumor types, we screened 14 cell lines and 129 tumor specimens from different zzso for a genetic zzso in zzso Six melanoma and eight myeloma cell lines were scrutinized for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso No changes were found in the coding zzso sequence and zzso zzso Next, we analyzed 12 zzso 8 zzso 12 zzso zzso cell, 26 zzso 28 zzso 24 soft zzso and 19 zzso tumors by zzso zzso zzso zzso Three changes in zzso coding zzso sequence were zzso One base pair deletion at zzso and zzso substitution by T occurred in a cervical zzso sample, resulting in a zzso and premature stop zzso at position zzso zzso of zzso by T occurred in a lung zzso sample, resulting in the change of zzso acid at position zzso to zzso A loss of another zzso was detected in this zzso One silent change, zzso was found in a pancreatic zzso zzso The changes were not present in the matched normal tissue DNA zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso is a rare event in most sporadic tumor zzso
