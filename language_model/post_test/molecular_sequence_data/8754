The zzso zzso factor is a member of the zzso gene family of regulatory zzso These molecules play a role in normal development and also have been implicated in zzso processes such as the development of zzso zzso The zzso proteins share a zzso zzso domain (the zzso zzso that recognizes a zzso sequence with the core zzso zzso This domain binds to DNA as a zzso unlike many other zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso factor has been zzso in complex with a zzso pair zzso that contains the recognition zzso The zzso formed in the space group C2 with a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, and beta zzso zzso degrees and zzso to at least zzso zzso There are two complexes in the zzso zzso zzso of large usable zzso was dependent on the length of both protein and DNA zzso the use of zzso with zzso A and T bases at the zzso and the presence of zzso zzso and zinc zzso in the zzso zzso This is the first zzso domain to be zzso and the strategy used to crystallize this complex may be useful for other members of the zzso zzso
