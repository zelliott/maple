The zzso signaling zzso plays a prominent role during zzso development but it is also involved in zzso zzso We investigated the zzso status of the zzso zzso in a set of zzso zzso of the skin and zzso tumors as an alternative to zzso causes of the zzso zzso Our aim was to define a possible role of genetic and/or zzso mechanisms of zzso signal zzso in the development of these zzso zzso DNA from tumors and from matched healthy tissue was amplified by a specific zzso and the zzso regions of the zzso promoter were zzso Two promoter regions showed statistically significant zzso compared to healthy controls in zzso zzso more significantly in the region in the vicinity of zzso sites and less significantly in the region containing the zzso zzso But, in zzso zzso of the skin we observed no difference in zzso suggesting different mechanisms of zzso in these zzso
