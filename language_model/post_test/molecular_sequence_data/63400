The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes 12 zzso colonization factors of the zzso zzso assembly zzso however, the binding specificity is known for only one of these zzso known as type 1 zzso Here we explored the utility of zzso to determine the zzso binding specificity of zzso zzso from zzso zzso A zzso carrying the zzso zzso was introduced into zzso coli and expression of zzso filaments composed of zzso confirmed by flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso from the surface of zzso coli, and the resulting preparation was shown to contain zzso as the sole major protein zzso The binding of zzso zzso zzso to a zzso suggested that this zzso specifically binds the zzso zzso also known as the Lewis X zzso blood group zzso zzso from the zzso were validated by zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso bound zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso could be inhibited by zzso with soluble zzso zzso Our results establish zzso analysis as a promising new approach for determining the zzso binding specificity of bacterial zzso
