zzso zzso levels in the seed are critical for the supply of a balanced diet for feed and zzso Currently, animal feed is supplemented with chemically zzso zzso which could be completely replaced with naturally zzso zzso However, insufficient levels of zzso are due to zzso of two genes in the zzso zzso that are expressed during seed development, which have a high percentage of zzso zzso ranging from 23 to zzso while free zzso is very zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso belong to the zzso gene family that arose during the evolution of the grasses and were duplicated during a whole zzso zzso zzso We have found several zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused either by zzso zzso or frame shift zzso zzso seeds with zzso zzso of both genes have a normal zzso in contrast to other zzso zzso explaining the zzso of zzso zzso in normal breeding zzso Moreover, the zzso of these genes deviates from zzso zzso One zzso of the regulatory locus zzso is inherited in a zzso fashion, while another zzso appears to prevent zzso segregation of the zzso zzso in zzso
