zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently isolated from zzso zzso zzso cases zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso as the zzso agent of a lethal zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed a zzso zzso structure of the viral zzso This consisted of a central zzso core of vaccine origin flanked by two units of zzso zzso The first zzso zzso unit spanned the whole zzso zzso region, and the second one almost the entire zzso zzso region and the 3' zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso sequence similarities in the 3' and zzso unidentified regions indicated that the viral zzso were zzso species, suggesting zzso between a zzso and a wild zzso The zzso zzso could not be identified among the investigated wild zzso zzso in the same geographical zzso This is the first report of a natural zzso event occurring in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso for transgenic mice and the zzso for humans of the zzso suggested that the modular zzso organization of this virus might have zzso a selective advantage over its vaccine zzso
