The zzso zzso zzso has previously been introduced into the zzso rumen to increase microbial degradation of plant cell wall zzso The functional effect of an introduced zzso depends on its ability to establish in the zzso zzso and signature zzso can be used as a tool to track and zzso introduced zzso The purpose of this current study was to develop an zzso signature probe targeting the zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso of a putative zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso strain zzso from the rumen of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene ITS of three zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso The ITS region has been reported to vary more between closely related bacteria compared to the widely used zzso zzso zzso and a high degree of sequence zzso was indeed detected between the three zzso strains zzso Based on observed sequence differences, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeting the ITS region of the zzso zzso isolate zzso were zzso zzso specificity was evaluated in dot zzso zzso with zzso zzso isolate zzso and four other zzso zzso The probe zzso gave positive signals for the zzso zzso isolate zzso only, while probe zzso gave positive signals for zzso zzso isolate zzso as well as for zzso zzso zzso The result of zzso with the probe zzso indicates that the probe is specific for the zzso zzso strain zzso amongst the four zzso tested, and is promising for further studies using it as a signature probe for tracking this strain when zzso to the zzso zzso
