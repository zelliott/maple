zzso zzso binding sites zzso are often tightly clustered with other zzso factor binding zzso Examples of this occur upstream of the genes for chicken zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso in several zzso zzso and upstream of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso In the TO zzso sequences immediately upstream of a zzso zzso binding site are required for steroid induction and contain a zzso identical to that found in the beta zzso zzso Here we demonstrate specific binding to this zzso element and show that it will also act zzso with a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso The response to zzso is independent of the order and relative orientation of these elements but does depend on their precise zzso zzso induction occurs at a zzso of approximately 10 base pairs zzso indicating a requirement for zzso zzso zzso to the zzso box, however, is not affected by its distance from the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the observed zzso is zzso by zzso interactions and does not depend on cooperative DNA zzso
