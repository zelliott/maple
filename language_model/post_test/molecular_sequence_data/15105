zzso family proteins regulate zzso through their zzso and zzso By protein sequence analysis and structural comparison, we have identified a zzso zzso core at the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso family zzso The zzso core is stabilized by zzso interactions among the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso core can promote the protein unfolding and pore formation in synthetic zzso zzso Interestingly, though the zzso core does not participate in binding with zzso domain of zzso zzso disruption of the zzso core can reduce the affinity of zzso with zzso zzso by changing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso that are involved in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding affinity and pore forming propensity of zzso were correlated to its zzso activity, which provides new information to help study the regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso Meanwhile, as the zzso are zzso in the zzso core, in zzso binding zzso based on zzso of zzso can be devised to screen for new zzso targeting zzso proteins as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso
