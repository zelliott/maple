Development of the zzso eye has been found to require the activity of several genes zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso Some of these zzso or portions zzso are highly zzso across zzso In this paper, we report the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and anterior neural fold zzso whose expression pattern suggests an important role in eye zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso comprises a protein with a zzso zzso as well as the zzso that is found in many zzso zzso zzso In addition, in the C zzso of zzso we found a zzso domain that we have named the zzso zzso This domain is also found in several other zzso zzso In the early mouse zzso zzso is expressed in the anterior neural fold, including areas that will give rise to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Once the zzso zzso form, zzso expression is restricted to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso At later zzso zzso expression is found only in the developing zzso After birth, the expression of zzso is restricted to the zone of zzso cells within the zzso and expression gradually decreases as proliferation zzso These findings suggest that zzso is one of the molecules that define the eye field during early development and that it has a role in the proliferation and/or differentiation of retinal zzso
