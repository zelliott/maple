Sex steroids, including testosterone, play a major role in determining peak bone mass in zzso and the subsequent loss of total bone mass with advancing zzso zzso and its active zzso zzso zzso bind with high affinity to the zzso zzso zzso a member of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso These receptors function as zzso factors, binding together with accessory proteins to specific DNA response elements in the promoters of zzso responsive zzso To further characterize zzso function in a model species of relevance to bone and pharmaceutical research, we cloned a partial canine zzso from a canine kidney zzso library and then cloned the remaining zzso segment by zzso from canine zzso prostate zzso The complete sequence obtained was zzso zzso This sequence contained a single open reading frame of zzso zzso potentially zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the protein zzso by this open reading frame reveals that the modular zzso providing the DNA binding and zzso binding functions are identical to those reported for eight other zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso from zzso prostate revealed three very low abundance transcripts of approximately 9 zzso and zzso analysis showed relatively high expression of zzso in canine zzso zzso zzso and zzso with lower levels zzso in zzso skeletal muscle, heart, and zzso Competition binding studies using zzso as zzso demonstrated specific displacement by zzso testosterone, and the anabolic steroid zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in the stimulation of an zzso zzso reporter following zzso with the canine zzso into zzso zzso zzso using an zzso directed to the zzso 19 zzso acids of the human zzso showed strong zzso of the zzso zzso cells in canine zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that we have cloned the canine zzso and that its functional DNA binding and zzso binding zzso are absolutely zzso with those reported for eight other zzso
