Recent findings of new genes in fish related to the prion protein zzso gene zzso including our recent report of zzso coding for zzso zzso protein found also in zzso raise issues of their function and zzso Here we report additional novel fish genes found in public databases, including a duplicated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and we use comparative zzso analysis to analyze the evolutionary relationships and to zzso evolutionary zzso of the complete data zzso zzso zzso performed on aligned human, zzso and zzso zzso genes to define candidate regulatory promoter regions, detected 16 zzso zzso three of which are known zzso zzso sites for a zzso and zzso factors specific to or associated with expression in zzso This result and other zzso zzso global zzso zzso protein sequence alignment and zzso and zzso zzso zzso relative gene order and zzso criteria indicate fish and zzso zzso genes are zzso and suggest a strongly zzso basic function in zzso Whereas zzso zzso share context with the analogous zzso gene in fish, their sequences are diverged, suggesting that the zzso and fish genes are likely to have significantly different zzso zzso analysis predicts the zzso zzso occurred before divergence of fish from zzso whereas that of zzso and zzso occurred in zzso Whereas Sho appears to have a zzso function in zzso brain, zzso seems to have an zzso role fine-tuned in a zzso zzso An evolutionary model consistent with our findings and literature knowledge is proposed that has an ancestral zzso zzso gene leading to all zzso zzso and zzso zzso This provides a new framework for exploring the evolution of this unusual family of proteins and for searching for members in other fish branches and intermediate zzso zzso
