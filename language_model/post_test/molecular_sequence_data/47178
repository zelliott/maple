A pig zzso zzso strain zzso was characterized by using reverse zzso zzso and direct sequencing of the zzso A zzso of 74 zzso was found at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region, which was also found in zzso zzso from zzso from two other pigs from the same zzso When the zzso was zzso the zzso NC region showed zzso similarity to bovine viral zzso virus zzso strain zzso and zzso to zzso strain zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso NC region of strain H was maintained after zzso in different cell lines and is not common for zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso analysis based on the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene of strain H confirmed the findings of the zzso NC region and show that this strain belongs to the zzso zzso These results show for the first time zzso in the zzso NC region of a zzso
