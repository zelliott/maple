We report here the first zzso and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso a strict zzso which produces methane and grows at pressure of 200 zzso and an optimum temperature near 85 degrees zzso zzso DNA fragments containing the structural gene for zzso zzso were cloned into an expression zzso zzso to form zzso The zzso zzso was zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso of total soluble zzso when induced with zzso zzso The protein was zzso by heat treatment (to zzso zzso coli zzso followed by zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein had a zzso structure composed of identical zzso and the zzso of the zzso determined by gel zzso was zzso Based on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso the zzso zzso was 36, zzso The zzso for zzso zzso was zzso The zzso constant zzso for zzso was zzso zzso and was 92 zzso for zzso The zzso was zzso units zzso The optimal temperature for zzso zzso activity was zzso degrees zzso
