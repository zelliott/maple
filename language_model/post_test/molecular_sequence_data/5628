zzso oxide zzso zzso are classified zzso based on whether zzso binding is zzso zzso or zzso zzso This key zzso has not been defined at the molecular zzso Here we show that zzso zzso contain a unique zzso insert in their zzso binding zzso which is not shared with zzso or other related zzso Previously identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso raise the possibility that the zzso insert is the zzso domain of zzso zzso with this possibility, three-dimensional molecular modeling suggested that the insert originates from a site immediately adjacent to the zzso binding zzso zzso peptides derived from the zzso acid insert of zzso zzso were found to zzso inhibit binding of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was associated with zzso binding to zzso rather than free zzso and zzso could be reversed by increasing zzso zzso In contrast, zzso peptides did not interfere with the zzso site of zzso as assessed from zzso zzso nor did they zzso effect zzso zzso Limited zzso studies showed that zzso ability to gate electron flow through zzso is associated with displacement of the insert zzso this is the first specific zzso change in zzso zzso to be zzso Together, our findings strongly suggest that the insert is an zzso control element, zzso with a site on zzso which zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso The zzso control element zzso defines zzso and offers a unique target for developing novel zzso zzso and zzso
