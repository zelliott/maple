The zzso of the zzso initiation factor 2 zzso is a key component of the translation machinery of the zzso In response to cellular stress such as viral infections, zzso is zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso leading to the zzso of cellular protein zzso The importance of zzso as a regulatory mechanism for protein synthesis is illustrated by the wide variety of strategies employed by viruses to zzso zzso Thus, zzso virus encodes zzso zzso which resembles zzso and acts as a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso of zzso zzso necrosis virus zzso a member of the zzso zzso of zzso has revealed an zzso equivalent zzso We have cloned and zzso zzso genes of several zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso open reading frames and deduced proteins of the zzso investigated exhibit a high degree of zzso of both zzso and zzso acid zzso At the zzso the zzso zzso shows significant zzso to the zzso of cellular initiation factor zzso of various species, to full-length zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences of corresponding zzso proteins with zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso has revealed a high conservation of zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso sequences has demonstrated the relationship of these zzso In order to investigate the role of the zzso zzso respective genes have been expressed in zzso and zzso zzso fish and chicken zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein has a molecular weight of 31 zzso and is zzso The cellular and viral protein synthesis of zzso is probably regulated by a mechanism similar to that of zzso zzso zzso 3, the type species of the zzso zzso of zzso has a unique zzso efficiency and, moreover, zzso the cellular protein synthesis of infected zzso
