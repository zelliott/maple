The zzso zzso region of zzso binds various zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso but the zzso role of these interactions is zzso In living nerve zzso the function of the interaction with zzso zzso was zzso zzso contains an zzso domain and is a major zzso binding partner at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso domain or of a zzso zzso containing the zzso binding site inhibited synaptic zzso zzso at the stage of zzso zzso pits, which resulted in an zzso distortion of the synaptic architecture and a depression of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso interactions are required for zzso function and support an essential role of zzso zzso in synaptic zzso zzso
