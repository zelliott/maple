zzso zzso play an important role in numerous biological processes through changes in zzso structure and stability and possibly through mechanisms influenced by zzso modifications unique to a zzso zzso The family of zzso zzso zzso includes members such as zzso the DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we have undertaken the challenge to decipher the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso generally associated with certain forms of condensed zzso such as the inactive X zzso in female zzso By using female human cells as a source of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and analyzed by mass zzso Although zzso is in low abundance compared with conventional zzso we identified a zzso site, zzso which resides within the zzso region of zzso This zzso hinge is an approximately zzso stretch between the zzso and zzso zzso proposed to bind zzso zzso A specific zzso to zzso was zzso by using this zzso zzso zzso was found to be present in both male and female cells and on both zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Although zzso is generally enriched on the inactive X zzso in female cells, zzso is excluded from this zzso zzso Thus, a zzso zzso of zzso appears to play a unique role in zzso regulation beyond X zzso We provide evidence that zzso is enriched in zzso suggestive of a role in the regulation of zzso zzso modifications throughout the cell zzso
