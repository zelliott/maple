zzso encodes a protein zzso related to zzso zzso which functions in several signal zzso pathways in zzso including those involved in zzso and invasive growth, as well as zzso In addition, zzso plays an essential role in cells lacking zzso a zzso with significant zzso to zzso It is not clear how the activity of zzso is regulated in response to these different signals in zzso but it has been demonstrated recently that binding of the small zzso binding protein zzso is able to activate zzso in zzso Here we show that zzso functionally interacts with zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso that can no longer bind zzso were unable to restore growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso They were also defective for zzso growth and zzso invasion, and displayed reduced mating efficiency when zzso with zzso Surprisingly, however, the zzso activity of such zzso zzso was normal when zzso in zzso Furthermore, these zzso were able to fully activate the zzso zzso zzso triggered by mating zzso in zzso suggesting that binding of zzso and zzso was not required to activate zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso as a zzso at emerging buds during zzso growth and at zzso tips in cells arrested with zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso protein unable to bind zzso was found zzso throughout the zzso suggesting that zzso is required to zzso zzso properly in zzso
