A transfer zzso lacking modified zzso was produced by zzso in zzso of a cloned gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso At least three different zzso (in zzso positions 13, 32, and zzso of this transcript zzso are modified to zzso by an extract of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were also constructed that each had only one of these sites, thus allowing specific monitoring of zzso at different zzso zzso Using such zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso producing this zzso were zzso from an extract of zzso zzso The activities corresponding to positions 13, 32, and 55 in the zzso zzso could all be separated zzso indicating that there is a separate zzso for each of these zzso The zzso specific for position 55 zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso approximately zzso using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso
