A zzso zzso gene zzso to zzso zzso zzso factor 1 beta was isolated by screening a zzso DNA library using a zzso zzso zzso as a zzso This zzso was previously obtained by zzso of an expression library with zzso zzso raised against zzso cell wall zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and the whole zzso zzso gene zzso zzso number zzso revealed an zzso open reading frame of zzso base pairs that encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso sequences are highly zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso sequence is less zzso zzso zzso and the predicted zzso acid sequence shares about zzso zzso
