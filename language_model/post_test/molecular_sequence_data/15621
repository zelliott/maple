A zzso zzso DNA zzso based on zzso porous zzso zzso crystal disks is zzso A zzso zzso is generated by zzso etch of a zzso silicon zzso using a programmed zzso zzso A zzso procedure is used to isolate zzso zzso 25 zzso in diameter and 10 zzso thick, which are then zzso modified with a zzso zzso and zzso to various zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso It is shown that the particles can be zzso based on their zzso zzso and that a multiple zzso zzso can be performed in a single sample with a modified zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso both within and across the zzso is also zzso
