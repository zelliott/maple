The zzso tumor zzso zzso domain, a zzso of two primary zzso is an independently folding domain whose zzso consist of a zzso a tight turn and an zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso zzso on three-dimensional structure, we zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso that resulted in zzso zzso having a smaller zzso than zzso 344 switched the zzso of the domain from zzso to zzso The three-dimensional structure of one such zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso When compared with the primary zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain, the zzso zzso showed a switch in zzso packing from zzso to parallel and rotation of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso size is therefore an important zzso of a protein zzso
