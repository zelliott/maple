zzso zzso particles are abundant in extreme geothermal zzso from which five zzso viral species have been isolated to zzso They zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and constitute the zzso a family of zzso DNA zzso Here we present four new members of this family, all from zzso zzso hot zzso Two of the new viruses exhibit a novel zzso for their proposed attachment structures, and specific features of their zzso sequences strongly suggest the identity of the zzso zzso All zzso zzso are highly zzso at the zzso level, although the regions of conservation differ between zzso consistent with a high frequency of zzso zzso having occurred between zzso We propose a zzso specific mechanism for zzso zzso and show that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system are not biased to the highly similar regions of the zzso zzso
