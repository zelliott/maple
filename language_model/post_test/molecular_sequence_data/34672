zzso The differential identification of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is impaired by the zzso zzso of both zzso In the present study, we characterized two zzso rabbit zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso that recognize the zzso region of mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso both zzso detected two major zzso zzso bands at sizes of zzso and zzso zzso in mouse zzso and in zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in kidney zzso In addition, both zzso stained zzso receptors in zzso cells with zzso zzso typical zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso showed zzso to fourfold higher selectivity for its zzso zzso target zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso showed high binding affinity towards its target zzso zzso but also demonstrated high zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso to twofold in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast with the lack of recognition by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso selectively recognized the zzso zzso fused to red zzso protein in zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso we have generated two new zzso zzso to the mouse zzso and zzso receptors zzso and zzso of which the zzso zzso has the capability to distinguish zzso zzso types in zzso zzso
