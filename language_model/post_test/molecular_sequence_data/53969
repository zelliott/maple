Using zzso zzso we have zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso heat shock protein 65 gene zzso from the heart valve of a patient with zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows high similarity to those from zzso confirming that zzso zzso is indeed a member of this zzso Based on the zzso zzso we have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients shown to be positive by zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and/or internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso were also positive by zzso zzso All 33 control specimens from patients without zzso disease and negative for zzso zzso by both zzso zzso zzso and ITS zzso remained zzso All zzso zzso with zzso revealed an identical restriction zzso Eight of the 17 zzso zzso representing all three previously described ITS types were zzso Three of the zzso showed slight differences, but none of the zzso detected affected the zzso acid sequence of the corresponding zzso We conclude that the zzso gene is a suitable target for the specific detection of zzso zzso Its product represents a putative zzso for a future zzso zzso
