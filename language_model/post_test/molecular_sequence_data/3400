The zzso zzso factor zzso is derived from the inactive precursor protein zzso by regulated zzso during the process of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso processing zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso zzso and is held inactive by two other integral membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that the processing zzso and its two regulators exist in a zzso complex that zzso to the membrane surrounding the developing spore (the zzso We further show that one of the regulators, zzso plays a central role in both the formation of this complex and its zzso zzso Evidence is presented in support of a model in which zzso acts as a platform for bringing zzso and zzso together, zzso zzso zzso zzso processing until a signal has been received from the zzso
