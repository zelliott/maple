The duplex zzso contains tandem G zzso A zzso common motif in the secondary structures of biological zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso was derived using molecular dynamics and energy zzso with zzso restraints for 78 zzso distances zzso zzso 18 hydrogen bonds for the six zzso G zzso C pairs, and 26 zzso angles zzso zzso The G zzso A mismatch structures are similar to those observed in a DNA duplex zzso zzso zzso zzso & Wilson, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso and an zzso hairpin zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) Science zzso zzso with hydrogen bonds from zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The other G zzso and A zzso zzso are within zzso distance of a zzso oxygen and zzso zzso Strong zzso zzso and zzso stacking is observed between the G zzso A zzso This contrasts with the poor stacking observed between the G zzso A zzso and closing G zzso C base zzso The stems are basically zzso with all bases in the anti zzso and all zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The structure zzso previous zzso circular zzso and zzso zzso zzso results and suggests tandem G zzso A zzso in zzso may provide a contact site for zzso zzso
