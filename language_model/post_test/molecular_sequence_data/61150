The genes coding for zzso zzso zzso in the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso have been cloned by zzso of a zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed the existence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso chain of 299 zzso acids zzso zzso and a regulatory chain of 170 zzso acids zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso genes showed zzso identity with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso allowing the first detailed studies of an zzso isolated from a zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed the same properties as the zzso zzso in the native zzso It is highly zzso and exhibits zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and positive zzso cooperative interactions for the binding of zzso Moreover, it is activated by zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso alone are zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso coli cells or present in crude extract of the native host have an Mr of 340 zzso as estimated by gel zzso suggesting that it has a zzso structure similar to that of zzso coli zzso Only zzso could be found in extracts of zzso zzso coli or zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso gene zzso In the presence of zzso these zzso assembled into zzso The stability of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso properties of the zzso are discussed in function of a modeling zzso
