The maturation of zzso zzso zzso of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a highly ordered process of development and zzso Information on the molecular basis of this process is, however, zzso Here we report the identification of the first zzso zzso regulatory element using the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso In the adult zzso Ada is highly expressed in the terminally differentiated zzso layer of upper gastrointestinal tract zzso The data reported here represent the identification and detailed analysis of a zzso zzso zzso sequence located zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of the zzso Ada zzso which is sufficient to target cat reporter gene expression to the zzso in transgenic zzso This zzso zzso is capable of directing cat reporter gene expression mainly to the zzso of transgenic mice, with a level comparable to the zzso Ada zzso This expression is localized to the appropriate cell types, zzso copy number zzso and shows the same zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the functional importance of multiple zzso zzso zzso
