The giant panda has an interesting bamboo diet unlike the other species in the order of zzso The zzso taste zzso gene zzso has been identified as a zzso during its zzso sequencing project and confirmed using a different giant panda zzso The estimated zzso time for this gene is about zzso zzso Such zzso coincided with the giant zzso dietary change and also reinforced its zzso life zzso However, as this gene is preserved in zzso such as cow and zzso we need to look for other reasons behind the giant zzso diet zzso 

Since taste is part of the reward properties of food related to its energy and nutrition zzso we did a systematic analysis on those genes involved in the zzso system for the giant zzso We extracted the giant panda sequence information for those genes and compared with the human sequence first and then with seven other species including zzso zzso zzso dog, cat, zzso and zzso zzso in panda were further analyzed based on the coding region, zzso consensus zzso and potential zzso binding of those zzso 

Our results revealed an interesting zzso zzso involvement in the zzso food zzso This finding suggests a new direction for molecular evolution studies behind the zzso dietary zzso
