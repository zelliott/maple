A total of 23 zzso zzso domain zzso sequences were zzso zzso models of the zzso domain of an zzso zzso and of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso based on the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso from the same zzso The completed models and the known structure of the zzso zzso domain were refined by molecular dynamics simulations in zzso All four models were found to be very similar to the structure of the zzso zzso domain and sequence comparison indicated that in general the three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso zzso are very zzso In all the zzso zzso two zzso bridges apparently stabilize the zzso zzso From the models, and additional zzso bridge was predicted in zzso and zzso and in eight further zzso from other zzso Three highly zzso aromatic zzso on the zzso side of the wedge make this surface zzso This surface is expected to make contact with the zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on this flat face are in suitable positions for hydrogen bonding with the cellulose zzso Analysis of the differences in the protein surface properties indicated that the zzso tend to be more zzso than the zzso The largest structural variation was found around positions zzso The zzso zzso sequences are discussed in relation to variations in function and pH zzso zzso of the zzso structures with experimental binding data for the zzso and zzso allowed the zzso of a qualitative relationship to cellulose zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
