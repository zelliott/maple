A novel member of the zzso zzso family has been cloned and the protein expressed and zzso In an effort to identify novel zzso zzso an zzso incorporating neural network zzso was applied to a large zzso zzso A full-length clone was identified that is zzso zzso in length and has a single open reading frame of 225 zzso zzso This new zzso is most zzso to zzso having a similarity and an identity of 46 and zzso respectively, and therefore we have named it zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis identified a zzso zzso zzso that is highly expressed in zzso and peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso and zzso reporter zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Furthermore, the signal zzso zzso for zzso was characterized in the zzso cell line zzso and found to involve zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
