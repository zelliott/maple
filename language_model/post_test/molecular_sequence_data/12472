As part of an overall program to characterize the impact of zzso zzso on the zzso properties of DNA, we report here the results of a comparative zzso and zzso study on a family of DNA duplexes both with and without the zzso zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we have studied a family of eight zzso duplexes of the form zzso or zzso A, zzso or zzso in which zzso is the zzso zzso These eight duplexes, which we designate by the identity of the variable central base pair zzso zzso reflect two zzso four duplexes in which the modified zzso base is positioned opposite each of the four possible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding four zzso duplexes in which the zzso is not modified zzso zzso zzso zzso The data derived from our zzso and zzso zzso on these eight duplexes allow us to evaluate the influence of the zzso zzso as well as the base opposite the zzso on the zzso the zzso and zzso stability, and the melting thermodynamics of the host DNA zzso We find that modification of zzso to zzso zzso does not change the global DNA duplex zzso as judged by circular zzso zzso Despite this structural zzso our data reveal that the zzso to zzso modification does influence duplex zzso and zzso properties, some of which depend on the base opposite the zzso Thus, apparent structural identity does not mean that two duplexes necessarily will exhibit equivalent zzso and/or zzso zzso In general, we find that the zzso effects induced by the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso or by mismatched base pairs zzso zzso vs zzso can result in relatively large changes in zzso which are partially or wholly compensated zzso to produce relatively modest changes in free zzso Our data also suggest that the biologically observed differential recognition of zzso duplexes and the preferential zzso zzso opposite zzso zzso cannot be rationalized simply in terms of large zzso zzso
