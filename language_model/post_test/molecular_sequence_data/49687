We identified four novel zzso in the zzso gene that encodes the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in this gene are associated with two genetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso periodic zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso C and zzso zzso C did not result in zzso acid replacement, the zzso substitution zzso zzso A caused the replacement of the zzso with an zzso zzso and an A zzso was identified in zzso zzso By using methods based on zzso with restriction zzso we calculated the zzso of these novel zzso as well as zzso in normal subjects from southern zzso
