zzso species strain zzso containing two zzso zzso zzso I and zzso II, was found during screening of a bacterial strain collection from zzso These zzso were zzso to functional zzso by sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso I recognizes sequence zzso downward zzso on zzso Unlike zzso I, it zzso DNA at a distance of 8 zzso from the recognized sequence on both chains producing zzso DNA fragments, while zzso zzso I zzso DNA forming zzso zzso protruding zzso Thus, zzso zzso I is a new type II zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The advantage of this new zzso is that the zzso DNA products of this zzso can be inserted without additional treatment into zzso zzso zzso with zzso yielding DNA zzso zzso zzso II recognizes site zzso zzso and thus is an zzso of zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso I is about 35 zzso and that of zzso II is 40 zzso The zzso exhibit zzso activity at 37 degrees zzso The optimal buffer for the reaction is zzso (10 zzso zzso pH zzso 10 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso
