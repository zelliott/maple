zzso zzso of a zzso library from rat zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells and from zzso cells exposed to nerve growth factor for 7 days identified zzso sequences of two genes induced by zzso The zzso species detected by these zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso reached zzso levels after 24 zzso of treatment with zzso and were still significantly higher than control levels after 7 zzso zzso growth factor zzso induced both zzso but at much lower zzso The zzso code for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso peptides whose sequences are zzso to those of a family of zzso proteins including the zzso zzso The conservation of primary and secondary structure between zzso zzso and the other proteins suggests a possible role for them in the regulation of cell growth and zzso
