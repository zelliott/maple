zzso protein zzso and zzso are highly zzso and functionally related zzso zzso and zzso zzso They are tumor zzso participate in a wide variety of zzso events, and serve as zzso among different signal zzso zzso In this study, 11 distinct proteins that have a high degree of zzso with the zzso acid sequence of zzso have been identified in current protein zzso All of these 11 proteins belong to either animal or plant zzso organisms zzso zzso Conservation of zzso zzso among these proteins was examined further by sequence alignment and pattern zzso The zzso of zzso that are required for the zzso function, including zzso putative zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in all of these 11 zzso This observation is consistent with the previous functional zzso and indicates that they are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso proteins may allow them to participate in zzso regulation by either directly recruiting zzso factors, zzso them zzso or directing targeted zzso of zzso zzso
