The roles of zzso and zzso from the human zzso locus control region and of the zzso zzso and stage zzso elements of the zzso promoter, in competitive zzso of zzso gene expression in early development, were tested using stable zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with an zzso beta construct demonstrate that zzso exhibits enhancing activity, but compared with zzso this site zzso less consistently in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In cells with zzso beta zzso the two HS sites act in concert to more effectively enhance zzso gene expression and to drive zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso gene with a zzso promoter can competitively inhibit zzso gene zzso zzso beta zzso were used to determine the effects of zzso promoter zzso within this region on zzso The zzso and zzso zzso but not the stage zzso element, inhibit inappropriate zzso stage expression of the zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso element results in the use of two major alternative zzso start zzso The data suggest that proteins binding to the zzso zzso and zzso elements interact with those binding to zzso and/or zzso to zzso zzso zzso in early zzso
