The human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is responsible for the zzso zzso zzso syndrome and encodes DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso efficient zzso synthesis past zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso The zzso of DNA synthesis by pol zzso on undamaged templates is extremely low, suggesting that pol zzso activity must be restricted to damaged sites on zzso Little is known, however, about how the activity of pol zzso is targeted and restricted to damaged zzso Here we show that pol zzso binds zzso zzso regardless of the presence of zzso zzso Rather, enhanced binding to zzso zzso containing zzso zzso is only observed when the zzso of the primer is an zzso zzso situated opposite the zzso When two zzso have been incorporated into the primer beyond the zzso zzso position, the pol zzso DNA complex is zzso allowing DNA synthesis by DNA zzso alpha or delta to zzso Our study provides zzso explanations for zzso switching at zzso zzso zzso
