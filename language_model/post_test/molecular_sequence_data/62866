Wilson disease is an zzso disorder of copper transport caused by zzso in the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso The Long Evans Cinnamon zzso rat is an established animal model for Wilson zzso We have used structural zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region of the rat zzso protein zzso to reveal the presence of a domain, the fourth domain zzso which was previously thought to be missing from zzso Although the zzso motif is absent from zzso the overall fold is zzso Using a wide range of techniques, zzso is shown to undergo zzso secondary and zzso structural changes similar to zzso Competition zzso experiments with zzso demonstrate a binding zzso unique to zzso zzso circular zzso zzso zzso suggest significant secondary structural transformation occurring when 2-3 zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso CD zzso which indicate zzso structural zzso show a zzso decrease in zzso zzso bonds upon the incremental addition of zzso and a maximum zzso zzso to protein zzso The similarity of these results to those obtained for the Wilson disease zzso zzso region zzso which has six zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso changes observed in both proteins may be largely determined by the zzso interactions taking place between the heavy zzso zzso zzso and remain largely unaffected by the absence of one of the six zzso zzso zzso
