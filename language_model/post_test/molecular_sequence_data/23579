zzso zzso zzso and zzso are key zzso in plant zzso zzso zzso of both zzso constitute a sequence family of zzso zzso Members of this family are selectively targeted toward either zzso or zzso In a comparative structural approach we have studied how this target specificity is implemented on zzso zzso By extending zzso work on the zzso inhibitor zzso to a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso from zzso zzso we show an zzso hairpin motif to be an independent and mobile structural entity in zzso zzso of this hairpin fully zzso the zzso A zzso composed of the zzso of zzso and the zzso bundle of zzso is still active against zzso By contrast, combining the corresponding segment of zzso with the zzso bundle of zzso renders the protein inactive toward either zzso or zzso Our experiments provide insight in how these zzso zzso can make differential use of similar structural zzso to achieve distinct zzso zzso our results with previous findings, we present a model for the zzso complex with important zzso
