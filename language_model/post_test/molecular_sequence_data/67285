zzso coronavirus zzso is found worldwide and causes respiratory infections and zzso in calves and adult zzso In order to investigate the molecular epidemiology of zzso 27 reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso positive samples from 25 cattle zzso in different parts of Sweden were zzso A zzso zzso was zzso amplified and directly zzso The zzso zzso strains showed a high sequence identity, regardless of whether they were obtained from outbreaks of respiratory disease or zzso or from calves or adult zzso Circulation of an identical zzso strain during a zzso period was demonstrated in calves in one dairy zzso In a regional zzso of winter zzso in Northern Sweden, highly similar zzso strains were zzso In the Southern and Central regions, several zzso of zzso circulated zzso indicating that in these regions, which had a higher density of cattle than the Northern regions, more extensive transmission of the virus was zzso zzso zzso sequences supported the zzso data that zzso contact through purchased calves was zzso Swedish zzso strains unexpectedly showed a high zzso with recently detected Italian zzso This study shows that molecular analysis of the spike zzso zzso gene of zzso can be a useful tool to support or rule out suspected transmission zzso
