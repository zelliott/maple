A zzso system for saline wastewater utilizing zzso zzso bacteria has not been developed so zzso In this study, zzso performance and microbial community under various saline conditions were investigated using zzso sludge zzso under zzso condition for a few years as seed zzso A continuous zzso experiment showed that zzso performance and microbial community at zzso zzso was higher than that at zzso zzso The microbial community in the zzso sludge that was zzso under low zzso was monitored by zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis during zzso to zzso zzso zzso profiles and clone analysis based on zzso zzso genes in the sludge of the zzso system with zzso zzso indicated that the zzso particularly zzso zzso were zzso species, suggesting that these bacterial members were possibly responsible for a high zzso activity under zzso zzso Furthermore, the investigation of zzso performance under various saline conditions revealed that zzso zzso results in the highest zzso rate, indicating that this zzso was optimal for zzso bacterial species to exhibit zzso zzso These results indicate the possibility that an appropriate zzso system for saline wastewater can be designed using zzso sludge with a zzso zzso
