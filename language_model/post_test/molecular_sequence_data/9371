zzso sponges zzso zzso Class zzso are known to be zzso zzso Previous molecular studies have revealed many discrepancies between classically recognized zzso and the observed relationships at the order, family and zzso zzso these inconsistencies question underlying hypotheses regarding the evolution of certain zzso zzso zzso we extended the available zzso and character set by sequencing the complete small zzso zzso zzso and the almost complete large zzso zzso zzso of additional key species and zzso this zzso by substantially increasing the length of available zzso zzso zzso analyses provided new hypotheses about the relationships of zzso and about the evolution of certain zzso zzso We tested our zzso against competing zzso hypotheses presented by previous zzso zzso Our data reject the current zzso zzso by again finding zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso we recovered a zzso that includes all species with a cortex, which is largely consistent with the previously proposed order zzso Other orders that had been rejected in the current system were not found, but could not be rejected in our tests zzso We found several additional families and zzso zzso the families zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso the family zzso and the zzso zzso Our zzso also provided support for the vaguely suspected close relationship of several members of zzso with zzso zzso to members of zzso Similarly, our analyses revealed several unexpected zzso such as a sister group relationship between zzso zzso and zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso According to our results, the zzso of zzso is in desperate need of a thorough zzso which cannot be achieved by considering zzso alone or relying on a zzso sampling based on the current zzso below the zzso zzso
