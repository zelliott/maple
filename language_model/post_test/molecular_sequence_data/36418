The possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso peptides in zzso zzso zzso in rats was zzso The zzso zzso was administered zzso zzso zzso either acutely or chronically for three zzso The detailed time course of changes in zzso and zzso was examined in several rat brain areas 5 and 20 zzso and 24 h after acute treatment and after three days chronic zzso zzso levels dramatically decreased in all areas 5 zzso after zzso injection, remained low after 20 zzso and progressively increased back to control values after 24 h and after three days of repeated treatment (except for the zzso zzso analysis of extracts prepared from zzso rats revealed a zzso decrease in zzso and increase in zzso Thus zzso might be a product of the internal zzso of the precursor zzso after its zzso zzso zzso zzso might be generated by zzso processing of zzso and thus be an zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso might be involved in zzso zzso in rat brain, and that zzso might play a role in these experimental zzso
