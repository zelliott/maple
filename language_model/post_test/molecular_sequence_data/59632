The zzso zzso zzso occurs naturally in zzso zzso To protect the zzso against zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso zzso zzso by reduction of zzso coupled with the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Z zzso can tolerate high zzso of zzso and this property may be useful in the development of an efficient microbial process for ethanol zzso Each zzso zzso contains tightly associated zzso which is not released during the zzso zzso 

The structure of zzso was determined by X-ray zzso at zzso A zzso Each zzso of the zzso zzso comprises two zzso a classical zzso domain, and a zzso domain based on a predominantly zzso zzso beta zzso In the zzso the zzso associate to form two extended zzso beta zzso which pack against each other in a face to face fashion, creating an extensive interface at the core of the zzso An zzso arm from each zzso wraps around the zzso domain of an adjacent zzso covering the zzso ring of zzso 

In zzso the zzso is found associated with a classical zzso domain in a conventional zzso The zzso is effectively buried in the zzso interior as a result of interactions with the zzso arm from an adjacent zzso in the zzso and with a short zzso from the zzso domain of the zzso This accounts for zzso inability to zzso The zzso arm may also contribute to stabilization of the zzso The zzso has an unexpected structural similarity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that both zzso have zzso from a common zzso The mechanism of zzso is still zzso but we have identified a zzso structural motif zzso in the active site of zzso and zzso that may be important for zzso
