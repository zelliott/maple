zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remains a paradigm in zzso signal zzso Emerging evidence suggests that this process involves zzso of the complex between the zzso zzso zzso however, a dynamic image of how it occurs on the membrane surface remains zzso We show here that, whereas zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso tails associate in zzso zzso zzso they become partially embedded into zzso zzso when zzso zzso embedding zzso substantial structural changes of the zzso tails as compared to their zzso zzso and suggests there may be an upward movement of the zzso zzso into the membrane during their zzso We further demonstrate that the zzso tail exhibits additional membrane binding site at its C zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso a key zzso zzso zzso recognizes this site as well as the zzso zzso thereby promoting zzso tail separation along the membrane zzso These data provide a structural basis of zzso changes at the zzso face in regulating zzso zzso and zzso
