zzso and zzso are related zzso proteins that activate zzso zzso zzso We showed previously that the human zzso zzso consisting of four zzso is located at zzso zzso designation zzso To identify the zzso location of the zzso zzso we first cloned its zzso and determined its zzso distribution by zzso zzso The results show that the zzso of the zzso gene are positioned exactly as in the zzso gene and are nearly double in zzso zzso similarity between the two zzso however, is limited to portions of zzso 1 and zzso The zzso and zzso genes are transcribed into single zzso species zzso and zzso zzso zzso and are zzso only in the zzso by Northern zzso The zzso gene was found by zzso zzso hybrid panel analysis and FISH to reside at zzso in a region indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso showed that the genes are in a zzso array less than 5 zzso apart and altogether span less than 20 zzso of zzso zzso The identical gene structures and zzso of zzso and zzso and the identical function of the gene products, are consistent with gene zzso zzso
