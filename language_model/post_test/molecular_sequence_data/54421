zzso of the zzso binding site of the zzso zzso come in three zzso positive zzso zzso negative zzso zzso and zzso all of which can bind with high zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso protein which forms a zzso selective zzso channel and zzso of the zzso binding site stabilize three different zzso of this zzso Classical zzso exert a positive zzso effect by increasing the apparent affinity of channel opening by the zzso zzso acid zzso We concentrate here on the major adult zzso the zzso zzso zzso The classical binding pocket for zzso is located in a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in a position zzso to the zzso binding site for zzso that is located between zzso and zzso zzso We review here approaches to this zzso In particular, point zzso were performed in combination with subsequent analysis of the expressed zzso proteins using either zzso techniques or radioactive zzso binding zzso The zzso power of these methods is assessed by comparing the results with the predictions that can be made on the basis of the recently published crystal structure of the zzso binding protein that shows zzso to the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso In addition, we review an approach to the question of how the zzso zzso are positioned in their binding zzso We also discuss a newly zzso zzso site for zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the classical zzso binding zzso
