The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso which possesses activity against zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso by the gene zzso and sequence data from analysis of mature zzso indicate that the precursor zzso zzso zzso several unique and unusual chemical modifications during its maturation zzso The genes of the zzso zzso are believed to function in the synthesis and maturation of zzso zzso zzso introduced into each of the zzso genes resulted in loss or reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed no zzso activity, indicating that the products of these genes are critical for the production of active zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso resulted in reduction of zzso activity and decreased immunity to zzso particularly under zzso zzso A new zzso zzso zzso another zzso product was discovered residing in a sequence overlapping the coding region of zzso Construction of an zzso zzso fusion and analysis of its expression indicate that zzso is induced in stationary phase of zzso cultures of zzso An zzso deletion of the zzso coding sequence did not affect the zzso activity or production of or immunity to zzso The results of this investigation show that the zzso genes are required for the mechanisms of zzso synthesis and zzso
