zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zinc zzso of known crystal zzso When zzso zzso in zzso coli, a blue protein that contains up to zzso iron zzso zzso could be isolated, with zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso These bands are reminiscent of zzso zzso complexes, an assignment that has been confirmed by resonance zzso zzso and by reaction with zzso zzso which is specific for the presence of zzso zzso After zzso zzso of blue zzso a zzso with the sequence zzso was isolated corresponding to zzso zzso in the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso where the unidentified zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso It is proposed that iron and oxygen bring about zzso of zzso in zzso and that zzso subsequently zzso the zzso zzso to give the characteristic zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of the blue protein suggests three iron environments in the zzso two in zzso environments with zzso values approximately equal to zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso The nature of the iron zzso sites is discussed with the help of model systems and by comparison with other blue zzso iron zzso
