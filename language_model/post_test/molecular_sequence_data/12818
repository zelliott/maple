To investigate the role of two highly zzso negative patches, zzso zzso and zzso on the surface of plant zzso six zzso were constructed by zzso zzso of the intermediate precursor gene from zzso zzso The zzso were designed systematically to incorporate positive charges into the negative patches, and the net charge on negative patches was modified from zzso to zzso Upon expression in zzso coli, the zzso proteins were correctly processed to the mature size and accumulated as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso proteins were almost indistinguishable from those of the zzso It was found that the electron transfer rate from zzso f to zzso decreased zzso as the net charge on the negative patch zzso was increased, whereas the modification of the other negative patch zzso had no zzso zzso strength dependence studies indicated that the rate zzso at infinite zzso strength did not change significantly among the zzso and the six zzso and the zzso attraction energies between zzso and zzso f decreased when zzso zzso were zzso whereas the modification of zzso zzso had no zzso These results clearly indicated that only one zzso of the two negative patches is involved in the transient complex formation with zzso zzso Essentially similar results were observed for the electron transfer from zzso to the zzso I reaction center zzso although in this case, slight participation of the negative patch zzso is zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
