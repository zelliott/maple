zzso is an zzso protein that zzso zzso signals from death receptors such as zzso to downstream zzso zzso in zzso We have identified and characterized the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains both a death zzso domain zzso and a death domain zzso that are structurally zzso to those of zzso zzso We observed zzso binding to zzso zzso and zzso as well as to human zzso and zzso through interactions with their zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso zzso was also able to induce zzso in zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso acted as a zzso zzso and prevented zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso signals from zzso to zzso Furthermore, we found that transgenic animals expressing zzso in the developing heart or eye under the control of zzso promoters show abnormal zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso can substitute functionally for its zzso zzso in death zzso zzso and we suggest that zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso in zzso Thus, the structural and functional similarities between zzso and zzso zzso provide evidence that the zzso pathways are zzso zzso across zzso zzso
