Mass zzso zzso of zzso zzso often involves zzso of zzso zzso groups to facilitate their enrichment, identification and zzso Among the many reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the most frequently zzso Despite their common use in zzso research, their zzso towards zzso zzso has not been zzso evaluated in detail, to the best of our zzso Thus we studied the zzso and specificity of these zzso towards different classes of zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso each being represented by a synthetic zzso carrying an accordingly modified zzso All three tagging zzso were selective for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products, however, were zzso only at low levels or not at zzso Whereas zzso zzso was efficient under the published standard conditions, the zzso conditions for zzso and zzso had to be zzso zzso conditions provided quantitative zzso yields for zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso fragmented efficiently in tandem mass zzso when the experimental conditions were chosen carefully for each zzso zzso the tested zzso peptides did not zzso with zzso groups in other proteins present during sample preparations or zzso zzso Thus, it appears zzso to digest proteins first and then zzso the zzso zzso groups more efficiently at the zzso level under zzso zzso The zzso model peptides used in this study might be valid internal standards for zzso zzso
