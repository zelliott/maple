Long terminal repeats zzso of human zzso zzso zzso have been reported to serve as alternative promoters in functional zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene located on human zzso zzso has been found to be an zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified the zzso element of zzso with reverse orientation as an alternative promoter of the zzso gene and analyzed its expression pattern in human zzso and cancer zzso A reporter gene zzso of the promoter activity of the zzso on the zzso gene in human cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and a kidney cell line zzso of African green monkey indicated that the zzso promoter with reverse orientation had stronger promoter activity than forward zzso The transcripts of this zzso promoter were widely distributed in various human zzso and cancer cells, whereas the transcripts of the cellular promoter were found only in stomach zzso and some cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest that the zzso element on the zzso gene was integrated into the zzso lineage and acquired the role of zzso regulation of human zzso and cancer zzso
