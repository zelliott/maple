The zzso zzso zzso family zzso factor, zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso zzso and the immune zzso In this report, we show that zzso is zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso large cell zzso cell lines and that zzso expressed zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells treated with the zzso zzso zzso anthrax lethal zzso In both cases, we identify zzso acid 137 as the zzso zzso site and demonstrate that zzso can be directly zzso in zzso by multiple zzso at this zzso zzso of zzso at zzso acid 137 separates the zzso zzso domain from the zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso and we show that the zzso zzso zzso retains both DNA binding activity and the ability to interact with zzso family zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso interferes with the binding of full-length zzso to zzso sites and zzso zzso zzso In zzso we have identified and characterized a novel mechanism of zzso zzso modification and demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso product functions as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso
