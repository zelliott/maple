Two highly similar zinc finger zzso zzso zzso finger, zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated and zzso Both map to the zzso short arm region of the human X zzso near locus zzso in zzso Both genes are expressed in several human zzso revealing a approximately zzso zzso zzso by Northern zzso zzso and both are subject to zzso A comparison of zzso zzso of zzso sequence from a single zzso in the open reading frames of the two genes reveals zzso identity in zzso zzso The predicted proteins include at least ten tandem zzso zinc finger zzso When zzso zzso from different parts of the genes are zzso to a zzso of different animal zzso two bands are seen in all zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso predates the radiation of zzso zzso and is highly zzso Furthermore, under conditions of lowered zzso additional bands are seen in several species, suggesting that the two genes reported here may be members of a larger zinc finger gene zzso
