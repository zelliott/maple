zzso cells were cultured in media containing standard growth factors with or without zzso plus labeled precursors of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the medium was zzso and fragmented with zzso Three peptides were identified by zzso sequencing, that were labeled mainly with zzso independent of zzso One of them, corresponding to the zzso of zzso incorporated both more zzso and more zzso upon zzso zzso These data likely reflect a zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso mostly with the maturation of zzso to complex zzso
