Using the sequences of a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso as zzso in an zzso approach, we have identified a highly related zzso in human and an apparent zzso in zzso The zzso predict type II zzso proteins that constitute new members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Members of this family have previously been implicated in the zzso of zzso chains within zzso and the zzso of zzso chains within zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the newly identified zzso in zzso cells led to the addition of zzso to zzso of zzso in an zzso zzso The tissue expression of transcripts corresponding to the zzso was highly restricted to the small zzso and colon in zzso Based on these zzso the novel zzso is designated zzso for zzso zzso zzso
