zzso of enveloped viruses to cells is triggered by the zzso domain zzso on envelope zzso zzso binding to receptors located on the cell zzso To date, recognized receptors and zzso of zzso virus zzso have not been exactly zzso In this study, one zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing high zzso activity, which is directed against zzso envelope zzso zzso was used to determine the crucial motif of zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso were selected from a 12 zzso acid zzso library displayed on zzso zzso After 3 rounds of selection, the binding capacity between zzso and zzso zzso was examined zzso zzso the positive zzso clones with high binding activity to zzso zzso were chosen and zzso The zzso sequences of positive zzso clones were compared with that of zzso zzso strain zzso A motif zzso aligned to the primary sequences of zzso zzso was identified from the zzso zzso in the 9 positive zzso Positive zzso and zzso zzso containing the motif were bound significantly to zzso cell zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the sequence on zzso between zzso acid 96 and 105 may be a key motif of zzso zzso recognized by viral receptors on target cell zzso Further characterization of the motif would provide useful information in understanding of the cellular entry of zzso
