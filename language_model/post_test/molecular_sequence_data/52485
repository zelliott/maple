zzso serves a critical role in the alternative zzso of complement by stabilizing the zzso zzso Early studies to determine the zzso sequence relied on zzso acid sequencing of zzso zzso zzso and only yielded partial sequence zzso Recently Nolan et zzso reported a zzso zzso sequence obtained from the zzso zzso cell zzso We sought to detect zzso zzso in two normal human zzso and to compare those sequences with that obtained from the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso harvested from human zzso and peripheral blood zzso served as a template for first strand zzso The zzso was then used as a template for zzso chain zzso A zzso message was detected in both zzso and peripheral blood zzso but not in peripheral blood zzso The sequence was nearly identical to that obtained from the zzso cell zzso These experiments demonstrate that peripheral blood may be used as a ready source for zzso zzso and will faster studies to define the zzso in zzso zzso
