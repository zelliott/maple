zzso proteins undergo a series of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso these modifications generate a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso protein targeting and zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso step in this series of zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity has not been described in zzso We have detected a specific zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso that discriminates between biologically relevant and irrelevant zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we have identified an zzso gene zzso that encodes measurable zzso activity in zzso zzso cells with greater specificity for biologically relevant zzso zzso than the activity found in zzso zzso These results suggest that specific and zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our findings are discussed in the context of zzso zzso as a potential regulatory mechanism for membrane association and function of zzso proteins in zzso
