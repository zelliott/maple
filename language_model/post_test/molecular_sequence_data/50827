Human zzso produce zzso a major protein of zzso while zzso produce zzso the major protein of zzso zzso is translated from zzso zzso that are zzso edited at zzso zzso converting zzso zzso to zzso a stop zzso In contrast to humans, mouse and rat zzso contain the zzso zzso editing zzso Because hormones and nutrients affect the metabolism of zzso containing zzso we studied the effects of sex hormones and diets on zzso zzso zzso Groups of male and female zzso mice were zzso and treated with 17 zzso at zzso zzso or at 5 zzso zzso or with testosterone zzso at 1 zzso body zzso for 14 zzso Plasma zzso levels and ratios of zzso both increased zzso but only in the zzso zzso To determine if the increased zzso ratios were associated with altered levels of zzso and zzso zzso both forms of zzso zzso were zzso We found that indeed zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso only in the zzso zzso Next, we studied the individual effects of dietary fatty acids and dietary cholesterol on the relative abundance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso effect, the high zzso diet increased zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso Total plasma zzso as well as zzso synthesis in liver also zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso and high fat diet both zzso zzso editing in mouse liver, but that zzso and fat diet affected zzso zzso editing in opposite zzso
