The zzso zzso of zzso coli, which lacks the zzso fold common to other zzso displays a zzso preference for zzso over zzso zzso as the ratio of zzso zzso by zzso crystal structures and molecular zzso zzso zzso has been used to introduce six zzso in the zzso binding pocket that systematically shift zzso preference toward zzso The engineered zzso displays an zzso preference for zzso over zzso which exceeds the zzso preference displayed by a zzso zzso zzso Of the six zzso introduced, only one is identical in all related zzso zzso zzso adherence to zzso as a criterion for replacing these zzso acids zzso zzso Two additional zzso at remote sites improve performance further, resulting in a final zzso zzso with kinetic characteristics and zzso preference comparable to naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso
