zzso a natural cause of zzso is often accompanied by high zzso zzso in the flood zzso Plants need to respond to these environmental zzso Strong zzso reporter gene activity in tobacco zzso zzso controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter from zzso zzso zzso depends on the presence of zzso and zzso To identify factors required for zzso regulated gene zzso promoter deletions fused to the zzso reporter gene were studied in transgenic zzso zzso of a 40 zzso zzso directly upstream of the zzso box leads to increased zzso reporter gene activity both, in the presence and absence of zzso This deletion does not affect light specific zzso zzso A positive correlation between increasing zzso zzso and gene activity is zzso zzso mobility shift experiments indicate that tobacco nuclear extracts zzso proteins that bind to part of the 40 zzso zzso Database assisted as well as experimental analysis reveal a role for zzso zzso factors for zzso the high zzso specificity to the zzso promoter in tobacco zzso This work highlights the importance for plants to respond to high environmental zzso zzso under zzso zzso
