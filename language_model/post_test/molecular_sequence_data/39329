The zzso delta virus zzso zzso has only one open reading frame, which encodes the viral small delta zzso After zzso editing, the same open reading frame is extended 19 zzso acids at the zzso zzso and encodes the large delta zzso These two viral proteins escort the zzso zzso through different cellular compartments for the complicated zzso of zzso zzso and, eventually, the formation of progeny zzso To orchestrate these events, the delta zzso have to take distinct cues to traffic to the right compartments and make correct molecular zzso In zzso zzso modification zzso is a major mechanism of dictating the multiple functions of a single zzso Multiple zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified on zzso delta zzso In this chapter we review these zzso and discuss their functions in regulating and zzso the life cycle of zzso
