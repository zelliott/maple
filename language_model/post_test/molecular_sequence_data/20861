zzso zzso is a normal gastrointestinal zzso that is a zzso for zzso resistance genes and can potentially act as a source from which mobile elements and their associated resistance zzso can be transferred to other bacterial zzso zzso resistance in zzso zzso is common and is usually zzso by zzso genes that zzso zzso B zzso In this study we identified strains that are zzso resistant but zzso sensitive and showed that the zzso resistance zzso was zzso borne and could be transferred to other zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso zzso to be identified that does not zzso zzso zzso Further analysis showed that resistance was zzso by the zzso zzso which zzso a putative zzso zzso and was located on zzso a functional zzso genetic element that was a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso This element had significant similarity to the zzso zzso resistance element zzso from zzso zzso Like zzso zzso carries a functional origin of transfer within the resistance zzso allowing the element to be mobilized by the zzso zzso zzso The similarity of these elements and the finding that they both contain an zzso region support the hypothesis that zzso may result in the movement of DNA zzso that are not obviously mobile since they are not linked to zzso or zzso zzso This process likely plays a significant role in bacterial adaptation and zzso
