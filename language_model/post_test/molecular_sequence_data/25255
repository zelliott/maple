Two recently identified structural elements important for zzso zzso of human zzso zzso were investigated in detail by functional analysis of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific requirements with respect to the nature of the involved zzso acids as well as to their spatial arrangements were found to be crucial for efficient zzso of zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, binding and zzso of zzso by zzso seem to be determined mainly by the positive charge density of the involved inhibitor zzso A zzso repeat enriched in zzso zzso acids turned out to exert a dual role with respect to structure and function of zzso First, in the absence of functional zzso the zzso charged zzso interacts zzso with the zzso zzso Second, the zzso zzso is instrumental in zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso are functionally not zzso
