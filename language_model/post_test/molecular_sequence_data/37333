The alpha zzso of human zzso heat shock protein zzso is composed of three zzso the zzso zzso zzso middle zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The middle domain is simultaneously associated with the zzso and zzso zzso and the interaction with the latter mediates the zzso zzso of zzso Besides one in the zzso domain, an additional zzso site exists in the zzso domain of zzso The aim of the present study is to zzso the regions within the zzso domain responsible for the zzso to the middle domain and to a client zzso and to define the relationship between the two zzso A bacterial zzso system revealed that zzso zzso of zzso were essential for the binding to the middle zzso An almost identical region zzso zzso was required for the suppression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso a model client zzso Replacement of either zzso or zzso to zzso within the zzso segment zzso zzso of the zzso domain caused the loss of zzso to both the middle domain and the client zzso The interaction between the middle and zzso zzso was also found in human zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso coli zzso a bacterial zzso zzso formed zzso complexes with zzso and the zzso zzso protein through their zzso zzso Taken together, it is concluded that the identical region including the zzso segment of the zzso domain is essential for both the client binding and zzso formation of the zzso molecular zzso and that the zzso zzso appears to be similar in the zzso zzso
