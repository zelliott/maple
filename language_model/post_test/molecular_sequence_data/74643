The use of two types of zzso zzso libraries zzso containing zzso terminating either with a primary zzso or modified with a terminal zzso group, allowed the discovery and identification of a large number of previously zzso egg white zzso Whereas the most comprehensive list up to date ( Mann, zzso , zzso 2007, 7, zzso zzso ) tabulated 78 unique gene products, our findings have almost doubled that value to 148 unique protein zzso From the initial zzso egg, it was possible to find 41 protein zzso the difference zzso zzso was generated as a result of the use of zzso from which a similar number of species zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Of those, 35 proteins were the specific catch of the zzso zzso while 33 were uniquely captured by the zzso zzso While a number of these zzso proteins might have a biological role in maintaining the integrity of the egg white and protecting the zzso others might be derived from zzso zzso cells lining the zzso and/or represent remnants of products from the zzso and eggshell membrane components zzso by the zzso which might ultimately be zzso even if in trace zzso into the egg zzso The list of egg white components here reported is by far the most comprehensive at present and could serve as a starting point for isolation and functional characterization of proteins possibly having novel pharmaceutical and biomedical zzso
