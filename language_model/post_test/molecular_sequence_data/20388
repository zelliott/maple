Human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso zzso zzso T zzso The minus strand of the zzso zzso encodes zzso a protein that could play a role in the development of leukemia in infected zzso zzso we demonstrate that the complementary strand of the zzso zzso also encodes a protein that we named zzso for zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso terminal repeat at different zzso This transcript was detected in all zzso cell lines and short-term culture of zzso obtained from zzso African patients tested and in 4 of 15 zzso blood zzso The zzso protein is 183 zzso acids long, is localized in the cell nucleus, and is detected in zzso Despite the lack of a consensus basic zzso zzso domain, zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso element binding protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and in cells zzso with an zzso molecular zzso Altogether, our results demonstrate the existence of an zzso zzso protein in zzso which could represent an important player in the development of disorders, such as zzso which is frequently observed in zzso zzso
