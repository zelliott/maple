zzso zzso the zzso agent of typhoid fever, is adapted to the human host and unable to zzso zzso zzso The genetic basis for host specificity in zzso zzso is zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in animal hosts may result from a lack of genes present in the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully employed to isolate zzso zzso zzso sequences which are absent from the zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso sequences mapped to 17 regions distributed throughout the zzso zzso zzso A positive zzso selection method was then used to identify zzso sequences which were transcribed by zzso zzso following zzso zzso A novel putative zzso regulator of the zzso family was identified as transcribed by zzso zzso zzso This putative zzso regulator was absent from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso within this gene did not alter the level of zzso zzso survival within zzso or zzso within zzso A zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso also zzso to the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with a high level of similarity to sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso was absent from the zzso zzso zzso The absence of specific genes may have allowed zzso zzso to evolve as a highly zzso systemic human zzso
