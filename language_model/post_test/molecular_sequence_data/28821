The characteristics of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso defined by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso These zzso recognized zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells of the zzso zzso tissue of the small zzso in contrast with approximately zzso of peripheral blood zzso Both zzso zzso a 180 zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with a 120 zzso protein consistent with the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso generated from molecular cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also zzso This zzso zzso shares zzso sequence zzso with human and zzso zzso with zzso and rat zzso zzso includes the presence of an X zzso domain, that appears unique to zzso molecules as described for human, rat and zzso as well as areas of zzso common to other alpha zzso Of note is a typical I zzso domain, the presence of seven repeat regions, and highly zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that both zzso recognized an zzso component which zzso the X and I zzso of the cloned zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the pattern of tissue distribution, zzso zzso and zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are largely similar to that described for other zzso
