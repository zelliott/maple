zzso or vitamin C, is obtained by humans mostly from plant zzso Various approaches have been made to increase zzso in plants by transgenic zzso Most of these attempts have involved leaf material from model plants, with little success reported using genes from the generally accepted zzso zzso of zzso zzso We focused on increasing zzso in commercially significant edible plant zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso that we had previously shown to increase zzso concentration in tobacco and zzso zzso The coding sequence of zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter, was expressed in tomato and zzso zzso was transformed with potato or zzso zzso genes under the control of the zzso promoter or a zzso promoter zzso zzso Five lines of tomato, up to nine lines of zzso and eight lines of zzso were zzso for each zzso Three lines of tomato had a zzso to zzso increase in fruit zzso and all lines of zzso showed a twofold zzso All but one line of each potato construct also showed an increase in zzso zzso of up to zzso Interestingly, in tomato fruit, increased zzso was associated with loss of seed and the jelly of zzso tissue surrounding the seed which was not seen in zzso In both zzso and tomato, an increase in zzso content was associated with increased zzso These results show that zzso can be used to raise significantly zzso concentration in commercially significant edible zzso
