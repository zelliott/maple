zzso encodes a zzso zzso of genes required for zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso which is transcribed under zzso control, encodes a zzso protein that binds to zzso to form a zzso zzso in which the zzso functions of zzso are zzso and repression of zzso genes is zzso The zzso surface comprises zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Each forms a pair of zzso that hook together to form an zzso zzso zzso Here, we are interested in the assembly of the zzso zzso and its binding to zzso zzso zzso with zzso laser light scattering and zzso analysis reveal that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso while a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso arranged as a zzso of zzso The zzso chain forms two zzso with the zzso of the zzso similar to that observed in the zzso zzso The zzso is formed through interactions of zzso at the zzso of the four zzso A model of the intact zzso zzso in which the DNA binding zzso surround the zzso core was zzso Fluorescence zzso and surface zzso resonance experiments showed that zzso binds to an zzso duplex, zzso containing a pair of zzso consensus sequences in zzso orientation with a zzso of 300 zzso The implications of these data for promoter binding and the curious zzso structural transitions of zzso upon binding to zzso zzso and zzso the zzso protein zzso which zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
