zzso zzso is essential for formation and zzso of zzso bonds during nascent protein folding in the zzso zzso The two zzso active sites catalyze a variety of zzso exchange zzso We have characterized three novel zzso zzso from the primitive zzso zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso the zzso zzso have only one active zzso The zzso sequence motif in the zzso proteins zzso is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso and not other members of the zzso zzso that have one active site, such as zzso and zzso proteins from zzso zzso The three zzso proteins have very different zzso acid sequences and molecular masses zzso 50, and 13 zzso All three zzso were capable of rearranging zzso bonds, and zzso zzso zzso also displayed zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, the three zzso proteins also had zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso with a single active site that have diverse roles in protein zzso This study may provide clues to the evolution of key functions of the zzso zzso in zzso cells, protein zzso formation, and zzso
