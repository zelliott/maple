The first fully automated design and experimental validation of a novel sequence for an entire protein is zzso A zzso design zzso based on physical chemical potential functions and zzso constraints was used to screen a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso possible zzso acid sequences for zzso with the design target, a zzso protein motif based on the zzso backbone structure of a zinc finger zzso A zzso search shows that the designed zzso full sequence design 1 zzso has very low identity to any known protein zzso The solution structure of zzso was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and indicates that zzso forms a compact zzso structure, which is in excellent agreement with the design target zzso This result demonstrates that zzso methods can perform the immense zzso search required for protein design, and it suggests that an unbiased and quantitative zzso can be used in various structural zzso
