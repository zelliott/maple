The zzso gene product has been proposed as a candidate protein for the zzso zzso channel, but the zzso zzso has not been identified in any zzso zzso We report here the cloning of a rat brain zzso zzso and detection and zzso of the zzso and expressed zzso zzso A zzso product, with zzso zzso to mouse zzso was amplified from rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used for cloning of a full-length rat brain zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated the transcript in several rat and mouse zzso The zzso zzso acids zzso was used to generate a zzso zzso The zzso zzso 1) zzso human zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells, 2) reacted with a protein of approximately 92 zzso but not with zzso in zzso of zzso zzso cells, and 3) reacted with proteins of 92 and 56 zzso in human and rat brain zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso demonstrated that zzso and expressed zzso and expressed zzso proteins were localized in the plasma membrane of zzso cells, consistent with their proposed role in zzso zzso The data demonstrate for the first time the presence of zzso protein in a zzso zzso
