We evaluated three zzso pancreatic zzso preparations by in zzso zzso and by comparing degree of zzso zzso zzso wet weight, and stool energy losses in a zzso crossover study of patients with pancreatic insufficient zzso zzso zzso of the study were to assess zzso the most zzso and reliable indicator of zzso zzso the variation in zzso batch zzso zzso the decline in zzso batch potency with prolonged shelf life; and zzso the relative zzso of the different zzso In the in zzso study, zzso of energy, zzso and fat did not differ when comparing the three preparations at roughly zzso equivalent doses, but when expressed per capsule of pancreatic supplement zzso zzso reflected relative zzso content, favoring the higher potency zzso Although zzso was reasonably controlled by these zzso stool energy losses varied from 800 to 1,100 zzso per day, suggesting greater attention be paid to overall energy zzso rather than zzso of individual zzso In addition, zzso energy loss correlated more closely with zzso wet weight zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such that 1 g wet feces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso potency varied markedly between batches of the same brand, and also a decline of up to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso activity was noted over an zzso period for each zzso Both observations have clinical implications at times of zzso Finally, the higher potency preparations were more effective per capsule and reduced capsule dosage is therefore zzso
