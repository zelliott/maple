We test with molecular dynamics the hypothesis that zzso forces in zzso simulated with a spring attached to the zzso alpha zzso of an zzso I domain, can zzso stabilize alternative I domain zzso Depending on the force applied and zzso in zzso and zzso I zzso the beta zzso 7 loop moves successively between three zzso zzso zzso from closed to zzso and then to zzso More zzso linked zzso in zzso zzso and metal coordination closely resemble those seen when the zzso becomes zzso zzso show that the intermediate state is populated over a wider range of forces for zzso than zzso I zzso zzso with zzso I zzso suggest that specific zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso I zzso reveal a lack of the intermediate zzso zzso to zzso to zzso substitution at the second zzso zzso The findings have important implications for biological regulation of zzso zzso
