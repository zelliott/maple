To compare the gene expression profile in a pair of zzso zzso 

The gene expression profile was compared in a pair of zzso zzso 

The twins displayed different disease zzso One acquired natural immunity against zzso whereas the other became a chronic zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were found to be zzso or zzso in their zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso protein 1 zzso that expressed at a higher level in the zzso twins was identified and four pairs of siblings with zzso immunity by zzso However, upon zzso core zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso from subjects with zzso whereas it was slightly zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso channel zzso domain in zzso that shares a significant zzso with some human, zzso and C zzso zzso 

zzso may play a role in the innate immunity against zzso
