Most temperate plants tolerate both chilling and freezing temperatures whereas many species from tropical regions suffer chilling injury when exposed to temperatures slightly above zzso Cold zzso zzso the expression of zzso genes needed to protect plants against freezing zzso This induction is zzso in part, by the zzso zzso factor zzso To understand the evolution and function of this family in zzso we identified and characterized 15 different zzso genes from zzso zzso Our analyses reveal that wheat species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso may contain up to 25 different zzso zzso and that zzso zzso can be classified into 10 groups that share a common zzso origin and similar structural zzso Six of these groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found only in the zzso suggesting they represent the zzso response machinery that evolved recently during colonization of temperate zzso zzso studies reveal that five of the zzso groups display higher zzso and low temperature zzso expression in the winter zzso and a zzso regulation pattern during growth at warm zzso The higher zzso and zzso expression within these zzso groups is an inherited trait that may play a zzso role in the superior low temperature tolerance capacity of winter zzso and possibly be a basis of genetic zzso in freezing tolerance within the zzso zzso
