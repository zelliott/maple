We have cloned and zzso the zzso regions encompassing the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso has only three zzso acid differences with respect to the zzso coli zzso Northern zzso blots and primer extension experiments were used to characterize the zzso zzso zzso transcript and to identify the zzso initiation and termination elements of this zzso The function of the zzso factor of zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso and by in zzso zzso zzso in polar zzso of zzso zzso
