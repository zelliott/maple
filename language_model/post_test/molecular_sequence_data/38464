zzso are the major source for the generation of peptides bound by zzso class I zzso To study the functional relevance of the zzso zzso zzso low molecular mass protein 2 zzso zzso and mouse zzso cell zzso zzso 1 in zzso processing and zzso that of zzso we established the zzso mouse cell line zzso allowing the zzso formation of zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso type 5 zzso and analysis of zzso presentation with zzso zzso showed that cells containing zzso processed the viral early zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with increased efficiency, thus allowing a faster detection of viral entry in induced zzso zzso optimal zzso zzso was already achieved at zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso with zzso zzso in zzso yielded zzso at quantities that were zzso to the relative contents of zzso Our data provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso when present at relatively low levels as at initial stages of infection, already increase the efficiency of zzso zzso generation and thereby enhance zzso class I zzso processing in infected zzso
