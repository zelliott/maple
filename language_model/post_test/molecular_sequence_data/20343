The class III zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and expressed in a zzso zzso zzso coupled with a zzso zzso method was used to clone and subsequently sequence the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso search of protein databases showed that the zzso of zzso and zzso are different zzso zzso from the previously reported class III zzso such as those of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of a zzso zzso fold in zzso the putative zzso of zzso Upon zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a shuttle zzso zzso containing the newly cloned zzso and zzso zzso the bacteria resumed the synthesis of zzso albeit at a low level zzso of the cell dry zzso due to zzso selection zzso We further showed that the zzso strain grown in zzso culture medium zzso a blend of zzso that also contains a high content of zzso and zzso as its zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested the existence of two zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso The results of this study not only make available a zzso diverse type III zzso and zzso zzso but also confirm through zzso selection pressure the existence of multiple zzso zzso systems in zzso zzso
