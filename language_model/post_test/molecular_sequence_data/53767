zzso proteins contain a zzso zzso motif consisting of a zzso zzso zzso domain and a highly charged zzso zzso that directly contacts zzso These zzso factors form zzso complexes with each zzso recognizing half of a zzso or nearly zzso DNA zzso We have found that the zzso protein zzso can also bind with high affinity to DNA sites containing only a single zzso consensus zzso Because several recent lines of evidence have suggested a role for zzso DNA binding by zzso zzso we investigated the structure of the zzso zzso zzso DNA binding and affinity zzso studies support a model in which zzso binds as a zzso with one zzso making specific contacts to the consensus zzso and the other zzso forming zzso contacts that are nonetheless important for binding zzso We also examined the folding transition induced in the basic regions of this complex upon binding zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the basic regions of both zzso are zzso suggesting that a protein folding transition may be required for both specific and zzso DNA binding by zzso
