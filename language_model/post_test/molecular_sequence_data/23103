zzso play a major role in the inflammatory and immune responses that mediate zzso zzso zzso expansion zzso is potent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and has recently been studied in transplantation with zzso results, but systemic zzso have been correlated to liver graft survival and zzso of zzso Recent studies revealed that a functional zzso at zzso in the promoter may have a significance for inflammatory and infectious immune zzso Our objective was to investigate zzso promoter zzso in rejection and graft survival in liver zzso We examined the zzso zzso in a series of 218 liver transplants and 101 healthy Caucasian zzso zzso zzso was performed by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso After comparing recipients (with acute rejection episodes versus without zzso with the control population, we found no significant zzso in the distribution of the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso in any comparison zzso zzso zzso Indeed, 5 years zzso survival was zzso in recipients with the zzso zzso against zzso in recipients with the zzso and AA zzso These differences were also not statistically zzso In conclusion, human zzso gene promoter zzso does not seem to influence acute rejection development and zzso survival in liver zzso
