The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso resistance plasmids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were isolated from a wastewater treatment plant, were determined and zzso Both have a nearly identical zzso zzso which zzso early from the zzso zzso plasmids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to the latter zzso the zzso and zzso backbone does not seem to have undergone any zzso The complete partition gene zzso is located downstream of the mating pair formation zzso zzso A zzso zzso or zzso zzso mobile genetic element is present between zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This region is typical for insertions in zzso zzso but the zzso site is zzso Both elements differ only by a zzso in zzso of a zzso zzso The 5 zzso target site zzso and the 26 zzso zzso repeats zzso the mobile genetic elements are still intact, indicating that the zzso occurred zzso The element consists of three zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of a zzso zzso with a gene for a new class D zzso zzso zzso within that, another zzso element with a class 1 zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso for a zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a copy of zzso zzso into the zzso gene zzso a zzso resistance module zzso flanked by copies of zzso is zzso Interestingly, in contrast to all other zzso plasmids zzso so far, the zzso region between zzso and zzso is not interrupted by accessory zzso and there is no indication that previously inserted accessory genes have subsequently been zzso The genes zzso are also missing in that region and should thus be considered acquired zzso These findings, together with the fact that zzso plasmids acquired accessory elements at various positions in the zzso suggest that zzso plasmids without any accessory genes exist in microbial zzso They must occasionally acquire accessory genes by zzso events, resulting in those plasmids that have been found based on zzso zzso zzso
