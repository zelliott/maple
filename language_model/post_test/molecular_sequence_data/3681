The gating mechanism of the zzso zzso channel zzso was investigated by using rate equilibrium linear free energy relationships zzso to probe the transition state between the closed and open zzso The properties of the transition state of gating in the second zzso segment zzso of the delta zzso one of the five zzso zzso zzso was measured on a zzso zzso Series of point zzso were engineered at individual positions of this domain, and the corresponding zzso were characterized zzso at the single-channel zzso zzso zzso zzso opening and closing rate zzso were estimated, and zzso (which are a measure of the extent of the zzso change realized at the transition zzso were calculated for each reaction series as the slope of the zzso relationship zzso rate constant versus log equilibrium zzso Our results indicate that, at the transition state of zzso the zzso half of zzso partly resembles the open state zzso between zzso and zzso while the zzso half completely resembles the closed state zzso between zzso and zzso with a break point near the middle of the zzso zzso This suggests that during gating the two halves of zzso move zzso with the zzso of the zzso portion preceding zzso that of the zzso part of zzso during opening zzso This particular sequence of molecular events indicates that the gating zzso change, which starts at the zzso zzso sites (when zzso does not zzso exclusively along the primary sequence of the zzso In addition, our data are consistent with the zzso segment zzso or swiveling around its central zzso during zzso We also elaborate on zzso aspects of the analysis such as the accuracy of zzso zzso the physical interpretation of fractional zzso and the existence of single versus parallel transition states for the gating zzso
