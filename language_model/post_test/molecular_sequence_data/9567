zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso of crude bacterial samples has been introduced as a very zzso and zzso yet highly zzso tool to identify and zzso zzso The potential of this approach to characterize whole animals, so far zzso insects, is only zzso Here, a simple protocol was developed to perform zzso analysis on extracts from whole ticks of 7 species and 4 zzso zzso Using commercially available software designed for the identification of bacteria, a reference database of zzso was constructed that allowed the species determination of ticks using larvae, zzso or adult individuals as starting zzso zzso analysis on the basis of zzso mass zzso indicated that the primary zzso for the mass zzso was the species, followed by the zzso zzso which formed distinct clusters within the given zzso With certain limitations, species identification was also possible using body parts and zzso zzso zzso of developing zzso zzso eggs showed dramatic changes with time, suggesting that, beyond its usefulness for species determination, zzso may have applications in zzso zzso
