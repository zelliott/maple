The zzso zzso zzso of zzso forms white or light yellow zzso and leaves and when zzso on soil does not survive beyond the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso are zzso as determined by electron zzso and contain reduced levels of zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso are sufficiently differentiated to enable the expression of two nuclear genes whose zzso requires the presence of zzso The zzso gene was isolated by zzso tagging with the zzso zzso element zzso zzso is a novel plant gene whose product shows zzso to a bacterial membrane protein previously identified in five bacterial species and to a zzso zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso is required in the zzso for proper assembly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not have a function identical to zzso because zzso zzso zzso activity is not affected in the zzso and zzso labeling as well as zzso import experiments performed in zzso demonstrated that the zzso protein is present in zzso zzso zzso might have a function related to that of zzso and be involved in the assembly of a zzso zzso zzso
