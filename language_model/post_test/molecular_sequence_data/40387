zzso strains belonging to DNA zzso groups zzso II, IV and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso complex, of Brenner et zzso zzso J zzso zzso 34 zzso zzso were suggested previously to belong to the zzso zzso but have never been formally described and zzso Additionally, it has been shown in several studies that zzso zzso is more closely related to species of zzso than to those of zzso In this study, the zzso positions of zzso DNA zzso II, IV and V and zzso zzso were zzso by both zzso zzso gene sequencing and zzso sequence analyses zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The analyses revealed that DNA zzso II, IV and V and zzso zzso form five separate branches within the zzso zzso zzso from zzso V were split into two zzso zzso zzso data further confirmed that DNA zzso II, IV and V constitute four separate zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a close zzso relative of zzso zzso and DNA zzso IV by both zzso zzso gene sequence and zzso zzso zzso analyses performed on strains from DNA zzso II, IV and V and zzso zzso confirmed their zzso position within the zzso zzso and revealed zzso characteristics that allow the differentiation of these species from each other and from their closest zzso zzso It is proposed to zzso the description of the zzso zzso and to describe zzso zzso zzso zzso for DNA zzso II zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for DNA zzso IV zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for strains of DNA zzso V excluding zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the remaining strain of DNA zzso V zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to transfer zzso zzso to the zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
