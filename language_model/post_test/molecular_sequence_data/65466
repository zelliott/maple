Growth and development of most parts of the zzso skeleton takes place by zzso zzso a process during which zzso undergo distinct stages of differentiation resulting in a successive replacement of the cartilage zzso by zzso In the context of an zzso project we isolated a novel transcript from a human fetal growth plate cartilage zzso zzso The transcript which we called zzso zzso cartilage zzso zzso encodes a short protein of 138 zzso zzso The protein sequence is evolutionary zzso throughout zzso and comprises a signal zzso a zzso domain, and a putative zzso zzso site for zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso we found high expression of zzso uniquely in zzso zzso zzso in developing long bones of zzso zzso This restricted expression could also be observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, and in mice that zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter indicating that expression of zzso is regulated independent of zzso zzso During zzso differentiation of zzso cells we found gradual increase of zzso expression at day 21 with a maximum at day 24 and a decrease zzso with a simultaneous increase in the expression of cartilage link protein zzso a protein with maximum expression in zzso zzso zzso The present data strongly suggest an important function of zzso in the early phase of zzso zzso
