zzso survival depends on signals induced by zzso zzso factor zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was identified in a horse zzso zzso The horse zzso zzso located on zzso 28, spans zzso base pairs and encodes a zzso acid zzso The protein is structurally zzso in which the zzso motif plays an important role in binding to zzso Furthermore, the horse zzso zzso domain was expressed and zzso which specifically bound to zzso and had the capability of blocking the function of zzso in zzso Finally, evolutionary analyses indicated that some zzso sites of zzso evolve with positive selection and that the genetic relationship among a zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso
