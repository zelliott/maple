A zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso was established subsequent to zzso zzso The zzso was shown to be zzso for a number of zzso properties associated with the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso of the zzso site zzso region failed to reveal any zzso between this locus and any reported sequence with the exception of one zzso of unknown function and a few repetitive elements including B1 element and a CA zzso zzso CA repeats occur commonly in the mouse zzso and usually show size zzso In this study, we mapped this zzso locus using CA repeat zzso and Jackson zzso zzso zzso zzso The locus maps to the zzso end of the X zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso and has been designated zzso There are several interesting candidate genes within this zzso zzso of their expression pattern may lead us to a better understanding of the molecular regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
