We present an zzso for predicting zzso factor binding sites based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our zzso is robust against low promoter sequence similarity and motif zzso because it does not depend on multiple sequence zzso This, in turn, allows us to incorporate information from more distant zzso Representative random data sets are used to estimate the score zzso Our zzso is fully zzso and does not require human zzso On a recent zzso zzso data set, it achieves higher accuracy than the previously best zzso zzso zzso threshold and the modular zzso bias score are two general features of our zzso that increase motif prediction accuracy and could be implemented in other zzso as zzso In addition, since our zzso works partly zzso to other zzso combining several zzso can increase prediction accuracy even zzso Specifically, our method finds 6 motifs not found by the 2nd best zzso
