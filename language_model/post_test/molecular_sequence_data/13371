Various strains of zzso zzso zzso contain small cryptic plasmids that replicate via the zzso zzso Like plasmids from other zzso bacteria, these plasmids are composed of several distinct structural zzso A new structural module was identified on the zzso zzso plasmids zzso and zzso It is composed of two zzso one specifies an unidentified protein with a putative signal zzso and the other zzso specifies a functional type 1 signal zzso zzso The zzso but zzso zzso genes of the two plasmids are the first identified zzso zzso zzso With respect to structure and activity, the corresponding zzso zzso zzso are highly similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and several newly identified zzso of other zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso have evolved because, of under certain conditions, zzso can be a limiting factor for protein zzso in zzso zzso
