zzso is a zzso protein that binds to DNA containing zzso zzso Here we have analyzed interactions of zzso zzso with DNA using zzso radical zzso and zzso interference zzso In the zzso complex, three separate DNA regions are protected from zzso radical zzso one located over and immediately adjacent to the zzso motif itself and the other two located on both sides of the zzso zzso The zzso interference zzso zzso however, that only in the zzso motif region zzso of bases was able to interfere with the formation of a zzso complex, suggesting that zzso makes zzso contacts only in the zzso motif zzso To further determine the specific DNA sequences necessary for zzso zzso we employed a zzso chain zzso random binding site selection zzso This analysis showed that zzso binding to DNA requires the zzso sequence and other specific sequences immediately zzso both ends of the zzso zzso We also showed that the nature of the zzso zzso sequences affects the affinity of zzso for zzso Interestingly, most of the zzso motifs present in various higher zzso promoters zzso to the zzso binding sites that were selected, consistent with the hypothesis that these motifs are binding sites for zzso and, zzso that zzso could regulate zzso of numerous zzso zzso
