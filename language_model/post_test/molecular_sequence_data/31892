We have identified novel zzso zzso zzso by sequencing of random clones from zzso library of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence is comprised of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso and shows zzso identity with zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso acid zzso from 35 to 162 belong to zzso zzso zzso The transcript was significantly zzso after early hours of injection with zzso derived from Gram zzso and Gram zzso bacteria, zzso 3 zzso from zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting putative function in innate zzso
