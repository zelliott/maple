Organic zzso tolerant zzso zzso are novel group of zzso zzso that have developed resistance to withstand zzso zzso These organisms play an important role in zzso of organic zzso In the present study, we used an organic zzso marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the zzso shows zzso similarity with an zzso marine zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was used for the transformation of a zzso zzso into zzso in a zzso zzso This transformation was affected by zzso zzso produced by zzso Transformation of zzso to zzso was monitored by zzso zzso (TLC) and zzso zzso zzso activity responsible for transformation was studied in zzso growth medium and cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso The zzso product was zzso and identified as zzso using zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso activity of both zzso and zzso is also zzso
