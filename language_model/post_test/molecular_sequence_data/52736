The zzso zzso region zzso gene encodes a zzso factor characterized by a zzso motif termed the zzso zzso mobility zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes comprise a large family related by zzso to the zzso zzso We isolated a zzso clone with an open reading frame zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso zzso which shared zzso identity to the mouse zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that a zzso band of human zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in heart, although weak signals were seen in brain, liver, zzso and zzso By zzso chain reaction zzso analyses with both a zzso zzso hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid panel, the gene was mapped to the zzso zzso zzso
