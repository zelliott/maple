In the present study, the zzso and molecular characterization of zzso zzso a zzso zzso infecting the European zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were described for the first time from zzso Lake, zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five out of 60 specimens zzso rate of zzso were found to be naturally zzso zzso was recorded as small worms attached to the inner wall of the zzso of host zzso Adult worms measured zzso zzso long and zzso zzso wide for zzso specimens with a smaller oral zzso measuring zzso zzso and a larger zzso zzso which was zzso zzso Our results recorded zzso differences as smaller dimensions of different body parts and the smaller zzso zzso ratio between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, the zzso position of the zzso was determined by molecular characterization of their 18 zzso zzso zzso were compared with those of previously recorded species on the Gene zzso It was found that the present species coincide with those belonging to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences and divergence showed that the zzso zzso gene of this zzso species revealed 92 % sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differing in 26 zzso with lower divergence zzso According to these results, this study indicated that the present species is recorded as zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as a zzso with new host and locality records in zzso
