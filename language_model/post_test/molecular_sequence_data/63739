zzso solution nuclear magnetic resonance zzso data can be obtained from zzso zzso active type I signal zzso zzso zzso an integral membrane zzso in zzso zzso Signal zzso has two zzso zzso a short zzso loop, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a critical component of protein transport systems, recognizing and zzso zzso signal peptides from zzso during the final stage of their zzso Its structure and interactions with the zzso are of considerable interest, but no three-dimensional structure of the whole protein has been zzso The structural analysis of intact membrane proteins has been challenging and only recently has significant progress been achieved using zzso to determine membrane protein zzso Here we employ zzso zzso to study the structure of the full-length zzso I in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso corresponding to approximately 3/4 of the 324 zzso in the zzso Some sequential assignments were obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso The assigned zzso suggest that the observed spectrum is dominated by zzso arising from zzso portions of the protein and that the zzso domain is largely absent from the zzso Our work zzso some of the challenges of solution zzso of large membrane proteins in zzso zzso as well as the future promise of these kinds of zzso
