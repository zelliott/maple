An zzso zzso protein is zzso from a precursor of higher molecular zzso the precursor contains 165 zzso acids (17 zzso whereas the stable product (15 zzso contains 156 zzso zzso The stable zzso form is derived from the precursor zzso form by the removal of eight zzso acids from the zzso zzso and the zzso from the zzso zzso The existence of the precursor zzso protein can be demonstrated after brief periods of in zzso labeling with zzso and by translation of zzso in zzso
