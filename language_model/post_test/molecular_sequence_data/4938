The zzso modification zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso formed spontaneously at high zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso We have characterized a human DNA repair zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by molecular cloning and functional zzso zzso of the human zzso in a repair deficient zzso strain of zzso coli zzso zzso suppressed the spontaneous zzso frequency to almost normal zzso The zzso zzso was localized to the nucleus in cells zzso by zzso of zzso fused to green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso yielded a protein of 38 zzso removing both zzso and zzso from zzso The zzso activities of zzso was zzso on DNA containing single zzso of zzso or zzso sites opposite each of the four normal bases in zzso zzso of zzso opposite C was the most efficient and was followed by strand zzso via zzso However, significant removal of zzso from zzso zzso T zzso zzso was also demonstrated, but essentially without an associated strand zzso zzso zzso with zzso site DNA showed that strand zzso was indeed dependent on the presence of C in the opposite zzso irrespective of the prior removal of an zzso zzso It thus appears that strand incisions are made only if repair completion results in correct base zzso whereas zzso from zzso preserves strand continuity and hence allows for zzso correction by a zzso repair zzso
