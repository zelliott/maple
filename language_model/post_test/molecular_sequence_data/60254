We have identified and characterized zzso zzso and human zzso that zzso a novel zzso protein of zzso zzso acids named DANCE zzso arteries and neural crest zzso growth factor zzso DANCE contains six zzso zzso zzso one of which includes an zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso DANCE protein document that DANCE is a zzso zzso zzso DANCE and recently described protein zzso comprise a new zzso protein zzso The human DANCE gene was mapped at zzso zzso DANCE zzso is mainly expressed in heart, zzso and colon in adult human zzso zzso profile analysis by in zzso zzso revealed prominent DANCE expression in developing zzso DANCE is also expressed in neural crest cell zzso zzso cushion zzso and several other zzso zzso In adult vessels, DANCE expression is largely diminished but is zzso in zzso vessels and zzso zzso notably in zzso vascular smooth muscle cells and zzso cells that lose their ability to zzso in late stage of zzso DANCE protein was shown to promote zzso of zzso cells through interaction of zzso and the zzso motif of zzso DANCE is thus a novel vascular zzso for zzso receptors and may play a role in vascular development and zzso
