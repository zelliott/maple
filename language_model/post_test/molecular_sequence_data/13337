zzso growth factor receptors zzso have three zzso zzso that belong to the zzso zzso We have determined the outline structures for these zzso on the basis of their zzso to the I set zzso zzso The outline structures describe the relative positions of zzso in each zzso their major secondary structures, and the extent to which zzso are accessible to the zzso They also provide the basis of a coherent description of the change in recognition properties that occur when the zzso and zzso zzso are switched and of the effects of zzso in zzso that cause genetic zzso
