zzso zzso channels have long been recognized targets for zzso and local zzso zzso Since the mid-1980s, zzso channels have become widely accepted as the primary target of zzso with pharmacological profiles similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso from animal models and a few preliminary clinical trials suggest that this class of drugs may also offer significant potential for reducing the zzso damage caused by zzso stroke, head zzso and perhaps certain neurodegenerative zzso Studies using zzso zzso of zzso channels with zzso have provided extensive insight into both the physiology and the interaction of drug molecules with zzso zzso This review includes an introduction to zzso channel structure, molecular biology, and physiology as they relate to zzso A review of several in zzso actions of zzso channel zzso is zzso zzso actions with a variety of zzso channel zzso in models of central nervous system disease in animals and in zzso models are zzso Although many zzso zzso channel zzso have additional pharmacological targets, the hypothesis that zzso and zzso actions results from the blockade of zzso channels is zzso
