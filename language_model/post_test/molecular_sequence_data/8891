zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso proteins that maintain cellular homocysteine zzso and produce zzso and hydrogen zzso In the present study, we describe a novel structural arrangement of the CBS zzso zzso by the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein contains a unique tandem repeat of two zzso zzso zzso regions in a single zzso zzso These repeats include a zzso active zzso module containing a zzso site and a less zzso zzso module that is unable to bind the zzso zzso and cannot zzso CBS zzso as demonstrated by analysis of truncated zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast with other zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso and regulatory zzso domain essential for zzso by zzso zzso and only forms zzso We determined the tissue and zzso distribution of zzso and showed that zzso zzso by zzso interference leads to delayed development and to an approximately zzso zzso of homocysteine zzso in zzso zzso The present study provides the first insight into the metabolism of sulfur zzso acids and hydrogen zzso in zzso zzso and shows that zzso zzso possess a structural feature that is unique among CBS zzso
