The zzso gene encodes a zzso finger protein of unknown zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is a functional zzso protein zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso 1 is localized to the nucleus by a zzso nuclear zzso sequence zzso We confirm that zzso is a binding partner of zzso and demonstrate that zzso can zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Finally, we show that zzso of zzso in zzso cells results in zzso of zzso to discrete zzso associated with zzso nuclear zzso These results suggest zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that may play a role in regulating zzso
