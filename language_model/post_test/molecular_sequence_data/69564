An zzso acid segment of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a newly zzso zzso zzso zzso shows significant sequence zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso nuclear factor zzso head family of zzso Here we demonstrate that this zzso acid domain is necessary and sufficient for DNA zzso We also propose a secondary structural model for the zzso At the zzso portion of the model, a basic hook structure is followed by two zzso zzso separated by a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso within the two proposed zzso form the zzso zzso An aromatic zzso and a third zzso zzso comprise the center of the zzso At the C zzso two zzso zzso flank a putative zzso acid zzso followed by a short basic zzso
