An zzso zzso incorporated into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is reported to stabilize the triple zzso structure as well as a zzso zzso zzso Here, we zzso zzso collagen models containing zzso in zzso utilizing the zzso knot zzso Analysis of their zzso transition temperatures using circular zzso zzso demonstrated unexpected decrease in the triple zzso stability as the number of zzso zzso The obtained results indicated that an zzso zzso in a zzso is not always an equivalent of a zzso zzso and that it possesses a potential zzso zzso zzso
