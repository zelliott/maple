We zzso zzso of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso obtained from cats that experienced zzso infection after having been vaccinated against zzso New zzso primer sets zzso zzso zzso were also zzso since the conventional Seal primer failed to amplify the target sequences in two zzso The zzso of the four zzso as well as eight global and 17 domestic strains were determined by zzso analysis of their zzso acid zzso One out of the four strains zzso isolated in this study, zzso was grouped into zzso I, along with the vaccine strains zzso and zzso The other three zzso zzso belonged to zzso zzso Thus, there were more zzso in zzso II than in zzso zzso However, the zzso values of the four zzso against cat zzso zzso were significantly zzso There may be no relationship between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence alignment of the four zzso showed that only a single zzso acid in region C, which is involved in zzso zzso was different in zzso strain from that of zzso The other three zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared the same zzso acid sequence with zzso zzso of zzso acids for linear zzso in the zzso strain, which are located at regions D and zzso showed variations in zzso zzso region zzso of zzso whereas D and zzso had only synonymous zzso zzso no change in the zzso acid zzso This zzso in zzso zzso of region E suggested a vaccine breakdown, as the region is known to be essential for zzso The zzso II zzso is likely to be the cause of the zzso infection in this study, while the vaccine strains belong to zzso zzso Thus, the existing vaccine may need zzso for its zzso
