zzso proteins (also known as zzso zzso are zzso members of the zzso zzso They are expressed at high levels during zzso when they are thought to induce zzso and zzso zzso There are between four and six zzso zzso and three different complementary zzso have been zzso Here we identify a fourth zzso gene zzso that we have cloned and zzso zzso is zzso identical in zzso acid sequence with the other zzso proteins but is missing two zzso sites that are present in the other zzso zzso with the loss of two of three zzso sites, the expressed form of zzso has a lower apparent molecular weight compared with other zzso In zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso and the adult zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso on day zzso In the skin, zzso expression is specific to the ears and tails of zzso Our results suggest that, as well as having growth and zzso effects during pregnancy, the zzso may have functions in zzso zzso zzso among the members of the zzso family for its expression in the hair zzso of the tail and ear, zzso is expected to have a singular role in the growth and development of these zzso
