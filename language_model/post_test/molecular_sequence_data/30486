The zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli K-12 can be used in an expression system as a carrier for foreign zzso zzso zzso their transport to the bacterial cell zzso The system is very flexible, since insertions varying in length and nature can be made in different zzso regions of zzso zzso without interfering with the assembly process into the outer zzso Multiple insertions of an zzso zzso can be made in the second and eighth exposed regions, resulting in a total insert length of up to 30 and 50 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso can be made in two exposed regions, zzso However, some limitations were encountered, zzso zzso of eight or more zzso zzso zzso affected both the zzso process across the inner membrane and the assembly process into the outer zzso Also, the zzso of sequences containing many charged zzso resulted in zzso of precursor protein in the zzso
