We zzso and characterized an zzso zzso zzso from a zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso was estimated to be 60 zzso by zzso gel zzso zzso The optimum pH and temperature of the zzso were zzso and 50 degrees C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso especially zzso and showed a tendency to decrease with increases in the degree of zzso But, zzso didn't zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The open reading frame of zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed zzso with several zzso belonging to zzso zzso family zzso The expression zzso coding for zzso was constructed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed pH and temperature zzso and zzso specificity similar to those of the native zzso The gene arrangement near the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was compared with that of zzso zzso zzso Three zzso which appear to constitute an ABC transport system for sugar, were missing in the vicinity of the zzso zzso
