As the first step in generating a transgenic mouse model of zzso diabetes zzso zzso we have analyzed the mouse zzso zzso zzso and gene and generated a zzso zzso zzso to zzso human zzso zzso zzso was isolated from mouse kidney and zzso a zzso protein with zzso identity to human zzso zzso in zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a single zzso zzso transcript expressed only in kidney zzso zzso zzso transcript expression was increased approximately zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso with a zzso mouse zzso DNA indicated three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso separating four zzso with boundaries at zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was water permeable when expressed in zzso zzso but was retained at the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The chemical zzso zzso produced a zzso of zzso from zzso to plasma zzso These results establish a basis for an zzso transgenic zzso model of zzso
