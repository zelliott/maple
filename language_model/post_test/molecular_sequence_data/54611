This study zzso the presence, location and zzso of zzso and zzso resistance genes in 103 zzso zzso outbreak zzso and in 32 sporadic zzso from zzso Multiple zzso resistance was common in both outbreak zzso and sporadic zzso zzso Class 1 zzso were present in 34 outbreak zzso zzso and in six sporadic zzso zzso This study is the first, to our knowledge, to identify an zzso zzso class 1 zzso carrying the zzso cassette array in zzso Class 2 zzso carrying the zzso cassette array were zzso in outbreak zzso zzso but were not present in sporadic zzso Other zzso resistance genes not associated with zzso were found to zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The most common zzso size was zzso zzso in 43 and zzso of 1998 outbreak and sporadic zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso location of resistance genes and horizontal zzso transfer promote the spread of multiple resistance genes in outbreak and sporadic zzso of zzso zzso
