Previously, we showed that zzso II heavy chains bind to zzso zzso zzso via their zzso terminal regions and that protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso the zzso heavy chains zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, we studied the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso C, and the effect of zzso zzso zzso on assembly using zzso zzso fragments from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and brain type zzso heavy chain zzso zzso of the fragments to zzso or zzso zzso increased zzso but zzso gave higher zzso than zzso Both fragments were zzso similarly by zzso in zzso concentration and mole percent of zzso dependent zzso With mixed zzso zzso zzso at least 70 zzso % zzso was required for heavy chain zzso A similar level of zzso was required for zzso of fragments by zzso C, indicating that binding of tail regions to zzso is a prerequisite for zzso by zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso with zzso values 4-5 times higher than those of zzso but the zzso values for the two zzso were zzso The apparent zzso values for zzso zzso zzso were also similar for zzso of both zzso zzso zzso with PC increased the zzso and reduced the zzso values but did not alter the zzso values for the zzso Assembly of zzso but not zzso was significantly inhibited by the zzso indicating that zzso zzso assembly can be zzso in an zzso specific manner, via zzso of heavy chains by zzso zzso
