In order to explore the mechanism for the zzso replication of classical zzso fever virus zzso so as to make a basis for investigating its zzso an introduction of the information theory is presented in connection with the statistical mechanics, zzso zzso statistics appears naturally as a consequence of the zzso zzso Furthermore, a selection rule for identifying the pattern of a recognition site for an zzso protein is proposed by means of the maximum zzso zzso Based on those, the information contents of zzso regions zzso of zzso of 20 zzso strains and zzso regions zzso of zzso of 58 zzso strains are analyzed with a zzso zzso in a reduction mode, and the zzso sites of 20 strains and zzso sites of 58 strains containing important motifs are extracted from the zzso zzso sequences of unequal zzso These sites, which have the patterns of sequence and structure similar to the putative zzso elements related to the regulation of zzso zzso would be identified as the potential recognition sites in zzso and zzso for zzso zzso responsible for classical zzso fever virus zzso zzso and to some extent, this identification is supported by experimental zzso Finally, information analysis allows a presumption to be made about the zzso zzso replication initiation zzso
