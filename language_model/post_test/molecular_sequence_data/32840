This study determined the conservation and protective efficacy of a 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso This protein was highly zzso across the strains of zzso examined and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the numbers of viable zzso recovered from the lung following zzso zzso induced predominantly an zzso zzso response that correlated with the reduction in the number of viable zzso in the zzso These zzso were not zzso against zzso The results suggest that zzso warrants further investigation as a vaccine component for zzso zzso
