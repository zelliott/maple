The value of clinical specimens in identification of tumor zzso is limited to the great individual variations among patients, the high complexity and dynamic range of protein zzso and the possibility that the identified proteins are not produced by cancer cells but are due to secondary body defense zzso zzso we developed a zzso model system, in which human zzso zzso cells formed a tumor in an zzso nude zzso to instantly detect proteins derived from cancer zzso 

Using one-dimensional zzso liquid zzso and zzso and zzso zzso the zzso proteins in the serum of zzso mouse could be identified and monitored without the great variations observed in a zzso zzso 

We successfully identified 224 zzso in which 175 zzso were of mouse origin, and 45 zzso were unable to be assigned as human or mouse zzso zzso was identified as a uniquely zzso zzso Its expression profile was then confirmed by Western zzso in serum samples from zzso mice, and patients bearing zzso zzso and healthy zzso 

Although the mechanism of zzso derivation by cancer cells remains to be zzso our results suggest that the zzso model presented here should be a promising tool in the discovery of tumor zzso
