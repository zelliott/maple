The zzso reaction promoted by the zzso system is an essential defense response in zzso subjected to regulatory mechanisms that are still not fully zzso We report here the finding and characterization of a novel zzso zzso named zzso isolated from the zzso of the zzso lobster zzso zzso with regulatory functions on the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of 48 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso with six zzso zzso forming zzso zzso Its primary sequence was determined by combining zzso zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso The low zzso acid sequence similarity with known proteins indicates that it represents a new family of zzso zzso zzso is a competitive and zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a notable specificity because it does not inhibit zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The removal of zzso from the lobster zzso zzso leads to an increase in zzso response to zzso Likewise, the addition of increasing zzso of zzso to a lobster zzso zzso previously depleted of zzso activity, decreased the zzso response to zzso in a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is implicated in the regulation of the zzso cascade in zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso toward the zzso of the zzso zzso
