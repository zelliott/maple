The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been mapped physically by fluorescent zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso probe zzso detected one zzso which corresponded to the secondary zzso zzso zzso on the long arm of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso probe zzso detected two pairs of zzso zzso gene clusters which were localized at two different zzso zzso one near the zzso on the short arm of the zzso I, which is the largest zzso of the complement, and the other about zzso out on the long arm of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The zzso zzso repeat unit is 309 zzso in zzso consisting of 121 zzso highly zzso coding region and 188 zzso variable zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is characterized by the similar size of zzso within the group 2, group 3, or group zzso This study represents the first step towards the understanding the zzso organization of zzso zzso and provides reliable markers for zzso identification in this grass, an important species as a model system for the study of zzso in zzso
