zzso zzso nitrate zzso zzso of many bacteria include four common, essential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (or a zzso of zzso zzso In zzso coli there are three additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso none of which are essential for zzso zzso We now show that deletion of either zzso or zzso almost abolished zzso nitrate reduction by strains defective in zzso zzso The residual rate of nitrate reduction zzso zzso of that of zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to replace zzso reduction in a zzso role during growth by zzso zzso Western zzso combined with zzso and alkaline zzso fusion experiments established that zzso is an integral membrane protein with four zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso as well as the two zzso zzso zzso are located in the zzso An zzso twin zzso motif was shown to be essential for zzso function, consistent with the expectation that zzso is zzso into the zzso by the twin zzso zzso zzso A bacterial zzso system was used to show that zzso zzso presumably on the zzso side of, or zzso the zzso with zzso As expected for a zzso zzso no zzso interactions with zzso or zzso were detected in the zzso An in zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed to show that both zzso and zzso are essential for rapid electron transfer from zzso to the terminal zzso zzso These new in zzso and in zzso results establish that zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso that couples electron transfer from the high zzso zzso potential zzso couple via zzso and zzso to zzso
