A new zzso approach based on zzso zzso mass zzso zzso has provided new insight into the characterization of zzso caps from zzso zzso which are key molecules in the zzso of zzso This zzso approach requires zzso labeling with the zzso zzso zzso by reductive zzso at the reducing zzso zzso of the separation and zzso conditions, such as the choice of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is presented and zzso zzso separation of the zzso and zzso zzso derivatives was finally achieved with zzso zzso zzso zzso It was found that in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso buffer was appropriate for zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso In this case, negative zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed mainly zzso zzso and some sequence zzso zzso allowing their zzso structural characterization at the zzso zzso This zzso approach was successfully applied to more complex zzso of carbohydrates released by mild acid zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso cap zzso were separated by zzso and their structural characterization achieved by zzso zzso zzso caps were routinely analyzed by zzso zzso induced zzso zzso from 50 zzso of zzso with zzso capping zzso but sensitivity was about 50 times lower using zzso zzso
