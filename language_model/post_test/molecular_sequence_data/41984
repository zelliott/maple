zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its receptors are abundant in the brain and particularly in the zzso of adult zzso In contrast, the occurrence of zzso binding sites has not been investigated during zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the distribution and zzso characteristics of zzso binding sites in the rat zzso during zzso development, and to examine the effect of zzso on immature zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso binding sites are zzso expressed in a zzso zzso of the zzso cortex, the external zzso cell layer, and in the zzso from zzso days 8 to zzso A population of zzso binding sites persisted in the internal zzso cell layer in the mature zzso zzso zzso performed on cultured immature zzso cells from zzso rat zzso demonstrated that transient zzso binding sites are expressed by zzso immature zzso zzso zzso characterization of binding revealed the occurrence of two classes of zzso recognition sites zzso respectively, high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity for zzso The two naturally occurring forms zzso and zzso were zzso in competing for zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso analog was eight times less efficient and zzso zzso zzso only induced weak displacement of the zzso Exposure of cultured immature zzso cells to zzso resulted in a zzso stimulation of the production of zzso indicating that zzso binding sites represent authentic receptors positively coupled to zzso zzso These results show that zzso receptors are actively expressed in the zzso of rats during zzso zzso The presence of functional zzso receptors in the external zzso cell layer suggests that zzso may play a role in the control of proliferation and/or differentiation of zzso zzso
