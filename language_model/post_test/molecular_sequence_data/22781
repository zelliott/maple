To clarify the stability of the BK zzso zzso zzso in zzso transplant zzso recipients, three to five complete zzso zzso from each of six zzso recipients with surviving zzso zzso were zzso zzso The complete sequences of these clones were determined and compared in each zzso No zzso difference was detected among clones in two patients, and a few zzso variations were found among those in four zzso In each of these patients a parental sequence (usually the major zzso from which zzso sequences (usually minor zzso with zzso zzso would have been generated, were zzso A comparison between the parental and zzso sequences in each patient identified a single zzso substitution in each zzso zzso From these findings, it was concluded that the zzso of zzso is stable in zzso recipients without zzso with only minor zzso zzso in the coding zzso
