This study uses multiple zzso zzso to increase the sequence coverage of proteins identified by the shotgun sequencing approach to zzso zzso The zzso used were zzso zzso and zzso which cleave at zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso This approach was evaluated with the zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and gave enhanced sequence coverage, compared with a single zzso zzso The approach was then evaluated with a complex zzso sample, namely zzso It was found that zzso and zzso were able to detect overlapping but distinct sets of proteins and a digital zzso of the data gave a significant increase in both the number of protein identifications as well as an increase in the number of peptides identified per protein (which improves the certainty of the zzso
