zzso and C are related class I genes which are believed to have arisen by zzso of a common zzso Previous study showed the presence of zzso for both zzso and C in African apes but only for zzso in Asian zzso These observations suggested that the zzso C locus evolved subsequent to the divergence of the zzso and zzso From an analysis of orangutan zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were defined as well as three zzso zzso zzso By contrast, no zzso zzso were obtained from orangutan zzso although three zzso zzso were zzso Thus an zzso locus exists in the orangutan (as well as a duplicated B zzso zzso that the zzso C locus evolved prior to the divergence of the zzso and zzso and is at least zzso million years zzso zzso is whether all orangutan zzso zzso contain a C zzso as the failure to find C zzso in some individuals could be due to a zzso of zzso zzso with certain zzso zzso These results raise the possibilities that other zzso species have a C locus and that the regulation of natural killer cells by C zzso evolved earlier in zzso evolution than has been zzso
