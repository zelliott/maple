The coiled zzso is a widespread motif involved in zzso and zzso zzso but the structural requirements for binding to target proteins are poorly zzso To address this question, we measured binding of zzso the zzso coiled zzso to zzso as a model zzso zzso binds to the zzso filament and zzso regulates its zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso that bind to other proteins are zzso We made zzso that alter interface packing and stability as well as zzso in surface zzso in a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso measured by zzso was correlated with zzso stability and local instability and side chain flexibility, analyzed with circular zzso and zzso zzso The flexibility from interruptions in the stable zzso interface is essential for zzso zzso The surface zzso in a zzso zzso binding site participate in zzso binding when the coiled zzso within it is poorly zzso
