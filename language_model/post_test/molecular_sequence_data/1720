The first zzso of a virus infecting a representative of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso that consists of zzso zzso its zzso of zzso resembles the hosts G + zzso zzso within the zzso A total of 76 open reading frames zzso were identified, the majority of which zzso displaying equal zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is obvious as zzso coding for head and tail proteins are located close to the center in the first half of the zzso and putative zzso zzso are zzso by centrally located zzso DNA repair and zzso functions are situated in the remaining part of the zzso adjacent to a small gene zzso the predicted proteins of which are involved in DNA zzso Close to the left zzso there are two small regions zzso zzso zzso each, separated by zzso zzso which are zzso to the recently zzso zzso zzso however, the unique overall structure of the zzso does not bear resemblance to any other known viral zzso The zzso sequence was deposited in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
