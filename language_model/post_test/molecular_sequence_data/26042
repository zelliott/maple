The type I human zzso leukemia virus zzso encodes a zzso nuclear zzso protein termed Tax that zzso activates the zzso long terminal repeat zzso as well as select zzso cellular and zzso viral zzso Tax does not bind DNA specifically but, rather, acts in a more indirect zzso Tax zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso through zzso expressed cellular factors that bind to zzso response elements zzso present within the zzso enhancers of the zzso In contrast, Tax zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso of the type 1 human zzso virus zzso involves the induced nuclear expression of zzso zzso We now report the identification of zzso zzso within the tax gene that functionally segregate these two pathways of zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso of the Tax zzso despite its zzso and predicted zzso structure, is completely zzso for zzso through either of these zzso factor zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso within a putative zinc finger domain disrupt the nuclear zzso of Tax and abolish zzso These results demonstrate that Tax zzso of viral and cellular promoters involves at least two mechanisms of host zzso factor zzso and suggest that this zzso is likely zzso through distinct functional zzso
