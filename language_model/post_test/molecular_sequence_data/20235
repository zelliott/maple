zzso zzso zzso zzso is a useful method for detecting zzso zzso Specifically, zzso signals produced from reconstructed split zzso fragments are powerful tools for in zzso analysis because the zzso signals have been zzso both in cultured cells and living zzso However, they are limited for detection and evaluation of biological events relevant to zzso zzso zzso In this study, we constructed an zzso zzso zzso probe for detecting target zzso other than zzso zzso It consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a short zzso between internally divided zzso zzso The inserted short zzso triggers zzso zzso or zzso and subsequent zzso or zzso of zzso activity through its induced fit zzso zzso We chose zzso binding zzso rich motif zzso zzso Rev and/or zzso for model zzso zzso and expressed constructed zzso probe zzso using a wheat germ zzso protein synthesis zzso They showed zzso activity changes, zzso or zzso after binding to their specific zzso zzso Furthermore, to expand the versatility of the zzso zzso detection system, we designed zzso zzso built to reform the zzso zzso binding site in the presence of arbitrarily selected zzso As a result, the target zzso was zzso detected by zzso zzso signals zzso by a cooperative function of the zzso and zzso probe zzso
