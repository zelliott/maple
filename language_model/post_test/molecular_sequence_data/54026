Small zzso displaying zzso acid sequences zzso zzso shorter than zzso zzso zzso have recently been identified in several zzso and zzso zzso organisms, and named zzso zzso zzso They have been proposed to be involved not only in oxygen transport but also in other biological functions, such as protection against zzso nitrogen species, photosynthesis or to act as terminal zzso Crystal structures of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the green zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso structure of both proteins is based on a zzso zzso zzso reflecting an unprecedented editing of the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on specific zzso motifs the zzso structure zzso the deletion of the zzso zzso and replacement of the crucial zzso zzso with an extended zzso zzso Additionally, concerted structural modifications allow burying of the zzso group and define the zzso site, which hosts a zzso zzso zzso zzso A set of structural and zzso acid sequence consensus rules for stabilizing the fold and the bound zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso
