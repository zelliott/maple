zzso zzso have been found in various animals, plants and zzso There were two types of zzso zzso in soybean including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The different zzso genes from wild soybean zzso zzso and cultivated soybean zzso zzso formed a zzso zzso We constructed a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso seed at the zzso growth stage using the SMART zzso zzso zzso or zzso were highly zzso to soybean zzso zzso zzso of 5, 35, 8 and 9 were highly zzso to zzso family members zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses showed there were novel zzso variations among the 4 zzso members in zzso zzso Based on the comparison of soybean seed zzso libraries from different zzso zzso it was apparent that the expression of zzso zzso increased during seed development in zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene sequences among zzso and zzso plants demonstrated that these genes shared a common zzso
