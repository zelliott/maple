zzso of the roles of zzso associated factors requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso control of flowering time through zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, are known as central zzso zzso Other plants may share the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso zzso To identify and characterize these zzso response genes in zzso crops whose zzso was zzso after divergence from zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso clones containing these genes by zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso end sequences against the five corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso allowed identification of five zzso zzso one for each of the five zzso zzso By draft shotgun sequencing of the zzso zzso we identified the complete gene sequences and cloned the five expressed zzso zzso zzso gene members, zzso 1, 3, 5, 7, and zzso zzso analysis revealed that each zzso was zzso to the corresponding zzso at the sequence zzso Northern zzso revealed that the five genes were transcribed at distinct points in the 24 hour period, and Southern zzso revealed that they are present in 2, 1, 2, 2, and 1 copies, respectively in the zzso zzso zzso which was zzso and then zzso during the last 15 million zzso
