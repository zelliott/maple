A gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was randomly zzso to generate zzso zzso with altered pH zzso One of the zzso which exhibited a significantly higher activity in the pH range zzso compared to zzso had a zzso substitution in the region corresponding to zzso one of the zzso binding regions of the zzso zzso The other zzso with almost the same pH profile as zzso had a zzso substitution near the type 3 copper center and became more sensitive to zzso than zzso zzso zzso in the zzso binding regions with reference to the zzso acid sequences of plant zzso led to isolation of zzso shifted upward in the pH zzso zzso and zzso increased the pH optimum by 1 and zzso units, respectively, while retaining the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso model of zzso constructed from the zzso zzso coordinates suggested that replacement of zzso by Pro could disturb the zzso pair networks among zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso could affect either the molecular recognition between the zzso and zzso or the electron transfer from the zzso to the type 1 copper center, leading to the alkaline shift of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso The other zzso zzso could also induce similar structural zzso involving the zzso pair zzso
