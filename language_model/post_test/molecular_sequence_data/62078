The zzso zzso to zzso transition in a series of host peptides was monitored using circular zzso zzso zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso Combination of these two techniques allowed direct determination of the zzso of zzso transition for the studied zzso It was found that the zzso of the zzso transition differs for different peptides and this difference is related to the difference in the temperature for the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso transition decreases with the increase in temperature, thus providing the first experimental estimate for the heat capacity changes upon zzso transition, zzso The values for zzso of zzso transition are found to be negative, which is in contrast to the positive zzso for protein zzso Analysis suggests that this negative zzso of zzso transition is due to the exposure of the polar zzso backbone to zzso upon zzso zzso
