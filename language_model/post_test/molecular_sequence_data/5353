The zzso zzso genes from zzso associated with digital zzso of British cattle were amplified by zzso chain reaction from digital zzso zzso zzso using one universal and one zzso zzso Two zzso sequences were identified both of which shared a high degree of zzso with the oral pathogen zzso zzso zzso Two further zzso zzso gene sequences were obtained and shared similarity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso amplified a potential zzso gene from digital zzso zzso which shared a high degree of zzso to the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso The significance of the presence of organisms in digital zzso zzso of the bovine foot which are closely related to oral pathogens is zzso
