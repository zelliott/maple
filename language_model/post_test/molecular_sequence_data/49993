The zzso 2 domain containing protein zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of infection with zzso Recently, we identified zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso from zzso zzso as a zzso binding and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 277 (2002) zzso To characterize this apparent zzso zzso factor further, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha was cloned and zzso Whereas nearly complete sequence conservation was observed amongst zzso alpha proteins from zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso alpha of zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso alpha sequences showed a number of significant zzso zzso structure zzso upon the known crystal structure of zzso alpha for zzso zzso a hairpin loop present in zzso zzso alpha and absent from the zzso protein which corresponded to a 12 zzso acid zzso zzso with these structural differences, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso alpha and host zzso alpha were zzso zzso Interestingly, infection of zzso with zzso zzso caused zzso of host as well as pathogen zzso zzso Since zzso alpha is essential for survival, the distinct zzso and structural properties of zzso zzso alpha may provide a novel target for drug zzso
