zzso E zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of two identical zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 42 zzso and has a unique zzso distribution in various rat zzso In this study, we determined the complete zzso acid sequence of rat zzso zzso and examined the zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso from this zzso Two zzso clones zzso rat zzso termed zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences predicted from the respective zzso sequences revealed that they were essentially zzso except that zzso lacked a sequence corresponding to zzso zzso of the longer zzso clone zzso Based on the structural analysis of zzso zzso forms, the zzso precursor was found to comprise a signal zzso a zzso and a mature protein region of 19, 39, and 337 zzso or 304 zzso zzso zzso Despite a high degree of similarity in the overall structure of zzso between rat and other zzso species, the first 11 zzso in the zzso sequence of rat mature zzso were significantly different from those of other zzso The zzso zzso was analyzed for its conversion to the mature zzso The results indicated that the zzso conversion occurred at pH zzso in a zzso and zzso manner by zzso zzso at the site between zzso This conversion was highly dependent on the protein zzso of zzso and delayed by the presence of zzso zzso suggesting the predominance of zzso reaction for its conversion to the mature zzso
