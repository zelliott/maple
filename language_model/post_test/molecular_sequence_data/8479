Recently, two zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso In this study, we isolated and identified fusion transcripts from a zzso cell line carrying zzso We demonstrated by zzso analysis that these transcripts are consistently expressed in fresh zzso cells with zzso On the other hand, the wild type of zzso is expressed in several zzso cells from different zzso while the expression of zzso was present in all zzso cells zzso These widespread expression suggests these molecules play an essential role in zzso
