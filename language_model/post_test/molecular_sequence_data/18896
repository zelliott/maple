Comparative zzso is an effective approach to assess the evolutionary history of biological zzso We used comparative zzso in zzso tree zzso from Lower zzso zzso zzso zzso to test for zzso with two simple evolutionary scenarios based on zzso features 1) the zzso environmental zzso and 2) the zzso seasonal zzso which determine zzso and zzso differences in the zzso We zzso the zzso zzso DNA region using a dual sampling zzso zzso zzso with small sample sizes zzso 1, mean zzso to assess whether a strong general pattern of zzso zzso and genetic differentiation zzso and four zzso well-studied species with larger sample sizes zzso 2, mean zzso to detect the presence of particular shared zzso zzso When grouping the samples into two alternative sets of two zzso W and zzso zzso N and zzso neither zzso exhibited a strong pattern of zzso zzso suggesting that none of the considered regions consistently zzso older zzso zzso in zzso 1 was similarly strong between W and E as between N and zzso with 3-5 significant F ST tests out of 14 tests in each zzso zzso simulations indicated that, given the power of the data, this result probably reflects idiosyncratic histories of the zzso or a weak common differentiation pattern zzso with population zzso zzso across zzso in zzso zzso zzso 2 identified a common genetic break separating the northern and southern populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Lower zzso in agreement with differentiation across the zzso seasonal zzso Our work suggests that currently recognized tree zzso or suspected species complexes can contain strongly differentiated genetic zzso which could lead to zzso of zzso zzso Therefore the evolutionary processes of such zzso require further study in African tropical zzso
