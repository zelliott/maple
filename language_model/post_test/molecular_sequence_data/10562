We have isolated and characterized a novel member zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso In zzso injection zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso sodium zzso transport activity with high affinity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Transport of zzso was effectively zzso only by zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid but not by zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the incubation medium zzso the zzso rate of zzso indicating that zzso is subject to zzso All these results are consistent with the idea that zzso along with zzso and zzso constitutes the transport activity originally assigned to system zzso Like zzso but unlike zzso the expression of zzso is regulated in a highly zzso manner; when various adult zzso were zzso significant levels of zzso transcript were zzso only in zzso In zzso zzso on brain sections revealed that zzso transcripts were localized predominantly along the zzso zzso whereas neither zzso nor zzso transcripts demonstrated a similar zzso In contrast to its highly localized expression during the primitive streak stage and in the adult stage, zzso expression was detected more widely in zzso day zzso mouse zzso
