zzso zzso the precursor zzso for zzso is zzso in the liver under zzso zzso In all zzso species, including fish, the process of zzso is crucial to subsequent embryonic zzso This study attempted to obtain the zzso zzso for zzso from female Japanese zzso zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso were used to amplify zzso zzso prepared from liver zzso zzso zzso products were zzso and zzso The overall sequence of zzso zzso zzso isolated in this study contained zzso zzso This zzso sequence encodes zzso zzso acids of the precursor zzso and is entirely composed of the characteristic zzso zzso region, an internal zzso domain region, and a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from these clones shares zzso identity with other zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso of zzso gene expression following hormonal treatment demonstrated that this zzso is zzso in the liver under stimulation by zzso zzso However, zzso synthesis may not be enhanced by salmon zzso zzso zzso induction for the developing zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso following zzso injection, may be more appropriate for the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso maturation during the artificial maturation of Japanese female zzso
