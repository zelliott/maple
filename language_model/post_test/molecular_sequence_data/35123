Both biomass dominated green zzso cells zzso and zzso orange resting cells zzso affect the final zzso yield in zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the OR cells greatly varied from the zzso cells at both cellular and zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso in the OR were zzso and zzso Furthermore, the OR zzso most of the zzso zzso with elevated zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso moderate photosynthesis was detected in zzso even though most of the zzso zzso were zzso when compared with those in the zzso However, the energy distribution pattern between zzso I and II zzso and zzso in the OR favored zzso which was also confirmed by zzso zzso As zzso was not detected in the zzso we attribute the zzso role to zzso instead of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso comparison analysis of zzso of the OR and zzso indicated no zzso remarkable zzso However, an extensive zzso mechanism of zzso zzso was proposed, in which proteins in zzso of zzso were noted to be involved in biomass zzso and those in OR were involved in stress zzso zzso of the comparative analysis might provide some zzso background of OR for zzso production by using zzso zzso
