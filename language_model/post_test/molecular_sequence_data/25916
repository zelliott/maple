The zzso zzso crystal structure of a complex containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso analogue was solved by multiple zzso zzso The zzso map is sufficiently detailed to zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and a single zzso of the zzso analogue bound zzso its active zzso Although zzso zzso does not belong to the large zzso Class zzso family that encompasses most other well-studied zzso there is zzso sequence similarity and conservation of many functional zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with other zzso structures provides compelling evidence for a common zzso zzso
