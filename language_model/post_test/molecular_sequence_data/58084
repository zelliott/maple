Point zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene causing single zzso acid zzso have been identified in several different zzso with generalized resistance to zzso zzso Until now, no study has been reported on the zzso gene in cases of zzso resistance zzso In the present study, we analyzed the zzso beta gene in a zzso Japanese female with zzso She exhibited clinical features of zzso elevated serum zzso hormone levels accompanied by inappropriately increased zzso of zzso mildly elevated zzso zzso rate, and increased urinary zzso of zzso No zzso tumor was zzso DNA fragments of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso beta gene were generated by the zzso chain reaction and analyzed by a single stranded zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 of the patient's zzso beta gene showed an abnormal band, suggesting the existence of zzso By zzso and sequencing the DNA, a point zzso was identified in one zzso at zzso zzso zzso to zzso which altered the zzso zzso acid, zzso to zzso Neither of her apparently normal parents had any zzso of the zzso beta zzso In zzso translation products of the zzso zzso beta gene showed remarkably decreased zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the molecular zzso detected in a patient with zzso is similar to that seen in subjects with generalized resistance to zzso hormone, both types of the syndrome may represent a continuous spectrum of the same zzso zzso with variable tissue resistance to zzso zzso
