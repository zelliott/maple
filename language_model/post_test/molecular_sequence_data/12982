The gene of zzso zzso has been cloned and identified to be identical to gene of the zzso zzso It is known that the zzso of zzso is expressed in liver and zzso However, it is not clarified which cells in the liver produce zzso Using a human zzso cell line, zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso was expressed by liver zzso cells without any zzso To clarify the regulation of the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso we assessed the effects of 5 zzso transforming growth zzso 1, zzso A, zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor, and zzso These zzso have no significant zzso effect on the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that liver zzso cells may be the zzso producing cells and also suggest that some zzso cells may produce zzso zzso
