zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso coli and zzso The corresponding zzso protein has a molecular weight typical of a zzso zzso and an activity comparable to that of other zzso zzso The copper active site is characterized by a peculiar zzso geometry as evidenced by its electron zzso resonance spectrum, moreover, the copper atom displays a low accessibility toward external zzso agents indicating a lower zzso accessibility when compared to other zzso zzso Investigation of the zzso zzso stability through differential scanning zzso indicates the occurrence of two transitions at low and higher temperature that are found to be due to the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, confirming that the metals have a crucial role in the stabilization of this class of zzso
