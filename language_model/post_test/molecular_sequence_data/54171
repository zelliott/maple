zzso zzso is a zzso modification zzso of body zzso and zzso that is sustained by chronic inflammation and zzso stress, two main clinical traits of chronic kidney disease zzso Despite this background, protein targets and their differential zzso to in zzso zzso remain almost completely unexplored in zzso This study reports a first investigation of plasma zzso in these patients, carried out by both zzso and zzso zzso Plasma proteins of chronic and zzso zzso patients showed a higher burden of zzso than in healthy controls, but main zzso targets appeared to be the same in these zzso zzso data showed that zzso zzso is largely represented in the zzso zzso together with zzso chains zzso B and zzso zzso zzso complement factor D, zzso and zzso light and heavy zzso However, zzso and affinity zzso experiments demonstrated that the relative content of zzso on the zzso zzso was very low when compared with that of the remaining plasma zzso The zzso zzso was investigated using also plasma proteins obtained by in zzso zzso from patients treated with protein leaking or standard zzso zzso The study of these samples revealed the possibility to selectively remove protein zzso products during zzso Identification of zzso sites of zzso was preliminarily obtained in zzso chains isolated by zzso PAGE and assessed by zzso tandem mass zzso after zzso zzso Further studies are needed to confirm at the molecular level the presence of zzso zzso zzso in other proteins tentatively identified as zzso targets in this study and to explore the biological meaning of such a selective modification of plasma proteins by zzso nitrogen species in zzso and dialysis zzso
