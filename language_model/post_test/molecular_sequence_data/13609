zzso genes have been observed in a variety of zzso zzso Although originally implicated as the primary zzso gene in humans and other zzso zzso more recent evidence indicates a zzso outside that of zzso zzso In this study, DNA from five species of fish, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was subjected to Southern zzso analysis using a zzso zzso of mouse zzso sequence as a zzso zzso zzso patterns were not zzso between sexes in any one species but showed a different pattern for each zzso With one exception, zzso a zzso band from the zzso zzso was common to zzso zzso and open reading frame analysis of this zzso showed a strong zzso to other known zzso zzso zzso Of particular interest in this gene is a novel third finger domain similar to one human and one zzso zzso zzso Our studies and others provide evidence for a family of zzso zzso zzso with those having this novel third finger being representative of the ancestral zzso
