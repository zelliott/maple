The gene zzso protein zzso the most abundant and zzso protein induced by African zzso fever virus at early times of infection, has been mapped in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso virus strain zzso zzso analysis has shown the existence of an open reading frame, named zzso zzso 204 zzso zzso The protein is zzso in zzso zzso located in the 115 zzso zzso acids and was zzso when expressed in cells infected with a zzso virus zzso zzso zzso is not zzso in spite of the presence of two putative zzso sites in the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso experiments have shown that the protein is localized in the zzso of infected cells and not in the plasma zzso In addition, the protein has been found in the soluble fraction and not in zzso from zzso zzso zzso Low levels of the protein have been detected in the medium from infected zzso zzso which probably zzso to zzso release of zzso zzso The protein zzso by other virus zzso shows different zzso zzso indicating zzso of zzso
