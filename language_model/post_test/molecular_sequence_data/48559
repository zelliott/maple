The ends of linear zzso are extended by zzso a zzso complex minimally consisting of a protein zzso called zzso reverse zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions by reverse zzso a short template region of zzso into zzso zzso Proper assembly of zzso and zzso is essential for zzso zzso however, a detailed understanding of how zzso interacts with zzso is zzso Previous studies have identified an zzso binding domain zzso within zzso which includes three zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we used zzso zzso radical probing to directly identify sites of interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso revealing that the zzso motif is in close proximity to a zzso region of zzso known as the template boundary element zzso zzso shift zzso on zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso motif is an zzso binding zzso Our results explain previous work that established that zzso to the zzso motif of zzso and to the zzso of zzso both permit zzso of zzso into the growing DNA strand beyond the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest a model in which the zzso motif binds the zzso to strictly define which zzso zzso can be reverse zzso
