Although most zzso viral zzso (and related cellular zzso can evolve at rates a zzso greater than that of their host zzso some of the small DNA viruses zzso and zzso appear to evolve at much slower zzso These DNA viruses generally cause host zzso zzso primary infections followed by zzso benign persistent zzso Using global progressive sequence alignments for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have constructed zzso evolutionary trees for the viral zzso proteins zzso zzso and the large tumor zzso zzso We show that these three coding sequences can yield zzso trees similar to each other and to that of their host zzso Such zzso zzso appears zzso with some prevailing views of viral evolution, and we suggest that zzso persistent infections may link virus and most host zzso zzso analysis identified three specific regions of zzso regulatory gene products zzso zzso as highly zzso and two of these regions zzso to binding sites for host regulatory proteins zzso the zzso gene product zzso and the related protein zzso The zzso site zzso with a zzso zzso domain and the zzso site zzso to zzso region 1 of zzso protein of zzso type zzso We examined the local conservation of these binding sequences and show that the zzso zzso binding domain is characteristic and inclusive of the entire zzso family, but the zzso zzso binding domain is characteristic and inclusive of three entire families of small DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso The evolution of zzso families may thus be tightly linked to host evolution and zzso by interaction with a subset of host regulatory zzso
