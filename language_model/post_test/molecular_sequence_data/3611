zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome zzso viruses are recognized as possessing a high degree of genetic and zzso zzso zzso diversity has led to questions regarding the association of virus zzso and persistent infection in the host and has raised concerns zzso protective zzso the ability of diagnostic zzso to detect novel zzso and the possible emergence of virulent zzso The purpose of this study was to describe ongoing changes in zzso virus during replication in pigs under experimental zzso Animals were zzso with a zzso virus derived from zzso the North American zzso virus zzso Three independent lines of in zzso replication were maintained for zzso days by zzso passage of virus at zzso zzso A total of 315 zzso viruses were recovered from 21 pigs over the zzso observation period and compared to the original zzso virus by virus zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and sequencing of open reading frames zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso envelope zzso and 7 zzso of the zzso zzso were detected by day 7 zzso and multiple zzso were present zzso in every pig sampled over the observation zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso and 7 to be highly zzso In contrast, sequencing of zzso 5 disclosed 48 zzso zzso which corresponded to 22 zzso acid zzso Although no zzso changes were detected under the conditions of this experiment, zzso virus was shown to evolve continuously in infected zzso with different genes of the viral zzso undergoing various degrees of zzso
