zzso belonging to zzso family and their specific zzso zzso form an alternative missing self recognition system critical in immunity against tumors and zzso elimination of tumor cells subjected to zzso stress, zzso of T cell dependent immune response, and zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain of the mouse natural killer zzso cell zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso The core of the zzso zzso domain zzso is zzso to the other zzso receptors whereas one quarter of the domain forms an extended loop interacting tightly with a neighboring loop in the zzso This domain swapping mechanism results in a compact interaction zzso A second zzso interface resembles the known arrangement of other zzso zzso zzso A functional zzso form of the zzso is suggested, with the loop, zzso zzso within this family, proposed to participate in interactions with zzso
