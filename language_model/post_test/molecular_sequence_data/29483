zzso zzso is a temperate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso encodes the factors involved in type V zzso zzso and the zzso conversion and zzso zzso of the zzso have been isolated and zzso We now report on the complete sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 53 open reading frames were predicted from the zzso zzso and analysis of the corresponding proteins was used to construct a functional zzso The general organization of the genes in the zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso zzso and numerous features of the sequence are zzso The zzso immunity system of zzso includes a zzso repression system and a zzso zzso termination zzso zzso analysis also suggests that zzso encodes multiple DNA zzso and experiments confirmed that zzso encodes a Dam zzso Studies conducted to determine if the zzso zzso zzso host DNA zzso showed that the two zzso zzso strains analyzed zzso their own Dam zzso zzso mapping and sequence analysis revealed that the zzso zzso has zzso sites at the zzso The tail assembly and structural genes of zzso show zzso to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in total) between sections of the early, zzso and structural regions of the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso coli K-12 zzso were noted, suggesting that these three zzso have common evolutionary zzso
