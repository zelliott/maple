The zzso zzso zzso functions as a growth factor and central regulator in the immune zzso Using a zzso goose zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells as an zzso we zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso to identify the functional zzso of zzso and used these zzso to finely map the functional zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso of the 5 zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified using a zzso display library and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso constitute 1 zzso functional domain in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso inhibited the in zzso zzso proliferation zzso by domain I peptides of zzso A zzso structural model of zzso showed that domain I is positioned in zzso A, long zzso loop, and the zzso of zzso zzso These data provide a clue for defining the interaction between zzso and its zzso
