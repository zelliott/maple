zzso zzso from zzso different strains assigned to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were isolated as zzso material of high Mr and as zzso gels of low zzso Chemical and zzso analyses of the soluble zzso and zzso liberated from the zzso gels led to proposed structures with Lewis zzso zzso zzso terminating regular repeating units of different types, linked in turn to inner core regions of zzso zzso The zzso zzso has two populations of related molecules with chains of zzso zzso zzso similar to those in the zzso strain, one with and the other without a single terminal Lewis zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso Lewis zzso and zzso zzso terminate a partially zzso zzso but a zzso chain similar to that in the zzso zzso was shown to connect the outer chains to the inner zzso These zzso provide examples of the molecular mimicry of zzso zzso zzso variations of zzso between zzso and differences in some aspects of structure within zzso between high Mr and low Mr zzso indicate a class of zzso whose mechanisms of zzso lead to overall zzso different from those characteristic of most zzso from enteric zzso
