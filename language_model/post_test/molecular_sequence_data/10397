In this paper we describe the first complete structure of a fish zzso zzso A 22 zzso zzso region from rainbow trout zzso zzso was cloned and zzso This region was shown to contain two zzso arranged zzso zzso Both genes are zzso similar, indicating that they result from a recent local zzso The complete sequence zzso one of the two genes was determined and the gene organization was zzso The gene is zzso zzso long and has 34 zzso it lacks one zzso compared to zzso and avian zzso zzso zzso 22 and 23 of the zzso and chicken genes were shown to be merged into a single zzso in the trout zzso Other zzso sites appeared highly zzso between the three zzso zzso In contrast, little similarity between zzso and zzso zzso genes was observed with respect to the number and organization of zzso The comparison of 17 independent zzso zzso sites with the 34 zzso sites indicated that a few sites are probably zzso However, most of the zzso junctions compared appeared zzso zzso suggest that zzso genes have been reshaped through multiple insertions and deletions of intervening sequences during zzso
