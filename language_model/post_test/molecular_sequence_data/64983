The protein zzso zzso is a key regulator of exit from zzso in budding zzso Its zzso during zzso is characterized by zzso from its inhibitor zzso in the zzso and is controlled by two regulatory zzso The zzso early zzso release zzso network promotes zzso of the zzso during early zzso whereas the zzso exit network zzso activates zzso during late stages of zzso 

Here we investigate how the zzso network component zzso regulates zzso zzso We identify the replication fork block protein zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to premature release of zzso from the zzso in zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso delay the release of zzso from the zzso zzso associates with zzso and consistent with this zzso we find that the bulk of zzso zzso to the zzso binding region within the zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso is cell cycle regulated and affects its binding to zzso 

zzso functions as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso We propose that zzso helps to prevent the zzso of zzso from zzso prior to zzso and that zzso zzso during early zzso promotes the release of zzso from its inhibitor by zzso zzso zzso
