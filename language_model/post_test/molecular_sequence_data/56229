The zzso zzso protein binds to zzso DNA sequence motifs that are present in the zzso of the zzso zzso DNA binding of zzso to zzso and zzso forms of the binding motif was analyzed by gel zzso and zzso zzso A DNA binding domain at the zzso and a zzso domain at the zzso portion of zzso were localized using deletion derivatives of zzso These zzso are novel since no apparent zzso has been found in the data zzso The zzso of the zzso complexes was zzso A special complex is formed with a zzso zzso DNA binding zzso most probably involving two zzso zzso molecules that interact via their zzso zzso In zzso reactions the requirement for one or two zzso bonds for DNA binding of zzso was zzso The implications of these findings for the zzso mechanism of zzso are zzso
