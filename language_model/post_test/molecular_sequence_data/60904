By screening a zzso library and zzso amplification of zzso ends, the zzso for a zzso type protein zzso zzso from the sea zzso zzso zzso was zzso The deduced protein zzso with the highest identity of about zzso to zzso zzso family zzso shows the characteristic features of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso eggs, while zzso expression is first detected in zzso and continues through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso is detected specifically in zzso at the zzso stage, while it is restricted in zzso to the zzso and zzso suggesting specific roles for zzso in the formation and/or functions of the zzso zzso Meanwhile, western zzso analysis has shown that the zzso protein is constantly expressed throughout zzso By zzso it was found that the protein zzso evenly in the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso to the membrane after zzso All through the following development, zzso was localized to the zzso of different embryonic cells, although at a relatively low level of zzso at the boundaries between adjacent zzso
