We characterized three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins exhibited similar activity on zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso zzso thus indicating that they are zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso In contrast, zzso protein zzso neither zzso nor zzso It showed the highest activity with zzso as the zzso in the reverse reaction using zzso zzso as the zzso The reaction product was zzso The zzso also showed activity on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso When zzso derivatives were used as zzso reaction products were zzso zzso parameters of zzso activity on zzso were zzso zzso 45 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso thus indicating that these values are common among other zzso We propose zzso zzso as the name for zzso zzso
