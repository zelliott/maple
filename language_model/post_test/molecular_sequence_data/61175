zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that requires zzso zzso for zzso The influence of zzso on zzso zzso is complex, and its exact role in zzso oxide zzso synthesis is zzso Crystal structures of the mouse zzso zzso domain zzso revealed a unique zzso site with a high degree of aromatic character located in the zzso interface and near the zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso engage in hydrogen bonding or aromatic stacking interactions with the zzso zzso We zzso point zzso to investigate how each zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso contained zzso zzso to zzso indicating no deleterious effect on general protein zzso Ala zzso were zzso except for zzso and did not form a zzso with excess zzso and zzso However, they did form zzso when paired with a full-length zzso zzso and these were either fully or partially active regarding NO zzso indicating that preserving zzso identities or aromatic character is not essential for zzso binding or zzso zzso substitution at zzso or zzso generated zzso that could zzso with zzso and zzso These zzso bound zzso and zzso with near normal zzso but zzso could not zzso zzso zzso and they had NO synthesis activities lower than zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso substitution at zzso had no significant zzso Together, our work shows how hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking interactions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso influence zzso zzso structure, zzso environment, and NO synthesis and thus help zzso the multiple effects of zzso
