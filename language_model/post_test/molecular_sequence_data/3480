zzso inhibitor zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that are involved in the regulation of a number of zzso zzso zzso like most zzso functions by zzso binding to, and zzso of, target zzso The interaction between zzso and its target is directed by the so-called zzso center loop zzso an approximately 20 zzso domain that extends out from the body of the zzso zzso and determines the zzso zzso Mice express at least seven closely related zzso zzso zzso by a family of genes clustered at the zzso locus on zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso region is zzso among zzso a phenomenon that has been attributed to high rates of evolution driven by positive zzso zzso This suggests that the various zzso are functionally zzso To test this notion, we have compared the zzso zzso of individual zzso from each of the two mouse zzso As predicted from the positive zzso selection hypothesis, the various zzso differ in their ability to form zzso complexes with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, they differ in their binding ability to zzso in crude snake zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso is the primary zzso of zzso differences in zzso recognition, indicating that zzso within this region drives the functional diversification of zzso during zzso The possible zzso benefits of zzso diversity are zzso
