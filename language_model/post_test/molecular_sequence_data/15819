The zzso sequence from the zzso binding protein zzso of the butterfly zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso with a length of 173 zzso zzso has a molecular mass of zzso zzso The sequence analysis was performed by automated zzso degradation of the intact zzso and of fragments as large as possible generated from different zzso The zzso structure of zzso determined by zzso et zzso zzso zzso Schneider, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Schneider, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Falk, zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso down to zzso resolution, exhibits a similar zzso to the human zzso binding zzso Sawyer zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that proteins from a wide variety of sources can be gathered into a zzso Computer searches of data banks yielded in a new member of this zzso namely human alpha zzso zzso One of the functions of the listed proteins is to bind and transport small zzso molecules in zzso
