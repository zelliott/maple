We identified a gene of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso designated zzso whose high-level expression stimulates zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In a central region the deduced zzso protein is highly zzso to the zzso and zzso proteins that regulate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The core of the zzso region is zzso to the basic zzso zzso motif of zzso zzso factors, specifically to the human zzso and Max zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain include the substitution of an zzso zzso responsible for target zzso zzso by a zzso zzso During zzso induction zzso transcript levels decline to low zzso zzso is zzso at the level of zzso initiation as shown by a zzso zzso zzso A strain carrying one disrupted zzso zzso and one zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso promoter forms zzso zzso cells, but is unable to form true zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso leads to enhanced zzso growth in the form of extended zzso in liquid and on solid zzso The results suggest that zzso has a dual role as a zzso zzso and zzso whose balanced activity is essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analogies between zzso and zzso are zzso
