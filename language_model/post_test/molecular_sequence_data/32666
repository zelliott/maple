zzso zzso zzso zzso have crucial roles in regulating the signaling activity of zzso zzso and are potential targets for drug discovery against human zzso These zzso contain a zzso domain zzso as well as a binding domain zzso that help recognize the target zzso zzso We report here the crystal structures at up to zzso A resolution of the BD and CD of human zzso and compare them to the known structures from other zzso zzso structural differences are observed between the BD of zzso and that of zzso determined previously by zzso In particular, the cluster of positively charged zzso that is important for zzso zzso binding is located in completely different positions in the two structures, with a distance of 25 A between zzso Moreover, this cluster is zzso in zzso while it forms a loop followed by a zzso in zzso These large structural differences could be associated with the distinct zzso preferences of these zzso but further studies are needed to confirm zzso The CD of zzso is observed in an active zzso and two zzso in the active site have backbone shifts of up to 5 A relative to the inactive CDs from other zzso
