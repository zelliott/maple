In zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso of superficial zzso cancer, a T cell zzso zzso reaction is associated with the zzso zzso To gain insight into the approximate number of zzso bacteria retained in the normal, zzso urinary zzso after zzso application responsible for induction of the immune reaction, the utility of a sensitive zzso chain reaction zzso based zzso was investigated in a guinea pig zzso 

After one single or six subsequent weekly zzso with zzso zzso of zzso the zzso were zzso and processed for zzso determination with zzso The zzso were zzso 24 h after zzso aiming at zzso the number of zzso organisms able to resist the natural zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso was based on amplification of a zzso base pair zzso of the zzso element zzso and is specific for bacteria belonging to the zzso tuberculosis complex which includes zzso zzso zzso 

After one single zzso no zzso zzso retention was zzso However, after six weekly zzso zzso bacteria could be demonstrated in 2 out of 5 guinea pig zzso indicating that the number of adhering zzso organisms was around the detection limit of the zzso zzso zzso bacteria per zzso 

The data suggest that after six zzso the retention of zzso in the guinea pig zzso is enhanced as compared with one single zzso This finding is suggestive of a role of the inflammatory process that is, besides immune system zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The nature of the molecules involved in enhanced zzso retention after repeated zzso remains to be zzso
