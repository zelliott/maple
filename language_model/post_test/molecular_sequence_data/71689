Roots and leaves of zzso zzso were studied for their activity in the central nervous system zzso by zzso isolation in conjunction with zzso binding zzso As demonstrated in preliminary zzso ethanol extracts of leaves and roots of zzso zzso showed strong binding affinity to a number of zzso zzso Chemical investigation of this plant species was then conducted and zzso plant ingredients were zzso In this study, nine of these isolated compounds were tested by zzso zzso binding zzso for their zzso zzso zzso showed that three compounds, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to selectively bind to zzso zzso a zzso bound to zzso channel and zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso A bound to zzso receptors with zzso values at zzso zzso In the zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso A and the zzso were found to affect binding affinity of certain specific binding agents to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso These observations suggest interactions between the plant ingredients and receptors as well as synergistic effect of various compounds at zzso zzso
