zzso attach sister zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso and orchestrate zzso zzso at zzso Although zzso zzso has the simplest known zzso they nonetheless contain approximately 70 zzso that assemble on zzso DNA in a zzso zzso zzso an accurate picture of the zzso zzso and zzso layers of zzso including the functions of individual proteins in these zzso is a key challenge in the field of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, comparison of zzso proteins in zzso and humans promises to extend insight obtained from the study of simple zzso zzso to complex animal cell zzso 

We show that zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso the likely zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso Through systematic analysis of zzso among zzso complexes, focused on zzso we develop a comprehensive picture of the assembly hierarchy of budding zzso zzso We find zzso to comprise the third zzso complex that, along with the zzso and zzso zzso complexes, is responsible for bridging between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Like the zzso complex, zzso is also essential for zzso binding by components of the zzso assembly zzso Moreover, these functions are zzso in human zzso 

zzso is the last of the core zzso complexes to be analyzed in zzso and we show it to be required for zzso binding by a discrete subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all of which are zzso zzso zzso of these proteins from zzso prevents bipolar attachment, even though the zzso and DASH complexes, the two zzso zzso are still zzso The failure of zzso deficient zzso to bind correctly to zzso zzso and to recruit checkpoint proteins in zzso and human cells explains the observed severity of zzso zzso
