zzso of the zzso coded zzso zzso within the zzso in zzso produces the precursor of zzso zzso which is processed and assembled into zzso c zzso The zzso sequence of the first 14 zzso zzso specifying the zzso leader zzso was previously shown to contain a positively acting element required for translation of a zzso reporter zzso zzso fused to the 91st zzso of zzso Here we show that three relatively short sequences within the zzso zzso coding zzso or structures they form in zzso inhibit translation of the reporter in the absence of the positive zzso One negative element was localized within zzso 15 to 25 and shown to function at the level of the zzso zzso whereas two others are within predicted zzso structures formed by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso All three of these zzso elements are antagonized in a zzso manner by zzso of the upstream zzso zzso These interactions appear to be independent of zzso and zzso leader zzso as they are also observed when the same reporter zzso are expressed from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which encodes a zzso zzso carrier, partially suppresses zzso zzso by each isolated zzso acting element, but does not suppress them in zzso We zzso that interplay among these signals during translation in zzso may ensure proper timing of zzso synthesis and assembly into zzso c zzso
