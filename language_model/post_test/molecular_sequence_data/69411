The determination of the structure of the zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso III zzso showed that this protein acts to clamp the zzso onto DNA by forming a closed circular structure that can zzso duplex DNA zzso Kong, zzso zzso zzso O'Donnell & zzso zzso zzso zzso 69, zzso In this review we describe the features of the beta zzso that allow it to be linked tightly but zzso to DNA, and discuss the surprisingly symmetrical architecture of the zzso The simple repeating pattern of the chain fold allows a connection to be made to the as yet unknown structures of zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso and the gene 45 protein of zzso zzso which are the zzso factors of the corresponding DNA zzso
