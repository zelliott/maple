zzso proteins constitute a novel protein family that may function in zzso and contain a double C2 zzso We have cloned and characterized two zzso zzso in rat brain and studied their interactions with other proteins implicated in zzso zzso was virtually brain specific, zzso zzso Within brain, the zzso were expressed zzso and complementary within zzso not zzso and zzso with synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso revealed that zzso binds zzso a protein also implicated in zzso The first zzso C2 domain and most of zzso are involved in direct zzso zzso may regulate formation of zzso zzso during zzso zzso by interacting with zzso We show that zzso and zzso compete for zzso Other core complex components shifted the equilibrium between zzso versus zzso These data suggest that zzso proteins are zzso adapter proteins regulating zzso complexes and zzso synaptic zzso zzso
