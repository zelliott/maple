Four zzso zzso bearing zzso or zzso zzso on the alpha or beta positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso available as pure R and S zzso have been studied as alternate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso were determined by a competitive zzso zzso using zzso zzso the zzso rate constant zzso was determined by the zzso displacement zzso All zzso undergo rapid zzso zzso varies from 17 to 170 zzso that shows little zzso there is, however, pronounced zzso in zzso binding for three of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In each case it is the zzso with the S zzso that has the higher zzso In all cases, zzso rates are slow, and in two cases, zzso zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso h at pH zzso 25 degrees C, are obtained (for beta zzso and alpha zzso zzso In these cases, high zzso zzso is observed zzso zzso zzso and the zzso more zzso bound as a zzso (R zzso gives the more stable zzso zzso Two zzso involving hindrance of the attack of water or an exchange of the zzso and zzso zzso groups in the zzso zzso are advanced as possible explanations for the high stability of these zzso zzso
