zzso zzso surveillance is essential to ensure the zzso of control strategies, such as zzso suppression, zzso or dissemination of public zzso Traditional strategies employed for zzso zzso such as detection of virus or zzso zzso in zzso animals, or detection of virus in zzso zzso have limitations as an zzso zzso A system was recently developed that involves collecting mosquitoes in zzso zzso where the insects zzso virus on zzso zzso acid preservation zzso The cards are then submitted for virus detection using molecular zzso We report the application of this system for detecting zzso and zzso in wild zzso populations in northern zzso This study was the first to employ zzso passive box traps zzso that were designed to house cards zzso with honey as the sugar zzso Overall, zzso zzso of zzso from different weeks contained at least one zzso zzso West Nile virus zzso zzso zzso Ross River virus zzso and zzso Forest virus zzso were zzso being identified in zzso zzso and zzso of positive zzso zzso zzso zzso chickens deployed to detect zzso activity did not zzso at two Northern zzso sites where four zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso onto some of the zzso cards to provide a template for gene sequencing, enhancing the utility of the zzso surveillance system for investigating the zzso zzso and movement of zzso
