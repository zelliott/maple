zzso sequencing of the zzso of zzso zzso has revealed thousands of new predicted genes and allowed analysis of long-range features of zzso zzso Generally, genes and predicted genes seem to be distributed evenly throughout the zzso having no overall preference for DNA zzso Apart from the smaller zzso which can have substantially lower gene density in their zzso regions, there is a consistent average of one open reading frame zzso approximately every two zzso However, one of the most surprising findings for a zzso with approximately 6,000 genes was the amount of apparent zzso in its zzso This zzso occurs both between individual zzso and over more extensive zzso regions, which have been duplicated preserving gene order and zzso Here we report the entire zzso sequence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that its features and organization are consistent with those observed for other zzso zzso zzso Analysis revealed zzso zzso zzso have not been identified zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso of regions of this zzso have zzso
