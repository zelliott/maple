The nitrogen regulatory circuit of zzso zzso contains structural genes that zzso nitrogen zzso zzso which are subject to complex genetic and zzso zzso This set of genes is controlled by nitrogen zzso by specific zzso and by the action of zzso a major zzso regulatory zzso and zzso a zzso control zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso the gene that encodes zzso a zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso gene contains a single zzso is transcribed from two initiation sites situated approximately 50 zzso upstream of the translation start site, and encodes a protein comprised of 354 zzso zzso zzso shift and DNA footprint experiments identified a single binding site for the zzso regulatory protein in the zzso promoter zzso The binding site contains a 10 zzso base pair symmetrical sequence which is flanked by two possible core binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins with zzso acid zzso in a putative zzso motif were shown to be completely deficient in the ability to bind to the zzso promoter DNA zzso
