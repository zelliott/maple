A single zzso zzso that results in an zzso acid change zzso has been identified in the zzso zzso gene and was initially found to be zzso in the zzso state in subjects with zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso More extensive studies provide limited support for the association with zzso but confirm an association of the Q zzso with progressive zzso zzso and zzso grain zzso A zzso sequence was found in the appropriate location of the rat and mouse zzso zzso but there was no open reading frame allowing zzso expression in these species, suggesting relatively recent evolution of this zzso In some zzso zzso the zzso gene was identified, and this was found to differ from the human gene at two of 128 zzso zzso All primates in which the zzso gene was identified were zzso for the R zzso of zzso suggesting this is the ancestral zzso This observation was surprising, in that the Q zzso is more common in human zzso and raises the possibility that natural selection has operated to favor individuals carrying this zzso The zzso zzso is part of the zzso gene zzso of which two major zzso exist in human zzso the Q being part of the zzso zzso and the R part of the zzso zzso More detailed studies confirm the zzso zzso to be the ancestral zzso zzso This situation is reminiscent of the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso another locus that is potentially important for the risk of development of zzso
