zzso of the animal zzso zzso zzso zzso differ greatly in size since they have either one or two zzso zzso that match profile zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that we have called zzso encodes a zzso zzso The alignment of these zzso with those of zzso zzso revealed a variable number of insertions with the consensus zzso This motif has also been detected in the structure of zzso zzso zzso where it was found to be involved in zzso coordination although a sequence analysis did not reveal the presence of any known calcium binding motifs in this zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that a zzso containing this consensus motif bound specifically calcium zzso with affinities ranging between zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso revealed zzso binding with a zzso of 12 zzso and zzso of zzso calcium zzso per protein zzso This domain exhibited zzso activity after its zzso with zzso These data led to the definition of a novel calcium binding motif that we have termed zzso and which was abundantly present in animal zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso thus possess two different types of calcium binding zzso namely zzso and the related zzso type calcium binding zzso with the latter being located outside the zzso zzso and in their zzso zzso A zzso tree of zzso zzso zzso of bacterial proteins with zzso zzso including single domain zzso was divided into two major zzso representing zzso with and without zzso motif containing zzso We have verified that the recently reported zzso of bacterial zzso zzso in two families zzso and zzso is unrelated to these zzso zzso matching zzso were detected in all zzso of zzso
