The ubiquitous zzso protein zzso contains a zzso domain required for DNA zzso which can be subdivided into a zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso domain and the zzso zzso domain in a zzso expression system, zzso both zzso to near zzso and compared their zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso domain, the zzso domain protects only part of the zzso sequence in the zzso origin against breakdown by zzso I or zzso zzso Analysis of zzso contacts by zzso and zzso interference zzso shows that the zzso zzso can be divided into two zzso one that is recognized both by the zzso domain and the zzso domain in an identical fashion, and one that is only recognized by the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso domain is responsible for the additional contacts located at one side of the zzso In agreement with this, mutating the first 3 zzso zzso of the zzso affected binding by the zzso domain but not by the zzso zzso The apparent binding affinities to different zzso sites were zzso The zzso domain binds zzso less efficiently to the zzso zzso sequence zzso than the zzso zzso The difference is only zzso for the zzso zzso whereas both zzso values are almost identical for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso recognize target sequences for zzso zzso box zzso We conclude that the zzso can act as a zzso recognition sequence for zzso and that the zzso domain contributes to the binding zzso as well as to the zzso by providing additional zzso
