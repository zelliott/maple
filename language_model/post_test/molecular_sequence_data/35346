Between September 2000 and November 2005, approximately zzso of the zzso examined human zzso zzso pediatric cases of acute respiratory disease zzso requiring hospitalization at the Hospital Nacional de zzso Juan zzso zzso in zzso zzso Argentina, were found to have a zzso zzso 

To characterize genetically and zzso the zzso virus zzso 

zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso and fiber gene sequencing and virus zzso zzso zzso were carried out on 8 zzso respiratory virus zzso 

zzso showed that the 8 examined zzso virus zzso were zzso belonging to two zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso which we designated zzso zzso analysis of the zzso genes showed that both zzso zzso had a zzso zzso zzso zzso previous reports, the 7 zzso virus zzso were found to have zzso fiber genes and therefore are zzso zzso The fiber gene of the zzso virus zzso most closely resembled that of various strains of zzso In zzso zzso the 4 tested zzso strains were zzso as zzso The zzso strain was zzso as zzso but also showed a weak but significant zzso with zzso to zzso Compared with the other zzso cases in our study, infection with zzso caused a similarly severe zzso 

Our results provide evidence to the long term zzso circulation of zzso zzso as a zzso agent of zzso zzso our molecular and zzso data support the rationale to base the molecular typing and designation of zzso viruses on the sequences of the zzso and fiber zzso
