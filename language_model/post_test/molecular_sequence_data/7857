After injection with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso two distinct B cell populations can be identified in the zzso during the primary zzso One of these populations is specialized for zzso zzso the other, the zzso centers zzso has been identified as the site of zzso zzso zzso zzso selection of zzso B cells bearing zzso receptors with higher affinity leads to the affinity maturation of serum zzso and increased protective zzso zzso zzso of zzso B cell populations specific for zzso and sequencing of the recovered zzso heavy chain variable region genes revealed that the zzso zzso process is absent in the zzso of aged zzso zzso However, selection for zzso appears to occur in the absence of zzso in the form of competition between zzso clones of zzso B zzso Thus, affinity maturation in these animals is limited to the affinities of zzso zzso by the zzso
