The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso segment 11 zzso a zzso protein of an zzso strain zzso have been zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the zzso segment 11 of zzso virus is zzso zzso long and contains a major open reading frame that codes for a zzso of 236 zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The second reading frame of zzso segment 11 was zzso zzso long and codes for a zzso of 145 with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso segment 11 contains 24 zzso zzso at the zzso and 48 zzso zzso at the zzso This gene codes for two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of this gene with the published sequences of other members of the family zzso indicated no sequence zzso
