The zzso zzso virus zzso zzso is flanked by terminal zzso origins of DNA replication zzso repeats zzso that are zzso at the terminal resolution site zzso by the zzso zzso protein in an zzso zzso zzso Here we determine the minimal zzso sequence necessary for zzso zzso zzso and show that this zzso core sequence is required only on the zzso zzso We also identify a potential zzso structure at the zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso on a zzso zzso that fixes this zzso zzso in the zzso form no longer requires zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso activity is necessary to unwind the duplex zzso and zzso the zzso structure, prior to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of origin zzso structures prior to zzso appears to be a general mechanism shared by plant and animal viruses and bacterial zzso In the case of zzso this mechanism of zzso zzso would provide a possible regulatory zzso
