A three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso from the zzso agent of malaria zzso zzso is suggested on the basis of zzso modeling followed by zzso by the method of molecular zzso The presence of a His zzso in the zzso site instead of an zzso zzso which is characteristic of zzso zzso and replacement of some other zzso zzso in the active site make it possible for the zzso to function by the zzso mechanism inherent in zzso zzso The detailed structures of zzso complexes with zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso as well as with a zzso zzso are zzso
