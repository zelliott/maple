The specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso is determined by zzso interactions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso showing that replacement of zzso with zzso increased the preference of zzso for zzso in comparison to zzso whereas replacing zzso with zzso had the opposite zzso In contrast, the replacement of zzso with zzso did not change zzso zzso The energy of the interactions formed by these different zzso with the zzso and equatorial zzso zzso were also measured, showing that the increase in preference for zzso resulted from a larger energy decrease in the interaction with equatorial zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the increase in preference for zzso was caused by an energy reduction in the interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The introduction of zzso at position zzso or of zzso at position 39 increased the preference of zzso for zzso in comparison to zzso whereas the presence of zzso or zzso at position zzso had less effect on this zzso The zzso of zzso was favored because zzso at position zzso increased a zzso hindrance with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at position 39 disrupted a favorable interaction with this same zzso In conclusion, it is proposed that the specificity of new zzso zzso can be predicted by combining and adding energy of the zzso interactions evaluated in the present zzso
