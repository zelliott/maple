zzso imperfecta type I results from decreased production of structurally normal type I collagen as a result of a zzso zzso zzso Steady state amounts of zzso zzso are reduced in both the nucleus and zzso of zzso zzso from most affected zzso zzso involving key regulatory sequences in the zzso promoter, such as the zzso and zzso boxes, could alter steady state levels of zzso and therefore lead to this zzso To determine the frequency of such zzso in zzso type I cell zzso we used zzso amplified zzso DNA in conjunction with zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso to screen the zzso untranslated domain, zzso 1, and a small portion of zzso 1 of the zzso zzso In addition, direct sequence analysis was performed on an amplified zzso DNA zzso that included the zzso and zzso zzso Forty unrelated zzso with zzso type I, in whom no zzso zzso was known, were included in the zzso No zzso were included in the zzso No zzso were identified in either the zzso or zzso boxes in any of the affected zzso In addition, there was little evidence of sequence diversity among any of the 40 zzso These data suggest that zzso in the zzso promoter do not play a significant role in the zzso of zzso type zzso
