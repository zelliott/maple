The eggs of most zzso animals are zzso with a class of protein called zzso zzso which is stored as the major component of zzso Until recently, deduced zzso acid sequences were available only from zzso and zzso zzso which proved to be zzso The sequences of several insect zzso are now known, but early attempts at zzso alignments with zzso and zzso zzso have been problematic, leading to conflicting conclusions about how closely insect zzso are related to the zzso In this paper we demonstrate that insect zzso sequences can be confidently aligned with one another along their entire lengths and with multiple zzso and zzso zzso sequences along most of their zzso Although divergence is high, conservation among zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences is widespread with a preponderance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso among strictly zzso zzso zzso establishing zzso that zzso from the three zzso are zzso Areas of zzso alignment are primarily in and around insect and zzso zzso zzso which are not zzso zzso reconstructions of zzso based on sequence identities indicate that the insect lineage is the most zzso and that the zzso serum zzso zzso zzso arose from a zzso zzso after the zzso zzso
