zzso interference is rapidly becoming a powerful tool for genetic analyses in zzso zzso A potential drawback to transient small zzso zzso zzso is the short duration of zzso it zzso usually only zzso zzso zzso systems for the long-term delivery of zzso zzso have been developed, yet they require expertise in viral production and zzso Here we describe a simple zzso system for the generation of long-term gene zzso utilizing zzso interference combined with the gene delivery capabilities of the zzso zzso zzso Sleeping zzso Designated zzso this system is shown to zzso zzso expression of zzso in a zzso positive cell zzso In addition, targeting of the zzso expressed zzso A gene results in long-term zzso with significant reduction in protein levels zzso zzso zzso therefore provides a relatively easy, efficient, and stable means of delivering zzso zzso to generate long-term zzso zzso cell zzso
