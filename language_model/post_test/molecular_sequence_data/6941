The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that positively regulates zzso expression of the zzso zzso Based on the sequence information of the human zzso and the zzso junctions of the mouse counterpart, an analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out to detect subtle base differences in the coding region of the gene among zzso We found that the zzso protein has at least two forms of zzso in a Japanese gene pool, and that these zzso can be ascribed to one zzso acid replacement of zzso by zzso at zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso We found, however, that this germ line zzso of the zzso gene did not show a significant association with zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso nor with lung cancer zzso
