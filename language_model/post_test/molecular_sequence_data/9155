zzso by imaging of the structure of zzso DNA zzso both bare and zzso to metal zzso is zzso We demonstrate here two transmission electron zzso zzso based methods to distinguish between fully formed zzso zzso from DNA zzso with gold zzso zzso at their zzso and structures which are only partially zzso When deposited on a surface, fully formed zzso are expected to retain their zzso zzso structure, while partially formed structures are expected to form a zzso zzso The first method by which zzso and zzso structures were distinguished was imaging them at different zzso zzso While for zzso structures all the four zzso acquire zzso fringes at the same zzso value, for zzso structures at least one particle is at a different plane with respect to the others, and so it acquires zzso fringes at a different zzso zzso The second method we show is imaging of the structures at different zzso While a single zzso image gives only a zzso projection of the structure, by combining information achieved from imaging at several tilting angles one may verify the structural zzso
