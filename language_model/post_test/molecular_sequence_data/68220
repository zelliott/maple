zzso the 129 zzso acid zzso protein from zzso coli, is a good model for studies of folding of parallel zzso zzso We report here the zzso characterization of the zzso zzso at different pH values and in different buffers and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso monitored by circular zzso and zzso fits the two-state unfolding zzso The stability of the protein is zzso strength dependent, probably due to the presence of three zzso zzso in very close proximity in its active zzso The presence of a zzso zzso which seems to interact with zzso 13 in the active site, zzso the native structure by up to zzso zzso zzso The zzso maximum stability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso is reached at pH zzso Analysis of scanning zzso data has shown that zzso unfolding of zzso is not a two-state process and proceeds through a highly populated intermediate state, corresponding to protein zzso as was subsequently confirmed by direct zzso zzso According to circular zzso fluorescence, nuclear magnetic zzso and zzso binding experiments, this zzso zzso at pH zzso exhibits all known characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso might explain such peculiarities as the increased stability or the cooperative unfolding found for the molten zzso state of some zzso
