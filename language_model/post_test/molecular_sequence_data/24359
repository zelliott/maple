The members of the zzso zzso catalyze different overall zzso yet share a partial reaction that involves zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The fate of the resulting zzso intermediate is determined by the active site of each zzso Several members of this zzso have been structurally characterized to permit an understanding of the evolutionary strategy for using a common structural motif to catalyze different overall zzso In the preceding paper, two new members of the zzso were identified that catalyze the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso These zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and their sequences are only zzso zzso The structure of zzso the zzso from zzso coli, was determined by MAD phasing using both the zzso protein and a heavy atom zzso The structure of zzso the zzso from zzso zzso was determined by molecular replacement using the zzso zzso zzso as a search zzso In this paper, we report the three-dimensional structures of these zzso and compare them to the structure of zzso zzso another member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
