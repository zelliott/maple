In bacterial zzso acid zzso zzso which binds the zzso zzso zzso in Schiff base linkage, was changed to zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had zzso the activity of the zzso zzso and was capable of forming a Schiff base with zzso this external zzso was formed over a period of minutes depending upon the zzso zzso The transformation of the zzso form of the zzso to the zzso form zzso the zzso of zzso occurred over a period of hours with this zzso zzso Thus, information on these two steps in the reaction and on the factors that influence them can readily be obtained with this zzso zzso In contrast, these reactions with the zzso zzso occur at much faster rates and are not easily studied zzso The zzso zzso shows distinct preference for zzso over zzso as zzso but it does so about zzso less effectively than the zzso zzso Thus, zzso probably acts in concert with the zzso and other functional side zzso to lead to efficient and zzso precise zzso in the zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased the rate of external zzso formation with zzso and the zzso zzso but the subsequent transformation to the zzso form of the zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed a large negative trough in the circular zzso spectrum at zzso zzso which was practically absent in the zzso zzso However, addition of zzso to the zzso zzso generated this negative Cotton effect zzso to formation of the external zzso with zzso This circular zzso band gradually collapsed in parallel with the transformation to the zzso zzso Further studies on this zzso zzso which displays the characteristics of the zzso zzso but at attenuated rates, may yield information on the factors controlling the zzso of the reaction as well as on the zzso steps of the zzso zzso
