The envelope of the zzso B virus zzso consists of three related zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso all of which share a common zzso acid zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso that is sufficient for zzso protective immunity against zzso zzso zzso resulting from point zzso leading to replacements of zzso acids within the zzso segment of zzso have been recently zzso In order to assure the continued success of vaccination against zzso and the zzso of diagnostic tests for zzso envelope zzso and zzso it is necessary to understand the impact of zzso acid replacements on the zzso recognition of zzso at both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso tolerated and forbidden zzso acid replacements within the zzso segment of zzso have already been zzso The impact of zzso acid zzso within the zzso segment on the zzso recognition of zzso is analyzed in this zzso Such replacements do not appreciably affect the binding of rabbit and goat zzso zzso to replacement set zzso while decreased zzso zzso binding was observed with some peptides having zzso at zzso zzso 123 and zzso On the other hand, zzso acid zzso within the zzso region, except those distinguishing zzso zzso of zzso from each other, zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to the zzso while zzso at zzso zzso 123 and 125 had a lesser zzso Some of the peptides with zzso acid zzso peculiar to the zzso had diminished zzso activity for zzso from individuals vaccinated against zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in both the zzso and zzso segments of zzso may potentially result in zzso viruses escaping zzso surveillance based on current zzso B zzso
