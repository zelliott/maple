zzso sites appear visually as zzso gaps on zzso that are zzso by specific cell culture zzso Expansion of zzso repeats has been shown to be the molecular basis of all five zzso fragile sites characterized zzso so far, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study we have refined the zzso of the zzso zzso fragile site by zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso clone spanning zzso identified a single, imperfect, but zzso zzso repeat that is part of a zzso island in the zzso of a novel gene named zzso The number of zzso repeats varied in the population from 8 to zzso zzso exceeding 200 repeat units were zzso in all zzso fragile site carriers zzso The zzso gene consists of 19 zzso and is transcribed in the zzso direction from the zzso zzso The major transcript of approximately 1450 zzso is zzso expressed and codes for a highly zzso zzso zzso of unknown zzso Several zzso zzso leading to alternative 3' ends were identified zzso in zzso These give rise to zzso proteins with altered zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein showed that it was present exclusively in the zzso We show that the expression of zzso in parallel to the other cloned zzso fragile sites, is caused by an expansion and subsequent zzso of an unstable zzso zzso zzso Taking advantage of three zzso within the zzso gene we demonstrate that one zzso of the gene is not transcribed in a zzso zzso Our data also suggest that in the zzso state zzso is likely a benign zzso fragile zzso
