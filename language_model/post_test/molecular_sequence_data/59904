zzso zzso zzso from the genetically zzso zzso zzso coli strain zzso as well as whole bacteria, were bound to zzso plates that carried zzso bound zzso and zzso The binding was inhibited by soluble zzso derivatives corresponding to the zzso including all zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments of the zzso zzso and all zzso zzso of zzso Analysis of the zzso pattern showed no significant difference between zzso zzso and whole zzso The zzso unit at the reducing end of the natural zzso was zzso to zzso binding since deletion of the zzso unit increased the zzso power zzso zzso The five zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso unit were shown to be important for zzso zzso presumably via zzso hydrogen zzso
