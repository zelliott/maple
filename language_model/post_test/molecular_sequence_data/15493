Two bacterial zzso zzso and zzso isolated from a zzso dump site in India, were characterized by using a zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, both strains belonged to the zzso zzso highest sequence similarities of strain zzso were observed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso % in each zzso and the highest sequence similarity of strain zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the distinct lineages of strains zzso and zzso among members of the zzso zzso The presence of zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso fatty acids supported their respective positions within the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso results, it is concluded that strains zzso and zzso represent two distinct species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, are zzso The type strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
