Muscle zzso following injury is characterized by zzso accompanied by local zzso zzso of satellite cells, and repair of injured zzso The resolution of the inflammatory response is necessary to proceed toward muscle repair, since persistence of inflammation often renders the damaged muscle incapable of sustaining efficient muscle zzso Here, we show that local expression of a zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso process of injured skeletal muscle, modulating the inflammatory response, and limiting zzso At the molecular level, zzso expression significantly zzso zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso and modulated the expression of zzso zzso involved in the recruitment of zzso Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that zzso expression modulated key players of inflammatory response, such as zzso migration zzso factor zzso high mobility group zzso zzso and zzso zzso The rapid restoration of injured zzso transgenic muscle was also associated with zzso tissue zzso and a rapid recovery of functional zzso By modulating the inflammatory response and reducing fibrosis, supplemental zzso creates a zzso different environment for sustaining more efficient muscle zzso and zzso
