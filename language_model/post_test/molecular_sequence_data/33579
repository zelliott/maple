zzso zzso and zzso resonance assignments are presented for a zzso 114 zzso acid human zzso zzso zzso zzso variable domain zzso zzso which displays a high degree of sequence identity with another human zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso is highly zzso in zzso and in zzso and has been linked to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and can be converted to the zzso state only in zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso relaxation rates confirm that, as expected, zzso is a zzso at zzso pH and typical zzso used for zzso studies, and the analysis of secondary chemical shifts indicates that the protein has a high zzso zzso These findings are consistent with previously published zzso data and the high-resolution X-ray structure of zzso
