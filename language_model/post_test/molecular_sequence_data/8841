To investigate the mechanisms by which zzso factors invade zzso DNA and replace zzso at control zzso we have examined the response of the zzso zzso to zzso factor binding in the presence of zzso proteins zzso zzso assembly zzso We found that zzso zzso assembly protein 1 zzso zzso zzso factor binding and zzso displacement in a manner similar to that of zzso In addition, disruption of the zzso zzso was required both for the stimulation of zzso factor binding to zzso DNA and for zzso zzso zzso displacement zzso by zzso or zzso While zzso and zzso zzso the binding of a fusion protein zzso to control zzso cores, this stimulation was lost upon zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso were able to mediate zzso displacement upon the binding of five zzso zzso to control zzso zzso however, this activity was also zzso when the zzso zzso were zzso These data indicate that zzso disruption is required for both stimulation of factor binding and zzso zzso displacement by zzso and zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso transfer onto zzso competitor DNA did not require disruption of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso displacement in this instance occurred by transfer of complete zzso zzso a mechanism distinct from that zzso by the zzso proteins zzso and zzso
