A highly zzso chemically defined representative of a new class of zzso zzso from the Atlantic white shrimp zzso zzso zzso class 4 zzso zzso class 4 zzso zzso was produced zzso Chemical synthesis was achieved by native zzso from two separate zzso yielding a zzso zzso that reflected the characteristics of native zzso zzso zzso proved to be an effective zzso zzso particularly against the zzso pathogen zzso zzso exhibiting a complex effect on zzso growth at zzso zzso resulting in the suppression of spore zzso zzso exhibits unique features zzso previously observed for zzso from the Pacific white shrimp zzso zzso including zzso specificity against zzso bacteria, indicating a potential zzso of zzso function among this family of zzso The zzso domain of zzso class 4 alone was an active zzso zzso having the same target range as the full-length zzso These findings indicate that the zzso domain of zzso is sufficient to zzso target specificity and that divergence in this domain between classes can result in a gain in zzso function as observed for the zzso domain of zzso
