The design of zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso of complex natural membrane proteins has been a formidable zzso A series of zzso was designed to zzso insert in TM zzso in zzso zzso Their secondary structures and orientation in the zzso zzso was characterized using zzso zzso zzso methods were then devised to design a zzso that targeted a TM zzso of the zzso zzso The designed zzso zzso interacts with the isolated target TM domain of the protein and activates the intact zzso in zzso
