zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the synthesis of zzso is activated by zzso binding to zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is also involved in interaction with zzso zzso We investigated the binding of the zzso domain to its different partners, both in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso states by surface zzso zzso zzso showed high affinity for zzso proteins zzso approximately zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and 7 zzso for zzso The zzso also bind to zzso charged zzso with intermediate affinity zzso at zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depending on zzso zzso and zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso showed a preferential binding to zzso compared with zzso both in zzso zzso and with zzso at neutral zzso The affinity of zzso for zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is much higher than the affinity of zzso for the same zzso compatible with the formation of a zzso complex between zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results shed light on interaction mechanisms that might be relevant for the zzso of the distribution of zzso in the zzso and membrane zzso and regulation of zzso and zzso zzso
