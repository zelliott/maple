The zzso of 12 zzso species and reference strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied based on partial zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso tree based on the zzso gene was similar to that of the tree based on the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso was found to provide a better resolution for zzso species, with lower zzso sequence similarities zzso 65 to zzso compared with those for the zzso zzso gene zzso 90 to zzso and high zzso sequence similarities zzso 95 to zzso average, zzso A new universal reverse primer that zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso gene was developed and used for zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis of 68 strains representing 11 zzso species as well as reference strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso all zzso species included in the study but showed more zzso diversity than zzso with the zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a high level of zzso sequence similarity to both zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso gave a unique zzso profile and an zzso profile identical to those of other zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso gene sequencing and zzso analysis are recommended as valuable tools for the identification of zzso zzso
