zzso diversity of the zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso in the eastern part of zzso zzso zzso State, zzso were zzso 

The pure culture method was used for zzso the zzso strains from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Principal zzso Analysis zzso were used to determine the genetic diversity and zzso zzso The growth in different salt zzso pH and temperatures were zzso 

In total 22 strains were isolated from 12 samples in 8 zzso The strains tested were classified into 4 clusters in zzso zzso zzso and 8 clusters were formed in zzso The zzso zzso Simpson genetic diversity index was D zzso zzso zzso The strains tested were closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso All strains could regularly grow in zzso medium amended with zzso zzso and zzso strains could grow in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could adapt to zzso zzso while zzso could tolerant zzso zzso Among the strains tested, 15 strains could grow in the pH range from zzso to zzso 16 zzso grew well from 4 to 45 degrees C, and all of 22 strains could grow at 28 degrees C after treatment at 60 degrees C for 10 zzso 

This study revealed the high genetic diversity of the zzso isolated from zzso zzso in the eastern part of zzso zzso The strains tested were adapted to high salt, different range of temperatures and zzso
