We provide two methods for identifying changes in zzso that are correlated with changes in a zzso implied by zzso zzso The first method, zzso works when the number of branches over which the change occurred are zzso zzso looks for genetic changes that are completely zzso with zzso changes on a zzso The second method, zzso allows for a partial matching between changes in zzso and zzso and provides a score for each change using zzso concentrated changes zzso The zzso that are highly correlated with zzso change can be ranked by zzso We use these methods to find zzso correlated with resistance to zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso Our findings are consistent with the current biological literature, and also suggest potential novel candidate zzso
