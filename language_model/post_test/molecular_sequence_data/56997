An zzso method for producing a zzso set of zzso deletions in a piece of cloned DNA is zzso The protein zzso zzso by gene II of zzso zzso makes a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso origin of replication zzso in zzso zzso Many zzso such as zzso contain this zzso on one side of the multiple cloning site, thereby permitting zzso zzso zzso to create a zzso at one end of a cloned DNA zzso The zzso may be expanded into gaps of increasing size by the timed 3' to zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso DNA zzso zzso deletions are produced by subsequent treatment with zzso zzso bean zzso After size zzso by zzso zzso the DNA from the melted gel slices is zzso and zzso into host cells to produce a set of plasmids that contain a zzso zzso set of zzso This deletion method is independent of restriction sites, requires only one universal DNA primer to sequence a cloned zzso and may be applied to virtually any cloned segment given the unique nature of the zzso recognition site for zzso zzso
