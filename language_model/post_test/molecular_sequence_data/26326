In this review, I have brought together and compared the available data on the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso that can charge zzso coli zzso show that the zzso involved in the binding and recognition of zzso are strictly zzso whereas those involved in the interaction with zzso are only zzso zzso The results of in zzso genetic zzso experiments indicate that the identity elements of zzso and the recognition mechanisms of such elements by the zzso have been zzso during zzso zzso or zzso zzso are zzso charged by E coli zzso the set of their common zzso contains less than 10 elements if one excludes the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of this set are candidates for a specific recognition by zzso So far, zzso is the only zzso for which a specific recognition of the base has been zzso The zzso that might serve as identity elements for E coli zzso zzso zzso Nicholas Jr HB zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso do not belong to the above set of zzso zzso and therefore probably play negative roles, enabling zzso to avoid zzso zzso zzso of the charging and stability properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that bases 1 and 72 must pair zzso by zzso or zzso hydrogen zzso and adopt a geometry which is compatible with the zzso structure of the zzso stem in order for the zzso zzso to be charged with zzso If bases 1 and 72 or bases 2 and 71 cannot form such pairings, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso The weakening of base pair zzso by zzso or the change of zzso into zzso results in the charging of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of the structural model of the zzso complex with the zzso structure of the zzso complex indicates that the mechanisms for the recognition of the zzso arm are different in the 2 zzso Chemical attack and molecular modeling experiments have indicated that the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso remains mobile after the initial binding of zzso to zzso
