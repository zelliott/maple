zzso of zzso zzso a nuclear protein essential for proliferation and zzso region zzso is a possible target of zzso B, an zzso and zzso zzso with cell zzso zzso zzso zzso a human zzso of zzso was zzso Human zzso zzso consisted of 1071 zzso zzso of which the sequence showed zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as did zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso under the control of a series of zzso promoters suppressed cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso in an expression zzso zzso A similar zzso effect was also observed for zzso zzso zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso were distinctly larger than zzso cells and contained zzso and fragmented zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso demonstrated that most of these cells formed two zzso per cell and accumulated a large amount of zzso or its related zzso around the zzso zzso similar zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells indicate that the cloned zzso encodes a functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses with zzso isolated from synchronized zzso cells showed that the expression of zzso zzso was initiated in late zzso and reached a peak at zzso although its protein level unchanged during the cell zzso zzso expression of zzso fused to the green fluorescent protein zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso was localized zzso in the nuclear envelope and was also zzso in the zzso and the zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso caused nuclear import of a zzso fusion protein containing a nuclear export signal but no change in the distribution of a zzso fusion protein containing a nuclear zzso zzso All of these data suggest that zzso is a novel zzso regulated gene that is essential for the nuclear export zzso nuclear export of zzso
