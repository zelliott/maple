We used differential display to isolate zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso One of them encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso Indeed, the deduced protein sequence contains zzso typical features like the presence of a signal zzso internal repeats, a zzso zzso sequence motif known to bind zzso and von zzso factor type c zzso involved in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals a single transcript of about 11 zzso with an expression pattern correlated to zzso fluctuations during zzso In zzso injections of zzso zzso alone or combined with zzso show that zzso expression is directly induced by this zzso zzso (a juvenile hormone zzso application experiments show that zzso expression is rapidly induced by this zzso This gene is still zzso in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor but, in these conditions, the zzso induction level is not zzso
