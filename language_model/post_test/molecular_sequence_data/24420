Using reverse zzso chain reaction with zzso derived from zzso zzso areas among all four zzso E virus zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence was identified in serum samples obtained from 3 zzso out of 95 zzso to zzso pigs in Japan and characterized zzso In the partial sequence of open reading frame zzso 2 of zzso zzso the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest similarity of zzso to zzso III zzso representing human and zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso in the United zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso consisted of zzso zzso excluding the zzso tail and contained zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 122 zzso The zzso strain was most closely related to a Japanese strain zzso which had been obtained from a zzso patient who had not traveled outside zzso The overall zzso sequence identity between them was zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence identities of zzso zzso and zzso were 96, 99, and zzso zzso These results indicate that a certain proportion of pigs in Japan are zzso and may act as reservoirs of zzso infection, and that the presence of an indigenous zzso of zzso should be taken into consideration for the diagnosis of acute zzso in zzso
