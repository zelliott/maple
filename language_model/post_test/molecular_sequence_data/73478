The zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem repeat zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and its zzso pattern determined by zzso acid zzso Key to these studies is the ability to trim the structurally zzso zzso zzso side chains to homogeneous zzso zzso side chains by mild zzso acid zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso releases the zzso tandem repeat as an ensemble of zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing using zzso zzso chemistry of the repeat was used to determine the extent of zzso of nearly every zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso are all highly zzso within the range of zzso giving an average zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso display a wide range of zzso ranging between 33 and zzso giving an average zzso zzso of zzso These data are consistent with the known elevated zzso of zzso peptides over zzso peptides for the zzso zzso zzso It is also observed that the extent of zzso of the repeat zzso poorly with published zzso zzso An examination of the sequences surrounding the zzso sites reveals that nearly all of the highly zzso sites have a penultimate zzso zzso whereas those that are less highly zzso have medium to large side chain penultimate zzso As observed by others, zzso also appears to be modulated by the presence of Pro zzso On the basis of these findings we suggest that the zzso zzso binds the zzso in a zzso zzso and that penultimate zzso side chain zzso interactions may play a role in determining extent that a given zzso or zzso is zzso A model for the zzso zzso zzso binding site is zzso
