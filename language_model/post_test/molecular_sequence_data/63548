zzso zzso zzso molecules that facilitate the infection of their zzso A number of zzso identified in plant zzso zzso species possess zzso motifs zzso required for targeting these zzso into host zzso Here, we zzso identify zzso candidate zzso genes in each of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A single zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso accounts for most of the zzso The zzso proteins show extensive sequence divergence but are all related and likely evolved from a common zzso by rapid zzso and zzso More than half of the zzso proteins contain zzso zzso motifs zzso W, Y, and zzso that are usually arranged as a module that can be repeated up to eight zzso The zzso genes belong to the most rapidly evolving part of the zzso and they are nearly always located at zzso zzso The zzso includes all zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso and its rapid pace of evolution is consistent with a role for zzso proteins in interaction with plant zzso
