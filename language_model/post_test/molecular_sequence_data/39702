The aim of this study was to assess the cellular response of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso as the single zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso was used to assess the response of zzso zzso zzso cultured in zzso This approach ensures constant growth conditions, both in the presence and absence of zzso A considerable negative effect of zzso on the cell yield was zzso The need for energy in the zzso against zzso was reflected by zzso expressed proteins for cell energy zzso In zzso cells the balance between zzso motive force zzso enforcing and dissipating systems was zzso zzso generating systems were zzso whereas the major zzso system, zzso zzso was zzso Other zzso expressed proteins were zzso outer membrane zzso transport zzso stress-related proteins and zzso zzso In addition, a protein with no assigned function was zzso This study yielded a more detailed view of the effect of zzso on the zzso energy management of zzso zzso zzso and several novel leads have been obtained for further targeted zzso
