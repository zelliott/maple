zzso zzso 1 zzso is the major zzso zzso in DNA base zzso repair that zzso the DNA zzso backbone immediately zzso to zzso zzso Recently, we identified zzso as an zzso that zzso a specific coding region of zzso zzso in zzso regulating zzso zzso level and zzso in zzso Here, we further characterized the zzso activity of zzso focusing on the zzso center of the zzso previously defined for DNA zzso zzso We found that most zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which target zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso zzso pocket, showed significant decreases in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein retained zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities, with concurrent loss of zzso (AP) site zzso activities on zzso DNA and zzso DNA zzso The zzso proteins bound zzso zzso equally well as zzso zzso zzso with the exception of zzso suggesting that most of these zzso contributed primarily to zzso zzso and not to zzso zzso Interestingly, both the zzso and the zzso zzso site zzso activities of zzso zzso were present in the absence of zzso while zzso zzso site zzso required zzso zzso at zzso zzso We also found that a zzso on the sugar zzso was absolutely required for zzso zzso by zzso zzso consistent with zzso leaving a zzso group following zzso of zzso Altogether, our data support the notion that a common active site is shared for the zzso and other zzso activities of zzso however, we provide evidence that the mechanisms for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA by zzso are not zzso an observation that has implications for unraveling the zzso function of zzso in zzso
