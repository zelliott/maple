We recently proposed a scout model of the microbial life cycle zzso zzso Epstein, Nature zzso zzso the central element of which is the hypothesis that dormant microbial cells wake up into active zzso zzso cells zzso independently of environmental zzso Here, we check the principal prediction of this zzso under zzso conditions, dormant cells initiate growth at random time intervals and exhibit no zzso lag zzso We show that a range of zzso including environmental species, zzso coli, and zzso zzso indeed wake up in a seemingly zzso manner and independently of environmental conditions, even in the longest zzso conducted zzso to years zzso As is implicit in the model, most of the cultures we obtained after long zzso were not inherently slow zzso Of the environmental zzso that required zzso months to form visible growth, only zzso needed an equally long incubation upon zzso with the majority exhibiting regrowth within 24 to 48 zzso This apparent change was not a result of zzso zzso rather, most microbial species that appear to be slow growers were in fact fast growers with a delayed initiation of zzso zzso slow growth thus appears to be less significant than previously zzso zzso zzso exit from the zzso state may be a key element of a general microbial survival strategy, and the zzso breadth of the organisms exhibiting such exit indicates that it represents a general zzso The zzso of awakening can also provide a zzso explanation to several zzso zzso including the apparent randomness of zzso infections and the existence of zzso cells zzso
