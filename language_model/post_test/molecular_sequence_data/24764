A zzso acid zzso zzso located inside the zzso loop on envelope protein zzso of zzso is the principal zzso zzso zzso and a subset of zzso zzso specific for this zzso show a broad range of zzso zzso But this zzso zzso restricted zzso In this study, three zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso and its two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and then zzso to carrier protein zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced high levels of zzso to three zzso loop peptides that contain these zzso respectively, and the zzso response induced by each zzso showed zzso zzso When these three zzso mixed together and zzso to carrier zzso or zzso to carrier protein separately and then mixed together, high levels of zzso zzso which respectively recognized these zzso on zzso loop zzso and both zzso peptides all can be induced by both of zzso In zzso zzso these zzso zzso all recognized the zzso zzso and zzso zzso on peptides zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso with whole zzso zzso which contained the zzso zzso was zzso Only the zzso zzso but not the other zzso recognized the zzso zzso These results provide experimental evidence that the candidate zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso may bring new hope against viral zzso resulting in zzso immune evasion and may be developed as an effective vaccine with a broad zzso activity against zzso zzso
