The zzso scavenger receptors are consisted of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso domain is revealed to have important role for zzso zzso The zzso gene is located on human zzso zzso The human scavenger gene spans approximately 80 zzso and is composed of 11 zzso Two types of scavenger zzso zzso were shown to result from alternative zzso of zzso 9 for type II or 10 and 11 for type I to the common zzso zzso The scavenger zzso proteins were detected in zzso of various zzso and zzso such as zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso In the zzso zzso scavenger receptors may participate progression of foam zzso zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso scavenger zzso may suggest the defending function against a wide variety of zzso zzso
