A complete zzso acid sequence for rat zzso zzso was deduced from zzso analysis of a zzso clone isolated from a rat zzso cell zzso zzso This DNA zzso containing initiation and termination zzso and a zzso tail, translated a zzso in zzso cells that expressed both 17 zzso and zzso zzso zzso It exhibited significant similarity to the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the bovine and human zzso zzso particularly with respect to the highly zzso regions and secondary zzso The zzso appears to be anchored to the membrane of the zzso zzso through two zzso regions, specifically the N terminal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the remainder of the C zzso is associated with the membrane through four zzso zzso including the putative steroid binding zzso
