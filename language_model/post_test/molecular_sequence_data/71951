zzso zzso virus 1 encodes two zzso regulatory zzso zzso proteins 22 and 0 zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whereas zzso is required in zzso and for efficient replication and expression of a subset of late zzso genes in zzso or rabbit cell lines and in primary human cell strains zzso zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso We report the identification in the zzso zzso system of a cellular protein designated zzso that interacts with zzso This protein zzso Mr of zzso has not been previously described and has no known zzso zzso of zzso revealed the zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lacking the zzso 24 zzso acids but not zzso lacking the zzso 40 zzso zzso whereas the previously identified cellular protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1998) bound all forms of zzso The interaction of zzso with only one zzso of zzso supports that hypothesis that each zzso of zzso zzso virus proteins performs a specific function that may be different from that of other zzso zzso zzso also bound zzso the binding of zzso was independent of that of zzso zzso zzso localized in zzso rabbit skin cells in both zzso and zzso In rabbit skin cells infected with zzso virus, zzso was zzso processed to a higher apparent Mr but was not zzso zzso processing required the presence of the genes zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso localized primarily in zzso Soon after infection with zzso virus, the zzso localized in discrete small nuclear structures with zzso Late in infection, both zzso and zzso tended to disperse but zzso did not change in apparent zzso The zzso of zzso was independent of zzso but zzso tended to be more localized in small nuclear structures and less dispersed in cells infected with zzso lacking the genes zzso the zzso or zzso protein zzso The results suggest that zzso modification of zzso is zzso either by zzso zzso zzso or by zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso rabbit skin zzso and that the restrictive zzso of rabbit skin cells may be related to the failure to process zzso by zzso lacking the genes zzso zzso or zzso
