We have reported previously that zzso protein 60 zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an important zzso in the zzso of gastric zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso In order to investigate associations with host immune reactions and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso production were zzso following stimulation with zzso To provide a clear zzso immune response, peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and those from healthy volunteers were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was also zzso by a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso of patients with zzso zzso was increased by zzso or by combination with stimulation with zzso zzso The production of zzso in zzso cultures was increased in patients with zzso zzso however, production of zzso was at low zzso DNA zzso analysis indicated increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso In cases of zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso immune responses against zzso may be enhanced by host factors, such as zzso presentation and zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso which can be demonstrated during chronic zzso zzso zzso
