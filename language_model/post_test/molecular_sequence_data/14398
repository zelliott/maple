zzso zzso zzso affects regulation of hundreds of genes during cancer zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso zzso island in cancer was discovered within the zzso zzso zzso was zzso in normal cells but zzso lung zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso zzso tumors were zzso zzso of two novel zzso transcripts identified was significantly reduced in primary lung tumors than distant normal lung zzso These transcripts were silenced in zzso lung and breast cancer cells and zzso treatment zzso zzso Extension of these zzso to zzso zzso and zzso genes that share similar zzso structure and protein zzso with zzso revealed distinct zzso profiles by smoking status, zzso and cancer zzso zzso was almost exclusively zzso in breast zzso than lung zzso cancer, whereas zzso was frequently zzso in lung zzso than breast zzso zzso zzso was zzso in all samples and showed the highest expression in normal zzso Compared to zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in normal lung was 25, 44, and zzso lower, respectively, supporting the premise that reduced promoter activity zzso increased zzso to zzso during lung zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso modulated multiple pathways while zzso zzso targeted zzso development and zzso Although these zzso did not result in further zzso changes of lung cancer cells in zzso the impact on tissue zzso inflammatory response, and cell differentiation pathways suggest a potential role for zzso in modulating tumor zzso
