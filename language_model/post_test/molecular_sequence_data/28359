Eight zzso ends of zzso molecules which zzso the zzso T4 base plate late genes 51 to 26 region have been mapped by zzso zzso protection and reverse zzso within a zzso DNA zzso Two of eight zzso ends are initiated at two absolutely zzso late promoter sites, zzso and zzso that direct zzso synthesis on opposite zzso These two promoters share four of eight promoter sequence base zzso A third zzso end arises from another promoter, zzso which shows one base pair mismatch with respect to the absolutely zzso zzso zzso All the other zzso ends arise from zzso processing and/or zzso Since no other late zzso promoter sites were found within the base plate cluster zzso we propose that the two overlapping late zzso zzso and zzso direct the expression of the T4 base plate gene zzso included between map coordinates zzso and zzso zzso directs the zzso of genes 51, 27, 28, 29, 48, and 54 on the zzso strand and zzso the zzso of genes 26 and 25 on the zzso zzso This peculiar promoter zzso might account for the low level of zzso of these late zzso
