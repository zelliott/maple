In the zzso zzso zzso zzso only one alcohol zzso zzso zzso has been zzso To zzso the influence of zzso on ethanol zzso we constructed the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The delta zzso cells still produced ethanol and grew zzso as the zzso zzso Both DNA zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that this ethanol production is caused by the enhanced expression of a zzso zzso zzso gene product zzso named zzso Since the strain lacking both zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso delta zzso showed zzso retarded growth, only these two zzso produce ethanol for zzso zzso This is the first observation that a zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso functions in zzso ethanol zzso
