Two zzso strains zzso and zzso were isolated by membrane zzso from samples of zzso water collected from two zzso forests, in Khao zzso zzso National Park and zzso zzso zzso zzso National Park, zzso Province, zzso Analysis of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso sequences revealed that the sequences of the two strains were zzso The closest species in terms of zzso sequence similarity was zzso zzso but the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to justify the description of a separate zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the two strains occupy a zzso position with respect to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso supported by a high zzso zzso The two strains showed identical zzso zzso including proliferation by zzso zzso absence of zzso and zzso and negative zzso blue B and zzso zzso The major zzso was zzso On the basis of the above findings, these two strains were assigned to a single novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
