zzso zzso are widely distributed components of zzso zzso that function in the formation of zzso serve structural roles and provide zzso for cell zzso To determine when and how zzso zzso may function in early development we have examined the zzso and spatial distribution of zzso in chicken zzso Using zzso zzso we amplified and cloned a 407 zzso zzso of chicken zzso that appears to code for an zzso of zzso zzso expressed protein was used to prepare two zzso zzso both of which recognize a 350 zzso band in zzso or zzso in zzso of chicken embryonic zzso cells or human zzso zzso Both zzso recognize zzso material associated with the surfaces of cultured zzso The zzso appear to be specific for zzso as there was only weak cross zzso to a zzso expressed zzso from the corresponding region of zzso and the pattern of zzso in embryonic tissue is distinctly different from that of zzso a zzso specific zzso zzso et zzso zzso In zzso zzso is first detected at stage 6 in the zzso during zzso In subsequent stages zzso fibers appear in all zzso and are present throughout the first 6 days of zzso zzso fibers are present in zzso zzso and zzso filled spaces, but they also form random zzso with an zzso polarity within zzso Using zzso specific for zzso and zzso in zzso reactions we confirm the presence of zzso 1 and zzso zzso in early embryonic zzso This zzso and spatial distribution indicates zzso has functions in early development that are distinct from zzso
