A zzso chain reaction method has been developed which allows the simultaneous detection of the majority of clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso direct the zzso amplification of a DNA region spanning E1 and zzso zzso This enables an immediate distinction between the two groups of zzso characterized by high or low zzso potential, simply from the size of amplified zzso The zzso product can be subjected to a second round of amplification with internal zzso which are specific for 7 high-risk zzso types, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identification of zzso or zzso amplified DNA is done by zzso zzso with one or two zzso The detection sensitivity, which has been assessed using cloned zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cell lines, varies from a few tens to a few hundreds of viral zzso zzso The accuracy of the method has been confirmed by examining cervical scrapings of 44 zzso
