zzso attack triggers a multifaceted zzso response in plants that includes the zzso of zzso proteins and their corresponding zzso One of these transcripts encodes for zzso a small zzso and zzso protein of unknown function that appears to be specific to grass zzso Here we describe members of the zzso zzso family of barley with respect to zzso relationship, transcript regulation, zzso with quantitative trait zzso for resistance to the barley powdery zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the association of single zzso zzso or gene zzso with resistance, as well as zzso effects of gene zzso by zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso family of moderate complexity that splits up into two major zzso one of those being also represented by previously described zzso sequences from zzso All zzso zzso transcripts accumulated in response to powdery zzso attack in leaves and all mapped zzso genes were associated with quantitative trait zzso for resistance to zzso zzso Moreover, single zzso zzso or zzso of zzso members were associated with quantitative resistance of barley to zzso zzso and transient zzso gene zzso affected the interaction of zzso cells with the zzso The presented data provide zzso evidence for a role of the zzso gene and possibly other family members, during the interaction of barley with zzso zzso
