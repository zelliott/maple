A zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from sea sand and studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew under both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso type was zzso and zzso was the diagnostic zzso zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso zzso was the major zzso and the zzso fatty acids were zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso High zzso zzso gene sequence similarities zzso were found with the sequences of the type strains of the three zzso of the family zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso formed a zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differed from these three type strains in zzso characteristics and in zzso zzso gene signature zzso Based on genetic and zzso evidence, it is suggested that strain zzso represents a novel species of a new zzso within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
