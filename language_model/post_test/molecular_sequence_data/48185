The entire sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso DNA from zzso zzso which contains the zzso gene and a second complete and two further partial open reading frames has been zzso A correction of the previously published zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997) which in the deduced primary structure of the zzso zzso changes four positive into four negative charges and the number of zzso acids from 425 to zzso was zzso The correction has no further bearing on the former sequence zzso zzso and interruption strains document that zzso zzso is essential for zzso growth on zzso The zzso zzso is involved in energy conversion, not in zzso Studies with an alkaline zzso fusion protein reveal a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso treatment of the fusion construct demonstrated that the zzso 38 zzso acids of zzso zzso were required for zzso An zzso signal zzso for zzso was not found in the primary structure of the zzso The possibility that the neighboring open reading frame, which contains a double zzso zzso may be involved in zzso has been excluded by gene deletion zzso the product of this gene functions in an zzso cassette zzso system, together with the product of one of the other open reading zzso The results lead to the conclusion that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso functions at the zzso surface of the zzso membrane and that this zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso
