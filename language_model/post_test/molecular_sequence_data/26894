Cystic zzso is frequently missed in the Pakistani population due to lack of appropriate diagnostic zzso Thus our aim was to define unknown zzso zzso to help create suitable diagnostic tests and improve understanding of what appears to be an aggressive and zzso disease in this zzso 

Patients with elevated sweat zzso values and clinically suspected zzso were recruited from Aga Khan University, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 296 + zzso zzso zzso and zzso were screened for by zzso specific zzso chain zzso zzso zzso 10, 11 and 12 were zzso by direct DNA zzso 

Of 150 patients tested by zzso 26 zzso were positive for zzso One patient was a zzso compound zzso zzso of 87 patients zzso for zzso in zzso 10 were zzso zzso for zzso 11 and 29 for zzso 12 were zzso 

This first step in defining zzso involved in Pakistani zzso suggests that zzso is uncommon and zzso was the only additional zzso identified in zzso zzso 10, 11 and zzso Identification of the remaining zzso and their frequency is required to design appropriate tests and improve understanding and management of the zzso
