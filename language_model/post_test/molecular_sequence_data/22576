zzso cope with zzso induced zzso of zzso II by regulating multiple zzso genes to boost the expression of D1 protein (in zzso zzso zzso or to exchange the zzso zzso protein to an alternate zzso zzso (in zzso zzso zzso To define more general patterns of zzso zzso zzso we applied moderately zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and tracked the expression of its five zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso characterized by a zzso represented the majority of the zzso transcript pool under control zzso zzso transcripts decreased upon zzso treatment but the total zzso transcript pool increased zzso fold within 90 zzso as a result of sharply increased zzso zzso and zzso transcripts zzso an alternate zzso protein zzso characterized by zzso similar to that of zzso Upon zzso treatment the relaxation of flash induced zzso zzso showed a characteristic acceleration of a zzso phase likely associated with the exchange from the zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso to the alternate zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso Throughout the zzso treatment the divergent zzso made only a trace contribution to the total zzso transcript zzso This suggests a similarity to the divergent zzso gene from zzso whose natural expression we demonstrate for the first time at a trace level similar to zzso in zzso These zzso zzso genes in two different zzso raise questions concerning the functions of these divergent zzso
