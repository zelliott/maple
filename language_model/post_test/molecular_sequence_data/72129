The zzso gene family of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso consists of eight members that zzso small zzso proteins containing a single zzso recognition motif zzso Similar genes are found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but are absent from the other completely zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso genes of zzso is induced by low temperature, with the exception of the zzso zzso We found four stretches of zzso sequences in the zzso region of the zzso zzso genes that are known to be induced by low zzso The zzso zzso proteins contain a short zzso zzso zzso In this respect, these proteins are similar to plant and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso which also contain a single zzso domain with a zzso zzso domain and are highly expressed at low zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso however, that the zzso zzso proteins and the zzso zzso do not belong to a single zzso but that the zzso zzso are likely to have been added zzso The zzso of both types of proteins is also likely to have evolved zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso proteins are not likely to have originated from the zzso proteins of zzso zzso but are supposed to have zzso from the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso proteins and the zzso zzso are similar in both structure and regulation, but that this apparent similarity has resulted from zzso zzso
