The zzso zzso zzso is found zzso in aquatic environments and can cause a severe pneumonia in humans called zzso zzso How this zzso switches from zzso to zzso life and adapts to different hosts and environmental conditions is only partly zzso Here we used zzso deep sequencing from zzso zzso and post zzso zzso grown zzso zzso to analyze the zzso landscape of its entire zzso We established the complete zzso map and defined zzso primary zzso start sites zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso genes contained tandem promoters of which 93 show alternative usage dependent on the growth zzso Similarly, over zzso of 713 here identified zzso are phase zzso zzso Analysis of their conservation among the seven zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed many strain specific differences suggesting that zzso zzso contains a highly dynamic pool of zzso Analysis of six zzso exhibiting the same expression pattern as zzso genes showed that two, zzso and zzso are indeed involved in zzso growth of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso encodes a small zzso named zzso that functions together with zzso and zzso in the zzso regulatory pathway, crucial for the switch to the virulent zzso Together our data provide new insight into the zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso identified many new zzso and will provide a framework for the understanding of zzso and adaptation properties of zzso zzso
