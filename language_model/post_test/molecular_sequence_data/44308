A 398 zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso gene of 39 clinical samples of rabbit zzso disease virus zzso and 17 of European brown zzso syndrome virus zzso collected between 1981 and 1995 from 17 countries, was amplified by zzso and directly zzso The alignment of the zzso sequences and the subsequently constructed zzso tree clearly separated zzso from zzso as zzso zzso The zzso zzso rates between the zzso and zzso groups ranged between zzso and zzso The zzso rates within the groups were much higher, zzso to zzso for the zzso samples, and zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso No intermediate viruses were zzso Despite the high zzso three main branches could be identified in the zzso tree of the zzso samples, corresponding to the zzso data, while the zzso zzso did not show such well defined zzso The present results support the zzso of zzso and zzso as two distinct members of the zzso zzso Nevertheless, a comparison with previously determined sequences of other zzso shows that zzso and zzso are more closely related to each other than to any other zzso
