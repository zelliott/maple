To exploit the huge potential of zzso sequence information, the ability to efficiently zzso long, accurate DNA sequences is becoming increasingly zzso An approach proposed toward this end involves the synthesis of approximately zzso segments of DNA, followed by their assembly into longer sequences by conventional cloning methods zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso III, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 100, zzso The major current impediment to the success of this tactic is the difficulty of building the approximately zzso components accurately, zzso and rapidly from short synthetic zzso building zzso We have developed and implemented a strategy for the zzso synthesis of long, accurate DNA zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso are built into zzso to zzso zzso with low error frequency by automated zzso gene zzso By parallel processing, these zzso are efficiently joined into zzso approximately zzso segments by using only three zzso and zzso by zzso These large segments can be subsequently assembled into very long sequences by conventional zzso We validated the approach by building a synthetic zzso zzso zzso gene cluster whose functionality was demonstrated by its ability to produce the zzso and its zzso product in zzso zzso
