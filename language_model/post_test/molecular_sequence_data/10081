zzso of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of two open reading frames showing striking zzso with zzso A zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso transfer of zzso from one zzso acid to zzso The genes were present in all zzso zzso strains tested by zzso chain reaction or slot zzso but not in zzso zzso Genes for the putative A and B zzso of zzso zzso zzso were introduced into the bacterial expression zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso combined with zzso of zzso activities using different zzso donors and zzso identified the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso This activity was consistently observed in different zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against either zzso A or B zzso recognized two distinct zzso of Mr approximately 26,000 and 24, zzso that are both necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso activities indicates that the generation of zzso zzso is not zzso by the zzso acid cycle in zzso zzso We zzso the existence of an alternative zzso where the zzso is essential for energy zzso
