zzso and zzso zzso acids are natural derivatives of vitamin A that zzso gene expression as a consequence of binding to nuclear zzso acid receptors zzso and zzso X receptors zzso zzso form zzso with zzso in zzso and such complexes display enhanced binding affinities for zzso DNA response zzso As zzso is devoid of zzso zzso and zzso we used this zzso to investigate whether zzso in zzso requires zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we demonstrate that zzso zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha containing the zzso domain of the zzso zzso activate zzso of a zzso reporter gene in zzso independently of each zzso These activities result from an zzso zzso zzso function located in the zzso zzso of zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha and a zzso zzso function located in the zzso region of zzso alpha zzso The zzso zzso function of zzso alpha is induced exclusively by zzso acid in this zzso zzso of a reporter gene containing a zzso acid response element by zzso alpha was considerably increased by zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso induction was achieved with zzso acid, which stimulates the activity of both zzso This study illustrates the utility of zzso to investigate signal zzso by zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso
