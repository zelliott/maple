We investigated the host specificity of two cryptic zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso infecting invasive zzso zzso and native zzso zzso hosts in zzso zzso zzso was on average four times more prevalent in the native host, whereas zzso zzso was three times more prevalent in the invasive zzso zzso with zzso zzso strongly reduced female reproduction in both host species, whereas infection with zzso zzso had weaker effects on female zzso We contrasted zzso prevalence in native zzso zzso populations (New zzso and in both invaded and zzso zzso populations (Old zzso At a community level, zzso prevalence was twice as high in native compared with invasive zzso due to the contrasting zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso At a higher zzso level, zzso prevalence in zzso zzso did not differ between the invaded populations and the native populations used for the zzso Although zzso zzso was the only species found both in New and Old World zzso no evidence of its zzso with the invasive host was found in our experimental and zzso zzso These results suggest that the success of zzso zzso invasion is probably due to a lower zzso to virulent zzso zzso rather than to decreased zzso prevalence compared with zzso zzso or to lower zzso zzso in introduced zzso
