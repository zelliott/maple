zzso decisions that control cell fate are commonly regulated by the zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors results in zzso liberation of the zzso domain of zzso which zzso into the nucleus, binds a zzso zzso promoter binding factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso target zzso We found that the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because numerous genes that control immune and inflammatory responses are zzso and zzso regulates immune cell function, we investigated the underlying molecular zzso zzso of zzso by zzso did not represent a general zzso effect on zzso because nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso driven by a zzso promoter and zzso were not affected by zzso The zzso relevance of the repression was supported by the facts that repression was apparent in multiple cell lines, zzso zzso target genes were zzso and similar zzso of zzso were required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso that mediates zzso binding and distinct sequences necessary for zzso were required for zzso However, there was not a strict correlation between the sequence requirements for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso nuclear zzso of zzso and was not accompanied by disruption of zzso zzso zzso signaling events required for zzso zzso or by defective zzso DNA binding zzso These results provide evidence for negative zzso between zzso and zzso which may have important consequences for controlling diverse biological zzso
