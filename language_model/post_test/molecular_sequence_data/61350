zzso that mediate zzso of attached zinc finger zzso zzso have been evolved in zzso starting from random zzso We first used zzso display to select zzso elements from libraries of random zzso zzso that were fused to the N zzso of the zinc finger zzso We then zzso these peptides by zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso across the zzso in three zzso and selecting zzso peptides that further stabilized the zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed that the selected peptides promote zzso of the zinc fingers on an appropriate DNA target zzso These results demonstrate that zzso units can be obtained readily from random zzso libraries of moderate zzso Our success zzso the utility of searching random zzso libraries in protein design projects, and the sequences presented here may be useful when designing novel zzso zzso
