zzso not zzso enhances the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso In earlier studies we have shown that a site involved in this rate enhancement is located in a zzso zzso zzso A zzso This sequence comprises a special charge distribution in which a stretch with alternating neutral and zzso zzso acids is embraced by basic zzso zzso In this study we found that the disruption of charge distribution as caused by replacing zzso 152 by other zzso and/or zzso zzso acids leads to loss of zzso zzso Also zzso at position A zzso was replaced by zzso derivatives and other zzso zzso We found that the side chain of the zzso acid at position A zzso must contain no (as in zzso or one carbon atom without substitution zzso When the side chain contains two or more carbon zzso there should also be a polar group in the side zzso We also zzso a series of zzso covering the sequence of A zzso and found that only A zzso is zzso notwithstanding the fact that the peptides A zzso A zzso and A zzso also contain zzso A zzso We conclude that the shortest zzso with stimulation activity is A zzso that the charge distribution in A zzso is zzso that it is not zzso A zzso per zzso that is zzso but rather the properties and orientation of the side chain of A zzso
