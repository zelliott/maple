The zzso zzso zzso and its cellular counterpart code for proteins that function as major components of the zzso factor complex zzso zzso proteins bind to the zzso consensus sequence as zzso or zzso with members of the zzso protein zzso This report compares the ability of viral and cellular zzso proteins zzso and zzso to activate zzso and to stimulate DNA zzso The effect of zzso acid zzso on cellular transformation is also zzso In zzso cells zzso is a more effective zzso than zzso which carries two zzso acid zzso in the zzso region that together zzso zzso The delta zzso present in the zzso region of zzso does not affect zzso in zzso zzso however, it does zzso the stimulation of DNA zzso When delta is deleted, the zzso acid zzso are without consequence on DNA zzso In the presence of delta the zzso acid zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, which is required for cellular zzso zzso both zzso and stimulation of DNA zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and stimulation of DNA synthesis all depend on the presence of the zzso zzso The three functions are, however, not tightly zzso and further work is needed to define the role of the zzso activities of zzso in zzso
