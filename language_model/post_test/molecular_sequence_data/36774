Two zzso peptides were zzso zzso zzso had the same zzso acid sequence as that in the region zzso of human growth hormone zzso zzso In the second zzso zzso zzso was replaced with zzso Biological activity of the peptides was assessed in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell division and DNA synthesis in a zzso zzso zzso stimulation was equivalent to that noted with native zzso although zzso was much less potent zzso zzso approximately 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 20 zzso No zzso activity was found with zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso structure of zzso zzso is crucial for biological zzso
