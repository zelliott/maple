zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso a large marine zzso found along the northeastern coast of North zzso The zzso structure of this zzso in zzso solution has been determined by zzso zzso zzso at 600 zzso The zzso has a zzso zzso hairpin structure, with the branches of the hairpin linked by four zzso zzso The zzso zzso were established from the zzso data to be zzso which differed from those determined previously by chemical means, where zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Each branch of the hairpin is largely zzso with the zzso in the N and zzso branches encompassing zzso 11 to 23 and 34 to 49, zzso The loop connecting the branches of the hairpin contains two inverse zzso zzso on zzso 24 and 25, a type I zzso at zzso 28 to 31 and a type II zzso at zzso 30 to zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are important for activity, are all on the same face of the zzso while zzso which is also important for activity, is on the opposite zzso zzso comparisons show that the zzso structure is quite similar to those of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso B from zzso zzso These structural similarities are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms of action of zzso
