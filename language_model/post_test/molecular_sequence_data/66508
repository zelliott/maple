We report here a new method for the alternative zzso tagging of zzso proteins from zzso cell zzso This method, which we called regulated zzso exploits the property of zzso antibiotics to promote zzso zzso of nonsense zzso The basic expression cassette includes a zzso fusion between a gene of interest and a membrane targeting zzso which are separated by a nonsense zzso In the presence of an zzso antibiotic, zzso zzso is promoted and results in the targeting of the fusion protein to the cell zzso thus allowing the efficient flow zzso isolation of cells expressing very high levels of zzso zzso For downstream applications requiring the production of soluble zzso zzso the cells are cultured in the absence of zzso leading to an efficient zzso zzso By combining different translation termination signals that exhibit various zzso to zzso zzso zzso with flow zzso capabilities, it is possible to use this technology for other applications such as functional library screening or monitoring the stability of zzso protein zzso
