The molecular zzso technique zzso zzso length zzso zzso was used in combination with zzso approaches to evaluate the geographic distribution of secondary zzso zzso genes in strains of the marine zzso zzso zzso This study targeted zzso zzso zzso from type I zzso zzso zzso genes and revealed four distinct zzso the largest of which was comprised of strains from all six global locations zzso The remaining strains fell into three smaller clusters comprised of strains derived entirely from the Red Sea, the Sea of Cortez, or around the Island of zzso These results reveal variation in the secondary zzso gene zzso maintained by strains that are largely zzso at the zzso zzso zzso The location zzso of the three smaller clusters provide evidence that collections of secondary zzso genes in zzso of zzso zzso are endemic to these zzso zzso zzso sequences support the maintenance of distinct sets of zzso genes in the strains associated with each cluster and include four that had not previously been detected in zzso zzso Two of these new sequences were observed only in strains derived from Guam or the Sea of zzso zzso analysis of one of the new zzso sequences in conjunction with the production of the zzso zzso A supports a link between this sequence and the associated zzso zzso From the perspective of natural product discovery, these results suggest that screening populations from distant locations can enhance the discovery of new natural products and provides further support for the use of molecular zzso techniques, such as zzso to rapidly identify strains that possess distinct sets of zzso zzso
