In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso acquires two zzso arms through the directed migration of its zzso tip cells zzso which are located at the tip of the growing zzso zzso A member of the zzso (a zzso and zzso family, zzso regulates directional migration of zzso zzso is zzso and zzso from the muscle cells of the body wall, and zzso to the zzso where it is required for DTC zzso The zzso zzso causes defective migration of zzso and interacts genetically with zzso Here, we report that zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso required for zzso and proper zzso of zzso Our findings indicate that an zzso affects organ zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
