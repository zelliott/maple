The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso was zzso and its complete DNA sequence was zzso In addition, the same gene from a moderate zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in a similar zzso Large parts of the two translated zzso acid sequences were confirmed by automated zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso gene consists of a zzso open reading frame and encodes zzso zzso acid zzso corresponding to the zzso (Mr zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The similarity of zzso acid sequence between the two zzso zzso with distinct zzso is very high zzso than zzso The zzso zzso are clustered in a few regions with relatively short zzso which may correlate with the difference in zzso stability of the zzso zzso search of the primary structures of both zzso zzso with those of other zzso zzso zzso revealed significant sequence similarity in the regions containing the zzso binding zzso Interestingly, several zzso important zzso in zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in the primary structure of zzso zzso at matched positions with similar mutual zzso
