zzso zzso the attempt to zzso a population by zzso its zzso rate, has been endorsed in the zzso literature as a promising approach for treating viral zzso In support of the concept, in zzso studies have forced viral extinction with high doses of zzso zzso However, the one known zzso drug used on patients commonly fails to cure infections, and in zzso studies typically find a wide range of zzso conditions zzso for viral zzso A key question becomes how subsequent evolution is affected if the viral population is zzso but avoids zzso viral adaptation zzso rather than zzso Here we consider the evolution of highly zzso populations surviving zzso using the DNA zzso zzso In zzso using zzso zzso whenever resistance zzso were observed, the zzso populations exhibited higher zzso but some zzso blocked plaque formation by even the zzso zzso Second, outgrowth of previously zzso populations led to rapid and potentially complete fitness recovery but zzso was slow to zzso and zzso exhibited inconsistent patterns of zzso Third, the combination of population bottlenecks with zzso did cause fitness declines, revealing a vulnerability that was not apparent from zzso of large zzso The results show that a population surviving high zzso may exhibit enhanced adaptation in some environments and experience little negative fitness consequences in many zzso
