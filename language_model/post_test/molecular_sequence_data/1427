zzso zzso is a widespread zzso that is toxic to plant zzso However, only a few genes that contribute to zzso resistance in plants have been zzso To identify additional zzso resistance zzso we screened an zzso zzso library using a zzso zzso zzso expression system employing the zzso zzso zzso zzso This screening process yielded a small zzso membrane protein zzso plant cadmium resistance, zzso Database searches revealed that there are nine close zzso in zzso zzso were also found in other zzso Four of the five zzso that were tested also increased resistance to zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso at the plasma membrane in both zzso and zzso zzso plants zzso zzso exhibited increased zzso resistance, whereas zzso plants that showed reduced zzso expression were more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso by zzso cells and also reduced the zzso contents of both zzso and zzso zzso treated with zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso family members may play an important role in the zzso resistance of zzso
