The major zzso complex zzso genes code for proteins that play a critical role in the immune system zzso The zzso genes are among the most zzso genes in zzso presumably due to balancing zzso The two zzso classes appear to differ in the rate of evolution, but the reasons for this variation are not well zzso Here, we investigate the level of zzso and the evolution of sequences that code for the zzso regions of zzso class I and class II zzso genes in the Alpine zzso zzso zzso We found evidence for four expressed zzso class I zzso and two expressed zzso class II zzso zzso genes in zzso were characterized by low zzso as one to eight zzso per putative locus were detected in 38 individuals from three French zzso zzso The generally limited degree of zzso which was more pronounced in class I zzso is likely due to bottleneck the populations zzso Additionally, gene zzso within each class might have compensated for the loss of zzso at particular zzso The two gene classes showed different patterns of zzso The most zzso of the putative zzso zzso showed clear evidence of historical positive selection for zzso acid zzso However, no signal of positive selection was evident in the zzso class I zzso These contrasting patterns of sequence evolution may reflect differences in selection pressures acting on class I and class II zzso
