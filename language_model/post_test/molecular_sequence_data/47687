The mouse zzso zzso gene is essential in both zzso and early zzso Its product, zzso is an zzso protein belonging to a growing protein family called zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso All members have an approximately zzso acid zzso domain, which contains a single extended zzso zzso K zzso domain flanked by two zzso called zzso and zzso We found that zzso zzso could associate with each other, while one of the lethal zzso zzso with a single zzso acid change in zzso domain, leads to a loss of zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso domain is responsible for zzso zzso Three zzso zzso have different zzso zzso and different zzso zzso Here, using zzso fusion zzso we identified a zzso acid novel nuclear zzso sequence in the zzso zzso of zzso which is zzso in a zzso of zzso proteins containing zzso and zzso Thus, we name this motif zzso In addition, the effects of active transcription, zzso and zzso on zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, using an zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso but not another zzso protein zzso zzso between the nucleus and the zzso which suggests that zzso functions in both cell zzso
