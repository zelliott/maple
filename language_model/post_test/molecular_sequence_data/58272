A zzso zzso containing a zzso insert zzso an zzso was isolated from a yellow fever zzso Aedes aegypti zzso complementary DNA zzso This insert zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso whose deduced zzso acid sequence exhibited zzso zzso zzso with the zzso terminal zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to clone and determine the sequence of the additional zzso zzso that comprise the zzso end of the zzso The coding zzso sequence of the whole gene zzso zzso exhibited between 81 and zzso zzso with coding sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and its deduced zzso acid sequence exhibited zzso zzso zzso with those zzso The highest similarity of zzso gene at the zzso acid sequence level was with zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscle zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the Aedes zzso contains at least 5 zzso zzso
