In the last decade, several studies have shown that subterranean aquatic zzso harbor cryptic species with restricted geographic zzso frequently occurring as isolated zzso Previous studies on aquatic subterranean species have implied that habitat zzso can promote zzso and that zzso events can be predicted from zzso zzso We tested the prediction that species distributed across different drainage systems and zzso sectors comprise sets of distinct zzso zzso from the zzso zzso from 11 caves distributed along the Western zzso zzso were investigated using three independent molecular markers zzso zzso and zzso The results showed that: 1) the studied populations belong to eight different species that derive from two zzso unrelated zzso zzso 2) narrow endemic species in fact comprise complexes of zzso similar species that are indistinguishable without using a molecular zzso The concept of zzso zzso between zzso and nuclear DNA, and the value of zzso distances were used as species zzso zzso The concept of cryptic species is discussed within the framework of the present work and the contribution of these species to regional zzso is also zzso
