zzso zzso which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso that zzso zzso A protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was previously identified as a zzso binding protein interacts with the zzso 15 zzso acids of the regulatory domain of the zzso zzso To identify the minimal region of the zzso zzso necessary for binding to zzso we employed an in zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding using a series of synthetic peptides as well as a screen of random zzso libraries by the zzso zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso three zzso acids zzso of human zzso were necessary and sufficient for its interaction with the third zzso zzso domain of zzso Furthermore, the direct zzso zzso of this zzso zzso resulted in the induction of zzso zzso in a colon cancer cell line that expresses both zzso and zzso Since zzso motifs in the C zzso of several other receptors have been shown to interact with zzso domain in signal zzso zzso this may represent a general motif for zzso interactions with important biological zzso
