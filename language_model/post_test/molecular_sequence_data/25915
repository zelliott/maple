The crystal structure of a complex between a zzso zzso analogue and the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been solved and refined to a resolution of zzso zzso The identical zzso of the two complexes that comprise the zzso zzso unit indicates both the manner in which the transition state is stabilized and how the zzso fatty zzso chains of the zzso are zzso by the zzso during zzso zzso The critical features that suggest the chemistry of binding and zzso are the same as those seen in the crystal structure of a similar complex formed with the zzso distant zzso zzso
