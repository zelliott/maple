Using zzso search, structure zzso and structural characterization methods we show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complement proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso type I zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso tissue zzso of zzso zzso The proteins harboring this zzso module zzso zzso fulfill diverse biological roles ranging from zzso guidance, regulation of zzso zzso to the control of the activity of zzso With the exception of zzso it is not known at present what role the zzso zzso play in these zzso In view of the fact that the zzso zzso of zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and that the zzso module of zzso is involved in the control of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso it seems possible that interaction with zzso could be a shared property of zzso zzso and could be critical for the biological roles of the host zzso
