zzso A blocked zzso was isolated from brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts of the zzso zzso zzso Biological activity was monitored during zzso zzso by observing the zzso effect of column zzso on the isolated zzso of zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of this zzso zzso was established zzso zzso zzso The zzso and biological properties of the synthetic zzso were the same as those of the native zzso thus confirming structural zzso zzso This zzso is the sixth natural analog of a series of locust peptides with a zzso zzso This zzso terminal sequence is also found in other peptides identified in other insects and it is the biological active core sequence for diverse biological activities: muscle contraction, zzso production, zzso synthesis and zzso zzso Like the zzso and zzso I, zzso II stimulates zzso of the zzso in zzso
