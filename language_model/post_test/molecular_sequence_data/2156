A gene zzso a zzso protein of zzso coli zzso has been cloned and zzso The gene was identified in a zzso library by zzso to a synthetic zzso probe corresponding to zzso acids 4 to 9 of the zzso sequence obtained by direct chemical analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Harris, and zzso zzso Trust, zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA was zzso and shown to contain an open reading frame zzso a protein with a molecular weight of zzso and a length of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was identical to the published zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and to four internal regions whose partial sequences were obtained by direct chemical analysis of two zzso and two zzso zzso peptides of zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso protein contains zzso modified zzso zzso most of which occur within a region containing two zzso repeating peptides separated by 34 unique zzso zzso Comparisons with the sequences of zzso from other bacterial species revealed zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso data suggest the presence of a second zzso copy located adjacent to the first on the zzso zzso
