The complex zzso of zzso diseases is usually attributed to insufficient zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a highly sensitive cellular energy sensor that is zzso by zzso zzso By zzso zzso 60 zzso we produced zzso diseased strains with gene zzso defects in zzso growth, and zzso zzso zzso disease was zzso in a gene zzso manner by zzso a zzso active zzso alpha zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso diseased strains were suppressed completely by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso although energy zzso were unaffected by zzso disease and zzso expression zzso zzso with the role of zzso in energy zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were reduced by zzso zzso zzso and increased by zzso zzso but they were near normal in zzso diseased zzso We also found that zzso a pharmacological zzso zzso in zzso cells, mimics zzso disease in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso cells were resistant to this zzso The results show that diverse zzso in zzso zzso disease are caused by chronic zzso signaling not by insufficient zzso
