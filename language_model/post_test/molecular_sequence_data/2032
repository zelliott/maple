Two adjacent genes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso iron sulfur protein and zzso b and zzso characteristic constituents of the respiratory complex zzso zzso zzso is a single gene of which the zzso half codes for zzso b and the 3' half codes for zzso zzso Experimental evidence suggests that a large zzso precursor is zzso processed into the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso grow zzso but are unable to fix nitrogen in root zzso zzso with zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso makes use of a zzso zzso respiratory chain on its way to become a zzso zzso whereas under zzso zzso can occur by a zzso zzso
