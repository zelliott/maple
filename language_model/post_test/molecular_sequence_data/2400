To investigate the role of sequences lying downstream of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso deletions or zzso were constructed in zzso signals from zzso virus 40 and zzso and their effects were zzso in both crude and zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso As expected, these sequences influenced the efficiency of both zzso and zzso as well as the accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso near or upstream of the actual site of zzso addition appeared to specify a unique zzso site, since their deletion resulted, in some cases, in zzso zzso Furthermore, the sequences that allowed the zzso virus 40 late zzso to be zzso zzso by partially zzso zzso activity were also those at the zzso site zzso Interestingly, sequences downstream of the zzso site zzso with factors not directly involved in catalyzing zzso and zzso since the effects of deletions were substantially diminished when partially zzso components were used in zzso In addition, these sequences contained elements that could affect zzso formation both positively and zzso
