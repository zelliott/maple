Previous studies have demonstrated that addition of zzso at the penultimate zzso zzso of zzso results in filaments with diminished mechanical zzso In the present work zzso introducing a zzso charged zzso and zzso or a neutral zzso zzso acid at position 374 of the human zzso and zzso at the zzso with the flag zzso were studied by transient zzso into zzso human zzso and zzso kidney zzso zzso revealed that zzso which incorporated zzso charged zzso were partially to severely zzso when compared to the almost zzso zzso filaments or the wild type zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso containing either zzso charged zzso were more sensitive to the zzso action of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso a considerable reduction of zzso content in the zzso zzso fraction for cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso compared to wild type zzso These results demonstrate that zzso charged zzso acid zzso at the exposed zzso tail strongly affect zzso zzso organization and dynamics in zzso
