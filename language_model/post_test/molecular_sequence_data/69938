A highly sensitive in zzso zzso procedure was established using zzso zzso that were prepared by the zzso chain reaction zzso By using 12 sets of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was amplified with labeled zzso in individual zzso Then the 12 zzso zzso size, 120 base zzso were mixed and zzso with cultured and zzso zzso cells, which contain two copies of zzso zzso per zzso The strength of the signals was much stronger as compared with zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso magnified the sensitivity for detecting low copy numbers of virus zzso by in zzso zzso and that this technique has the potential for investigating zzso virus infection in other clinical zzso
