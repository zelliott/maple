Using methods of parallel zzso the complete zzso acid sequence of an zzso 1 zzso zzso 10, an zzso zzso zzso zzso was made in the form of a set of 100 synthetic overlapping zzso This set of immobilized peptides was allowed to react with the zzso zzso zzso 10, a highly zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso A dominant zzso zzso zzso was thus zzso which zzso mainly to the zzso region from the zzso domain of the zzso 10 zzso A synthetic zzso replica of this zzso was found to bind to zzso 10 with an affinity zzso in the zzso M range, as measured using zzso zzso which represents a significant part of the affinity of the complete zzso 10 zzso zzso in the zzso M zzso The synthetic zzso also zzso zzso zzso in rabbits that recognized specifically the zzso zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was further characterized chemically by the identification of zzso important for binding to the zzso and by zzso of its zzso Our approach makes it readily possible to map and characterize functional, zzso zzso that could be further used to manipulate the immune response by zzso zzso
