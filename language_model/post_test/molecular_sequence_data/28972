The three human zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed by zzso zzso All three proteins have broad spectrum zzso activity, with zzso consistently being the most zzso Additionally, zzso has significant zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso at zzso salt zzso We have compared the zzso state of the three zzso using zzso diffusion zzso dynamic and zzso light zzso and analysis of the migration of the three zzso on a native zzso All three techniques are in agreement, suggesting that zzso is a zzso while zzso and zzso are zzso zzso the zzso solution structures of zzso and zzso were determined using standard zzso techniques and compared with the previously determined solution structure of zzso Both zzso and zzso form well defined structures with backbone root mean square zzso of zzso and zzso A, zzso The zzso structures of all three zzso are similar, with a short zzso segment preceding a zzso zzso zzso The surface charge density of each of the zzso is markedly different, with the surface of zzso significantly more zzso Analysis of the zzso data and structures led us to suggest that zzso forms a symmetrical zzso through strand zzso of the zzso The increased zzso activity of zzso may be explained by the capacity of the protein to form zzso in solution at low zzso an zzso zzso structure, and the increased positive surface charge compared with zzso and zzso
