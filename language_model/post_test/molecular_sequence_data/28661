zzso zzso for several diseases, including zzso zzso mental zzso and short zzso have been mapped to zzso In spite of the recent publications of two draft sequences for the human zzso this region seems to be largely zzso and zzso Here we report an integrated physical and transcript map of approximately zzso from zzso to zzso Using sequence zzso site zzso mapping and zzso walking, we assembled a zzso clone zzso of 54 zzso and one zzso with an estimated zzso coverage of this zzso The minimum zzso path consists of 23 zzso and one zzso zzso this zzso we mapped 30 new zzso derived from the unique zzso of the zzso three expressed sequence zzso five zzso and seven zzso zzso This integrated map provides a unique resource for the zzso cloning of candidate disease genes mapping to zzso and is therefore of value for the completion of the zzso sequence of this zzso
