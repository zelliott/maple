The influence of the zzso pattern of zzso A on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested in different zzso systems with synthetic zzso A zzso Both the number and type of fatty acids had an impact on the zzso amounts needed for optimal zzso of sheep red blood cells, on the zzso capacity of compounds and on the zzso zzso amounts in zzso zzso and dot zzso zzso zzso obtained with two zzso zzso indicated that the location of fatty acids is of no zzso Although all zzso used recognized zzso residing in the zzso backbone of zzso A, their zzso were greatly influenced by the number as well as the type of zzso chains zzso In the various zzso the zzso reacted either similarly or zzso suggesting that zzso are exposed differently in the test zzso We conclude that for the determination of the zzso of zzso A zzso it is useful and sometimes necessary to run various zzso in parallel and to compare zzso on the basis of reaction zzso
