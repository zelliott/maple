The present review on zzso zzso focuses mainly on the possible zzso role of zzso with special emphasis on its behavior in pathological zzso From these data at least three ways to regulate zzso activity zzso zzso zzso activity changes during zzso being high at certain stages of development and showing zzso activity values at zzso zzso zzso activity can be enhanced in zzso by treatment of tissue culture cells with various growth factors and serum and zzso zzso activity is zzso enhanced in rapidly zzso zzso The regulated zzso activity changes during zzso cannot be explained as zzso In the case of the zzso high expression of zzso in tumors, genetic changes may be responsible, zzso through zzso of the regulatory genetic elements and/or regulation by specific zzso zzso In the case of serum zzso no genetic changes are necessarily zzso the observed changes may be entirely due to a signal zzso zzso where zzso could be zzso by another zzso zzso zzso from various organisms have been isolated and zzso From the deduced zzso acid sequence it turns out that zzso zzso are highly zzso during zzso The relationship between zzso alpha from humans and plants is still zzso Similar relationships are reported for the zzso zzso assignment of zzso alpha shows two gene zzso one of which is a zzso They are located on different zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso coli and the zzso expression system is zzso The zzso zzso can zzso to a functional zzso in zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso suggests it to be zzso in association with the zzso zzso zzso stability, zzso zzso specificity and zzso zzso zzso The question where zzso and its zzso are located throughout the cell cycle has also been zzso mainly because of the large discrepancies that still exist between results obtained by different zzso zzso expression of zzso at the zzso and at the protein level has also been given zzso The fact that the zzso activity is surprisingly high in brain and low in heart and lung may be indicative of involvement of zzso in processes other than zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
