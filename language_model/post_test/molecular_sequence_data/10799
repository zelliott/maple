The zzso properties of the zzso major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso zzso were investigated using a zzso hybrid zzso composed of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso of zzso and the alpha 3 domain of zzso This allowed the use of a zzso zzso directed against zzso whilst retaining the zzso groove of zzso By comparison with classical zzso class I zzso zzso maturation of the zzso zzso was inefficient with weak zzso association with beta zzso However, at the cell surface the hybrid molecules were zzso associated with beta zzso and were recognized by zzso T zzso zzso clones specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso binding zzso was used to determine which zzso of zzso were important for binding to zzso and zzso clones served to identify zzso important for T cell zzso zzso at position 1 and 5 did not reduce the efficiency of binding and had little effect on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso at position 9 resulted in loss of zzso class I zzso Mass zzso analysis of peptides zzso from zzso zzso molecules indicated that zzso was the dominant zzso The closely related zzso zzso which is derived from the signal sequence of zzso was also present, although it was considerably less zzso The mass profile suggested the presence of additional peptides the majority of which consisted of eight to ten zzso acid zzso Finally, the finding that a zzso derived from zzso zzso can bind raises the possibility that this zzso zzso class I zzso may play a role in the presentation of peptides of zzso
