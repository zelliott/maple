zzso radiation is a zzso factor in various diseases, zzso zzso zzso disorders such as lupus zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso are discussed as zzso agents in lupus zzso zzso we investigated the influence of ultraviolet zzso on expression of human zzso zzso sequences and human zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso of cellular genes using human zzso zzso as a model zzso First, zzso sequences of zzso zzso pol genes were amplified from cellular zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction products were zzso in a reverse dot zzso zzso zzso to a representative number of distinct cloned human zzso zzso pol zzso Using this method, we could show that zzso with 30 zzso per zzso ultraviolet B activates zzso of various zzso zzso pol sequences in primary zzso zzso as well as in a spontaneously immortalized zzso cell line zzso Interestingly, some of these sequences were found to be closely related to pol sequences of human zzso zzso sequences which have been shown to be expressed in zzso zzso Analysis of human zzso zzso pol expression in zzso using skin zzso of lupus zzso patients revealed similar zzso zzso In a second approach, ultraviolet zzso induced zzso transcripts were isolated which are initiated by human zzso zzso promoters and proceed into cellular sequences using a newly established modified differential display zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso of human zzso zzso sequence zzso by ultraviolet B may contribute to the zzso of lupus zzso where inappropriate zzso presentation of ultraviolet zzso viral and cellular proteins could stimulate zzso zzso
