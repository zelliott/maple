The zzso zzso and zzso injury is caused by the zzso of coronary circulation in zzso zzso zzso A number of experiments demonstrate that zzso response such as adherence of zzso to zzso cells play a critical role in zzso zzso In this paper, the effect of global zzso and zzso on the expression of zzso genes by zzso zzso as well as cell zzso molecules by zzso were studied by using zzso zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso response in 25 zzso global zzso at zzso degrees C followed by 60 zzso zzso were studied in isolated rat heart zzso with blood supplied from support rat zzso zzso zzso functions were measured with a left zzso zzso The mean zzso reduction of the left zzso zzso pressure were zzso zzso zzso of zzso level in the control zzso group and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso flow zzso showed that zzso and zzso injury did not affect the expression of zzso molecules on zzso which were isolated from zzso blood zzso zzso gene expression was analyzed by direct analysis of zzso obtained from the zzso isolated rat zzso The level of expression of the zzso genes was assessed using zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in normal heart tissue at low level and were zzso following zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not expressed at zzso level in normal heart but were induced following global zzso zzso alpha was not expressed at zzso level in normal heart but was induced following zzso of the zzso zzso zzso examination of zzso tissue from the zzso group revealed no evidence of zzso zzso Only a mild zzso zzso as well as weak focal zzso was detected after zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that there is a process which causes early stage of zzso zzso dysfunction without involving zzso necrosis nor zzso of inflammatory zzso
