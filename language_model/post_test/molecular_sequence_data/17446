The ABC model of flower organ identity is widely recognized as providing a framework for understanding the zzso of flower zzso in diverse plant zzso Recent studies in zzso zzso have shown that three closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required to specify zzso zzso and zzso because these zzso are converted into zzso in zzso zzso zzso triple zzso Additional studies indicate that the zzso proteins form zzso complexes with the products of the B and C organ identity zzso Here, we characterize the zzso zzso which shares extensive sequence similarity to and an overlapping expression pattern with the other zzso zzso Although zzso single zzso display a zzso similar to that of zzso plants, we find that floral zzso are converted into zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso quadruple zzso indicating the involvement of all four zzso genes in the development of zzso We also find that zzso contributes to the development of zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso and that it plays an important role in zzso zzso These and other data demonstrate that the zzso genes play central roles in flower zzso identity and organ zzso
