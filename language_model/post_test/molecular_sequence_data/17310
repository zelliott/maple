Red fluorescent proteins zzso combined with zzso are attractive zzso for zzso labeling of proteins in live zzso However, the application of these proteins is restrained by stable zzso formation and by their weak zzso in zzso Previous attempts to eliminate these problems by zzso of zzso from zzso zzso resulted in the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso which is distinguished by its enhanced zzso in zzso Based on these zzso we have generated an enhanced zzso zzso zzso and report its spectral zzso Together with green fluorescent labels, we used zzso to zzso zzso zzso structures and zzso in zzso zzso This enhanced zzso proved to be suitable to monitor the dynamics of zzso proteins in cell zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso
