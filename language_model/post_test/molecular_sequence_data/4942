zzso zzso patterns of zzso can vary among individuals and are subject to dynamic changes during zzso In order to gain a better understanding of this variation, we have analyzed patterns of zzso zzso within a 200 zzso region at the zzso island of the human zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso is normally zzso during zzso of the X zzso in females and it is also zzso and zzso upon expansion of zzso repeats in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were determined by the sequencing of zzso zzso from normal males and females and zzso from a family of five brothers who are zzso mosaics and are affected to various degrees by the zzso zzso Our data indicate that: zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso is zzso variable in zzso zzso obtained from a single individual, suggesting that maintenance of zzso zzso is a dynamic process; zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the region studied may occur but is zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the analyzed zzso males is remarkably similar to that found for the active X and inactive X zzso in normal zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of some zzso males reflects similar on and off states of zzso expression that exist in normal zzso zzso zzso is slightly more pronounced on zzso zzso than on normal inactive X zzso of zzso zzso the general zzso of zzso and zzso zzso persisted over the 5 year period that separated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was most pronounced at a consensus binding sequence for the zzso zzso factor, a sequence that may play a role in regulating expression of zzso
