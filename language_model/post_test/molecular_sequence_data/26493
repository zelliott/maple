zzso zzso are important scaffolds in the zzso search of zzso for molecular zzso The structural zzso of a zzso scaffold are the critical zzso determining the formation of the native zzso zzso and thus should remain unchanged in the zzso libraries so as to allow a large portion of the library sequences to be compatible with the scaffold zzso A zzso molecular evolution procedure has been developed to select and screen for the zzso sequences folding into a specific zzso zzso zzso of sequence preference that emerge from the zzso sequence profiles provide structural zzso information, which zzso the designs of zzso libraries for zzso approaches as in zzso zzso This methodology enables artificial zzso proteins to be engineered with enhanced folding and binding zzso
