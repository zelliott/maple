zzso zzso of the spike protein may be recognized by zzso zzso against severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso coronavirus zzso A protein zzso zzso containing predicted zzso of the spike protein was expressed in zzso zzso The properly zzso protein zzso specifically bound to the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against this zzso recognized the native spike protein of SARS zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso were capable of blocking zzso attachment to zzso cells and exhibited in zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso mapped to zzso in two zzso each zzso 20 zzso zzso Thus, this region of the spike protein might be a target for generation of therapeutic zzso zzso against SARS zzso and for vaccine development to elicit protective zzso zzso
