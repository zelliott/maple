The zzso sequences for adult specimens of zzso zzso from the common zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso monkey were zzso For both species, the length and zzso content of the zzso sequences were 216 zzso and zzso zzso While there was no unequivocal sequence difference among individual worms representing each of the two species, five zzso zzso zzso differences were zzso These differences were associated with the presence of unique restriction sites in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso for multiple zzso of diagnostic value for the differentiation of the two zzso by restriction zzso zzso comparisons of the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with published zzso sequences for five different zzso indicated that these species from the zzso zzso are closely zzso in accordance with previous zzso zzso
