The construction and screening of zzso libraries constitute a valuable resource for obtaining novel zzso In this work, we present the construction of a zzso library in zzso coli using zzso and microbial DNA directly isolated from forest zzso and screened for zzso zzso The library consisted of zzso clones with an average DNA insert size of 35 zzso Eight unique zzso active clones were obtained from the zzso library on the basis of zzso zzso zzso secondary libraries in a zzso zzso were generated to select zzso zzso and to characterize the individual genes responsible for the zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of six genes revealed that the zzso zzso by the zzso genes for zzso activity were novel with zzso similarity to known zzso They had zzso sequences similar to those in the zzso zzso zzso Based on their deduced zzso acid zzso the six genes zzso zzso zzso were further divided into three subgroups, the identities among which ranged from zzso to zzso The six predicted gene products were successfully expressed in zzso coli and zzso into the culture zzso Most of the zzso zzso showed a zzso activity for zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso
