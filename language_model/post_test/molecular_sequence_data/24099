Due to their involvement in many pathological conditions, zzso zzso zzso are very attractive therapeutic zzso Our study focuses on one of them, zzso which is involved in tumor progression and zzso Recently, the solution structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso with a zzso acid inhibitor zzso was published by zzso et zzso Using the zzso group published binding affinity data and the structure published by zzso as a basis, we have built a binding affinity model by targeting the zzso pocket of the zzso with a set of nine zzso zzso acid zzso Two binding zzso of each zzso have been generated corresponding to two binding modes zzso A and B, respectively, of which the first one is targeting the zzso pocket and the second one the zzso zzso For the binding affinity model developed for mode A the zzso activities show a zzso of zzso zzso as compared with the experimental data, and a correlation zzso zzso of zzso while in the case of the binding mode B a zzso of zzso zzso and correlation zzso zzso of zzso respectively, were zzso In conclusion, our data suggest a higher probability for the zzso gated zzso open form pocket to accommodate the zzso alpha versus the wide zzso exposed zzso zzso probability which some research groups could have overlooked due to extensive use in their calculations of non revealing zzso pocket open state zzso structures instead of zzso zzso
