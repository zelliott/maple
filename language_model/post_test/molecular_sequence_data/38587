zzso is a rare but recurring zzso found in a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso share clinical features with chronic zzso leukemia and are further characterized by zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso cloning of zzso revealed juxtaposition of the zzso to the zzso heavy chain gene zzso although zzso on both genes were zzso The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, which is expressed throughout the process of zzso development except in terminally differentiated plasma zzso zzso consistently leaves the zzso coding region intact, most likely resulting in zzso expression of the gene product due to the proximity of zzso The majority cases of zzso tumors expressed considerable levels of zzso irrespective of whether they exhibited zzso suggesting that quantitative differences in expression level alone may not account for the development of this particular zzso of zzso
