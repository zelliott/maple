The molecular genetic basis of the P zzso group system has eluded characterization despite extensive studies of the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The main controversy has been whether a single or two distinct zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of the structurally related zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is linked to zzso Data base searches with the coding region of an zzso identified a novel zzso gene at zzso designated zzso zzso of full coding zzso of zzso in insect cells revealed it zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis showed expression of the transcript zzso with zzso zzso activity and zzso expression in human B cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso resulted in strong zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in six Swedish individuals of the rare p zzso confirming that zzso represented the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the coding region of zzso in zzso individuals did not reveal zzso zzso with zzso zzso
