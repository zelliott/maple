We determined the ratio of zzso acid zzso to zzso acid zzso in zzso respiratory zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso and examined the binding specificity of zzso influenza virus strains for zzso containing different molecular species of zzso acid zzso and zzso and for bovine zzso zzso 2 zzso containing zzso as its predominate zzso acid zzso of total zzso zzso The presence of zzso which had not been detected in human zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was observed in a zzso zzso The zzso influenza virus zzso and zzso zzso tested, except for zzso zzso displayed a marked binding ability for zzso chains containing zzso compared with that of the human influenza virus zzso These results suggest that zzso influenza viruses recognize zzso chains containing the molecular species of zzso acid present predominantly in the zzso zzso zzso
