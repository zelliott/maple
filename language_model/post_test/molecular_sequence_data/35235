Plants respond to zzso stress and tolerate zzso status through complex zzso and cellular zzso Many genes are induced by water zzso zzso acid zzso plays important roles in tolerance to zzso stress by inducing many stress zzso zzso is zzso de zzso in response to zzso Most of the genes involved in zzso zzso have been identified, and they are expressed mainly in leaf vascular zzso Of the products of such zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in zzso zzso One of the five zzso genes in zzso zzso is significantly induced by zzso To understand the regulatory mechanism of the early stages of the zzso stress response, it is important to zzso the zzso regulatory systems of zzso In the present study, we found that an overlapping zzso recognition sequence zzso at zzso zzso from the zzso start site of zzso is an important zzso element in the induction of the zzso zzso We discuss the possible zzso regulatory system of zzso zzso zzso and how this may control the level of zzso under zzso zzso
