Although in the cow the genetic resistance to zzso has been previously attributed to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso none of the zzso described to date seems to be the zzso To be able to associate another zzso of the gene to zzso resistance, we characterized the gene and identified in different breeds of zzso zzso and zzso zzso six new zzso among a total of 11 single zzso zzso of which five occurred in the coding sequence (three are zzso zzso one in the promoter region and five in zzso The zzso and zzso zzso calculated revealed differences zzso zzso zzso among the breeds zzso
