zzso is a tumor zzso whose expression is altered in human liver, zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso Mice lacking zzso spontaneously developed zzso zzso zzso and other tumors at a higher zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene were identified in human zzso tissue zzso which resulted in instability or abnormal cellular distribution of zzso protein in zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso are able to promote cell growth and invasion and inhibit zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso negative for zzso zzso Moreover, one of the zzso zzso can dramatically accelerate tumor formation in zzso zzso Analysis of gene expression in zzso cells, zzso expressing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso can alter expression of genes involved in the regulation of zzso This includes zzso of expression of zzso and zzso and zzso of expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with small interfering zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso resulted in a profound reduction in cell zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso zzso in the zzso gene may abolish its native zzso activity and gain zzso activities partially through zzso of zzso thereby zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso
