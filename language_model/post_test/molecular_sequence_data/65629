We have developed a molecular method using zzso sequencing to identify the zzso 3rd juvenile stage of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso that can accidentally zzso humans and cause zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso end of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is a suitable marker to identify zzso zzso and distinguish it from other closely related zzso zzso When the zzso zzso marker was employed on zzso populations extracted from the black zzso zzso zzso collected in 2 test sites in the Philippines, the zzso 3rd juvenile stage zzso zzso was detected without zzso The zzso position of other zzso zzso isolated was also zzso The molecular technique developed in this study provides a rapid and accurate method for the identification of zzso zzso when zzso identification proves difficult or zzso
