A bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from forest soil collected in the zzso zzso zzso Province, zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter and zzso zzso in zzso strictly zzso and zzso zzso produced on zzso zzso plates were zzso smooth, circular and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the major respiratory zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major cellular fatty zzso The zzso zzso type was based on zzso acid and the zzso type of the zzso acid was zzso zzso zzso and six unknown zzso were the major polar zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso was zzso related to members of the zzso zzso with sequence similarities ranging from zzso The zzso zzso values of strain zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Based on these results, it is concluded that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
