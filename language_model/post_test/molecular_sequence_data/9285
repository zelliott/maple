zzso development and zzso play crucial roles in zzso zzso Here we identified a rice zzso zzso zzso AND zzso 1 zzso which controls the early stages of that zzso This gene encodes for an zzso zzso zzso membrane protein that is present only in zzso Our zzso zzso zzso gave rise to abnormal zzso zzso Cellular zzso especially the zzso were zzso which led to hampered differentiation and zzso of the zzso In addition, the development of zzso mother cells was arrested at the early stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso transcripts were most abundant in zzso cells at stages 6 and 7, and moderately in the zzso mother cells and zzso zzso of zzso which functions in zzso development during early zzso were reduced in zzso zzso as were those of zzso which is involved in zzso pairing and zzso during zzso However, expression of zzso and zzso which function in zzso wall zzso and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the zzso zzso Moreover, transcripts of zzso were reduced in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso These results, together with their zzso zzso suggest that zzso plays important roles in the zzso membrane during early zzso development, functioning after zzso and before zzso and also in zzso development, after zzso and before zzso
