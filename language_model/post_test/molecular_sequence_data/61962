zzso are proteins specific to zzso zzso zzso have several important roles in zzso zzso for example, zzso formation of protective surface zzso and the reduction of the surface tension of water, which allows growth of aerial zzso zzso show remarkable zzso properties, for example, they are the most powerful zzso proteins zzso To this point the molecular basis of the function of this group of proteins has been largely zzso We have now determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso has a novel, compact single domain structure containing one zzso and four zzso zzso that completely zzso two zzso zzso The protein surface is mainly zzso but two zzso zzso contain several zzso zzso side chains that form a flat zzso patch that makes the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is expected to be a source for surface activity, and we suggest that the behavior of this zzso is greatly enhanced by the zzso that is favored by the combination of size and zzso This mechanism of function is supported by atomic force zzso that show highly ordered zzso of zzso at the air water zzso The data presented show that much of the current views on structure function relations in zzso must be zzso
