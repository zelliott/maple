Recent studies indicate that some zzso zzso zzso bind zzso to zzso containing the repeating zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso or zzso zzso zzso We report here our investigation on the distribution of these sequences in zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and the interaction of zzso containing zzso chains with an immobilized zzso zzso zzso from calf heart zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso chains are carried by a few high molecular weight zzso which are bound by zzso zzso and one of these was zzso by zzso to zzso (a zzso membrane zzso More importantly, these high molecular weight zzso including zzso were bound with high affinity by zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso are highly specific in their interactions with zzso and that zzso carry important recognition sequences for these zzso
