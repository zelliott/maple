zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mass zzso from bacterial cells have been associated with four known zzso The zzso observed both from cells and in filtered cellular suspensions, were isolated by zzso and identified on the basis of their mass zzso and their partial zzso acid zzso determined using the zzso method zzso zzso The acid resistance proteins zzso and zzso give rise to zzso near zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso mass zzso from cells and from extracts of both zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the proteins associated with zzso zzso by the zzso zzso rather than the precursor zzso were observed, both using cells and from cellular zzso A zzso zzso zzso was associated with the zzso near zzso zzso from zzso zzso Similarly, a zzso zzso zzso was identified as the source of the zzso near zzso zzso in zzso zzso This last protein was zzso with a known zzso from zzso zzso While these experiments involved the detection of known or zzso proteins from typical bacteria, this same approach could also be applied to the detection of unique proteins or zzso proteins associated with other bacteria of public health zzso
