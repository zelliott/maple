zzso is a B zzso member of the zzso zzso that serves as an zzso zzso expressed by mature B zzso In this study, the ability of different cell types to attach to zzso cells zzso zzso with a full-length zzso zzso zzso was examined to determine the cellular distribution of the zzso for zzso T and B zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed specific zzso with zzso cells at 4 degrees zzso A panel of 33 new zzso directed against zzso were developed to examine the regions of zzso that mediate zzso Four of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (at 1 to 5 zzso specifically blocked zzso (75 to zzso of all cell types to zzso zzso Each of these zzso zzso each other's zzso suggesting that zzso binding occurs through a single region of zzso These zzso also identify a region of zzso distinct from those defined by previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell lines to zzso cells was independent of zzso and zzso zzso and it was not inhibited by zzso against known zzso Although zzso zzso acid expressed on the surface of zzso cells did not serve as a zzso for zzso the zzso zzso may contain a critical zzso acid zzso as zzso treatment of all target cells eliminated zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso independent, again suggesting that zzso were not zzso An zzso substance for zzso zzso was found to be present in zzso and some zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and protein revealed that although multiple zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be zzso only a single protein zzso was detected on the cell zzso zzso although the identity of the zzso zzso remains incompletely zzso it is possible that a single major zzso is expressed by zzso and zzso which binds to a single region of zzso
