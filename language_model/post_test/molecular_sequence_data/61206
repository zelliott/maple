We took 28 fragments of DNA whose crystal structures were known and used CD zzso to search for conditions zzso the crystal structures in zzso All 28 fragments switched into their crystal structures in zzso zzso zzso zzso to indicate that the zzso affected the zzso of DNA like the concentrated zzso The fragments zzso in the zzso also underwent cooperative zzso changes that took place within the wide family of zzso structures, suggesting that the zzso and crystal zzso differed as zzso zzso and zzso or calcium zzso which were contained in the zzso zzso promoted or suppressed the zzso changes of several fragments to indicate that the zzso agents can decide which of the possible structures is adopted by the DNA zzso in the zzso
