The question of whether zzso C virus zzso zzso is translated by a mechanism of internal zzso entry has been examined by testing whether zzso of zzso sequences between the two zzso of a zzso zzso promotes translation of the downstream zzso in rabbit zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that efficient internal initiation required a segment of the zzso zzso extending from about zzso zzso and that deletions from the zzso of this element were highly zzso As the authentic initiation zzso for zzso zzso synthesis is at zzso zzso this demonstrates that, besides zzso zzso a short length of zzso coding sequences is required for internal zzso This finding was confirmed in zzso zzso of zzso cells and was shown to be independent of the nature of the downstream reporter zzso The strong requirement for coding sequences is in sharp contrast to internal initiation of zzso zzso zzso As a probable correlate with this, it was also found that the efficiency of internal initiation was only marginally compromised when the authentic initiation zzso was zzso to a zzso zzso again in sharp contrast with the zzso The finding that coding sequences are required for internal initiation has important implications for the design of experiments to test for internal initiation of translation of cellular zzso
