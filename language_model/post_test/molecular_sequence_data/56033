zzso analysis and zzso cloning of zzso zzso zzso were undertaken to expand the understanding of the relationships of structure, function and molecular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso acid sequencing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso showed that the mature proteins are identical in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in size and preceded by a zzso signal zzso Their likely identity to zzso from zzso zzso is zzso zzso has an zzso zzso zzso extension blocked with a zzso zzso which is absent in other zzso zzso The presence of zzso formed by zzso of zzso and the finding of a minor fraction of a zzso form lacking the zzso zzso indicate that signal zzso zzso is followed by further zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical in zzso sequence to 11 zzso zzso from four zzso species, and zzso identical to the two known zzso Like these zzso zzso zzso zzso has an additional segment of approximately 40 zzso at the zzso which is absent in plant zzso Although zzso is much more similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso specific activity and pH optimum than to zzso zzso zzso the sequences of zzso and zzso C showed only zzso zzso zzso zzso qualifies as the first member of a new family of zzso zzso The nine zzso zzso present in all plant, zzso and bacterial zzso zzso are also found in zzso The present data support the hypothesis that only one zzso zzso gene zzso In contrast, a large number of zzso plant and zzso zzso are expressed from several zzso gene zzso zzso of three batches of zzso protein and of 49 zzso clones revealed the existence of only two highly similar zzso indicating less zzso zzso in zzso zzso strains than observed in plants and zzso zzso
