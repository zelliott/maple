Peanut zzso is one of the most severe food zzso One effort to alleviate this problem is to identify peanut zzso with lower levels of zzso which could be used in conventional breeding to produce a less zzso peanut zzso In this study, we identified one peanut line, zzso lacking several seed zzso which were identified as zzso h 3 zzso by zzso sequencing and named zzso h zzso Total seed proteins were analyzed by one-dimensional zzso and two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso The total protein extracts were also tested for levels of zzso end products or zzso such as advanced zzso end products zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Peanut zzso of zzso and zzso exhibited significantly lower levels of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso This potential peanut zzso zzso h 3 was confirmed by zzso sequences and Western zzso analysis using specific zzso h 1, zzso h 2, and zzso h 3 zzso A full-length sequence of zzso h 3 zzso number zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso h 3 zzso has the first three of four zzso zzso of zzso h zzso zzso h 3 zzso reacted with two groups of protein zzso one with strong reactions and another with weak zzso These zzso spots with weak reaction on zzso PAGE to zzso h 3 zzso are zzso or zzso of this potential peanut zzso zzso h zzso A recent study suggested that zzso h 3 basic zzso may be more significant zzso than the zzso zzso
