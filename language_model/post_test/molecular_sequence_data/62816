zzso zzso zzso of the cell wall zzso zzso zzso II zzso is required for the growth and development of zzso and zzso Here, we report that the amounts of zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso primary walls of members of the most primitive extant vascular plant groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso are comparable with the amounts of zzso in the primary walls of zzso By contrast, the zzso generation of members of the avascular zzso zzso zzso and zzso have primary walls that contain small amounts zzso zzso of the amounts of zzso present in zzso zzso of an zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is zzso in vascular plants, but these zzso are not identical because the zzso zzso zzso present on the zzso zzso side chain of zzso of all previously studied plants is replaced by a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data indicate that the amount of zzso incorporated into the walls of plants increased during the evolution of vascular plants from their zzso zzso Thus, the acquisition of a zzso growth habit may be correlated with the ability of vascular plants to maintain upright growth and to form zzso secondary zzso The zzso structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that the genes and proteins responsible for the zzso of this zzso appeared early in land plant evolution and that zzso has a fundamental role in wall zzso
