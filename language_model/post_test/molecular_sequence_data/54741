The zzso c zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso to zzso through a six electron reduction zzso that is of major zzso significance to the zzso metabolism of enteric and zzso reducing zzso zzso receives electrons from the zzso zzso zzso donor zzso This requires that zzso complexes form between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The formation of these complexes can be monitored using a range of zzso for studying zzso zzso including dynamic light zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and visible zzso These methods have been used to show that oxidized zzso exists in dynamic zzso equilibrium with a zzso zzso zzso of 4 zzso zzso the zzso and zzso forms of zzso are equally active for either the six electron reduction of zzso or zzso When mixed together, zzso and zzso exist in equilibrium with zzso which is described by a zzso of zzso Thus, since zzso and zzso are present in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso it is likely that zzso remains tightly associated with its zzso zzso partner under zzso zzso
