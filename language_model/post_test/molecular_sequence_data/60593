To examine the role of the zzso N zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso calcium channel zzso zzso we have pursued two routes of zzso First, we made zzso channels between zzso and zzso the latter not being modulated by zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with accessory zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of expressed zzso zzso was induced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors with zzso in zzso or by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso For the zzso channels, only those with the N zzso of zzso showed any zzso zzso further addition of the first zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the degree of zzso To determine the zzso acids within the zzso N zzso essential for zzso zzso we made zzso of this sequence and identified three zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso within an 11 zzso acid sequence as being critical for zzso zzso with zzso being involved to a lesser zzso This sequence may comprise an essential part of a complex zzso zzso site or be involved in its subsequent zzso
