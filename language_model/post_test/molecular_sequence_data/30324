The expression of transforming growth factor beta type 1 zzso was increased by conditional expression of zzso A zzso sequence found approximately zzso base pairs upstream of the gene zzso human transforming growth factor beta 1 acted as a zzso zzso element in transient zzso zzso The human sequence contains the element zzso that also is found in a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of nuclear factors present in cells zzso transformed by zzso indicated that both human and zzso sequences were recognized by the same nuclear zzso The role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso using zzso elements that contained either zzso or zzso These experiments showed that while both elements are activated by zzso expression to nearly the same event, only the former element responded to zzso In addition, zzso of reporters containing zzso is zzso higher by zzso than by zzso zzso retention experiments revealed that the nuclear factor present in cells transformed by zzso exhibited the same sequence preference as demonstrated in the transient zzso zzso zzso experiments identify a protein of apparent molecular mass 120 zzso that recognizes the zzso zzso This work identifies a persistent signal zzso zzso that links zzso to nuclear zzso and indicates that a zzso protein is a target of this zzso
