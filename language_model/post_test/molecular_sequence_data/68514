zzso protein zzso I zzso zzso I) was previously zzso from bovine brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on its ability to zzso the synaptic zzso zzso zzso I at site zzso The zzso for this protein zzso has now been cloned from both a rat and a bovine brain zzso library and the complete zzso acid sequence of rat zzso zzso I zzso The rat zzso zzso a protein of 331 zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso was expressed in bacteria as a zzso zzso fusion zzso The resulting fusion protein was zzso by zzso affinity zzso and shown to be totally dependent on zzso and zzso for zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso I at the same site zzso 1) as the zzso brain zzso zzso zzso I is zzso to other known protein zzso and contains all nine zzso zzso acids zzso in the zzso domain of this class of zzso zzso zzso I was most identical to zzso zzso II both in the zzso domain and in a short region at the zzso that is predicted to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso I appeared to be zzso by a single zzso zzso protection zzso detected the zzso zzso zzso zzso I in all zzso zzso High zzso of the zzso zzso were found in all regions of the brain with frontal zzso showing the greatest zzso zzso zzso I was zzso in a zzso manner at a zzso zzso zzso which is located at a position equivalent to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso
