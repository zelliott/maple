Genes of the zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso and zzso zzso influence gene expression by modulating zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso initiated in early zzso is maintained by a balance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we identify a novel zzso family member, zzso zzso on the basis of the following criteria: zzso zzso zzso zzso act as genetic zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso and zzso they enhance the zzso effects of zzso in the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, reduced zzso activity can mimic zzso zzso zzso as is often the case for zzso zzso zzso encodes two closely related zzso protein zzso zzso derived from broadly expressed alternative zzso zzso and zzso rescue experiments indicate that the zzso proteins are functionally zzso The zzso proteins share zzso zzso motifs with several recently characterized zzso nuclear zzso including the zzso zzso regulator zzso the related protein zzso and zzso a partner of replication protein zzso These data raise the possibility that zzso play a role in zzso zzso structure with cell cycle zzso
