To isolate genes specifically expressed at the initiation of plant zzso development we have applied a sensitive zzso zzso technique for three zzso wheat lines of the so-called zzso zzso with either zzso or autonomous zzso zzso Here we present a gene sequence showing a high zzso to grass zzso zzso of type zzso thought to be expressed in zzso tissue zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso designated zzso a III, is also expressed in zzso of the zzso male fertile wheat line zzso whereas the two zzso and male sterile wheat lines zzso and zzso completely lack any zzso a III zzso Our data suggest a positive correlation between the expression of this clone and the manifestation of male zzso Northern and in zzso zzso analysis revealed that, in addition to its presence in zzso zzso a III is expressed in the zzso tissue of zzso zzso exclusively at the day of zzso This precise zzso and spatial expression pattern suggests a more general function of the zzso zzso sequence zzso a III not limited to the exhibition of zzso in zzso zzso
