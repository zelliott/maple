The zzso zzso and zzso control, zzso and zzso many zzso and behavioral processes in zzso zzso possess only small amounts of both zzso and thus, zzso and zzso together with other zzso zzso are referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso evoke cellular responses by zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a complementary DNA zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso from the American zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares high sequence similarity to members of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells, and its zzso response has been zzso zzso zzso with zzso reduces zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner zzso approximately 350 zzso The zzso effect of zzso is abolished by zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso expression has been investigated by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso The zzso is present in various zzso including brain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and leg zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells has been investigated by zzso recordings, which have revealed zzso zzso actions of zzso This study marks the first comprehensive zzso zzso and functional characterization of a zzso zzso in the zzso
