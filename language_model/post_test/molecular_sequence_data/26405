zzso processing of zzso precursors at pairs of basic zzso acids is a prerequisite for the generation of zzso zzso zzso While the zzso zzso responsible for these zzso are yet to be identified, this function has been unequivocally assigned in zzso to the product of the zzso zzso To study the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso processing, we have zzso the zzso zzso gene into mouse zzso zzso zzso and established a new cell line (called zzso where the zzso zzso is permanently zzso zzso studies show that the zzso zzso is retained within the zzso of the zzso zzso The evidence for this cellular location is supported by measurement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this permanently zzso cell line, zzso activity is exclusively zzso in contrast to the situation previously described in zzso infected cell lines, where zzso zzso activity was zzso Furthermore, infection of zzso cells with a zzso zzso expressing a zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso resulted in the synthesis of zzso and its efficient processing into zzso and zzso two of its zzso authentic maturation zzso These results suggest that in the zzso cell line zzso zzso processing of zzso by zzso zzso occurs in the zzso zzso
