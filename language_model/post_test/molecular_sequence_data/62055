The primary structure of zzso zzso the principal product of the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso fishes, was deduced from zzso zzso clones for two species of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Overlapping partial zzso clones were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso Excluding the zzso tail, the zzso of 1863 base pairs zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained the zzso untranslated region followed by the coding region and the 3' untranslated zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 252 zzso acids zzso with a signal zzso of 32 zzso and a mature protein of 220 zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso zzso shows zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso identity with most zzso zzso and zzso identity with mouse zzso zzso analysis of the sequences support a view that the zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed in the zzso and zzso that, just as in zzso and rainbow trout, the expression of zzso zzso is widely spread in many zzso and zzso Since the zzso and zzso are representatives of the most ancient zzso known to possess zzso the zzso zzso zzso in fish has had a zzso zzso
