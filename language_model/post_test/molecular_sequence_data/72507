The zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the complementary zzso they zzso have been isolated and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene promoter region possess the same four well characterized zzso control elements as the human zzso zzso namely an zzso zzso binding site, zzso site, and zzso zzso In contrast, no obvious regulatory motifs are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequences with other members of the zzso zzso family showed that zzso has been zzso to a greater degree during evolution than zzso In zzso species, zzso gene expression is typically associated with the zzso and zzso with the small zzso and zzso However numerous secondary sites of zzso gene expression have also been zzso zzso showed a high degree of conservation of both primary and secondary sites of zzso production between zzso and the zzso with zzso zzso zzso being detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso brain, and zzso whereas zzso zzso was observed in the brain, zzso zzso and throughout the length of the small zzso In zzso zzso using zzso gene specific zzso zzso uncovered zzso and zzso zzso zzso in distinct areas of the zzso central nervous system and zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso as previously seen in zzso This highly preserved tissue expression pattern suggests that zzso plays specific roles in the zzso and zzso zzso that are distinct from those of zzso Our findings show that in spite of the structural zzso zzso zzso and zzso constitute independent neuroendocrine zzso zzso
