To investigate for the presence of increased zzso of circulating zzso to putative infectious agents and for zzso viral zzso or bacterial DNA in children with active zzso juvenile zzso zzso 

zzso resonance zzso muscle zzso were performed in 20 children with active, zzso zzso juvenile zzso and in zzso children with zzso zzso zzso were tested for zzso zzso to zzso B zzso influenza A and B, zzso 1 and 3, zzso pneumoniae, zzso respiratory zzso virus, and zzso and by zzso for zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso Muscle from juvenile zzso patients and control children, zzso Swiss mice with and without zzso infection, and viral stock positive for zzso were tested using zzso zzso chain reaction with 5 primer sets, 4 zzso (1 zzso 3 zzso and universal zzso for zzso 

No increased zzso viral zzso or bacterial DNA was present in the juvenile zzso patients or the control zzso 

Juvenile zzso may be triggered by unidentified zzso in the genetically susceptible zzso
