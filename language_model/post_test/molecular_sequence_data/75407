The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso region of the zzso coli zzso containing the zzso regulated zzso gene has been zzso A sequence of zzso zzso zzso two zzso open reading frames that constitute a single zzso and which specify zzso with predicted molecular weights of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, was identified as the most probable sequence for zzso Each of the two open reading zzso designated zzso and zzso is preceded by a reasonable zzso zzso Two 16 zzso sequences zzso zzso that match the consensus sequence for binding zzso protein are located zzso to zzso in a region that provides a possible single promoter for expression of both zzso and zzso with the second zzso box overlapping the putative zzso zzso A possible zzso zzso is located 137 zzso downstream of zzso The zzso acid sequence predicted for zzso contains a region that matches a highly zzso sequence found in several DNA repair and zzso proteins that bind zzso
