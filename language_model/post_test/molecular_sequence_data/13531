We report on zzso cloning and zzso and Southern and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of one moderately and one highly amplified repetitive DNA element, zzso and zzso respectively, isolated from barley zzso zzso zzso zzso arm zzso The zzso sequence zzso to all 14 zzso or zzso regions of the barley zzso as determined by zzso The 50 different zzso sites that include zzso signals allow the discrimination of all 14 zzso arms and the construction of a zzso of zzso The zzso repeated zzso element of 331 zzso exists in all zzso species tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is AT rich zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso to zzso of the D zzso zzso zzso element zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso DNA sequence zzso from zzso zzso The repetitive sequence zzso is moderately amplified in barley and highly amplified in zzso zzso The in zzso experiments revealed no distinct signals on barley zzso indicating a dispersed character for the zzso The significance of the results for the identification of zzso and zzso aberrations in FISH experiments are zzso
