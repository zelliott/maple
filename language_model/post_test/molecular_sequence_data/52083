The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular weight zzso zzso has been determined by single crystal X-ray zzso The zzso are zzso space group zzso a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso beta zzso zzso degrees, Z zzso zzso The zzso units are in the trans and the zzso bond in the zzso zzso The first and third zzso units show significant zzso from zzso zzso omega zzso zzso degrees and delta omega zzso zzso degrees, zzso The backbone zzso angles are: zzso 1 zzso zzso degrees, zzso 1 zzso zzso degrees, omega 1 zzso zzso degrees, zzso 2 zzso zzso degrees, zzso 2 zzso zzso degrees, omega 2 zzso zzso degrees, zzso 3 zzso zzso degrees, zzso 3 zzso zzso degrees, omega 3 zzso zzso zzso The zzso ring of the zzso zzso adopts the zzso gamma zzso The molecular packing gives rise to an zzso zzso structure formed of zzso repeating units of the zzso The surface of the zzso zzso is zzso Water molecules are found systematically at the edges of the sheets interacting with the zzso oxygen and terminal zzso zzso Surface zzso of an zzso to zzso zzso process by water molecules zzso on to an zzso zzso is suggested as a mechanism zzso zzso of the title zzso were obtained from a solution of zzso
