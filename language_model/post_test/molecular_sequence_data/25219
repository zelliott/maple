This paper describes a novel method for creating exact DNA zzso between any two points in a zzso carried in zzso zzso It exploits the zzso in zzso zzso between directly repeated sequences that can be established by zzso of a synthetic zzso The method was used to enhance the productivity in zzso zzso of a cloned zzso zzso gene originating from zzso zzso Thus, an exact fusion between zzso sequences zzso the expression signals, including the signal zzso of a zzso zzso zzso gene and the mature Amy of zzso zzso was zzso The resulting hybrid zzso product was processed correctly in zzso zzso during zzso giving rise to an Amy identical to the mature Amy zzso by zzso zzso
