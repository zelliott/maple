The zzso zzso zzso zzso detects the zzso of specific zzso product by zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso probe during the amplification zzso The probe is an zzso with both a reporter fluorescent dye and a zzso dye zzso An increase in reporter zzso intensity indicates that the probe has zzso to the target zzso product and has been zzso by the zzso zzso activity of zzso DNA zzso In this study, zzso with the zzso dye attached to an internal zzso were compared with zzso with the zzso dye attached to the zzso zzso In all cases, the reporter dye was attached to the zzso zzso All intact zzso showed zzso of the reporter zzso In general, zzso with the zzso dye attached to the zzso zzso exhibited a larger signal in the zzso zzso zzso zzso than the internally labeled zzso It is proposed that the larger signal is caused by increased likelihood of zzso by zzso DNA zzso when the probe is zzso to a template strand during zzso zzso with the zzso dye attached to the zzso zzso also exhibited an increase in reporter zzso intensity when zzso to a complementary zzso Thus, zzso with reporter and zzso zzso attached at opposite ends can be used as homogeneous zzso zzso
