zzso sequence analysis of zzso from the zzso on the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the first 94 of 110 zzso of zzso from zzso are identical to zzso an open reading frame from the 3' zzso segment of other zzso found in zzso bacteria, after which point they zzso zzso The predicted products of both zzso and zzso share zzso with the zzso exporter zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso specifies a resistance profile to zzso and zzso almost identical to that of zzso whereas zzso specifies much lower levels of resistance to these zzso zzso whose product lacks the zzso 16 zzso acids of the zzso zzso may have evolved by the interruption of zzso from the zzso of a DNA segment carrying a zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso was designated zzso and its partially functional deletion zzso zzso was designated zzso delta zzso zzso experiments indicated that the mechanism of resistance zzso by zzso the protein specified by zzso is active export energized by zzso motive zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons revealed that zzso is related to a family of small zzso export proteins with four zzso zzso
