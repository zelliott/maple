The tight junction is the most zzso zzso junction of zzso cells and regulates zzso zzso through the zzso zzso To examine possible functions for the tight zzso protein zzso zzso truncated zzso and a deletion zzso of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso cell zzso Only full-length zzso and one zzso zzso zzso targeted to cell borders; other zzso showed variable zzso zzso None of the zzso initially disrupted the zzso of zzso zzso However, long-term stable expression of two of the zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic change in cell shape and patterns of gene zzso An zzso zzso shape replaced characteristic zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and smooth muscle zzso expression were zzso although variable zzso expression zzso suggesting a partial transformation to a zzso cell zzso zzso with the zzso change, the expression of the integral membrane tight junction protein zzso was significantly zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and another family member, zzso were zzso These findings suggest that zzso may participate in regulation of cellular zzso
