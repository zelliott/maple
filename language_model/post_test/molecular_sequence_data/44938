zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso bleeding zzso and zzso zzso storage disease, associated with defects of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is frequently fatal and is the most common zzso disorder in Puerto zzso We previously characterized the human zzso zzso and identified zzso zzso in the gene in patients with zzso The zzso protein is a novel apparent zzso zzso that seems to be crucial for normal zzso zzso Here we describe the structural organization, zzso zzso and zzso of the human zzso zzso The gene consists of 20 zzso spanning about zzso zzso in zzso segment zzso One of the intervening sequences is a member of the novel, very rare class of so-called zzso zzso defined by highly zzso zzso and 3' zzso site and branch site consensus sequences that provide novel targets for possible zzso gene zzso This information provides the basis for molecular analyses of patients with zzso and will greatly facilitate diagnosis and carrier detection of this severe zzso
