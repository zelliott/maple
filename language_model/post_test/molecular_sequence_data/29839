In a search for zzso of the dominant modifier of zzso zzso zzso we have identified one zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid deduced protein is much shorter than the zzso zzso acid protein zzso Surprisingly, the two genes are very close to each other at zzso on the zzso zzso map, and are transcribed zzso The zzso coding for the zzso zzso acid of the new gene lies only 368 base pairs from the start of zzso of zzso This opposite orientation of the zzso has led us to name it zzso The zzso of the zzso protein contains only one of the seven unusual zinc fingers of zzso A second region of similarity encodes an zzso zzso Finally, there is a block of high similarity near the zzso of the two zzso It zzso to a new zzso protein domain, zzso found also in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have constructed a zzso zzso zzso and have expressed it as a zzso zzso zzso zzso associates in zzso with zzso zzso but, in contrast to the zzso protein zzso does not show specificity for the zzso zzso does not seem either to modify the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso of the zzso does not affect the variegated zzso of a number of zzso zzso
