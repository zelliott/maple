In cancer, the zzso pathways that are dominated by the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the most frequently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to control its activity and they are, in turn, specifically inhibited by the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso which cause arrest at the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which alter the protein or its level of zzso are all strongly implicated in zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso is of particular zzso Here we report the structure of the zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso The structure indicates that most zzso to the zzso zzso which result in loss of function, are due to incorrectly folded and/or zzso zzso We propose a model for the interaction of zzso proteins with zzso zzso complexes that might provide a basis for the design of zzso against zzso The sequences of the zzso family of zzso are highly zzso
