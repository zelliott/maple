A zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso is shown to be an zzso agent in this zzso The zzso designated zzso c 1, was zzso by sequential zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso c 1 has a molecular mass of 33 zzso and a zzso of zzso The zzso zzso activity of this protein was zzso The protein binds to serum zzso from patients allergic to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso c 1 is zzso zzso in length and contains an open reading frame for a zzso zzso zzso c 1 codes for a larger precursor containing a signal zzso a zzso and the zzso mature zzso zzso comparison revealed that zzso c 1 possesses several features in common with the alkaline zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The essential zzso zzso and zzso zzso that make up the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are well zzso Northern blots demonstrated that zzso transcribed from this gene are present at early stages of zzso The zzso zzso by zzso c 1 gene was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein bearing an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso by affinity zzso with a yield of 130 zzso of pure protein per liter of culture, was able to bind to both a zzso zzso c 1 zzso and zzso from the serum of patients allergic to zzso zzso zzso c 1 can therefore be expressed in zzso coli in large quantities and should prove useful as a standardized specific zzso for zzso of zzso zzso In addition, full zzso zzso activity could be generated in the zzso zzso protein by zzso and zzso followed by removal of the affinity tag, indicating that the zzso protein can assume the same zzso as the native zzso
