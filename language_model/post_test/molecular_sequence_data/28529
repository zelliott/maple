zzso are increasingly used as animal models in studies that require the assessment of specific zzso zzso The complete analysis of these responses includes the characterization of zzso variable region genes and their zzso zzso we cloned and zzso a total of 27 zzso variable region heavy chain zzso genes using zzso obtained from a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and human zzso sequences shows that the percent of identity varies between zzso and zzso at the zzso level and between zzso and zzso at the zzso acid zzso The various zzso zzso genes can be grouped into one of seven zzso corresponding to the human zzso zzso The only zzso zzso sequence belonging to the zzso zzso is zzso to the human zzso zzso for which no transcripts have been zzso zzso to their human counterparts, all zzso zzso genes cluster into three zzso with one clan including the zzso zzso and zzso subgroups, one clan including the zzso zzso and zzso subgroups, and one clan including the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso may represent valuable models to analyze the zzso repertoire generated in response to zzso strategies developed for human zzso
