Small zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso peptides as zzso of innate enteric zzso In mice, production of mature zzso cell zzso termed zzso zzso requires zzso zzso of inactive precursors zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso produces the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To identify which zzso event enables zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso were very similar to fully processed zzso contrasting the lack of zzso and zzso activity shown by zzso Thus, zzso of zzso at zzso downward zzso is sufficient to activate zzso activity, and zzso acids in the zzso of the zzso maintain the precursor in an inactive zzso Because zzso zzso zzso are zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, we hypothesized that zzso and zzso zzso in zzso neutralize zzso zzso side chains in zzso zzso a zzso zzso with zzso zzso at all zzso zzso and zzso positions zzso was prepared, and it was zzso and zzso zzso zzso under conditions where native zzso lacks zzso These findings show that zzso zzso of zzso at zzso downward zzso converts inactive precursors to zzso forms by removal of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids from proximity with the zzso component of the zzso
