zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain several genes exhibiting zzso expression and these systems are ideal for studying mechanisms of zzso gene zzso At sequence level, only two highly zzso zzso elements are present on the zzso a regulatory element named zzso box directing zzso expression and the zzso promoter element zzso serving as the binding site for the zzso zzso zzso these promoters possess a modular structure that allows an essentially inactive zzso promoter to be strongly zzso The invoked mechanisms include zzso zzso factor zzso recruitment by the zzso factor to activate gene expression and zzso of zzso recruitment efficiency to yield differential gene zzso
