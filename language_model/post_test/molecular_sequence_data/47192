zzso protein C zzso zzso is a newly identified member of the zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso zzso by two distinct cell zzso zzso giant cells and zzso zzso To gain some insight regarding the control of zzso gene expression and the regulatory factors controlling zzso giant cell and zzso cell zzso we have initiated a structural and functional analysis of the zzso zzso The activities of a series of zzso promoter zzso ranging in size from zzso zzso to 50 zzso zzso to a zzso reporter have been assessed in the zzso zzso cell line zzso to zzso giant cell zzso and in a primary zzso cell culture system after transient zzso zzso promoter zzso containing zzso zzso to 149 zzso of zzso DNA possessed full activity in the zzso giant cell zzso A region located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start site was found to be essential for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells required additional zzso zzso DNA for full zzso A region located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start site significantly enhanced zzso promoter in zzso zzso In conclusion, mechanisms underlying the zzso of the zzso promoter are different in zzso giant cells zzso zzso zzso
