The zzso gene is zzso among most zzso In zzso virus zzso the zzso protein is a zzso type II membrane protein found in the zzso zzso It zzso to the zzso network zzso region in infected and zzso cells and is maintained in this compartment by zzso from the plasma zzso zzso with zzso deleted have no zzso defects in tissue culture yet have reduced zzso and restricted spread to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso spread in zzso is dependent on a zzso zzso motif previously shown to be essential for the maintenance of zzso in the zzso region and recycling from the plasma zzso zzso viruses with the zzso motif deleted have an zzso spread zzso indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso spread, however, is not dependent on a zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso Through zzso scanning zzso of the zzso zzso we have identified two zzso zzso zzso that are essential for zzso spread as well as two zzso zzso zzso putative consensus zzso zzso II sites, that zzso the rate of zzso zzso spread in zzso
