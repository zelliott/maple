The zzso zzso stress zzso regulator is a zzso protein that belongs to the zzso zzso regulators zzso zzso It has the ability to sense zzso species inside the cell and to trigger the cell's response, zzso the zzso of genes involved in scavenging zzso zzso In the present study, we have zzso zzso and characterized the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is the zzso agent of citrus variegated zzso zzso disease caused by the zzso strain, resulting in economic and social zzso The secondary structure of the zzso protein was analyzed by circular zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is a zzso in zzso zzso shift zzso indicated that it does bind to its own predicted promoter under in zzso zzso However, considering our control experiment we cannot state that this interaction occurs in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is able to restore the zzso stress response in an zzso knockout zzso coli zzso These results show that the predicted zzso codes for a zzso regulator, zzso to zzso coli zzso involved in the zzso stress zzso This may be important for zzso zzso to overcome the defense mechanisms of its host during the infection and colonization zzso
