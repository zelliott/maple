The structure of zzso a zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso with only the zzso zzso bridge intact, has been analyzed by two-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso Except for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all regions of the zzso give two exchange cross zzso for each zzso for one zzso zzso 37, three exchange cross zzso are zzso The presence of exchange cross zzso indicates that the zzso sample zzso that zzso on a time scale of milliseconds or zzso Over zzso of the zzso zzso have been zzso including backbone and side chain atoms and their exchange cross zzso zzso of chemical shifts, chemical exchange, hydrogen isotope exchange, and zzso indicate that zzso at pH zzso and 1 degree C is an ensemble of zzso zzso in all of which the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso Outside the zzso zzso zzso undergo local zzso zzso The stable structure of zzso is not in the vicinity of the zzso zzso bond but rather is in the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the main zzso interactions involve zzso contacts with the rings of zzso 21, zzso 23, and zzso zzso As a model for early folding zzso the structure of zzso suggests that zzso folding is initiated by stabilization of a turn existing in the unfolded protein and involves both local and zzso zzso zzso
