To investigate the zzso system of cells, we identified genes responsive to a zzso mechanical zzso zzso cells were cultured on a computer-controlled zzso device designed to provide a zzso mechanical zzso A maximum zzso of zzso of membrane at 10 zzso (3 s extension followed by 3 s relax per zzso was repeated for 48 zzso By means of a differential display, the gene expression pattern of cells exposed to the stimulus was compared with that of zzso zzso As a result, a gene zzso that was exclusively expressed in mechanically stressed cells was zzso By using expressed sequence tag walking together with the zzso method, this gene was identified as zzso zzso zzso type II beta zzso known as zzso but now reclassified as zzso The specific zzso of zzso upon mechanical stimulus was also confirmed by using another apparatus, zzso a computer-controlled zzso motor zzso To examine the involvement of the zzso mechanical stimulus in the regulation of zzso expression in musculoskeletal zzso we created an Achilles zzso zzso model in zzso The zzso expression of zzso was assessed by means of a quantitative zzso zzso chain zzso In the zzso muscle, expression of zzso rapidly decreased 1 week after zzso but was restored to normal levels at 4 zzso In the Achilles tendon, however, expression remained decreased until 4 weeks after zzso We suggest that the expression of zzso can be used as a marker for cells receiving a suitable mechanical zzso
