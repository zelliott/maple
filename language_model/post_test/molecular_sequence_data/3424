zzso zzso family members are central components of host defense mechanisms in a variety of zzso One well zzso element in their signal zzso is zzso zzso which couple early signaling events in a zzso complex at the plasma membrane to larger zzso in the zzso The fruit fly zzso zzso has one member of this family of zzso termed zzso The complexity of this zzso is vastly increased in zzso and several zzso zzso have been described and termed zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a novel and distinct member of the zzso family, zzso zzso is the closest human zzso to zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso in an zzso manner, and zzso of zzso can activate zzso B as well as zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Most zzso and in contrast to the other zzso zzso depends on its zzso activity to activate zzso zzso In addition, zzso is able to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is blocking the zzso zzso and modification of zzso suggesting a role of zzso as a central element in the early signal zzso of zzso zzso upstream of zzso
