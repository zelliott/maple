The zzso B cell zzso consists of zzso and zzso cells which express the same zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso were derived from the zzso cells by a typical H chain switch zzso zzso The zzso cells can be induced with zzso to undergo H chain switching in zzso It has been proposed that the zzso zzso process is activated during H chain switch, since V genes expressed in zzso and zzso cells have more frequently undergone zzso than those expressed in zzso zzso We have investigated this question by sequencing zzso genes expressed before and after H chain switch in the zzso zzso We have also zzso the zzso zzso gene corresponding to the gene expressed by zzso cells to determine whether the zzso gene expressed in the zzso cells had already undergone zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso was not activated in the precursor cell for the zzso lymphoma, nor during zzso switch in zzso zzso It is possible that cells of the zzso lymphoma, or their zzso have not received the signal which zzso zzso zzso or that zzso cells belong to a subset of B cells that cannot be induced to undergo any (or zzso zzso zzso
