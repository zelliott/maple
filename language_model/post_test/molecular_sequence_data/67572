zzso foot and mouth disease zzso caused by a group of enteric viruses such as zzso 71 zzso zzso A16 zzso and zzso A10 zzso is heavily epidemic in East zzso This research focused on investigating the occurrence of zzso pathogens in domestic sewage and secondary zzso before zzso in a wastewater treatment plant zzso in zzso the largest zzso in northwest zzso In order to simultaneously detect all three zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was constructed with a newly designed primer set targeting conservative gene regions from the zzso untranslated region zzso to zzso As a result, zzso of raw sewage samples and zzso of the secondary zzso samples were positive for the zzso viral zzso indicating that zzso pathogens were highly prevalent in domestic wastewater and that they could also persist, even with lower zzso in the secondary zzso before zzso Of the three zzso zzso zzso was positive in zzso of the total samples, while the zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso It could thus be stated that zzso is the main zzso pathogen prevailing in the study area, at least during the investigation zzso High genetic diversity in the conservative gene region among the same zzso of the zzso pathogen was identified by zzso analysis, zzso that this zzso pathogen replicates frequently among the population zzso the domestic zzso
